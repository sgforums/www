            <div class='col-md body'>I have a problem in attempting to forget a girl which I've known and loved for about 5-6 years. I've never proposed to her before, hence she didn't know my intention. We've parted for about a year and I've hardly heard from her ever since. My feelings continued to decline over that period of time, but just recently, I met her online through MSN...<br><br>She appeared distant while the feelings keep coming back to me... Is there anything that I can do to forget about her?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

I still dunno what is so special about her that keeps me reminded of her over and over again.

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I have been thru this before. I was secretly in love with a guy secretly for nearly 2 years before I confessed to him. I guess the confession helped me to get over him faster because at least I know where I would always stand when it comes to him. His answer lets me know that we would always be close frens and no more than that. So I no longer harbor any hope and slowly I learn to let go. And then I met someone who is much better than him, and the rest is history <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
