              <p>Hi guys/gals</p>
              <p>just need some advice from u guys...:(</p>
              <p>i have been working in IT indsutry for almost 5 years now.. but for the pass few months i am beginning to wonder am i suitable for this industry or not. To me as new technology is introduce..we as developer need to keep up with the latest technology and most of the system/tehcnology ae either full of bugs, provide insufficient information rearding the products, does not provide/cant find support about the prodduct. Even in the internet, we hardly find the solution.</p>
              <p>So far i have been working as a developer of certain product , implemnetor of other or ppl product. I have seen so many lmitation as well as serious bugs that me as low/middle knowlege worker cant even solve..in other words not my expertise.</p>
              <p>I have been thrown into a situation where i nkow almost nothing of it, not much help from colleague or the custodian, searhc from internet does not provide help at all.. and somehow by god grace and luck.. i manage to solve them.</p>
              <p>I was thinking what if one day, icant solve it, after going thru different channels for help. If you are working in projects with high preassure..it would be trememedous mental stress to take.</p>
              <p>i am beginning to feel the strain, and it worries me. I nkow every other job got their own stress and problem. i also nkow/experience before that they are light after a dark tunnel.. but right now the effect of it really makes me really tired.</p>
              <p>My current collegue say tht i cant take preassure..but i m good technically..but after thinking much thru..maybe it is because i m doing something i m not good at (e.g implementing other ppl product)...but as i have thru tehcnical forums. it worries me..of some technical issue that i cant solve..</p>
              <p>Maybe i do need to rest a long time (take 2 weeks off to regenerate)? Learn to relax?Change job scope? What do u guys think :(</p>
              <p>Thank you for the response in advamce...</p>

              <p>If I were you, I will probably change job to another company like a software management or any other management position (if any?). Cos I think 5 years has probably given you sufficient exposure that you needed to move onto a different/better role in another company.</p>
              <p>What you need is to overcome your own defeated spirits, you can probably do that by picking up a book to help you learn more about the latest technologies out there that you will need to do better in your current job.</p>
              <p>OR</p>
              <p>You can probably try applying for some teaching jobs at some educational institutions, be it government or private...I'm sure your 5 years exposure in your industry would've made you qualified to teach.</p>
              <p>OR</p>
              <p>You can think about your talent...what talents do you possessed? Think about your hobbies, interests, desire....whichever activities you have confident in doing would be one of your strengths which you could further develop into a career path of your own.</p>
              <p>Life is full of opportunities, it's up to you if you want to spend the time and the amount of interests you have got in you to succeed. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png">  </p>

              <p>Hmm... are you compelled to work in IT industry 'cos you have an IT cert? Do you have interest in what you are doing now?</p>
              <p>Actually my situation is almost quite similar like yours now. I have an IT cert but have not many IT skillsets to excel in IT industry and I'm also not really interested working in IT industry.</p>
              <p>I'm also at a career cross road now, thinking of what to do next. Like what parn says, think of what other talents or interests you have and nurture it into a career, maybe. I'm trying to make that work, but it's not easy as said though. Haiz.</p>

              <p>Hi, im in IT for 11 yrs and counting...how i got in is by sheer providence really.</p>
              <p>Just wanna encourage u, if u can tell u r good @ programming look into that line. U can be a team lead, tech lead, ... u know? Your "Strength Zone"? I dare to say amongst my peers Im the best in programming and systems designs. (not boasting but its said by others to me).</p>
              <p>Yes no doubt keeping up w the changes is tedious, but hey is not that the fun part? Pick a technology that's stable, or wouldnt change so much. Go for certifications. Im doing my deg now, hence im taking a job as a consultant. Not much programming, but to be a good programmer, one must think beyond programming.</p>
              <p>Know ur strengths and focus, major on the major.</p>
              <p>Bread and butter - if u cant succeed doing something u are strong in, what makes u think u can even survive doing something u are weak in?</p>
              <p>Cheers... all the best...remember programming is just the 1st step :D</p>

              <p>yes....the life of an IT professional is like that...I am sure U know Moore's law....not to mention professional certs even for the entry-level ones like CCNA also needs to be re-certified after a period of time...</p>
              <p>IT is quite broad-ranging....someone above suggested U move into programming/teaching....I kinda agree with that...except most of the hardcore programming are not coming to sg anymore....so maybe U want to do IT sales?ur experience in integration would come into handy.</p>
