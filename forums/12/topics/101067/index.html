            <div class='col-md body'>just had me 1st paper today. Having more in 2 weeks time. So i asked 2 of my friends (girls) if thye could show me wat notes they got and check if i lacked any so i could zap stuff from em. Like the other ppl in my class claim they got NO notes, so i don't really compare with em. SO I asked my 2 friends to lend me notes, but they didn't specify if they wanted anythin in return from me. So end up i was parussing through their notes. Basically 1 girl showed me 2 stacks of notes given by teacher, but i never got it coz no one collected for me. Other girl showed me her own self-compiled "outline" notes of the syllabus. I asked if girl1 could zap for me those notes, she said yeah. I asked girl2 if she could email me her overlay notes, she said yeah. (which were in softcopy anyway). I just sms them, saying thanks again, and said i got copies of syllabus books (with my own notes on them) to give if they want.<br><br>Somehow i feel troubled. Coz they seem willing to help me, yet its like i neber did much for them. Although there was some chatter over me offering to take them out, which i wouldn't mind. But that's just chatter. Cant help them thinking i am a wanker who resorts to borrowing their history notes, without giving em anything in return.<br><br>But what about the idea of helping a friend in need? Afterall its just 1 subject, and notes i never recieved in class, and its just an overlay set of notes like summary of the syllabus for history. If they appeared willing, so surely their ok with helpin me out.. but then again many local people are all smile on the outside yet cold/hard on the inside.<br><br>or am i thinking too much of what others think? me being hyper sensitive and all?<br><br>Sidenote; I have all my syllabus at hand already (i found subsititute materials for the missing notes long ago), notes are all of the same subject, and i just wanna copy of whatever other people are doing to prepare so i can compare with my own notes.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i bet they feel some sense of unpleasantness deep inside even if they are the most helpful person in the world.. especially if its something that they had spend quite a bit of effort into. so i'll say you own them a treat.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>nah i think they changed their mind abt helpin me out. My instincts serve me well, nice/outside different inside u know? Hence the term the impenetrable chinese person. No matter, least they said it after i asked twice, woot! go locals! but it doesn't matter, they're still my friends as are almost everyone.<br><br></div>

It is not pleasant to suspect somebody's intention when they have already helped you unconditionally.<br><br>I'm sure that your two gal friends doesn't mind about not receiving anything in return. Instead, if you felt bad about receiving from them...be a better friend to them in return. I'm sure they will appreciate it more in return then a treat or some other form of return.<br><br>They probably don't mind to help you out because they felt that you deserve their help, that's all. Don't create complicated situations out of a simple gesture. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Good luck anyway...treasure your friendship with them...only friendship..and nothing else. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br></div>
