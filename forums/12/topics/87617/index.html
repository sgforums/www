The subjects are pretty much easy for me too, but I just want to put in effort because I really regreted not putting effort into my studies for the past 9 years.<br><br>So I try hard to put in effort whenever I can, no matter how simple it seems to be, I just want to put in effort. I look forward to school is because I know that I already missed out a large portion of my schooldays and childhood, if I don't appreciate what I have now, I will never get it back ever again. Ever, I do not want to experience the same kind of emptiness again.<br><br>The thing you are missing is something in school to look forward to, I dunnoe what that can be for you but anything is better than wondering why are you so lonely and crap.<br><br>One thing is, don't compare yourself and others so strictly, everybody is more or less equal, we have our own weakness and strength. Your so called "image" is nothing more than mere illusions that will mean nothing in time to come.<br><br>My 2 cents, you should appreciate what you have now.</div>

But then as long the frenship is true, why bother with mere appearance... dun be one of those shallow people. They didn't do anything wrong anyway, why scared what other people say? Some people got the "image" but personailty-wise nt v likeable.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Mmm... i think.... you already don't think well of them b4hand. Maybe that why u never open out to them. Some people can really surprise you once you get to know them. Ur classmates have their good and bad, just like everybody else in this world. Sometime we don't understand people but that doesn't mean that they are not good. Sometime, maybe we get so confused and feel  distrustful of people; scared of being harmed etc. So some choose to walk away from a relationship. End up feeling left out?? lonely? Regret!<br><br>N u got good grades <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"> U can try helping ur classmates who desperately need help in their works. Lend ur hand, nobody will reject it. It's a good start to make new friends.<br><br><strong>and you mention u never really opened up before?</strong><br><br>life will be darn lonely if you don't share with people.<br><br>Sometime, we may not even know who we really are cos' we lost touch of ourself. You need to find the inner your. sOUnd Zen hor. But i believe it's already inside you hor but u didnt go and develop it.<br><br>Dont lose faith. We can lose faith in something and then regain faith again. I guess it's quite normal to be confused now and then. So that why got lessons to learn in life mah to correct urself and why u not feeling happy.<br><br>Live your life and be happy!</div>
