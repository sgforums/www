              <p>Hi everyone. I'm new to forums in general, There are tons of
                                      forums on Computers, cars, bikes food and lots more for
                                      Singaporeans, but none on Medical/psychiatric help. I don't know if
                                      this would be the best place, please do redirect me if you know of
                                      a better one.</p>
              <p>My friend needs to see a psychiatrist to deal with the issues he
                                      is facing with his family. I strongly urge him to do so cos its
                                      really affecting his work and life in general. But where does one
                                      find a psychiatrist? Any idea how much it costs?</p>

              <p>It depends on the qualification of the psychiatrist and in what field he/she is trained in. In fact more psychiatrists in their studies are more than capable to fulfiling the role of a counselor and are often more effective in analysing the issue due to extensive training.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A misnomer is that psychiatrists is meant to help people who are aware that they have problem, which unfortunately in many cases do not exist.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>That being said, I think your friend should still go through the normal channels via polyclinic or public hospitals since private consultations are anything but cheap as the sessions are usually not short and the whole program might take weeks, months or even years (depending on the severity). Having some subsidy would be good.</p>

              <p>IMH might be the ideal place to seek help if your friend is bound by monetary constraints.</p>
              <p>if he is well to do and money is no problem, $160 per 50 min session by private counselors might be better. bare in mind that this is a long term thing, not just one short visit to the doctor to cure a fever.</p>
