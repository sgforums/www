              <p>Last time in school like I this girl. I thought is she was available because I never see her with any guy. So I approach her. To my embarassment, two days later her secret boyfriend confronted me when I was eating in the canteen. Turn out she was secretly seeing her boyfriend quiet quiet.</p>
              <p>Then now at college. I also do project with college mates. Then I saw this girl i like. I ask her out. Then afterward, a friend took me to the corner and told me that she already taken. Aiyoyo, why nowadays girls attach but they don't announce one ah?</p>
              <p>How to find out if they are still single? I don't want to become third party and always I am not good enough to beat their current boyfriend. Sometimes, the girl go out or seeing another guy, nobody knows. So how to beat this embarassment. Next time should I ask and check her background before I make my move?</p>

              <p><br>You are a lady, you don't know how hard it is to ask somebody out you like. You don't understand how hard it is to profess your liking to a girl. First you face rejection, not so bad. what if you knock on the wrong door? I go for classes and have friends in lecture but I don't want to risk losing my friends over a wrong move. I also need cooperation when we do class assginment and project.</p>
              <p>We men, constantly in danger of getting grilled. If we go after a girl we like but we fail to see that she is attach and she is loyal to her bf, surely we will be subject of bad gossip.</p>

              <p>I feel u there man.. i FEEEEEL YOU!</p>
              <p>But unfortunately.. cant hate the playa man.. hate the game.</p>
              <p>I know what u mean man. Its like.. wondering why the girl didnt reject u straight out, cause she says its too harsh. Then stringing along is not? lol!</p>
              <p>But dont dwell on it too much. Sure there WILL be peoplelaughing at you, giving u wierd looks, but seriously who gives a shit man! Its not like they never get rejected before. More like they never ever been attached before staying in thier little safe zone. Always bitching why they cant get the girl while laughing at other's attempt.</p>
              <p>Trust me, u dont have to do ANYTHING to them or hide into ur shell due to these incidents. You just go after the girl u like. U gotta risk it. And when the risk pays off... heh.. now that is the time to rub it in thier face!</p>
              <p>Thats right .. u guys keep looking... keep salivating... But man.. i'll be tapping that when we get home.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="icon_razz.gif"></p>

              You are a lady, you don't know how hard it is to ask somebody out
              you like. You don't understand how hard it is to profess your
              liking to a girl. First you face rejection, not so bad. what
              if you knock on the wrong door? I go for classes and have friends
              in lecture but I don't want to risk losing my friends over a wrong
              move. I also need cooperation when we do class assginment and
              project.</p>
              <p>We men, constantly in danger of getting grilled. If we go after
              a girl we like but we fail to see that she is attach and she is
              loyal to her bf, surely we will be subject of bad gossip.</p>
