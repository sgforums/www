              <p>I currenlty managed a team of 10 people, mainly low educated staff , some due for retirement some just completed NS.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Everyday is a battle , cos there are a few group and gang in them , some infighting between them , some fighting against me , and worse other dept alos or ....and pple from other dept , alway trying to push work to us and complain at our work to department head and GM if we do not do their bidding.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>these pple some are unmovtivated and out to create trouble , you will of course say if you are the superior you must motivated them , trust me it never easy , these pple are out to get on your nerve, they do not want to follow your instruction liek to do things to their way , ignore your constant reminder to update them on their work and meet the dateline</p>
              <p>taking chance to add blur ,shout back threaten you, give excuse and excuses for not doing their work , or screwing up , you must go and clear all their shit , give them warning letter fat hope , before you can do it they already preemptively made complaint to managemnet , HR about you ,,, these pple may be low educated , but they are smart and cunning , they can lie without brinking their eye ,, and my boss knowing the situation to preserve himself , side them and play politics and push the blame on you</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>dunno how long can I take thsi much longer , all my the precedecessor last less then 3 months , I already tong more than one year cos no choice cannot quit without a job and got family to feed</p>

              <p>Read history books and learn the art of  dealing with such pple.</p>
              <p>Vent your anger at them. U treat them the way they treat u. If they got do OT and u must sign for them , make life difficult for them. They want to apply leave , if need consent from u or if chance arises , make life difficult for them. If can , sack one or two of them. To your superiors , you raised your voice at them if you really cant tahan anymore They can't be motivated , they need to be whipped to know fear.</p>

              <p>To manage them you got to be a leader. To be a leader you got to have some clout, and be willing to use it. Let them know you mean business. If you got no clout, they won't respect you. You gotta have some leverage. Power. Nice guys can never be leaders.</p>

              To manage them, you must first know them.
              
              Why do they behave the way they behave? Ever thought about it? Everyone's unique, so learn to handle and communicate with each of them at a personal level before you learn to run them as a team.

              <p>have you in anyway offended them? or is it like GTO where the whole class is f up?</p>
              <p>break them down so they cant unite against you.like lionesses hunting, look for the weakest(most amicable) among them and snag them as ally. but take care that u dont snag a spy instead. try to understand them sincerely and then eradicate them. humans are selfish. they want their needs to be satisfied before deciding to work..explore whats their needs and try to work on that.( best if you know what kind of people liu bang and liu bei is. use jia3 ren2 jia3 yi4 if need be)</p>
              <p>as for your boss. reason with them that if they side with such imbeciles, what good their company will profit from it?surely they stand to benefit from a more efficient team of workers??</p>
              <p>lastly,a good general cannot always give slack to the troops. you must also discipline them. its just like fishing. slack at times and tighten your death grip at other times. hope it helps.</p>

              <p>I think u not flexing ur muscles.</p>
              <p>U gotta show them and ur bosses WHY you are here. Ur position already gives u the legitimacy to dispense your powers on these individuals. As team leader , you gotta weed out the weak , and reward the strong.</p>
              <p>Make it clear to them that standing with you is better then standing against you.</p>
              <p>Low education can be extremely problematic. It consumes alot of time and energy , not to mention $$$ to educated them and let them understand the complexities in ur decisions and why it will not just benefit u , but them and the entire company as a whole. If they cant be moved by $$$$ , think of others. If all else fails , time to exercise that power u are given.</p>
              <p>Every individual in ur team have different characteristics and principles. Its best that u at least grasp a good understanding of each and every one of them and once u know that , u will know how to proceed from then. Make ur problems known to ur boss and the reasons why u need to do what u are going to do.</p>
              <p>If in the end u still getting shafted up the @ss by both ur boss and ur team due to some internal interests between ur boss and what nots , then go to someome higher then ur boss to complain. If still cannot , then u kinda will know that u are just a hired to be punching bags from upper management and those below u.  So its either they are all out to get you , or u just suck being a team leader.</p>

              <p>I agree with HK tat highly educated pple are probably more difficult to handle.</p>
              <p>Let's not say abt "handling" the lower educated staff, instead, try workin with them "side by side". </p>
              <p>There must be a "leader" in the mini gangs/grp somewhere, target tat person 1st.  Show him/her respect but at the same time show them WHO is in charge here.   Watever tactic they use on u, tackle it back on them tactfully.  They probably think u are not good enuf to lead them, well, prove them wrong!  U arnt being selected to do the job if u dun hav certain potential.  If u hav done it well, not onli u can hav them workin with u, u may even get on better terms with them. </p>
              <p>The bottom line is, do not treat them as lower individual.  Every single of them has his/her strong points.  Earn their trust &amp; hav their heartedly support.  It's nvr easy, but u wll eventually succeed.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></p>
              <p>Superior wise..it can b alittle more tricky here..but i wld suggest, at the moment, settle the problem with ur co-workers/sabordinates 1st.  Afterall, u hav more sabordinates than superiors.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Vent your anger at them. U treat them the way they treat u. If they got do OT and u must sign for them , make life difficult for them. They want to apply leave , if need consent from u or if chance arises , make life difficult for them. If can , sack one or two of them. To your superiors , you raised your voice at them if you really cant tahan anymore They can't be motivated , they need to be whipped to know fear.</span></p>
              <p>Best way , look for anothe job before u quit.</p>

              <p>Take out your heart ? You are too idealistic. They already treat TS like a nobody or rubbish. Why dont say TS should have his rights and equalities as well ? I'm just suggesting TS to fight for his. Cant be helped , they wont be your friends unless they recognise money , power and status.</p>
              <p>TS should weigh the nature of his job. Who needs each other more ? They need TS more or TS need them more ? If their OT needs to be acknowleged , who will acknowledge for them ? If TS cannot afford any of them to quit , then keep an nonchalent attitude towards them and bosses. Scare HR complain ? No need to worry liao , i am sure they already made complaints about TS liao. The bosses also s worried if TS quit , who will clear up the mess ? Cant be helped , squeezed by bosses and workers. Find another job before quit.</p>
              <p>TS , you do have a bargainning chip as well . I mean well , just telling u abt their mentalites and the situation.</p>
