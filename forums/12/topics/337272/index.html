              <p>I have a close friend who's getting married. I had agreed to be her bridesmaid but recently pulled out of it because I decided that I didn't want to have to interact with my ex boyfriend, who is one of her husband-to-be's best men.</p>
              <p>Before I pulled out, however, I checked with her if not doing it would mean that our friendship would be affected. I had already bought my dress for the occasion and was prepared to go if she insisted. However, she seemed all right about it at that time, so I thought all was well and that she'd be able to find a replacement.</p>
              <p>Later, when we met up again with other friends, she tried to act as though I was not there. Or if I said anything to her, she would give a snappish reply.</p>
              <p>I'm quite upset by her behaviour, because I feel that my friend is also being a bit selfish here. What happened with my ex hurt me a lot. Even till now, I still feel a pang of sadness when I think about him. It's been more than a month since I last spoke to him, though I never really blamed him for the break up, seeing him and talking to him again will bring back memories.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, there are friends who've told me that I'm in the wrong and that I'm the selfish one. They felt that I should have gone since I've known her for ages. My friend has not been answering my calls, but she has sent an sms to tell me that she is feeling disappointed that I couldn't put aside my feelings for just that one day.</p>
              <p>Can feelings be put aside like that? Am I in the wrong? How can I mend this friendship? It's quite weird between us now, with her ignoring me. I feel that we can both be more mature about this and talk face to face. I understand that she may be having wedding jitters, and I would like to help, but she doesn't seem to want to talk to me at all.</p>

              <p>no right no wrong.</p>
              <p>u are in the ''wrong'' for not being able to put aside a man for your good friend wedding, its just a day.</p>
              <p>she is in the ''wrong'' for not being considerate of your feelings.</p>
              <p>but what done is done.</p>
              <p>now. shes bringing that unhappiness over from her wedding day til now. I cant say its totally her fault, afterall its her wedding day. things could have gone much worse, if the 'brother' and 'sister' fight on the wedding day eh? but things may go smoothly if both people are able to control their feelings and see things on a bigger scale (hey its my good friend wedding)</p>
              <p>either way, just give her some time to be enlighten from this whole issue. =)</p>
              <p>take things 1 step at a time kay? afterall you are good friends.</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>I have a close friend who's getting married. I had agreed to be
              her bridesmaid but recently pulled out of it because I decided that
              I didn't want to have to interact with my ex boyfriend, who is one
              of her husband-to-be's best men.</p>
              <p>Before I pulled out, however, I checked with her if not doing it
              would mean that our friendship would be affected. I had already
              bought my dress for the occasion and was prepared to go if she
              insisted. However, she seemed all right about it at that time, so I
              thought all was well and that she'd be able to find a
              replacement.</p>
              <p>Later, when we met up again with other friends, she tried to act
              as though I was not there. Or if I said anything to her, she would
              give a snappish reply.</p>
              <p>I'm quite upset by her behaviour, because I feel that my friend
              is also being a bit selfish here. What happened with my ex hurt me
              a lot. Even till now, I still feel a pang of sadness when I think
              about him. It's been more than a month since I last spoke to him,
              though I never really blamed him for the break up, seeing him and
              talking to him again will bring back memories.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, there are friends who've told me that I'm in
              the wrong and that I'm the selfish one. They felt that I
              should have gone since I've known her for ages. My friend has not
              been answering my calls, but she has sent an sms to tell me that
              she is feeling disappointed that I couldn't put aside my feelings
              for just that one day.</p>
              <p>Can feelings be put aside like that? Am I in the wrong? How can
              I mend this friendship? It's quite weird between us now, with her
              ignoring me. I feel that we can both be more mature about this and
              talk face to face. I understand that she may be having wedding
              jitters, and I would like to help, but she doesn't seem to want to
              talk to me at all.</p>

              <p>i guess you have to explain to her, try to communicate with her to tell her how you feel and encourage her to tell you how she really leaves. it's only when you two just trash things out, then you can be able to resolve from there.</p>
              <p>on the other hand, just speaking from my personal view point. not saying who is in the wrong n who is in the right. for one thing, it's an honor to be asked to be a bridesmaid because she has chose you out of so many other friends. and that you have agreed even knowing that 'he' will be there. Naturally anyone would be upset when the promise is broken. on the other hand, i guess putting myself in your shoes, i do understand as well.</p>
              <p>i guess for me ultimately, the wedding is not about you, it's ur fren's big day, i guess for her to choose you to be her bridesmaid meant a lot to her. so... yeah.</p>
              <p>i still suggest u go find her to talk face to face or call her up, you guys got to talk, n trash things out</p>

              <p>thanks... sometimes i feel that i'm quite lame for letting my feelings get in the way. but my ex was quite nasty to me towards the end.</p>
              <p>after we broke up, smth that he initiated, he wld call me again to say tt he wanted to be wif me again or he really wanted to see me. then when i gave in, he pulled away and made it seem as tho i was clinging on to him.</p>

              <p><br>My dear, it's very simple. If the friendship is any worthwhile, she wouldn't bear grudges for too long. True, it's her big day and she expected you to be there as her bridesmaid. But shouldn't friends be all understanding? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>
              <p>If I were you, I'd text a simple apology, offer my help in other areas and seek her understanding. Chances are, if the friendship is tight enough - she would find it in her heart to forgive you (or rather start to see things from your point of view and come back to you)</p>
              <p>However, the root of your problem is still your haunting past. You can't just switch off your feelings at a snap; but if you're holding on so tightly to something so unpleasant - it will crush you just sooner or later. Let go, friend <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"> The past is past and it should serve no more than as a reminder and a valuable lesson for us not to commit the same mistakes.</p>
              <p>Be a happy person <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>

              <p>i will be going for the wedding. in fact, both the church and the dinner. i have also sent her well wishes over email and sms. i thought that would be good enough and that she wouldn't blame me for not being her jie mei. i really need more time to forget abt what happened before seeing him again.</p>

              <p>we were together for two yrs and i cldn't believe tt he could be so coldhearted as to leave me a time when my mum was diagnosed with cancer. it was really bad, i don't even know why i bothered to get back tog with him for a few mths or be friends with him. i guess i really did love him and i knew tt i had also given him a hard time. but ultimately the friendship didn't work out also cos he treated me like dirt.</p>
