This is so ridiculous. A guy, presuming his gf two-timing him, break up this relationship, without concrete evidence, paradoxically with his gf explaination that says otherwise.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>It only boils down to one reason - he is having second thoughts about the relationship. It has little to do with you personally, therefore there is no need to compromise, change, whatever to an extreme - the issue lies with him AND himself only.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Understand why I said ridiculous? He don't want go out with you, then in the end blame you for going out with another guy. Lame right? In the first place, who is the one rejecting dates?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Seemed illogical right? I only have one conclusion for you:<br><br>When people wants to dump the relationship - they seek for all kind of excuses. Lame or not, as long as they believe - its truth. All I can say is, in time to come, you will realise that all this is but a fleeting moment of feelings. It leaves deep marking, no doubt - but you gain experience and lesson. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>

Yes, its a positive point - however, when issues conflicts your relationship, you have to lead it - instead of being in passive mode. Let me enlighten you about some possible comments/questions/statements you could trash at your bf and see how he reply. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> I give you one chance to explain yourself why do you think you deserve me to go back to you.

If yes, there is not point patching back - go fool around and after 20 years of soul searching, if you are still single and provided I am, tell me what have you learn about yourself. Then I shall consider whether the patch is accepted or not.<br><br>Cheers</div>

I am speaking from experience basis and this is the WORST way to solve problems. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>For me, breaking off is pretty extreme - once its mentioned and took place - WHY patch? Most of the time, its isn't worthwhile to patch within a few days to weeks, unless you are talking about minimum a year and more. Time change, people change, but you can't change within mere days or weeks.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Good point? Apologise when arguement arise - Ha! Presuming and presuming. He always assume that you will say sorry first - in love nothing is absolute. There will be one day where you wouldn't and probably he will panic.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You need a good rest. Don't get tangle with this guy for a moment. You are confuse because everything seemed to happen in a flash. All I can say is if you allow a moderate period of rest - like probably 2 - 3 weeks. (I mean full rest - go enjoy yourself, make merry, don't bother about his sms, calls, etc) - you will eventually realise whether is it worth to patch back with him.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>
