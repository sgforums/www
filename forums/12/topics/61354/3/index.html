For maybe the first time in my life, I really grasp what I want, argue within my head what i want and what I want to achieve. And this process of thinking came into my life few months ago only. And to back this up, I dont want to jump into things like what I did last times, so I do my own research. I could go Australia, why SIM, I could be a banker, why chose MLM. I actually sat at my neighbourhood playground and wrote out my reasons. Not only these two factors, but other I have considered..<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Well when would I have godbro? Let nature takes it course.<br><br>Why I wanted one? Urm, if you been tracking my posts everywhere, something happened to me few months back which suddenly made me want to have godbro. Two reasons. Felt that I do cherish friendship a lot. Friendship I realise is very important but yet never understand its meaning until few months ago. I do want to bring this friendship closer with someone. And you are right in one part, that one half of my emptiness is companionship, close one, which I found lacking in my life. Hey having gerfren is very diff from having godbro. In many aspects<br><br>Second half of my emptiness, is actually what I wanted to achieve something in life. Somewhere in Neontetra thread on prayers, I wrote about charity. My main frustrations is not having money or otherwise to help people in need. Haha, may sound idealistic or freaky, just my feelings only.<br><br>Anyway thanks for your counselling.<br><br>Send me a detailed invoice for your couselling fees....hehehee joking</div>
