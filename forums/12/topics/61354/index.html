            <div class='col-md body'>Sigh, I know of a younger guy whom I wish to be my godbrother for many reasons. Problem is, when I told him that, I think he thought me of as psycho and brush me off. Thats ok. But he wont quit smoking. Hey, I know of many smoker friends, but why smoke when you are just putting the cigarettes in your mouth, but not puffing it.<br><br>Well, he is now having a friend who are giving him bad influence, even now inducting him into an MLM company, which I could see as those disguised pyramid or fly by night company. I tried persuading him, but how to talk to a person who has been brainwashed, becoming more stubborn and negative towards others? Of course when you enter those company earlier, you start to earn a lot in the beginning. He wont let go because he see the "results".<br><br>I forsee his weakness is money long time ago before this, considering his family background too. But as he is the only child, the more he cannot afford to take a wrong route in life. I cant wait for the company to collapse. You wouldnt know when the police will knock on door.<br><br>Even if the company collapse, he is still under bad influence, and might go merry-go-round trying other lousy companies. Many a times, I told myself, well he will learn the lessons somehow. But the impatience in me do not allow. Well, this is my story, although it is quite brief compared to the experience.<br><br>I just wish people would just shoot those arseholes, either the people who organise the scam or people who benefit from the effort or influencing their friends in the negative way.</div>
