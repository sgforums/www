I have read and seen his posts. Mayb he was abit harsh but I think he was just stating his opinion. I mean ppl can state their opinion here watever that may be. It mayb unpleasant to see but its ppl's opinion afterall.<br><br>Hm... I also do realise that he mayb trying to flame others which ppl dun like. But by back stabbing him, its kinda bad. Wat goes round comes round. U can post his pictures around and say that is him and do watever but ever tot abt wat if he takes legal action?<br><br>Hm.. I realied hes been quiet too lately. Mayb hes really frustrated at that aready. I agree with some of ur points but I also agree with someof his points too cos I can see some topics are clearly aimed at him abusing his pictures (refer to I wana date chio gals). MODs shld do sth abt it no matter how they dislike it cos its their responsibility to stop abusing.<br><br>Though the picture is placed in some publick domain but that doesnt mean that u can use it and state that is u. Isnt that abusing? Hmmm... I think we all shld stop this thing aready. This is AA to help ppl after all.

I have read and seen his posts. Mayb he was abit harsh but I think he was just stating his opinion. I mean ppl can state their opinion here watever that may be. It mayb unpleasant to see but its ppl's opinion afterall.<br><br>Hm... I also do realise that he mayb trying to flame others which ppl dun like. But by back stabbing him, its kinda bad. Wat goes round comes round. U can post his pictures around and say that is him and do watever but ever tot abt wat if he takes legal action?<br><br>Hm.. I realied hes been quiet too lately. Mayb hes really frustrated at that aready. I agree with some of ur points but I also agree with someof his points too cos I can see some topics are clearly aimed at him abusing his pictures (refer to I wana date chio gals). MODs shld do sth abt it no matter how they dislike it cos its their responsibility to stop abusing.<br><br>Though the picture is placed in some publick domain but that doesnt mean that u can use it and state that is u. Isnt that abusing? Hmmm... I think we all shld stop this thing aready. This is AA to help ppl after all. If u are here, <span style="color: blue;">hear ppl's advices no matter they are pleasant or to your disliking.</span> </div></blockquote>But some are obviously not advices...<br><br>I personally often just stand neutral.<br><br>It's often easy to just flame someone for their mistake(s). Though no doubt sometimes some of them may have done their wrong parts, but what's done often cannot be undone. In the spirit of AA and light of things, it would be more appropriate to be encouraging than all down pullings.. Though of course, I understand it would only natural to expect both sides of responses most times... To encourage people to post follow their woes and ask for help, rather than putting them down as they do... Tell me... Who has never made mistake in their own life before?<br><br>And finally for you... Yeah.. The MODs are taking the appropriate actions for the inappropriate things... But we ain't GOD, and we're not paid for devotion for this job... We have our own lives and own work... Own mouth to feed... So pardon us if we can't possibly be doing such a throughout job as to chase after someone...</div>
