I also do realise that he mayb trying to flame others which ppl dun like. But by back stabbing him, its kinda bad. Wat goes round comes round. U can post his pictures around and say that is him and do watever but ever tot abt wat if he takes legal action?<br><br>Hm.. I realied hes been quiet too lately.
