Just realize I have never celebrate my birthday with anybody except with my wife. Seriously doubt my co-workers know or want to know my birthday. I alway felt I can't fit in. Neither with the pub-going, smoking guys, or with the studious guys in my poly days. So in the end, I'm always alone.   Now in working life, I also don't know how to fit in with them. Things got worse since I got promoted. Just realize how bad it is just now when I saw video they post going out with older guys who join the company later then me. So it must be something wrong with me, right?I think I need to see a shrink or something. Going to join SPCA as a volunteer as it is something I always enjoy, cause the dogs and cats there are always happy to see you. I seriously don't know whats wrong with me. Needs some help here. Actually I don't know am I posting in the right place or not.</p></div>

              Self-consciousness is a dis-ease!  In other words, what others think of u and utter about u is so very important but one does not realize one's predicament. There is nothing outside of onself that can fix it cos it emanates from within onself.
              
              When one is unable to relate to oneself (warts and all) or unaccepting of oneself, it is nigh impossible for another to accept what one is!

              Ts -  I alway felt I can't fit in - why? That is something that calls for self-honesty.  many are not willing to see the lack within oneself or are unreconciled to baggages within - both emotional n psychological.
              Most of us try to find ourselves in others and reject antying or anyone that does not resonate of us (within) or add to the sense of self.

I honesty want to turn my life around. I don't want to die a lonely sad old man.  Thing is, Whenever I go out with my friends, I feel like I need to conform to their ways of, talking trash, or girl ogling or drinking. It's not me, I would feel faky if I do that. I would lose myself. Whenever, I go out in a group, I tend to keep quiet. I felt it's safer. Till the point that I feel going out with friends or not is the same.</div>

              <p>If I am you, I be happy for what I have and not to bother jelousy other ppl can mix around. its a personality problem that you can't just turn the leaf overnight. Either you are in it or you are not. Some ppl are born to be chatterbox but thinking yourself being a not is a sickening thing, just be who you are and mix with the right group of ppl you be at ease then forcing your butt around.</p>

              I think we have steptrack some where. I'm fine with being a kidney patient. Life deals you all kind of shit and I got the long end of it. I'm fine with it. &amp; its not the issue here, my issue is I wonder why I am always walking alone on sat with no friends. Can't be the whole world got problem, so it had to be me somehow. Just couldn't ....pin the point if you know what I mean.
              Rooney: thinking doesn't solve the problem for my social issue, that's why I'm trying to figure it out. That's why I'm asking for advises here. 
              Angie azurebluesky: it's the right group I can't find.

              <p>there is nothing wrong with you, actually - except that you are not really skillful in the art of relating to people at work and socially....take up social interaction classes and activities....</p>
              <p>it has something to do with how you were brought up in an enclosed environment...a lot of people do not know how to open up themselves and relate socially except only with family and a selected few people in their lives...surely, your dog/ cat/ goldfish has nothing to do with whats wrong....</p>
              <p>if your wife can marry u, that is a blessing point that she appreciates your personality and character,...all u need is to open up yourself to more people...be more interested in people and their surrounding ....</p>
              <p>dun just dwell on social medias...meet real people...</p>

              fcukpap: i think what you say is right. my parent are very private people too. i need to go out and meet real people. That's why i want to do something about it by joining group of interest to me. Thats why im going to join the SPCA as a volunteer. By the way, this is the first time i have try social media. Took me awhile to just sign up for the forum. Im internet-retard. what social interaction class are you talking about? 
              bio-hawk: i dont want to be alone any more.

              <p>Dun worry Igor, you can come joo chiat and visit me, once you visited me, all your social and introvert behavor will be solved, in fact, you will become more extrovert than you can ever control.</p>
              <p>Dun join SPCA, there you only meet animals, your interaction should be with human especially gals, not animals</p>
