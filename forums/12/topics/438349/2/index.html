              <p><br>hehe.</p>
              <p>Joining SPCA i a start to find people with the same interest, which is a start. Becoming friends with people at work is good, but not essential...so try other places to find friends, social interest groups, sports clubs (or whatever else u r interested in).</p>
              <p>Also like u said, first time on social media, so who knows.</p>
              <p>Everyone has their own characteristics, so be yourself and I;m sure there are ohers that will click...just depends how hard u want to try to look 4 them.</p>

              thanks for all the advise given.
              fcukpap: your advise is the most sound to me. i shall re examine my social life base on your suggestion. try to found out about those social interaction stuff you mention.
              rooney9: i understand your points. i am to accept myself as the way i am. &amp; I understand there are people more worse than me. i get that. But that still doesnt mean i can't try to improve mine. i dont take anything for granted. Thanks for your advise anyway.

              Igor,
              Why do you not understand this: that others are not the barrier but yourself, your sense of what you are (with all its conditionings and ...) is swimming against life! The so-called others are merely an excuse - what you are in every situation and circumstance reveals what you are. What is inside u is surfacing. 
              
              Many here seem to suggest that by ''doing'' things - social as well as indulging in pursuits may resonate with you and ultimately ''free'' you.
              
              It is fine to heed such advice or suggestions and do or indulge in such ... but one has to understand that till one is reconciled to the dichomtomizing, polarizing conceptuals models within onself - as to what life should be, love should be, .... )add on what comes to the mind) one is bound to be at odds with others and the world at large.
              
              HAVING A POROUS EGO MAKES ALL THE DIFFERENCE TO ONE'S LIVING!

              <p>one thing about relationships, whether family, friends or colleagues. you need to make an effort to communicate with them. usually relationship problems comes when one or the other party doesnt connect or even communicate properly, resulting in a lot of misunderstandings.</p>
              <p>I reckon you are poor in communication with others. you need to make an effort in this. alot of others, including me, are poor in communication, be it explaining your point of view, concept or even listening. hearing and listening are not the same. you may hear, but you did not take down the gist of the message. you may also be selective in hearing, ie you want to hear what you wish to hear and block out other messages you do not wish to hear.</p>

              <p>But then, becareful, most of the message given by govt people,  frens, relatives, colleagues and especially bosses is meant to con you into doing something out of your will, communication is good, no doubt, but learnt to listen carefully, the gist of it can make you suffer later, you need to digest it, analyse it before you decide if the gist of the message is for real or for making use of you, Like me, boss, use to give those good message like making money, good bonuses, better paid increase, but end up, after processed the profit and loss, not much cashflow left, so, no choice, got to con the staffs, if not, how to motivate them to work harder.</p>
              <p>Same like our govt, alot of gists in their messages before election, then after election, the gist become cheeze and start to melt down, so, dun alway trust the gist of a message ya</p>

              Fugazzi: I know u r trying to help. But gosh, I got no idea what u r talking about. I must be a shallow person cos your advise is too deep for me. thanks. Buddhism?
              The rest: Actually I know my communication sucks. I am lousy at explaining things. In work, I only care for the results. Cos my boss only expect positive result from me too. Plus the fact that I'm a impatient people when regard to work. So while communication ideas or explaining, i sucks major big time. When your worker worry about their pay every month, it's hard to make them see the bigger picture. 
              Angel7030: the problem is ever after you know your boss are bullshitting, you still have to play along. Thats when it's hard being the in-between your boss &amp; your worker. It's like selling talisman to ah pei even though it is totally crap.

              One carries what is alway witin oneself. Let me exemplify - one cannot put lemon in a juicer and expect some other juice. That seems to be your predicament!
              As for Buddhism - it may be or may not be - what matters is that it makes one unlearn the folly of one's ways.

              <p>Igor, Just don't give a damn about fitting in or catching up.</p>
              <p>Just be proud of who you are. So what if you have no friends. You are alive, you are working, and is good at that. Just look forward to getting more things done well, and be proud of that.</p>
              <p>Its not you lifestyle thats lousy, its you thinking that it is lousy, when you don't know how to appreciate yourself.</p>
              <p>You can struggle with yourself, and in the end, you will realise, after a lot of anguish, that there is nothing wrong with you. Thats when you are old and have white hair. Remember, wisdom? Wisdom will set in, and you will realise the foolishness of youth.</p>
