              <p>i think the question of when exactly a fetus is considered a
              life (therefore abortion = murder) is still raging at this point.
              imo when the nervous system is developed to the point where a
              sensation of pain from the aborting can be felt, the process
              becomes cruel for the helpless.   </p>

              <p>How many parents of adopted children do you know ?</p>
              <p>Are you even a parent yet ?</p>
              <p> I have at least 3 couples of which 2 adopted children outside their own race . 4 teenage single moms who decied against aborting their babies . Growing up, at least 3 of my girl friends had abortions, 2 of which are unable to have kids due to scarring and 1 just went through her 3rd miscarriage.</p>
              <p>You talk big.. but you have no idea what it's like to be a parent.</p>
              <p>TS already clarified that guy is not his half brother.. go and read TS post properly.</p>
              <p>The fact that you think aborting a baby is like a dental removal shows how <strong>IGNORANT </strong>you are. So please STFU.. educate yourself better before you come here and spout more nonsense.</p>
              <p> Here's the stats you ask about..pertaining to psychological damage..</p>
              <p>Research by David Reardon of the Elliott Institute has shown that, 
                  regardless of age, family size, race, marital status, or number of 
                  abortions, of those surveyed:</p>
              <ul id="BulletUL">
              <li id="bullet"> 61 percent experience flashbacks</li>
              <li id="bullet"> 54 percent have anniversary reactions </li>
              <li id="bullet"> 33 percent feel suicidal</li>
              <li id="bullet"> 78 percent have feelings of diminished control of their lives</li>
              <li id="bullet"> 52 percent experience difficulty developing and maintaining relationships</li>
              <li id="bullet"> 49 percent begin or increase drug use</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Ironically, though women seek out abortion as a solution to stressful 
                  circumstances, abortion itself can become a contributor to long-lasting 
                  stress of a different kind.</p>
              <p>And yes.. if you are old enough to have UNPROTECTED SEX.. you are old enough to view photos of aborted babies..</p>

              <p>Actually.. Steve's mom had to settle for a couple without college degrees. because the lawyers wanted a baby girl. Steve's mom made the adoptive parents promise they will send Steve to college.. which he never did.</p>
              <p>TS's priority is her health.. she is at risk of HIV.  IF she is indeed HIV positive..it will be difficult for her to have babies in the future. The only way a HIV mother can have a baby is via insemination if her new partner is HIV negative.</p>

              <p>How many parents of adopted children do you know ?</p>
              <p>Are you even a parent yet ?</p>
              <p> I have at least 3 couples of which 2 adopted children outside their own race . 4 teenage single moms who decied against aborting their babies . Growing up, at least 3 of my girl friends had abortions, 2 of which are unable to have kids due to scarring and 1 just went through her 3rd miscarriage.</p>
              <p>You talk big.. but you have no idea what it's like to be a parent.</p>
              <p>TS already clarified that guy is not his half brother.. go and read TS post properly.</p>
              <p>The fact that you think aborting a baby is like a dental removal shows how <strong>IGNORANT</strong> you are. So please STFU.. educate yourself better before you come here and spout more nonsense.</p>
              <p> Here's the stats you ask about..pertaining to psychological damage..</p>
              <p>Research by David Reardon of the Elliott Institute has shown that, regardless of age, family size, race, marital status, or number of abortions, of those surveyed:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>61 percent experience flashbacks</li>
              <li>54 percent have anniversary reactions</li>
              <li>33 percent feel suicidal</li>
              <li>78 percent have feelings of diminished control of their lives</li>
              <li>52 percent experience difficulty developing and maintaining relationships</li>
              <li>49 percent begin or increase drug use</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Ironically, though women seek out abortion as a solution to stressful circumstances, abortion itself can become a contributor to long-lasting stress of a different kind.</p>
              <p>And yes.. if you are old enough to have UNPROTECTED SEX.. you are old enough to view photos of aborted babies..</p>

              <p><br>Is a good point for sure. If thoughts of abortion even occurs to a parent then, I do not know what to say. If the child is born they would be living with this messed-up, irresponsible and hating parent for atleast 25 years. Which is better`?</p>

              <p>For what it's worth (not a whole lot, to be frank), whatever one's version of the truth is, it needs to be consistent with the facts and that's where your side sort of stands up.  I assume you've read Govier?</p>

                                  reason you think so is because you are unable to differentiate
                                  betwen a fetus and child. I figure you have nothing left but

                                  help you think rationally, picture this: You are HIV+ and your

              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 14px;">Laughable how you present half baked knowledge like it is
                                  applicable and relevant. I wonder why you still try to pretend that

                                  don't know that legitimate abortion clinics have such warnings in

                                  affected. These warnings are there for those who are in

                                  better options. On topic, cannot imagine what you'd say to mothers

                                  kidding yourself... The context was "invasive procedure". The tooth
                                  and fetuse would be regarded as bio-hazard waste. You thought that
                                  you have a point that abortion is an "invasive procedure", I
                                  was just saying that tooth extraction is also
                                  an "invasive procedure".to show you how meaningless your

              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 14px;">So
                                  in summation, back up your claim or back off for the sake of the

              <p>What exactly is your purpose here ? To prove how well a debater you are ?</p>
              <p>Other than attacking how I choose to present my case... I don't see much educational value in your postings.</p>
              <p>This is Aunt Agony.. not some mock court you do at school. There is a time and place for everything.. If you so desire a full point-by -point debate.. you can PM me.. I do not wish to burden this thread with your selfish desire to prove how smart you are.</p>
              <p>Abortion is not the only way to resolve the problem. </p>
              <p>And for your info. a friend of mine is a result of a rape. I've mentioned this before. Her mother is a Roman Catholic ( no abortion policy). She is Hispanic.. growing up in Texas..a place of much racial discrimination... today she is a high flyer.. if her mother had condemned her to death by abortion..she wouldn't be what she is today.</p>
              <p>Ofcors you can always disregard my story and call it ancedotal crap.. it's up to you to believe or not.</p>
              <p>The fact is ,that I choose to see what life can be, instead of the gloom and doom you seek to portray.</p>
              <p>I am very saddened by people like you. To build your ego on the backs of other people's misery.Cheapening the precious life of a child.</p>
              <p>As for your children... you will do well imparting them the technical art of argument. Turn them into little assholes nobody gives a crap about. </p>
              <p>I wish you peace and happiness, if you can ever attain it.</p>
