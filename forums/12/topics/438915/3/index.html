              <p>How can one who is already more or less dysfuntional raise a
                              functional child? If Ts was alll that ready and willing to risk
                              chastisement and yet give birth, she would not be here posting her
                              predicament.</p>
              <p>By all means save the … but it pressupposes the courage to face
                              the social fallout of such a decision and if and when that is
                              reconciled – a possibility of raising a child in a ’’healthy’’
                              manner is there.</p>
              <p>PS – Intuitively, it feels that she is not prepared for
                              motherhood and to impose one’’s sense of morality ( with regards to
                              abortion) on another cos one is caught up with what is rite/wrong
                              does not cancel out what the other chooses to be which could feel
                              rite/wrong for her/him.</p>

              <p>Fuggy, you are too quick to condemn a woman's ability, please unlearn what you have learned ....this narrow mindedness.</p>
              <p>While men stay fools upon their deathbeds.. girls grow up to become mothers.</p>
              <p>Functional or dysfunctional is a <strong>pre-judgement</strong> in this case.</p>
              <p>How many of us truly grew up in a "functional" family ? How many "functional" adults came from "dysfunctional" family ?</p>
              <p>How many women out there can truly claim to be "prepared" to have a baby ? None. They are all scared, confused, unsure.... but with some support and encouragement ... woman gave birth and raised her child.</p>
              <p>This amazing ability to adapt.. else Human beings woulda be extinct !! Ponder on that.</p>

              <p>Do you really think her quality of life will "improve" after killing that baby ? Can you be certain.. this little boy/girl will not grow up to become someone of importance ? Someone who can give the Mother a much better life than if she had aborted her child ?</p>

              <p>Wow.. something is seriously wrong in your head. Obviously you think abortion is like going to the dentist to remove a rotting tooth. It's not.</p>
              <p>Abortion is a very invasive procedure.. and the psychological damage is enormous and may last a lifetime.</p>
              <p>Please go call up the helpline listed in page one.</p>
              <p>Talk to one of those consultants and they will explain to you what you are doing is wrong.</p>
              <p>TS case is not the end of the world for her, if she decides to keep the baby.</p>
              <p>A lot of young mothers are scared..but as long as they get the right support , their babies don't have to die. Understand ?</p>
              <p>Abortion is an option all women are aware of.. you don't need to keep pushing for it.</p>

Take your pretentious morals and GTFO!</p>
              <p>The rights of the mother overcede the rights of the fetus since the fetus obviously has none entitled. No one else opinions matter. Its her life, her decision, her burden, whatever the outcome.</p>

              Most of us tend to forget that in all the threads being posted here, we tend to label, pass judgements , advice, offer opinions but seem so unaware to our own conditionings, our own hangups (emotional/psycho/baggage) and unwittingly foist our prejudiced/bigoted ''ways'' with nary a care to the individuality of that person. 
              As to whether, he/she is cognizant of that individuality is not relevant. 
              
              One can go on arguing/discussing  ad finitum on  the pros and cons of abortion/childbirth and justify one's stance. However, to me, it is unpardonable that it is imposed on another - it is disrespectul of another. Telling another what to be or not to be is taking away what the essence is of an individual.
