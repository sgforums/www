              <p>Your ex is actually your half brother. That's incest.  Inbreeding leads to a higher probability of congenital birth defects.</p>
              <p>You may be infected with disease. Please go for blood test.</p>
              <p>If you are indeed infected, your baby will be at risk too.</p>
              <p>Transmission of
              HIV infection to your infant is almost completely preventable with medication. But, when the
              disease is passed on, the results are catastrophic -- the baby may develop HIV
              infection.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For your case.. a simple abortion is insufficient. You have a lot to deal with.</p>
              <p>Please call the helplines for professional help.</p>
              <p>Please talk to your mother, seek her forgiveness so that you may have inner peace.</p>

              You need to go for abortion and a health checkup. Certain diesease can be cured if detected early, once pass a certain date, the disease will stay with you permanently, so it's advisable to go checkup for any sexual diesease asap.
              
              As for abortion, it's not painful. You will be sedated and put to sleep and the more painful portion is emotional/guilt etc... But for the sake of decision making, I think it's wise to abort so as not to complicate your life, your family life, the child's life. (For you, it will be hard for you to find a boyfriend next time with a child, most guys don't want such free gifts. For your family, it will be complicated how they think of you and that will make you feel bad every year whenever there is a gathering. For your child, when he grow up, he will ask how come he's different and where's his dad etc) So the wise decision is to go for abortion.
              
              And for your own sake, go get health checkup like I say, some diesease can be cured if detected early. Same like cancer, as long as it's contained in a part or haven't spread, it can still be cured. But once it spreads, it's too late.
              
              No point feeling depressed now, what's done cannot be undone. Look forward, you're at the lowest point of your life and no matter how dark it look, the days ahead will get brighter if you start making smarter decisions about your life.

              <p>Yes a bit complicated.</p>
              <p>But what to do.</p>
              <p>You tell a person, don't go there, landmine,  its dangerous, he goes there, gets the leg blown off. What do  you do? You treat the person.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>TS, That ex is no good, so don't marry him for the child's sake. He chase you for sex, and he got it, he's done with you. Thats not something new to you. Your mother told you so, and you know that from your surroundings.</p>
              <p>Tell your mother, she won't kill you. Only her face would look like she want to kill you. She will help you. You are her daughter. That's the best way out. There is no easier or magical way out. You need her help and support. Otherwise you are on your own.</p>

                      complicated. I hope youre not making this up... If what you said
                      its true, consider the following</div>
              <div class="quote_body">
              <p><strong>- Are you brave enough to have an abortion?</strong></p>
              <p><strong>- Will the abortion solve all the issues youre facing

              <p>With that said, i dont think abortion is the only way out. In
                      fact, if i were you, i would give birth the child and pull that
                      d*ckhead into the court. Now theres DNA testing methods and the dad
                      of the child can be found out easily. Once convicted, he will face
                      multiple charge. As for your mother, i cant blame her. She will be
                      angry and disappointed with you but thats how it is. You cant
                      change that. If you insist in abortion pls do it soon since the
                      fetus is 1-2 months old. How old are you? I dont think the hosp
                      here allow girls to do abortion anyhow...</p>

                       patients must undergo compulsory counselling before the procedure. 
                      Girls below 16 years of age need to be counseled at the Health Promotion
                       Board Counselling Centre (except for rape victims).</li>
              <li>This is followed by a mandatory waiting period of 48 hours before the procedure can be done.</li>
              <li>If you want an abortion and your doctor refuses on personal grounds, you have the right to seek a second opinion. See <a href="http://singapore.angloinfo.com.sg/af/631/singapore-gynaecology-and-obstetrics.html">here</a> for other providers.</li>
              <li>Patients
                       will normally undergo post abortion counseling after the procedure and 
                      may be required to return a week later to check for any complications.</li>
              <li>Because of the risk of infection, some doctors may advise that you should not have sex for up to two weeks after your procedure.</li>
