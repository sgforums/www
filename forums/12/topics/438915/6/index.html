              <p>Ah yes Gedanken.. I see the start to a great friendship between
                      you and Aneslayer .</p>
              <p>Aneslayer is very much like you isn't he. Very combative..
                      unyielding and here to prove how wrong the world is. A much
                      tortured soul.</p>
              <p>He'd make a good Protege or your doppleganger.</p>
              <p>And Ofcors.. his side sort of stands up.. Easier to let a simple
                      fool remain ignorant.. than try to educate one.</p>

              <p>Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.  Just because you can't stand on your own two feet doesn't mean that Aneslayer needs to be my protege.  Fact is that he's doing a fairly thorough job of making you look like a complete idiot, which really isn't much of an achievement given how much help you're providing.</p>
              <p>As for being combatative and unyielding, well, your posts in this thread amongst others are damning proof of your shameless hypocrisy.</p>
              <p>In any case, it's of no consequence.  You're probably too rabid to recall, but while you take this place as life and death, while I'm just here for shits and giggles.  You're providing great comedy here (especially with how you think your silly little percentages count for something, only to have Aneslayer provide you with a good dose of common sense), so do carry on.</p>
              <p>Oh, almost forgot - I absolutely love how you mistake the simple rules of logic that Aneslayer has highlighted for being attempts at legal arguments.  Hell, you're almost as funny as Karl Pilkington and I'm really curious - how hard do you have to work at coming off as such an ignoramus?</p>

              <p>LOL.  The vexation of a fool is known at once, but the prudent ignores an insult.</p>
              <p>In your case.. the "Luwts" is appropriate. <a href="http://www.orgsites.com/sc/shine/Five_Types_of_Fools.pdf">http://www.orgsites.com/sc/shine/Five_Types_of_Fools.pdf</a></p>
              <p>Yup..It's just an observation, that Anes is much like you. So just enjoy each other's company , don't have to get so excited over my little comment. </p>
              <p>And unlike you.. I don't need to work my ass off for my cushy life in the states.. so I got time to come here and post...</p>
              <p>Please do yourself a favor.. go back to brown nosing your white bosses and white wife.. whenever they are not happy.. you'd be here venting your anger and bitterness again. We really dread it lah... OK ? Good.</p>

              <p>You are right that plant cells (like bacteria and all other
                                                      cells) can divide, produce food, and are alive. Just like a fetus;
                                                      a developing fetus is a simpler lifeform than many plants and
                                                      animals, at some stages simpler than algae.</p>
              <p>While my toes are not sapient, you may not cut them off because
                                                      they are useful to me. What use is the life that TS will provide to
                                                      TS' would-be child?</p>
              <p>The fetus is not even sentient yet and is not in a position to
                                                      suffer loss. Animal cruelty laws prevent us from inflicting pain,
                                                      because as sentients they feel pain. They provide for their humane
                                                      killing as pests, because they are not sapient or not as sapient.
                                                      Yet more advanced than many fetuses.</p>
              <p>In the second instance, as a mother you should consider your
                                                      ability to be useful to your baby and not the other way around.</p>

              <p>You are forgetting, when a parent live vicariously through her own child. this child can provide joy and unconditional love far greater than a man can give.</p>
              <p>If TS is indeed HIV positive.. this is perhaps her only chance of pregnancy.  If she aborts this one.. she may never have one again. Which man will want her ? Perhaps if she can find another HIV positive guy.. how likely is that in Asia ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A woman is instinctively protective of her child the moment she realise her pregnancy. Her body kicks into defensive mode, all her senses heightens.. hence the "morning sickness". Rapid changes to her physical form begins at point of conception.</p>
              <p>If that fetus is indeed just a piece of extra flesh, she will have no qualms in removing it.. like a piece of fibroid ( which is very common in a woman's womb), however..a woman experience much distress/dilemma when forced to make a choice to destroy her child, going against her natural instinct.</p>
              <p>While we humans are finding ways to live a longer, healthier life through medical research and breakthroughs... why are we also/ at the same time seeking ways to nullify a child's right to life.. so we can kill/end it without remorse ?</p>
              <p>Failing the sentience/personhood test does not means the fetus/embryo/zygot is not deserving of protection or the priviledge to continue life.</p>
              <p>So really.. lets call spade a spade.. pro-choice is truthfully.. Pro-death.</p>
              <p>As for Animal cruelty law, it really depends on which philosopher you ascribe to...Rousseau/Bentham.. who believes in natural law.. and/or the ability to suffer.</p>
              <p>Personally.. I prefer Emmanuel/Locke ...who opposes the idea that human beings have duties to non-humans.. we do eat them afterall..steal their milk.. take away their youngs for our own enjoyment.</p>
              <p>"cruelty to animals is contrary to man's duty to <em>himself</em>, because
                                   it deadens in him the feeling of sympathy for their sufferings, and 
                                  thus a natural tendency that is very useful to morality in relation to 
                                  other humans is weakened."- Kant.</p>
              <p>If you see a man torment an animal.. you feel anger towards that man.. to see such vileness in a human. Will you want to be his friend ? No. So cruelty to animal is bad for humankind.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"In the second instance, as a mother you should consider your
                                                      ability to be useful to your baby 
                  and not the other way around."</p>
              <p>..a mother is always useful to the child..
                   to ensure they survive .. how is that not mutally benefitting ? how do you think human beings are not extinct by stone age ? They don't have diapers, no artificial milk, no advance medical facilities.. nor internet. Right ?</p>

              <p>If you would check the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion_in_the_United_States">US statistics on abortions</a>, you would see a drop in

              <p>Just for thoughts, picture how unsafe illegal abortion clinics

              <p>Not anti-government chant lah...</p>
              <p>If you ignore the number of abortions ..yet focus only on increasing birth rates...</p>
              <p>It's akin to drawing water with a leaking bucket.</p>
              <p>Make Singapore more family friendly and condusive for youngsters to start a family.. AND try to plug the loss due to abortions.</p>
              <p>There are still plenty of illegal abortions in the USA... their practices are shoddy, unsanitary.. and God knows how many teenagers they've damaged.</p>
              <p>USA is all about their Constitution. Anything remotely un-constitutional is swiftly struck down.</p>
              <p>Religion plays a very heavy role ...Roman Catholics and Christianity are all Pro-Life...even if the Courts agree to it.. Religiously, abortion is widely forbidden.</p>
              <p> ADD: On top of religious obligations.. the advancement of Paternity Tests, Paternity laws and child support enforcements helps ensure women no longer have to face out of wedlock pregnancy alone and stripped of resources.</p>
              <p>Even Steve Jobs tried to deny his first child.. to the extend he declared to be sterile in court papers... until paternity tests proved he is indeed the child's father. After which he did establish a relationship and sent her to Havard.</p>

              <p>I don't think the system incentivizes promiscuity because
                          pregnancy and birth are powerful disincentives.</p>
              <p>Glorification of the prolific mother (for the state's economic
                          ends at that) and castigation of singles and small families is the
                          greater social ill.</p>
              <p>For any policy there will always be takers, especially if the

              <p>I think our education system needs to play a bolder role in sexuality education in preventing teenage pregnancy and HIV infections.</p>
              <p>Parents are too unreliable to teach, threatening their own children is not teaching. (due to limited teaching resources/materials ? or simply too lazy ?)</p>
              <p>In my mommy support group.. there's quite a few single mothers who are doing well in raising their own child... we also have some who are single with adopted children  ( unable to have a child.. or fear of transmitting their genetic defects ).</p>
              <p>Single motherhood is not a social ill... it's time we give them a break.</p>
              <p>The real problem in Asia is, fathers refusing to take care/provide resources for their children.</p>
