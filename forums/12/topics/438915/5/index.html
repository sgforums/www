                                  one's version of the truth is, it needs to be consistent with the

              <p>Ah yes Gedanken.. I see the start to a great friendship between you and Aneslayer .</p>
              <p>Aneslayer is very much like you isn't he. Very combative.. unyielding and here to prove how wrong the world is. A much tortured soul.</p>
              <p>He'd make a good Protege or your doppleganger.</p>
              <p>And Ofcors.. his side sort of stands up.. Easier to let a simple fool
                                                  remain ignorant.. than try to educate one.</p>

              <p>Jojo,</p>
              <p>Seeing we eat animals all the time, would it help to draw a line
                              between life with only sentience, and life with sentience and
                              sapience? </p>
              <p>All beings have the former, some animals have the latter, but
                              certainly not a cluster of cells has the latter. People generally
                              avoid eating the more sapient species. If it's not sapient, it's
                              not murder.</p>
              <p>I point out all of us have the would-be child's welfare as our
                              only consideration.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>ALL animals are sentience and sapience being. How many of us actually raised our own food ? If you do.. you will agree that animals are intelligent, albeit limited in capacity. </p>
              <p>Humans eat anything that nourishes them.. sapient or not it seems. There is not one animal we do not attempt to feast on.. even the most poisonous of living things.</p>
              <p>The question I ask is .. do we eat our young? And since we don't, why do we kill them ?</p>
              <p>I will agree that the cluster of cells are non-sapient beings...if it remains throughout it's life as but... a cluster of cells.</p>
              <p>However.. the fact that these cells are able to divide and form perfectly ( some not so perfectly)  into human beings.. bellies the fact that they carry/retain some form of memory/information...and the ability to <strong>execute</strong> these information.. makes them sapient.</p>
              <p>So again.. why do we want to kill it ?</p>
              <p>If you say that a fetus/embryo ( whatever you label it)  is not human being.. then may I ask..  can a chicken egg become a human being ? or can a cow give birth to a human being ?</p>
              <p>or.. can that fetus/embryo with human genetic become a cat ?</p>
              <p>Answer: No.</p>
              <p>So.. that human fetus/embryo/cluster of cell.. is in fact human.</p>

              <p>So.. that human fetus/embryo/cluster of cell.. is in fact
              human.</p>

              <p>Your argument is fatally flawed.</p>
              <p>You cannot say a cluster of cells is sapient just because it performs cell division according to hardwired instructions, that is common to every single plant or animal.</p>
              <p>You wouldn't call your thumb or toe sapient just because it grew from your body</p>
              <p>Now, sapience will occur at an advanced stage of assembly that is yet far to occur, perhaps when a baby is a few months or years of age.</p>
              <p>Also you confuse sentience (the ability to feel) with sapience (wisdom and its exercise). Sapience does not extend to all animals. Crows and dolphins are sapient and have a concern for their future. Fish, cattle, poultry are sentient and live and react completely in the present.</p>

              <p>How far back does sapience go?</p>
              <p>A sperm cell is hardwired to build a body on contact with an egg, taking information on bodily traits from DNA present in any given cell.</p>
              <p>Is that sapience? Or a sperm+an egg? Or 100 additional cells? Even sentience is not acquired until long after.</p>
              <p>Most of us add to our wisdom as we age. We don't acquire sapience until we have had opportunity to exercise and develop our wisdom.</p>
              <p>This is not to say that 1 year olds should be eaten. But to show that no sapience exists to be killed within the womb.</p>

              <p>Fatally flawed or not.. is merely subjective. You do not know what I know.. and vice versa so lets not judge too quickly shall we ?</p>
              <p>This debate on Sentience vs Sapients to justify or vilify abortion is not entirely new.</p>
              <p>The problem with this debate is .. till date even the greatest scientists, philosphers and great thinkers failed to test and measure sentience or sapience. so really.. is this a futile discourse ?</p>
              <p>Is human truly capable of dictating which living things are sentiences with or without sapiences ? The arrogance.</p>
              <p>Our body is made up of living cells. The plants are made of living cells too.. infact.. plant cells are capable of making their own food to survive.  Our nails and hair cells are dead cells.. thats why we don't mind cutting em off. But is a fetus a cluster of dead cells ?</p>
              <p>If all our cells are dead.. we'd be dead or zombiefied- the living dead ( a non-sentience with sapient abilities?)</p>
              <p>If our right to survival solely rests upon classifying our being into sapiance or non-sapiance.. then is it right to kill someone who is brain dead ( in a vegetative state, all organs functioning)  but had lived outside a mother's womb for more than a year ?</p>
              <p>Add: "You wouldn't call your thumb or toe sapient just because it grew
                                      from your body".. since your thumb and toes are non-sapience.. may I cut it off for you ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To sum it all up.. <strong>The starting point of a new life start at Conception</strong>.  To insist a person's arbitary rights to live after that point, is illogical.</p>
              <p>I am Pro-choice.. the choice to use contraceptives and medical related abortions.</p>
              <p>Abortions should never be a lifestyle choice. Give that baby a chance to live.</p>

              <p>Fatally flawed or not.. is merely subjective. You do not know

              ?</p>
              <p>This debate on Sentience vs Sapients to justify or vilify
              abortion is not entirely new.</p>
              <p>The problem with this debate is .. till date even the greatest
              scientists, philosphers and great thinkers failed to test and
              measure sentience or sapience. so really.. is this a futile
              discourse ?</p>
              <p>Is human truly capable of dictating which living things are
              sentiences with or without sapiences ? The arrogance.</p>
              <p>Our body is made up of living cells. The plants are made of
              living cells too.. infact.. plant cells are capable of making their
              own food to survive.  Our nails and hair cells are dead
              cells.. thats why we don't mind cutting em off. But is a fetus a
              cluster of dead cells ?</p>
              <p>If all our cells are dead.. we'd be dead or zombiefied- the
              living dead ( a non-sentience with sapient abilities?)</p>
              <p>If our right to survival solely rests upon classifying our being
              into sapiance or non-sapiance.. then is it right to kill someone
              who is brain dead ( in a vegetative state, all organs
              functioning)  but had lived outside a mother's womb for more
              than a year ?</p>
              <p>Add: "You wouldn't call your thumb or toe sapient just because
              it grew from your body".. since your thumb and toes are
              non-sapience.. may I cut it off for you ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To sum it all up.. <strong>The starting point of a new life
              start at Conception</strong>.  To insist a person's arbitary
              rights to live after that point, is illogical.</p>
              <p>I am Pro-choice.. the choice to use contraceptives and medical
              related abortions.</p>

              chance to live.</p>

              <p>You are right that plant cells (like bacteria and all other cells) can divide, produce food, and are alive. Just like a fetus; a developing fetus is a simpler lifeform than many plants and animals, at some stages simpler than algae.</p>
              <p>While my toes are not sapient, you may not cut them off because they are useful to me. What use is the life that TS will provide to TS' would-be child?</p>
              <p>The 
              fetus is not even sentient yet and is not in a position to suffer loss. 
              Animal cruelty laws prevent us from inflicting pain, because as sentients they feel pain. They provide for their humane killing as pests, because they are not sapient or not as sapient. Yet more advanced than many fetuses.</p>
              <p>In the second instance, as a mother you should consider your ability to be useful to your baby and not the other way around.</p>

              <p>This argument sounds very luan...for me, I think I favour an abortion. Reason is that a foetus should not be feeling the painful end since it is not developed yet. It also looks like the makers (girl and guy) are not prepared to provide stable and happy family yet. So if by giving birth,wouldn`t the baby suffer even more for so many years?</p>
              <p>Also, I cannot understand why guys will say goodbye to the girl who carries his flesh and blood. I will do anything for a girl who is willing to have my own little baby! It is godsent! Aiya, but I am not so attractive. very sad...any takers?</p>
