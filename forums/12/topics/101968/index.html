            <div class='col-md body'>Well.. local teachers are considered nice.. physical punishment is strictly restricted to discipline heads.. plus parents nowadays will complain whenever they sense any slightess "injustice" their precious babies went thru.. the thing is teaching is an ungrateful job.. so be tolerant.. they are humans too.. they do have their pms times.. it could be u having mood swings on tt day..<br><br>However, there are really excruciatingly obnoxious ones.. i've a fren in NYJC who walked out a specific teacher's lesson almost all the time.. rebut back at him.. from wat i heard its the norm dere.. plus other schs.. anyway mu fren is a nice person.. so the teacher muz have been really too much..<br><br>So it's up to ur discretion.. so if u feel victimised and wish for vindication and revenge.. do share with us ur exploits..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Prolly the male reservist ones, ptah. but then again.. maybe.. maybe i wear a pen.. or maybe i was in wrestling before <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">, maybe they got a shot.. but then again.. maybe.<br><br>Sorry just the white cells talking in rage.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>the way teachers talk e.g<br>Before u read.. bear in mind whatever I say is completely calm and composed.. think of.. English butler voice.. yeah.. i am never worked up in front of them..yet.. although i may want to.<br><br>example 1:<br><br>me: "Would you require me to bring another copy of the essay for tutorial (i emailed it to her), just in case u might have had troubled printing it or opening it in the email?"<br><br>her/it:" I AM NOT A photocopying MACHINE, you SHOULD print it yourself regardless of whether u have emailed it or not!"<br><br>Me: "very good then madam..*growl*."<br><br>example 2:<br><br>her/it: I WILL NOT ACCEPT essays from you since you did not attend me class last friday!! Do you think i am a lowly marker to mark for you!?"<br><br>(Given last friday i was on mc btw..)<br><br>me: Errrr you do understand i was not in school that day.. so it was not just ur class-<br><br>her/it: i dun care blah blah blah etc etc etc<br><br>Plus this teacher keeps giving me dirty looks all the time.. prolly coz she as an Indian can't do it to REAL powerful adult brits outside withouit getting thrashes... so i am the next best alternative to vent out her nationalistic racial stuff out on.. afterall she is a history teacher. And we are all people..<br><br>example 3:<br><br>him/it: Some teachers tell me u are just.. errr... errr<br><br>me: Yes??? I am wat?<br><br>him/it: U must learn to respect authority or something like that<br><br>me: Well frankly sir, i really cannot care less for this authoritarian "teacher is GOD i am the lowly worshipping student" kind of thing u know? i mean perhaps it is hard for me to adapt to a grovelling position here-<br><br>him/it: interrupts; what do u mean? What the heck is your problem? Many teachers complain about u blah blah blah!<br><br>me: i am sorry if i have caused you distress. All i am saying is it is hard for me to understand what we are discussing.. i am sorry but i fail to see the point as in what my problem is precisely?<br><br>him/it: forget it.<br><br>Example 4:<br><br>*art room. me is fixing lights for my project, totally oblivious to anything around me. i am alone and sweating in this heated room trying to fix the freakin lights to the ceiling..*<br><br>suddenly;<br>teacher: Have u seen wei-liang or some funny name?<br><br>me: Whoa..! What? *me is not facing the door,,, i think its my art teacher* Who the heck is Weiliang??? new student??<br><br>*Me turns around to find its the indian hist teacher, i nearly fall off the table i am standing on while working on the ceiling*<br><br>me: Whoa... darn.. err sorry ma'm i thought u were someone else..<br><br>teacher: U know u are very rude? All the teachers are talking about u etc etc<br><br>me: errrr... ok! I'm sorry. Errr ma'm? err you do understand that i am officially allowed to do my project this whole week.. so i have not been skipping ur classes on purpose ok?<br><br>teacher: yes yes ur art teacher told me..<br><br>me: ok then..<br><br>Other episodes: Me going round to teachers to findout what the problem is?? Coz what 1 teacher said really put the hook in me.<br><br>me: I was just wandering sir, if we were cool? I.e. if u had a problem with me or anything?<br><br>teacher1: Oh no not at all? why?<br><br>me: just that i've been told most of my tutors are unhappy with me.<br><br>teacher1: No no well not me..<br><br>Me: alright then. But then hypothetically should u have a problem with me, i do hope you would talk to me straight about it.. because i get the impression from mr (the dude above) that many tutors seem to be talking badly about me, i simply would like to know why so that i might change.<br><br>teacher1: ok.<br><br>I did this with ALL my teachers, and none of them said they had a problem with me.. in fact i was said to be quite a good student.<br><br>Unless u people don't have the guts to openly tell someone his flaws.. it doesn't matter.. it just simply means the system might allow moral flaws to continue unchecked.. into adulthood..<br><br>Other episode 2: taking to discipline mistress (who is also my drama teacher)<br><br>me: same qn as above.. u got a problem wuith me blah blah?<br><br>discipline mistress: no? why? Well i guess teachers here are just not used to having students question them or something.. when i first met u i felt it too..<br>(She was never specific)<br><br>me: errr felt what?<br><br>*in the end,, like most people here... they spoke a lot but i really couldn't get what they were trying to say... so in the end all i can do is nod and thank them, exiting from the conversation more clueless than ever..*<br><br>So this is why i have very little respect for local teachers, because they are inherently antagonistic and rude. The only local teachers i have met who are not like that.. i am proud to say (not coz of national reasons, but coz i genuinely like them) are my old D&amp;T teacher, hokkien commando dude who was educated in birmingham.. and my art teachers and chinese teachers.  But i have noticed in particular chinese language teachers are the most warmest, prolly coz they are impressed a semi-white dude like me took SO MUCH TROUBLE to learn their language or something like that..<br><br>i dunno. Whenever a fucked up teacher pisses me off.. i imediately think of many numerous instances about past insults/me geting pissed off.. And that makes me want to do all manner of unspeakable things to them when i am at my greatest and they are at their weakest..<br><br></div>

I only teach the syllabus.. and your kid didn't pick up due to lousy attitude which is your part to teach.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"> </div></blockquote>Ur a teacher? I certainly hope you are not antagonistic to ur students coz ur so pumped up on ego. Be careful then, 1 day when ur abroad or whatever, students who u pissed off would be powerful and have ur quick arrangement settled, i personally know some students who are more grudge bearing then me.. 1 of them is now a principal and is trying hard to make life difficult for his previous teachers.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Why not just think of you rteachers as your playthings?? Derive entertainment at their expense. like openly tell the class you hate her and all that. I did it to my chem teacher once, she ordered me out of class and i refused. She was a total bitch lar. Scream at ppl using microphone. SO i start to give sarcarstic remark to whatever comment she makes in class. Like for example when she asked :What do you get if you mix ethanol with water? I would reply with things like Powerpuff Girls and all that lar,. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">Kinda fun. Try it out!</div>
