Law of Relativity... Depends on how ya watch and what kinda life you're living...? Mentality...? Life you're living... OR life you're LEADING...? Some people take things down as just it is.. Some just make the necessary changes... Of course, there'll also be people who compare it with others (especially celebrities) and yes... TV programmes... And SOME might just wanna LEAD it....<br><br>Mentality? Sometimes to the extent that it all gets TWISTED UP.... Sometimes might actually end up a 'meaningless' thing... Or in their opinion 'meaningful' at the expense of many others....<br><br>It's our life you see...? It's the way we live...? How the media would affect one would depends on how the mentality of the individual? Just like the many other things which could be affecting him / her in life?</div>

Boredom might be the initial stage we begin with (maybe? depending on the reason for watching the TV?)... TV's usually there to keep us entertained or informed...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
