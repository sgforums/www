            <div class='col-md body'>Well most boring people I speak to usually just talk about the television shows they watch. They go on and on about their Channel 8 serials and who did what with whom blah blah blah. I find it boring because it seems their entire life revolves around these shows, right now they are all talking about American Idol, it used to be Surivor lolz. Some of them just watch Anime Cartoons.<br><br>It seems these people don't have lives because they are too passive. All they are happy to do is sit and watch, and let their lives be just observing what scriptwriters put on the screen. I rarely recieve any new ideas or proposals from such people, simply put they don't talk to me (which is cool now <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> i used to be pissed), they only like to talk to their own sort of people who watch the same stuff. Haha thus it becomes a cycle of passivitiy when passive people only associate with other people equally as passive.<br><br>When i watch anything, i think about how it can be improved in quality or directing. Most importantly, i think about how I can twist what I watch into something else to make people laugh, in other words, i make parodies. I am thus not passive in that sense.<br><br>Then again why are people's lives un-glorified? Because they watch too much media stuff, why do they watch too much media stuff? Because they are passive, now, WHY ARE THEY PASSIVE? Well its the culture and strict rigid system here I suppose. THE average person's schedule is too jam packed, so much so he must resort to the cheapest and easiest form of distress, i.e. Television and media, for he won't have time to read books and ponder about philosphy, or he wont have time to walk through the gardens or the beaches... being passive in the 1st place, he wont even attempt to think differently or parody what he watches.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thank you all for replyin...<br><br>Ling Ling,<br><br>yea tv and cinema and even MTV gives us hope of a better life. but for some of us, we aspire too greatly to chase dreams that we should never even begin chasing. media depicts (although not always very accurately) how the rich famous popular and succesful live their lives. be it fictitious characters or real live examples, we all somehow envy them and we try to chase those dreams. some suceed but the majority (to be fair) only marginally succeed... for those that fail very badly.. they become casted out from the very societies that they tried to fit in to.<br><br>from another angle, our lives could have been pretty interesting. reading a book or spending family time could be interesting. picking up culinery skills or gardening or sewing or just plain fixing the broken fan could be exciting. but i bet many of you, whilst reading the abovesaid must have scoffed at it and said.."wah...damn loser lor" BUT i beg to differ. (no offense to those who actually take joy in the above said due to INTEREST)<br>media portrays thru dramas or adventure series, heck, even REALITY series how boring the abovesaid is....</div>
