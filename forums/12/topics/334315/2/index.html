              <p>Hello everyone. (:</p>
              <p>Intro of the people involved:</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1. My ex (Jonathan)</span></p>
              <p>We were from the same sec sch. We dated when I was sec 3, and he was one year older.<br>However, due to some childish reasons, we broke up. We did stay in contact, mainly using msn.</p>
              <p>Last year during Aug, (i'm already in jc, he went privatesch). Then he attended one of my college event. So we met up after the event. And we were back into a r/s.</p>
              <p>4 months later (Dec), he turned cold and so we broke up.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2. My JC BFF (Jenny)</span></p>
              <p>She was my best friend during these two years, till now.<br>And she knows Jonathan too, 'cause he often drop by my school to send me home.</p>
              <p><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3. And me, obviously</span></p>
              <p>(Names are faked)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>THE STORY:</strong></p>
              <p>Long story cut short.</p>
              <p>I just found out few weeks ago that since this Jan08. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Jenny was with Jonathan.</span><br>They'd been together for 8months already, and still is together.</p>
              <p>Let's see, Jon and me broke up during Dec. And they got together in January. What are the chances that he turned cold was NOT because of Jenny's existence?</p>
              <p>I'd asked her why she steals my guy, but she denies doing so. Both Jenny and Jonathan insist that they are just two singles getting together.</p>
              <p>She lied to me for so long. Yet, pretending to be my best friend for these 8 months.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'm terribly upset by her actions.<br>I don't understand how some people can be so selfish.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'd said I forgive her, though I refused to talk to her.<br>I'd even grant both of them happiness, but sometimes I regret what I'd said.<br>Sometimes, I still hate her.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Did I do the right thing? Should I not have forgiven her?</p>
              </div>

              <p><br>Last time hor...the girl who steals other girls' bf would've acid splashed across her face and the bf would've been desexed by my grandmother's golden pair of scissor.</p>
              <p>But since we're talking about right now, then I think you have to consider it takes two hands to clap. Although if your bf had been faithful to you from the beginning, even if marilyn monroe stripped herself in front of your bf, it wouldn't have any effect on your bf if he's faithful.</p>
              <p>What comes around goes around, don't worry about this pair of gou nan nv. Because of this betrayal that they have done to you, both of them will always have this fear of getting betrayed by each other in the future. And they will never be able to overcome that fear in their hearts unless they get married within a year or so to solve that fear issue within themselves.</p>
              <p>So if you see them getting married within a year or so, you will be pleasantly pleased to know that they are doing it out of guilt and not out of love (Of course it's their lame excuse for getting married).</p>
              <p>Little do they know, this kind of marriage does not last. So don't be surprised to see them filing for divorce in the future.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, this kind of incidents is quite common in Singapore and maybe that is the reason of couples breaking up.</p>
              <p>But for your own sake, I'm sharing this with you and I hope you will NEVER resume any friendship with these two people again, and show NO MERCY to them cos they don't deserved to be forgiven at this moment.</p>
              <p>GOD may forgive them when they both die eventually, but they will still need to suffer for their sins while they're still alive. It's called RETRIBUTION and it's will constantly lurk and haunt them as long as they are alive. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p><br>You can still get back at her by lying to her all the wonderful things that your ex have done for you.</p>
              <p>Remember...the more realistic your lies are, the more she would be demanding your ex to outperform.</p>
              <p>These lies can all include those things that your bf would never be willing to do for any girl.</p>
              <p>Lie to her and make her feel always inferior to you and she will constantly bug your ex to do impossible things for her....all just for her sake of outperforming you.</p>

              to consider it takes two hands to clap. Although if your bf had
              been faithful to you from the beginning, even if marilyn monroe
              stripped herself in front of your bf, it wouldn't have any effect
              on your bf if he's faithful.</p>
              <p>What comes around goes around, don't worry about this pair of
              gou nan nv. Because of this betrayal that they have done to you,
              both of them will always have this fear of getting betrayed by each
              other in the future. And they will never be able to overcome that
              fear in their hearts unless they get married within a year or so to
              solve that fear issue within themselves.</p>
              <p>So if you see them getting married within a year or so, you will
              be pleasantly pleased to know that they are doing it out of guilt
              and not out of love (Of course it's their lame excuse for getting
              married).</p>
              <p>Little do they know, this kind of marriage does not last. So
              don't be surprised to see them filing for divorce in the
              future.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, this kind of incidents is quite common in
              Singapore and maybe that is the reason of couples breaking up.</p>
              <p>But for your own sake, I'm sharing this with you and I hope you
              will NEVER resume any friendship with these two people again, and
              show NO MERCY to them cos they don't deserved to be forgiven at
              this moment.</p>
              <p>GOD may forgive them when they both die eventually, but they
              will still need to suffer for their sins while they're still alive.
              It's called RETRIBUTION and it's will constantly lurk and haunt
              them as long as they are alive. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>always ask urself why are u angry? being resentful will get u no where. it makes u a bitter person &amp; eventually eliminates ur trust in others.</p>

              <p>u think its fine now to hate others for causing hurt on u but in the long run u will understand it is this very element that will cause urself destruction. and i mean destruction in ur future r/s because u have no trust.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>why keep mentioning karma? u mean ur cursing them? if u so believe in karma, wouldn't this karma backfire on u then?</p>
