              <p>Hello everyone. (:</p>
              <p>Intro of the people involved:</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1. My ex (Jonathan)</span></p>
              <p>We were from the same sec sch. We dated when I was sec 3, and he was one year older.<br>However, due to some childish reasons, we broke up. We did stay in contact, mainly using msn.</p>
              <p>Last year during Aug, (i'm already in jc, he went privatesch). Then he attended one of my college event. So we met up after the event. And we were back into a r/s.</p>
              <p>4 months later (Dec), he turned cold and so we broke up.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2. My JC BFF (Jenny)</span></p>
              <p>She was my best friend during these two years, till now.<br>And she knows Jonathan too, 'cause he often drop by my school to send me home.</p>
              <p><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3. And me, obviously</span></p>
              <p>(Names are faked)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>THE STORY:</strong></p>
              <p>Long story cut short.</p>
              <p>I just found out few weeks ago that since this Jan08. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Jenny was with Jonathan.</span><br>They'd been together for 8months already, and still is together.</p>
              <p>Let's see, Jon and me broke up during Dec. And they got together in January. What are the chances that he turned cold was NOT because of Jenny's existence?</p>
              <p>I'd asked her why she steals my guy, but she denies doing so. Both Jenny and Jonathan insist that they are just two singles getting together.</p>
              <p>She lied to me for so long. Yet, pretending to be my best friend for these 8 months.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'm terribly upset by her actions. <br>I don't understand how some people can be so selfish.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'd said I forgive her, though I refused to talk to her.<br>I'd even grant both of them happiness, but sometimes I regret what I'd said.<br>Sometimes, I still hate her.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Did I do the right thing? Should I not have forgiven her?</p>

              <p>Hello everyone. (:</p>
              <p>Intro of the people involved:</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1. My ex (Jonathan)</span></p>
              <p>We were from the same sec sch. We dated when I was sec 3, and he was one year older.<br>However, due to some childish reasons, we broke up. We did stay in contact, mainly using msn.</p>
              <p>Last year during Aug, (i'm already in jc, he went privatesch). Then he attended one of my college event. So we met up after the event. And we were back into a r/s.</p>
              <p>4 months later (Dec), he turned cold and so we broke up.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2. My JC BFF (Jenny)</span></p>
              <p>She was my best friend during these two years, till now.<br>And she knows Jonathan too, 'cause he often drop by my school to send me home.</p>
              <p><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3. And me, obviously</span></p>

              <p><strong>THE STORY:</strong></p>
              <p>Long story cut short.</p>
              <p>I just found out few weeks ago that since this Jan08. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Jenny was with Jonathan.</span><br>They'd been together for 8months already, and still is together.</p>
              <p>Let's see, Jon and me broke up during Dec. And they got together in January. What are the chances that he turned cold was NOT because of Jenny's existence?</p>
              <p>I'd asked her why she steals my guy, but she denies doing so. Both Jenny and Jonathan insist that they are just two singles getting together.</p>
              <p>She lied to me for so long. Yet, pretending to be my best friend for these 8 months.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'm terribly upset by her actions.<br>I don't understand how some people can be so selfish.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'd said I forgive her, though I refused to talk to her.<br>I'd even grant both of them happiness, but sometimes I regret what I'd said.<br>Sometimes, I still hate her.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Did I do the right thing? Should I not have forgiven her?</p>
