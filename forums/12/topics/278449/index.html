Have you mapped out your route after completing 'A' levels?<br><br>Your results are quite crappy now is it? You don't have to respond to this, but do ask yourself if it is because your results are crappy that you're telling yourself grades are of no major importance. Don't lie to yourself.<br>If scoring well was a walk in the park for you, would you still say grades are of no major importance?<br><br>Before you worry about the stress and expectations that come with excellence, worry about whether you can pull your grades up. It's like worrying about whether the press will hound you for an interview when you come in first in the marathon when you don't even have the stamina to complete the marathon.<br><br>Good grades are more than pretty alphabets on a piece of paper. They open up opportunities and widen the choices you are eligible for. Can you imagine next year you decide you want to be a vet, but your grades are just not good enough for you to be accepted for the course?<br><br>Ah just curious... were you one of the top few students back in primary/secondary school?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dude, I can empathize with your situation.<br><br>Are you one those overachievers or do you have them as peers or close friends?<br><br>Sometimes you study for your own sake. No one but you yourself can motivate thyself to get the grades.<br><br>People do view you through a tinted pair of glasses sometimes especially where results are concerned. My results are not really top-tiered but sufficient enough for my tutors to be concerned when I got 77% for chemistry.<br><br>To you, all I can offer you is to ask you to block out what others say. You study for what you want, for yourself. Everyone has the right to choose his/her own path. Others may judge your choice, criticise your results but ultimately it all boils down to you.<br><br>Ask yourself what you want and just heck care what the naysayers/critics say. You know yourself best. If in doubt, do not hesitate to seek advice from others but always know how to differentiate the useful advice from the seemingly-useful-but-in-reality-useless ones.<br><br>Chart your own course. Like you, I am an A level student. Does it matter what others say? I nearly burst out laughing at the look on my tutor's face when I told her I was not going to apply for overseas university. Yes, people do expect you to achieve certain things but who cares man? You achieve what you want, not what others want.<br><br>Sometimes I look at all the straight As and outstanding peers that I have. Of course I do admire them for having the ability to achieve what they have achieved thus far. I won't bother comparing myself with them because ultimately, my aim in life is different from theirs'.<br><br>Remember an application of Hess' Law in life (ok sorry but I am just tempted to quote this from my teacher). It doesn't matter what you go through. People judge you on what you achieve at the end of the day.<br><br>These are stressful times. Just block out the critics and naysayers if you know very well what you are doing.<br><br>I wish you well. PSLE results, O level results, test results, just chunk them aside. They are just merely the scenery on your journey towards a destination. Nothing should distract you from reaching that destination.<br><br>P.S. You can PM me if you need an outlet to vent your stress and frustration. After all everyone has to go through such a period of time.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Okay, there're several remarks i want to reply to. but since i'm still below 20 post (yes, I'm a clone. i dun want my sch to noe who i am), i'll have to reply all in this single post...but sadly, i think someone here already know who i am... ...<br><br>Firstly, my results now is not that good, but it's not crappy either. For the mid-year exams, I got into the honor roll. I was ranked 15 out of the entire school of 800 cohort. I got 3 B (history chemistry physics) and 2 D (math chinese...but to hell wif chinese, it doesn't affect uni admission)<br><br>So granted, I did not get straight As. Still, crappy results? I don't think so. (just being honest and unhumble)<br><br>Secondly, I am seriously (and really seriously) considering going to poly after my A'level, REGARDLESS of how well or bad I may do. I seriously considered applying for poly after my O'levels, but because JC is more 'prestigious' and people perceive it to be for the 'elites', I went in.<br><br>I wanted to drop out of JC after my J1 promos, but the teacher counsellor advised me not to because my results wasn't too bad. Note, I'm not blaming anyone. It's my own decision after all to stay on and move on to J2.<br><br>Third, I don't know about the future. But at least I'm sure now that my results does not bother me at this point of time, except for the fact that I have people's expectations to meet.<br><br>The fact that I chose JC because it's more 'prestigious' further proves the fact that I am someone who is very concerned about how other people look at me.<br><br>Which is why ever since I got into the honor roll, I find myself wanting to get better and better results. Not because I want a good future or even anything close to that. I don't even want to enter uni. I just study so hard because I want more of this 'prestige' and I want people to think that I'm good.<br><br>But the problem is that I find myself more and more lost. I'm studying for the wrong reasons. And I really do not find a good and valid reason on why I should keep on studying.<br><br>For a short period of time after my mid-year exam, I mug like never before. I wake up at 6a.m, sleep at 2a.m, just to study. And even though I'm really tired, I forced my butt to continue sitting on the chair, forced my eyes on my lecture notes. But recently, I realised that I have no reason to mug so hard at all. In fact, do I even want good results? No!<br><br>And so, even though the prelims is coming (day after tomorrow) and we have two weeks of study break...I hardly touched my book at all.<br><br>That is what I meant by 'sliding results'. Needless to say, my prelim results is going to be a far cry from my mid-year results. I'm sure my tutors and principal is going to make a lot of comment about this. Which is why I tell myself I should not be bothered by what other people think of me.<br><br>They can say I'm complacent. They can even say I'm proud (just because I nvr study). There's no reason for me to care.<br><br>Lastly, yes, the first post is written by me, and yes, it is also taken from somewhere else. I copied and paste it from my blog (hence the tone)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Before I say anything, I must say that your results are rather decent-looking to me. In fact, many people in my JC struggle to even get those grades, but that's besides the point anyway.<br><br>Seems like you are feeling lost as to why you decided to pursue JC education. Right now, you are torn between studying for a practical reason (honour, prestige etc) vs studying for an idealistic reason (gaining knowledge, improvement of oneself). This feeling is perhaps understandable given the current stress levels that you are facing. I know the stress because I am going through the same period of time as you.<br><br>You will have to view JC life like a 2.4km/long distance run. Right now, you are nearing your last lap. However, at this juncture, you start to wonder to yourself, why did you bother to start running in the first place? Why even bother putting yourself through the pain and anguish? What are you trying to run for? The honour of a NAPFA gold? The fastest timing? To shut those pesky PE teachers up (ok my PE teachers are good people but there are some pesky one)? To be fit and keep a healthy lifestyle? Why not just drop out of the run and cut short the agony? It's exactly the same, no matter whether it's a run or JC life.<br><br>You are merely getting disillusioned as things do not start to seem that favourable or enticing as they used to be. It is perfectly normal and perfectly understandable. Yet, I must caution you against letting such things distract you from something which you used to working so hard towards. Just like a run, you are now on your penultimate lap with only the last lap to go.<br><br>No matter what reason you study for, be it idealistic or pragmatic, most importantly you should not give up what you have achieved thus far. It doesn't matter whether you study for the honour, prestige, to shut people up, to please your parents or simply to increase your knowledge.<br><br>It doesn't matter.<br><br>Right now, you should be less concerned with the 'why' in your study and instead you should concentrate on tackling the 'how' in your study. Get your last lap over and done with and wonder "what was it all for?" after your A levels.<br><br>Seriously, your mid-year exam results are decent and some students will pay to have that kind of grades. Just whip yourself one last time and finish the whole thing. Perhaps, a few years on, you will be congratulating yourself for not having distracted yourself with your disillusion and neglecting what you have achieved up to that point.<br><br>Just grit your teeth through these last 2 months. It will be worth it, no matter what reason.<br><br>Cheer up and stop getting so stressed.<br><br>And most importantly, good luck for your prelims and As.</div>
