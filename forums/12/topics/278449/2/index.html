            <div class='col-md body'>i do agree that one of the reasons we study hard, is to meet with people's expectations. when i say people i mean your parents your tutors or whatever.<br><br>but what really happens is, higher expectations would be set for you each time you meet it. yes sure for a start meeting the expectations would be easy. and with all the praises you receive you feel good. but as time goes on, when these expectations gets higher, you tend to fear and hence creating stress for yourself thinking that you might not be able to fulfil the requirements for people's expectations.<br><br>i do agree with most of the replies about us living in a competitive world. its true afterall don't you agree? you may think that people like bill gates, toby maguire and others, made it big in the industry though they were school drop-outs. BUT as jojo said how often do you see dropouts making it big? maybe they had the talent.. do you?<br><br>people comment on you simply because they know what you're worth. they know your capabilities and are trying to help you along with it. there's also a difference between encouragement and putting you down.<br><br>for me i believe that everything comes with a reason. perhaps you just haven't found your reason to study. study to meet the expectations of others? study to get that cert? study for your future? study to impress? what? you decide. i used to always get fustrated with my parents nagging me to study and all. but i'm just simply plain lazy to study. now thinking back, i really regretted my past actions. i mean looking things from your parents POV, you spend so much money on your son send him to school to study, he comes home and play game and gets bad results at the end of the day, how do you think they feel? or perhaps if your children were to do this in the future how would you feel then?<br><br>i guess you should just intake whatever advises thrown to you and filter out the unnecessary ones. i believe you should be old enough to decide what's good and what's bad for you  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>unless you tell me you wanna convert to be a holy person and give up everything you have to walk the righteous way. if this is what you're thinking, i cannot help but will support you  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Good results can be important for many reasons. For some it can open the doors to their dream job.<br><br>There are people out there who possess great interest in becoming scientists, mathematicians, economists, bankers, doctors, lawyers etc. To get into these fields, they would require good results in the appropriate subjects. Even hairdressers, cooks, beauticians and insurance agents are required to pass exams and show results.<br><br>Sometimes, these people lack the necessary funding to reach their dream profession. Good results will help them obtain scholarships and awards.<br><br>Perhaps you find studying and scoring good grades meaningless now because you do not have a goal in life yet? I once faced the same problem and chose to neglect my grades. Now that i found my life's interest, I regret deeply because my poor 'A' levels grades severely hampered my chances to get into the profession i crave for.<br><br>It is a blessing to be able to earn a living doing the things one likes.

            <div class='col-md body'>If you have the opportunity to study, while many others dont, why not make the best use of it while you can. If you work hard, study smart, and learn well, there is very little chance for you not to get good grades. Employers often judge if you are a good work by your results. You dont need excellent scholarly kind of results, but you will at least have an easier time finding jobs with decent results. Recently I was choosing companies for my industrial attachments and I was pretty shock to realise that some of the higher paying companies require their interns to have excellent results as pre-requisite to apply. So probably what they meant by excellent results would be at least 2nd upper onwards.<br><br>Good results does not mean u will be a success in life, but it will smooth the path for you. The problem I have is more about ppl taking education for granted. There are millions of people around the world who have no means to an education, even for many in first world countries like USA. And down here in singapore, most people have the means to an education, and they dont treasure it. It's a shame really.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Getting good exam results is prestige? What an utter rubbish! If you can't attain good results, admit that you r not up to mark. Don't give silly excuses.<br>Meeting other people's expectations? Other than your parents, I don't think anyone can have any expectation of you. But whether your parents' expectations are too high is another issue. When it is your turn to become a parent, I wonder if your expectation of your children is for them to be failures in life!<br>Quit giving excuses. Buck up. Set your 'own' expectation that is achievable, exemplary and meaningful. Stop whinning and face the real world.</div>

The world is filled with cheaters who would lie about their abilities for monetary reasons. Certification is an efficient and low cost way to differentiate the real from the fake. It is too costly to engage people to do work without certification. (Certification can mean grades, professional certs, portfolios and resumes etc)<br><br>If you are really interested in music, start indulging in music related activities! Read about the history of music, learn about the great pianists that came before you, learn to compose and great your own scores, learn mathematical Set Music Theory. Have you taken your piano certification course? Thought of enrolling in music school?<br><br>If you do excel in these "academic" activities, you stand the chance of going to really good international music schools on scholarships and becoming an acclaimed pianist in the future. No, money won't fall in your lap. Yes, the journey will be tough.

Usually, students who didn't do so well in school end up taking up a teaching job in a primary/secondary/JC as a last resort. Yes, there might be some passionate ones.<br><br>Students who study very hard go to place likes Harvard and Princeton. They graduate with top honors and seek lucrative employment in high finance, law, consulting, medicine, research etc.<br><br>Last year, Goldman Sachs paid out an average of US$500k in bonus alone to its employees. Don't even think of entering if you didn't come from a top university. (if you think NUS and NTU are top uni, please do a search on "Ivy League" ) Boston and Mckinsley are top notch corporate finance consulting firms that won't even interview people who didn't top their university batch.<br><br>Do NOT end up like your JC tutors.

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, happiness does not depend on how much you study, how well you do.

Others simply just give up whatever they have, realising that their endless pursue to 'success' is the source of their misery, and just live peaceful life!<br><br>TS claimed to have studied till 2p.m, and wake up at 6a.m to study again. That's around 20 hours a day. If you have to give up 20 hours a day of your lives just to get 2 Bs, what price do you have to pay for straight As? And like others have said, in this competitive society, you can get nowhere without having straight As.<br><br>So what's the point?
