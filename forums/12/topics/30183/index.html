But tht poor ass may want to punish his dad for all the abuse, so he could take him to a remote island, crucify him, then remove his intestines with a screwdriver, then make his dad eat them. Then he can do stuff lyk make his dad drink battery acid or stick hot metal pokers up his ass, then leave his dad to die and his body to be eaten by vultures.</div>
