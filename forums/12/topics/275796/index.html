            <div class='col-md body'>Exams are coming next week and i haven't start studying, whole study week comes to a waste. Everytime i try to study i just can't concentrate, my confidence, aim or whatsoever seems to be all gone.. my mind keeps thinking of her, deluding in my one sided dreams, thinking she would accept me someday, and i would be able to change, change into someone who can talk more and be more outgoing.. and i tried.. but it all seems to be impossible even though i would really want to change and win her heart..<br><br>The whole week seemed to be used up pondering about her, thinking why had things come to such a stage for me. Had she not known that i have fallen in love with her, things would not be as complicated now, conversations would be more casual and friendly. At this period of time, i just feel like giving up on my semester examinations.. i look at the notes, and can understand nothing about it. Everything i do seems to coincide with the thought of her, i just cant stop thinking of her..<br><br>I came to poly having already wasted one whole year in jc, and i swear when i came in, i just wanted to well in school, maintain a gpa of at least 3.5 and move on to university in the future, i did not want to fall in love and make my school life  so stressed and complicated. Things are fine during the first few months, results aren't that bad and my new friends are rather nice too.. until there's this period of time where we went out to study, chat every night online. I wouldn't say that she's very beautiful, but i am just so attracted by her character, how nice she treats her friends, and how independent and intelligent she is.. gradually, i had feelings for her and thru some little things that i have done for her, i think she somehow found out  about it.<br><br>I had wanted to maintain a close friendship with her, be her close friend and be there with her when she needed help. But things were not as simple as it seems, we just can't seem to talk normally like before.. Everytime i try to talk to her, words just seem to get stuck in me, and all i can manage are one sentence conversations with her in school..<br><br>Time after time, i just couldnt concentrate in school, stoning during lectures and didnt even attempt my tutorials which i had been doin regularly before.. Looking at the notes now, i am just so lost. The exams are starting on monday but im just so not prepared.. Sorry for being so long winded.. just wanted to pour out my feelings  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>
