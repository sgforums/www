Over time, I hope you will be a better person with strong character.<br><br>1. 'easily fall in love'.....this is infatuation. It's common to everyone. Regardless of age. For teenager, it's loosely called BGR, crush, infatuation. For adults, it's loosely called love affair [!] ha...you are not alone.<br><br>We are all attracted by anything 'new', ''refreshing', 'interesting'....be it people or things - we are just curious by nature. However, it is also this same curiosity that trashed a relationship.<br><br>Be genuine and sincere when making friends. Grow your social circle and you will find the right match. It's too 'boring' to keep liking others and not 'liked' back.<br><br>How to find out what you like? Too bad...there's no short cut here except experiencing characters of different kinds and asking yourself what qualities you like best.<br><br>Next, you have to develop those qualities yourself so that others 'looking out' will find you attractive too : )<br><br>Unfortunately at this age, 'attractive' usually means cosmetic looks so learn to look beyond that. When I said 'look beyond', I do not mean neglecting your appearance. So continue to maintain a simple, clean, and hygienic appearance<br>and work on other qualities.<br><br>2. We all have ego. Learn how to deal with your pride and be humble and you will go a long way. The problem with most people is that we are not good with words and most of the time, insensitive in our expression...so just in case you are rejected...dun take it to heart. Learn how to improve your 'move' and character and not resort to 'not sms her' kinda thing. Be gracious cos there is no harm having another friend rather than another foe.<br><br>3. The fact that you can identify this little episode shows that you are a positive and mature person. So, read and evaluate what is said and apply appropriately.<br><br>Last note, there is only so much I can write, so learn to sort out your thoughts and enjoy the process...good luck!</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>I feel that you are more of having a crush on someone than falling in love. Do not rush into a relationship. Get to know the person better. Expand your circle of friends and mix around. Find someone who share similar interest or at least have some common understanding.<br><br>More importantly don't frighten her by being too bold and outright blunt. You are still very young, take your time. Be a gentlman, you probably attract gals in your own ways.<br><br>Good luck in your search.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

I feel emo too but i dun resort to hurting myself to ease my heart pain. Therefore, i am glad that u have sort out ur thought about this. Btw, i am 21 this year and i believe i have gone through what u have gone through and here are some insights that i have learnt over these past 21 years.<br><br>Alright, i know u fall for a girl easily due to ur urge for r/s but then TS, this is a SERIOUS NEED to surpress this urge. Why? Is simple because if u gonna have this urge, u will find that people label u as despo and even ostrasize u for it. This can result in further self-distress and undermining of your self-confidence.<br><br>As a guy, the fact that u cannot get a gf hurts ur pride (I have this feeling which i think maybe the same for u). As in y other can have so many while i cannot have even one. But TS, treat this as a form of test by God. What i mean here is, God wants u to know the significance of love before he presents u the right one.<br><br>Don't u think u will treasure something more if u fight for it?<br><br>So ur gf will be ur treasure and not just another girl in ur life. She is that somebody whom will care for u and u, in turn, must be a responsible and caring bf. Always remember love is mutual.<br><br>Therefore, my advices to u are to make yourself look better, read more self-improvement books to present urself better and finally "mound " yourself into a perfect lover so that u can give the BEST to ur destined one.<br><br>P.S. I'm still pessimistic about love but i know i will become optimistic one day. So TS, do heed the advices provided in AA so that u can find the "right" way to resolve this problem.
