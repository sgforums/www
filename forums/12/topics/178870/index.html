Men will always downmarry. their biological nature is such. Of course there are men who dont mind marrying a woman earning a hihger income and education, if she is a good wife and does not give problems.. The  point is women need to accomodate these men.

            <div class='col-md body'>seems men are becoming victims today dragging the women down along with them.

Some women will not admit they are choosy and wants to control in a r/s. Yes men have egos but when it comes to women their egos are manipulated by beautiful women or women that men consider beautiful.<br><br>Now my point is: it's not that women are mostly at fault. There are women like u who really are accomadating and supportive as a wife or a girlfriend. I hope there are more women like u so there's hope for men. Men also need to see what they have done wrong themselves.<br><br>Although feminist laws are such that women have much more power now and may have actually created more problems than intended, men still have power and will always have.</div>

It's got nothing to do with man/women or feminism/chauvinism, but how in our very competitive, material society, a person as an individual can have the freedom to be himself/herself without being swept away by societal's demands on norms, and AT the same time, without becoming a burden to society by still being able to contribute.<br><br>We live in a contradictory society that prizes technology, improvementsm, change and modernity above all, and yet view our past through rose tinted glasses and nostalgia. The relationships between men and women has changed because the relationships between men and society AND women and society has changed.<br><br>Stable relationships can be built with mature expectations (cos to expect NO expectations is a HUGE expectation), and romance can still flourish in a realistic down-to-earth environment.

            <div class='col-md body'>Really smart women will know that as long they respect their men, things will be fine. Of course men have to love and respect the women in their lives, and all women in general. It's got to be reciprocal.<br><br>The problem is that sometimes women carry their ego in the workplace back into their own homes and private lives. Same for men. When ego increases, humility and respect decreases. And all relationships (romance, parent-child, siblings, friendship) can't work without mutual respect.<br><br>The problem is PRIDE. When pride overrides love, then you have a problem.<br><br>So if men need to know three things as stated above, women need to know only one thing:<br><br>Respect the man. And you will be so much easier to love, and romance and understanding and all that will follow in tandem.<br><br>Men appreciate it when our women help to bring home the bacon also so we can build a comfortable home together. Whatever expectations you might have, we dearly want to fulfill them. Help us by being supportive.</div>
