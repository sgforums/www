            <div class='col-md body'>My dear friend, I COMPLETELY understand how you feel. TRUST ME, I REALLY DO, 100%. I myself face the exact same situation as you are in right now. You're not alone.<br><br>Before I was arrested, I had a great job. I'm on bail right now and although the police have not yet informed my company about my situation right now, I live everyday in fear one day I'll lose the job and subsequent embarrasment when it comes to a trial, which I believe there's a high chance. Up to now, I cannot concentrate in my work and even at home, I try to sleep early to forget all my troubles.<br><br>But let me tell you my friend, YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT, never mess with the law, because it can mess you up. I truly, completely, understand your feelings right now. The guilt, remorse, your future, and worse of all, the thought of how your parent/s are going to handle it if their dear child is sentenced to jail, no matter how long.<br><br>For me, I've now come to accept and prepare myself for the worse. I've told myself that if it really comes to jail term(max 3 yrs + 10k fine), I will accept it like a man AND COME OUT A BETTER ONE. That is my only consolence, by humbly accepting my punishment. Detached has never been more right; humans will only stand the true test of their own character when they're down under. Jail, so be it, there is nothing I can do but ACCEPT it. I have to.<br><br>My friend, you're not alone. You can talk to me if you want. I shocked myself when the thought of suicide crossed me. I thought again and concluded that compared to others who are terminally-ill, disabled, orphans, condemed criminals to hang or sentenced to life criminals, and others with ill fate befalling them, I cannot be more fortunate.<br><br>I'm not going to tell u to cheer up because I doubt you will, neither do I... but I hope you look at others who are less fortunate and remind yourself how blessed you have been, and probably will be after your release(if convicted). That's how I'm dealing with it...<br><br>My biggest worries are my parents. My dad is already super stressed with his financial problems, his business, my brother's business and my mum's health(she just went thru an operation, she's getting thinner by the week...my greatest worry). I do not wish to add to their burdens, yet I need the support from them right now for my case...  How pathetic can I get? I yearn to tell them not to feel depressed if I'm sentenced to jail because if it comes to that, I will readily accept it. But being their son, I know this is not possible; for them to accept my sentence. You probably see your mum cries at times but u know what? Behind you they're crying more. Although my parents keep telling me that worse come to worst I cannot but accept the punishment like a man, I know if given a choice they still won't bear to see me go to prison. They brought me to this world, fed, dressed, sheltered, educated me from day 1 to now, and this...? I have really brought them dissapointment and disgrace. That's one of my biggest regret.<br><br>Don't be too negative, just remember, your parents will always forgive you no matter what. I do feel for you too, as we are in the same boat.<br><br>PM me if you need someone who's in the same shoe to talk with, I'm all ears.</div>
