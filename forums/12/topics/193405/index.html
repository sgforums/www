            <div class='col-md body'>Yesterday night at 9pm, i got a sudden MSN msg from her. My ex. I was very surprise yet afraid. After 1 year + of no contacts after we broke up, she contacted me.<br><br>In the end, i was very sad and angry after this 4 mins of conversation. In the chat, she asked me not to initated any forms of contacts to her. She kept saying she hoped that we ceased all contacts from now on, she lives her life while i will live mine. She did apprec all the small gestures i did for her during the past mths. That's all. I even asked her why, till now..she say she do not need the concern. She also say, " so to just let you know, i will be deleting ur contact from now on" goodnites and she logged off, forever.<br><br>For the past few mths on impt events like her birthdays, exam periods and even..Val day, i msged her, gave her a card. I know that she will not reply but i just want to let her know of my concern to her. Later two months now, she MSN me. I am very angry by her way of doing things in the last time and now, she just intruded my life by clicking the mouse and made my life upside down again in just 4 mins. Can't she end this thing in a more humanly way or faster way..shd't she just cut me off 1 year ago. Why waited till now...<br><br>Btw, both of us are in early 20s..Love is really just an illusion. I am pretty upset yest, but now getting better. When i thought about what she say, i felt so pain in my heart. Yes, i will keep my words and shut her off from my mind now. But before penning of the world she and i together first..i know its silly.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>

I hesitated.. he appears everytime when I tell myself to move on and forget him.. after break up i always bump into him outside at the wrong time.. if it's a test from god, then i really fail the test everytime lor.. i cannot forget him, he's my first love.  Afterall, we shared so many happy times together and I would never be able to find someone who share so many common interest with me, a nice companion, someone who can talk about anything under the sun with me.

            <div class='col-md body'>basically, she wants to get on with her own life, without you "disturbing" her. She knows that your little gestures are your secret hidden intention of getting her back one day. But have you spare a thought for her current bf(if she has one now)?<br><br>You and her have broken up 1 year ago...As a friend, i think you can probably just sms her on her bday or something.. Dont do anything extra, which resulted in her getting irritated instead of being appreciative.<br><br>Find a new gf dude...<br>good luck! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
