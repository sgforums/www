            <div class='col-md body'>well since you cannot stand then sit lorz.. ahahahha~ Sorryz crappy today, coz just finish 3 papers of my finals... brain malfunction liaoz..<br><br>Well think only got 3 choices... see if your connection with other pple good or not see whether got lobang for some form of intro... if not then you stnad there for what?? go approach lahz.. see whether she wants to be be friends... exchange email or icq number... see whether she willing to reply or not.. then you know your answer liaoz... little bit little bit at a time lahz.. ask for number you'll scare her off immediately.. Last thing is sit there and wait for the to be snatched off by some other guy.. sorryz I know I'm kind of sarcastic, but since you like her, and you don't go up, you will realize it will only be too late if you delay...<br><br>Well, on the other hand, think you're afraid of being rejected right?? hehehe~ typical of guys.. well rejection is part and parcel of life.. Rejected?? so be it lorz.. after some time try again, then maybe the girl will be touched by your sincerity... feel sad, nevermind.. take it as a factor to boost your determination... of coz good strategy need to come slowly one like I said.. can't rush things... This is not a Hmong, where they have this culture of kidnapping the girl home, and rape her, then she's considered your wife... ahhaha~<br><br>Reject or regret.. slowly think and choose... think you should know the answer lahz lorz...<br><br>Sorryz.. sort of crappy and bonkus.. but there's some truth in what I said I guess, even it is in some kind of informal tone...<br><br>All the best in your courtship...<br><br>------------------<br>()""()     ************************<br>( 'o' )     Barely Bearing Berry Belly Bear<br>(,) (,)   =======================<br>(.)_(.)

If you r really persistent, try to know her friends and from there, ask them to introduce u to her, this is a very gd way...<br><br>------------------<br>Hope to b your frd forever, Mike signing off</div>

Wait, a lot people hunt you down and beat you to pulp.<br><br>Next time you see her, take a deep breath and go up and talk to her.  Not difficult, "Just open your mouth and say "Hi, weren't you from blah blah... secondary school?  My name is BPPhua, what's yours?".  After that just talk about school life, etc. how she's coping and don't sound like a geek, dork or desperado.  Behave yourself and keep your hands to yourself.<br><br>Then ask for her phone no.  If she gives it to you good.  If she doesn't, then too bad.  Take a deep breath, go home and cry if you must but at least you tried.<br><br>Just be yourself.  For all you know she has bad breath and digs her nose in public and it's a lucky thing you escaped.  Hahaha... don't laugh, I've seen girls dig their noses at bus-stops.  Really gross, though!</div>
