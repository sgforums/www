              <p>Dear All,</p>
              <p>Thanks all for the constructive input.</p>
              <p>Will try ways forumers have put in here.</p>
              <p>Nevertheless I have tried lubricants, fingering and making sure she is not dry before any penetrative intimacy.  Even got her to drink a bit of wine to relax herself and to set the mood right. Whenever we get to the penetrative part it just stop there.</p>
              <p>She complained pain and said my manhood is too big for her. I am Not boasting and I think I have the average asian chinese size. In the last round of intimacy a few mths ago, thinking subconsciously what she had said, i purposely squeezed 1/2 tube of lubricant on my manhood and her as well. Results was frustating unsuccssful again.</p>
              <p>Now I have lost all my mood to make any intimacy with her but i still love her and care for her. Nevertheless I will try once more.</p>
              <p>Thanks everyone for the input again.    </p>

              <p>If want to have childre, maybe you can release your sperm around her virginal area and let your sperm swim inwards to find the eggs..of course she needs to lift up her leg for a while...</p>

              <p>TS,</p>
              <p>In my opinion, it appears on the surface to be ''physical'' but belies the emotional disequilibrium and psychological stress.</p>
              <p>A doctor wont help except pile upon another layer of ''what to be and what not to be'' and try to have one fit - especially psychologically! However, one has to factor in this - she is an individual and unique.</p>
              <p>Some here suggested means and ways to indulge in ... and frankly it is dehumanizing the other lah. It is fine if your spouse is amenable to this ....</p>
              <p> trying is not wise cos it has conditions that has to be fulfilled before one loves or accepts or what have you.  Love heals and it embodies being compassionate and the ability to emphatize with another.</p>
              <p>Acceptance is freeing and let me reiterate that it <strong>presupposes</strong> that you are yourself accepting of what u are.</p>

              <p>It seems that she has no problem with wanting to have sex, up to that point.</p>
              <p>So it could be what works with the other three ex, do not work with this time.  Instead of the de rigueur foreplay and the eagerness for penetration, TS should just play and have fun on bed, tickle, joke, laugh, caress, cause her <em>neow neow,</em>  slowly see how far she is willing to go. Caressing her neck, causing goose pimples, sucking her inner thighs near the knees and see how she screams, and how much she can take. Just play and have fun. Trying finger first, if she allows. Hint, if a baby's head can come out of the vagina, a dickhead is nothing.</p>
              <p>If she amenable all along, part the labia and place the dickhead there. Just place it there, no penetration. See how it goes. If fear hits, stop. If not, see how far it can go.</p>
              <p>If after a few attempts, its still no go beyond that point, then its time to see the doctor.</p>
              <p>Both need to see a doctor.</p>
              <p>A GP or a shrink.</p>
              <p>But she will not accept that suggestion from her husband. The moment the husband broach the subject, = quarrel.</p>
              <p>So it must be someone else she also respects, like a good friend, or a counselor (religious or social).</p>
              <p>The problem then will be that of letting a personal matter get out. She may resent that.</p>
              <p>Then that guy has a problem.</p>

              <p>JLimV did like everything. He restrain from sexual relations before he married his gf even though he had sex with his previous gfs. Can anyone do that easily? If i had sex with my previous gf, my normal reaction is i probably would feel unhappy if my current gf don't let me have sex with her. After<strong> 9 months</strong> and a honeymoon at a romantic resort beach hotel. Still rejected. Ask her to see a doctor. Made a big fuss and had an tiff over it several times. I was just saying if i were JLimV and did all this, isn't all this extra effort. If i did all these <strong>extra effort </strong>and nothing came out of it. And i can't solve it because my wife is not uncooperative, do i go on in this marriage being frustrated? People have needs and wants leh. you keep on getting rejected of all people your wife, who is supposed to be the closest to you. How can you take it for long man.

              <p>Why you're so work out if the marriage is consummate or not ......and finding excuse to annulment the marriage because of SEX?    If TS is a Catholics than the Vow Read before GOD....would be enough to stay married with or without SEX.</p>
              <p>You seemed to gear towards the seperation of the relationship and avoid the FACT Finding<strong>.</strong>  </p>
              <p>i am asking TS to "deepen" the relationship with his Wife....I mean How perfect is TS? Who know TS might have Early Ejeculation problems. nobody is perfect. So why Jump into seperation because of 9 months of unsuccessful SEX.</p>
