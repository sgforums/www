              <p>The first time is ALWAYS painful, it's like someone rip your <strong>skin</strong> apart with their bare hands ( except it's with a blunt dick) pushing through the skin untill it breaks from pressure.</p>
              <p>If you ask ANY girl who had sex before, their first time is NEVER memorable.</p>
              <p>In fact, every girl wants to FORGET their first experience because it was so CRAPPY, PAINFUL and AWKWARD.</p>

              <p>Doesnt seem like TS is the uncaring or impatient type. . At least from what he said, doesnt seem so. I hope like what you said thats the reason of the fuss and not because of other childish reasons. Lets hope this fuss dont last too long and they can go see a doct and find out whats wrong.</p>

              <p>I guess it pointless to keep speculating because we don't know if TS really has an early ejaculation problem or what is the reason for his wife not wanting to go to the doctor. I just feel that for all the effort he put in. His wife is behaving like she is not his wife. And now he is going for another vacation again. Not many wife can go on so many vacation so often you know. He could have just bought something he wanted but he chose to spend it on a vacation with his wife. He tried so hard and waited so long. It is easy to ask other people to keep trying. Doing it yourself is another thing. I put myself into his shoes and there is a limit to how much you can take. I guess he probably will get numerous bad responses from his wife again. Let wait and hope for the best.</p>

              <p>I guess it pointless to keep speculating because we don't know if TS really has an early ejaculation problem or what is the reason for his wife not wanting to go to the doctor. I just feel that for all the effort he put in. His wife is behaving like she is not his wife. And now he is going for another vacation again. Not many wife can go on so many vacation so often you know. He could have just bought something he wanted but he chose to spend it on a vacation with his wife. He tried so hard and waited so long. It is easy to ask other people to keep trying. Doing it yourself is another thing. I put myself into his shoes and there is a limit to how much you can take. I guess he probably will get numerous bad responses from his wife again. Let wait and hope for the best.</p>
