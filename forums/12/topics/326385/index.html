              Im here to vent my anger on what happened to me during PE today.<br><br>I did not have a good sleep last night, prob cuz i slept late, which was further aggravated by the fact that my air con couldnt bring the temperature of my room down to the desirable one.<br><br>Thus, this resulted in my very obvious black rings around my already-small-enough eyes, making me look like the approaching olympic icons - the pandas.<br><br>Knowing my own stamina, I requested to let me off after i completed my 8 rounds for me to have ample rest as im feeling really unwell. However, Mr xxx doesnt empathize with the amount of stress this school is giving in mentally, physically and academically. Not only do we have to complete 8 rounds (in fact i did 9 cuz he caught me walking for a period), we still had to do 150 jumps with the skipping rope, 30 sit- ups and 20 dips.<br>To people who are physcially fit and not as massive in size as us, it may seem no kick to you.<br>But put yourself in our shoes. we are fat, we landed in "FUN" club, we are labelled as physically <em>less inclined</em> then our peers. so why do you expect so much for us?<br><br>Nonetheless, I COMPLETED EVERYTHING, depite sleeping only like 2 hours last night.<br>Can't you understand the tiredness in me?<br><br>Next, he started"lecturing" (both meanings) on our diet, how we should eat our food, encouraging us not to believe in slimming pills etc. He also made several false assumptions that it's cuz we "fat" people did not control our diet. we eat and eat and did not exercise.<br>HELLO???????????????????????? you lucky if you are born thin then. pls do not discriminate us "fat" people.<br><strong>WE ARE HUMANS TOO. WE HAVE OUR RIGHTS TOO. WE FEEL TIRED MORE FREQUENTLY THEN YOU DO.</strong><br><br>Feeling very tired, i shut my eyes as the weight of my eyelid is greater in magnitude then the force exerted by my eyelid muscles to keep it open.<br>at that moment, gravitational force is really strong, i guess around 20ms-2.<br>I was abruptly awoken by Mr xxx, who then used several sarcastic remarks on me.<br>Nevertheless, i ignored and try to look somewhere else.<br>As i was <strong>REALLY TIRED</strong>, i closed my eyes again.<br>This time he scolded me, asked me to stand up and forced me not to close my eyes <strong>AT ALL</strong>.<br><br>HELLO? don't you know this is reflex action that we will blink our eyes?<br>yet, you claimed you are a JC student.<br>even if you are from some punggol JC your intelligence wouldnt be that low, near to autistic children. (even they know they cant force themselves not to blink).<br><br>I was so tired that i cried.<br>i really cried.<br>i <strong>WAILED.</strong><br>I knew my life ended ever since im posted to AJC. just as i was having some positive thoughts, it always seem to prove me wrong again. (like the few incidents before).<br><br>I was held back for 30min of reprimand by this unreasonable teacher.<br>but what can i do?<br>i cried.<br>i was really glad that xinyi from 06 stayed by me to give me encouraging words.<br>she is really a nice person, yet i don't understand why the guys in our school would laugh at her presence, which is really mean.<br><br>i told this to my parents.<br>oh well. im seriously apologetic of my attitude towards them.<br>not only did tears flow profusely down me already-red-plus-swollen eyes, im in such a bad mood that i hurled abuses and sarcastic remarks at them. which i know, i shouldn't.<br><br>life really ended, ever since i land into ajc.<br>i also wonder; <strong>wouldnt my life be better somewhere else?</strong><br></div>

              <p>What was the reason your friend slept late the night before? Was it because of heavy load of homework? If yes then your friend should explain to the teacher. But if it was due to his or her own personal like gaming/msn/surfing last night then your friend deserve to be reprimanded. Your friend jolly well know there would be school the next day yet instead of sleeping early so to be fresh and alert to be ready for class your friend chose to do personal things and go to bed late. So, whose fault?</p>
              <p>Bear in mind your friend are in school and in class having a lessson. He or she is not in her or his home relaxing leisurely. That means your friend need to adhere to the school rules and regulation. If every student claimed the night before 'boh ngau kun' and everybody started napping in class how would you think it will make the teacher on duty look like? An irresponsible clout that can be easily bullied by the students iizzit? And why should the teacher give your friend any special preference over others to close his or her eyes? Teacher's pet ah? What would the other students think. It will create resentment and dissatisfaction only.</p>
              <p>So, please hor, tell your friend (maybe you actually<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="icon_twisted.gif">) that as long he or she attend classes make sure to be alert regardless of what time he or she sleep unless SICK!</p>
              <p>Anyway the teacher has no right to belittle overweight people especially teens as I know it does hurt the feelings. If the teacher do that again can always complain to the head of the school mah. Make sure tape down hor.</p>
              <p>Acutally I don't agree to this type of special class just to cater for 'overweight' students. It can do more harm than good psychologically. It makes them like an unwanted bunch. Poor fat kids. This one my heart goes out to your friend. School should abolished this kind of stupid and pride demeaning classes.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="icon_evil.gif"></p>

              <p>I see no evidence in the original post of the blogger's gender. Are people here just quick to assume and soothe their own inferiority complex by putting down someone whom we've never met in our entire lives over his or her blog entry? Seems that way.</p>
              <p>And whats with saying "that guy must be gay"? IF you're stupid enough to not know that sexuality does not decide your personality traits, then you shouldn't be allowed access to a computer. So well done, all of you who assumed, I bet you feel so good about your pathetic lives now.</p>

              <p>regardless the gender, gay or gal, gay or lesbian... it is not a positive action to put the student down in front of the whole class... in fact, <a href="http://sgforums.com/users/243046">R3D3V1L</a> is right to point out that this action is from a bully.</p>
              <p>write a letter,  pretending it's from your dad to the principal and teacher... or rather, don't pretend, tell your dad you are writing a letter ON his behalf to the school and we'll see where it leads to... ask for an explaination why you were berated for closing your eyes and humilated in front of the whole class.</p>
              <p>you may want to include that if no satisfactory answer been given, this will go to higher authorities like MOE?</p>
