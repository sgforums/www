              <p> I was wondering why people were so sure blogger is a guy. Totally wondering if I missed something somewhere that said it's a guy. Guess everyone else is so busy playing the "I'm superior to the blogger" card that they failed to asscertain even the most basic of facts. ^^</p>

              <p>if you are a teacher in that school, i suppose you will allow all your students to sleep in your lessons?</p>
              <p>so is that what you are trying to say?</p>
              <p>self-righteous?</p>
              <p>from the way i see your nick, i am puking</p>
              <p>have you ever even think of why they are tired? there are millions of things that they can do before they go to bed</p>
              <p>and did they type that down? maybe yes, maybe no</p>
              <p>i already said that, humans can make choices by themselves</p>
              <p>from the way she is dozing in class, she is deliberately CHOOSING IT, she fucking chose to take forty winks</p>
              <p>and also, you have only fucking seen her part of the story</p>
              <p>you didn't even heard or seen the teacher's part of the story, and you want to talk back to me?</p>
              <p>she closed her eyes, for how long? do you know? do you fucking know?</p>
              <p>analyse the case, think in her shoes, think in the teacher's shoes, then type back</p>
              <p>learn to utilize your brains, please, don't be so straightforward, like some spoonfed baby, like some brainwashed pawn</p>
              <p>lastly, even if you had flamed me, what difference would that make? that girl will surf to this page and feel gratitide for you siding her?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>as for that female blogger, my advice to you is, tired cannot take MC? tired cannot sleep earlier?</p>

              <p>Actually hor, although we can say like that, we must still realise that everyone's physical capabilities are different.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I can also say that I done my JC1 with 4 CCAs, and JC2 with 3 CCAs, travel from east to west to school every morning, take part in competitions, and still have time to do well enough for my A levels =&gt; no reasons why others should complain that they don't have enough time when they live nearer to school and has less CCAs.</p>
              <p>I have said before... I am with the mentality that if people can do it, so can I. But there's differences; time and effort. Some people might need more time or effort to achieve the same thing.</p>
              <p>We should always stand in the shoes of others and think/evaluate from their viewpoints.</p>

              <p>I have said before... I am with the mentality that if people can do it, so can I. But there's differences; time and effort. Some people might need more time or effort to achieve the same thing.</p>
              <p>We should always stand in the shoes of others and think/evaluate from their viewpoints.</p>

              <p><br>Not true la. Some abilities people are born with, some people are born without. Thats the reason why some people can be the best at what they do without trying while others try so hard and have a good positive mindset, and make all the right decisions and still can't do it.</p>
              <p>Some things are simply within the domain of a few select few who are lucky and are from the deep end of the gene pool. Other people, no matter how much time and effort they put in, can never achieve the same thing.</p>
              <p>And yes, we should always stand in the shoes of others and think/evaluate from their view points. Thats why I feel that it's so distasteful that all these people come here in petty glee and throw their worthless 2 cents about how "useless" the blog author is. It's like, where is your humanity, empathy and compassion? They are obviously lacking it, and I do not hesitate to give them a taste of their own medicine. Unsurprisingly, they can dish it out but they can't take it.</p>
              <p>I'm glad there are people like you who can show more empathy towards others whose physical abilities might not be up to you own.</p>
