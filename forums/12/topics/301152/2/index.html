            <div class='col-md body'>First of all TS, you got to ask yourself this:<br>1) Do you give her any sense of security?<br>2) Do you make her feel that you are the one for her instead of her current BF?<br><br>Feeling love, no matter how strong it is for the other party sometimes is quite futile as only u know. Did you express it to her? And also action speaks louder than words, You must do something for her to answer the above 2 questions as a "yes". What a lady needs sometime is more than love as love doesn't bring the dough home. Not only to support her emotionally but also able to help her and point her in the right directions when she needed help most.<br><br>I got a feeling that you were not chosen because she went through alot with her current BF and he had been there helping her. He's a better choice because he may be able to give her a sense of security and a future.<br><br>You may wanna find out more. Go talk to her. Lamenting, feeling helpless, sorrow and all those do not solve problems.</div>

Did you express it to her? And also action speaks louder than words, You must do something for her to answer the above 2 questions as a "yes". What a lady needs sometime is more than love as love doesn't bring the dough home. Not only to support her emotionally but also able to help her and point her in the right directions when she needed help most.<br><br>I got a feeling that you were not chosen because she went through alot with her current BF and he had been there helping her. He's a better choice because he may be able to give her a sense of security and a future.<br><br>You may wanna find out more. Go talk to her. Lamenting, feeling helpless, sorrow and all those do not solve problems.</div></blockquote>yeah i think her bf gave her no.1, but i give her no.2..</div>
