Then when you do realise the importance of self-love, could you extend this feeling to another person in a form of a friendship. Only if you planted seeds of friendship into her and lead them, before an option of a love relationship could sprout.<br><br><strong>Don't talk about love</strong> - talk about how much you understand her as a friend because if you don't, then how far do you think you can go? Train yourself and treat her like anyone you would normally treat. This reduce psychological barrier between you and her. Chat normally, avoid acting weird and drop all motes of uncomfortability around her. Learn to project good self image and posture. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>P.S: Your first task is to understand her. She doesn't need love from you - at least not at this stage. Your flaws isn't because you came from a boy's school (I was once from one as well), because you lack the confidence and feared to experiment. Don't worry, things will pick up. Work on your personalilty - Everybody and everywhere welcomes a good personality and a good heart.<br>Cheers</div>
