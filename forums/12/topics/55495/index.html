            <div class='col-md body'>It is good that you know she will be replaced by another girl in the future. So basically, you know that the main solution is time. How long? Up to you.<br><br>This jealousy feeling of yours is normal. Cause you are still very much in love with you. Or should I say, you still can't let go of her. But there is one thing you have to know, she no longer bears any feeling for you. This is the cold hard truth. Sorry mate, you just have to accept. The fact that she has found herself another guy, and is very happy with him says all.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Firstly, you have to accept the fact. Know that she no longer likes you. And for this very moment, no matter what you do, she is just not going to go back to you. Anything else, she will probably find you irritating and it may worsen any possible happenings in the future. That is if there is any...<br><br>You have to leave her alone now, if you have to listen to her, know what and how she is doing, drop her a few sms over a few days. Let's say, maybe once or twice a week?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Secondly, avoid trying to know too much about her life right now. Avoid asking questions about her and her new guy. In short, just try to avoid her. Try not to go back to the usual haunts that you and her been to, and avoid doing things that can possibly remind you of her. Discard everything and anything she gave you. If you can't bear to throw them away, gather them in a box and keep it out of your sight.<br><br>Whenever you know she is going to take over your mind again, stop yourself. Tell yourself that she is happy right now, with another guy. She no longer needs you. Everything she once said to you, once did with you is already history.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow">Treat this as a lesson in your life. Like you said, you are going into the army soon. Don't take this burden into it. Take this as an opportunity to learn more things, make new friends, and reflect on yourself. Tell yourself what have you gain, and what have you lost. Reflect on your weaknesses and try to improve them. Make yourself a better man that you, yourself can be proud of.<br><br>So relax man. I know it's always the same thing that everyone have told you, but it's really time. Do not bear false hopes that she may return to you, in the near future or whatsoever, cause all these, are merely illusions.<br><br>Let nature takes its course, take things in your stride. Actually, if you can... chop off all ties with her. What's yours will be yours, what's not will never be. Leave everything to fate man.<br></div>

Leave everything to fate man.<br></div></blockquote>I really appreciate what you've said, and they all really do make sense.<br><br>I haven't called her in weeks, and I'm sure u know, its an uphill task every time I had the urge to call. I did sms once awhile. We do keep in contact, that's only thru ICQ.<br><br>But the problem is I haven't got many people whom I could talk to about these, and I'm living alone, so basically its tough to keep everything inside me. So I blog everyday, and she'll go take a look whenever she's free. The things I typed on my blog, are my true feelings, like "I can't let go.." "Wish she'll be back" all those, because I don't want to blog all those that aren't from my heart. And she'll leave me bombshells most of the time on ICQ, quoting my sentences, then applying her harsh words. Its really not helping me at all, and the whole time she keeps saying "I don't want to give u false hope that I'm coming back, I'm sorry to make u cry again". It just doesn't make any sense. Everytime she did this I had to pick myself up all over again.<br><br>We practially roamed the entire town area, so in the beginning it was difficult for me.. those memories kept flooding my mind when I was in town either by myself or with my friends, and those memories that came, really changed my mood instantly. But I kept myself composed. Now I'm getting better, w/o thinking of her so much, and yea, I kept the stuff she gave me into a box, cept for the stuff toy which is still on my bed. Maybe I'm jealous, maybe I'm envious, maybe I still worry for her. But yea, all these gotta stop, sometime. How long, I don't know as well.<br><br>Thanks for your comforting words.. I'll rem them. God bless you, kind soul  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yea, like sort of like deja vu... I don't know how to explain. Its painful to be in this state, but at the same time, I CHOOSE to be like this. Probably she never spoke nicely to me about this breakup, instead she lied here and there, thus I don't know whichever she said was real, which wasn't. This could be the reason why I'm holding on to the thin piece of thread, the hope that I'll manage to get her back. I mean, after all that I've tried to convince her, she wouldn't budge, furthermore she got so quickly. Was telling myself "Maybe she don't have a bf" "Maybe she's just punishing me for a little while". But then, these few days, I'm beginning to return to reality, so those little hopes aren't valid anymore, thus my mood since day 1 was like ________/Â¯\____.<br><br>I don't know already what I'm trying to say. Am so disillusioned, so tortured, so worn out.</div>
