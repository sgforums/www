My doc has asked me to relate this so many times. Anywayz:<br><br>1st and only gf and me was nice and mushy etc, moved to SG while she remained in Indonesia, years later met up again and got together, only she changed, became kinda nazish, maybe she was always like that but i didn't know, she hung out with nazish friends, white supremist.

I never knew about tis, i found out the hard way.<br><br>According to my shrink doc, this failed rs has led to me developing some kind of inferiority complex and introversion. Now i more uneasy about interracial relationships. so now i want someone who will accept me as a friend and possibly more than a friend, but its very hard to find such people. Apparently i am now oversensitive about my ethnicity and all because of that rs.</div>

But still, you probably can CHOOSE to live a life the way you want to... If it's not too much you're asking for... Though it might not be easy.. But probably not impossible...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

I don't believe in discarding a partner when she's in sh|t... Unless circumstances really don't allow us to be together?<br><br>Though I know that alot of people would say they should 'choose' to let go of their past.. But it's never really an easy process... Just as much as I would often ask people to 'get out of it'... Choice.. At least a start... Often is only the beginning... That's when 'effects' of the relationship comes in... In a healthy relationship, the other party should be able to at least to a certain extent... Console or smoothen his / her partner...<br><br>Well.. At least that's what I would believe?</div>
