This is not a legal advice! They are entirely based on my personal and not professional experience &amp; knowledge; it is still your responsibility to research the authencity of my statements!<br><br>Get the details of the other driver. Call up your insurance company, they'll advise you to send in your car for inspection of damage.<br><br>Your insurance company will proceed with the claims, and inform you about what to do accordingly. Usually this will happen within the day or 2nd.<br><br>If it was a hit and run, you need to at least have the *correct* number plate. Go to your nearest police post, and make a police report. You will also need to state that you would like the police to charge him with criminal actions. The police will then advise you if they will charge him. If not, they may or may not advise you if it is plausible to bring legal proceedings towards him in your personal capacity (ie: sue him), but ultimately you will need to find your own lawyer to advise you on this.<br><br>It takes about a week for them to track down the dude, and they will then send you a courtesy letter regarding what they have charged him with. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Ok, all that out of the way, so exactly what happened??<br><br>Edit: This is not a legal advice!</div>

What took them so long to inform us?  6 hours!  Damn them!  My mum cooked hor fun and waited for dad to come home..coz he said he want to eat that..  But he never return... She couldn't takle the blow..First time in my 20 years, I saw my mum cry out loud.  She kept saying that he wanted to eat Hor Fun.. he left with an empty stomach.<br><br>And yet, the hospital and traffic police staff did not want to let us see the body, claiming that we should be there within 2 hours after his death.  Come on, we were informed only 3 hours later after he was pronounced dead.  Who wants to see a dead body when we could have actually seen his last before he was pronounced dead.  i read the medical report.. I know the pain my dad was going thru.  He was struggling and in great pain.  If we were there with him for the 3 hours when he was alive, perhaps he might live.  We couldn't make it there...he went thru all that alone.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>What were they doing?  I wana know.  6 hours?  It's not a joke man!  If the one lying there was their father, they would be as annoyed as me.  My sis called up the officer in charge and he said he could not help us.  But we actually found out from the hospital that as long as an officer is around, we could see the body.  So my sis confronted him over the phone.  Insisted that he give us his identification number etc.  And you know what?  He gave us a false name.  We only know some time after the funeral.<br><br>I'm NOT pointing my finger at the driver, coz we still duno whose fault was that.  We will only know on the day of the hearing.  But I duno whether they will defend the driver, coz he's a Malaysian.  I'm angry with those people involved, for not informing us, for not helping us, for pushing responsibilities when what we wanted was just to see his body!  We waited and waited.. Sis and her frens fought for it..then we could see the body after 12am.  We waited around 2 hours.  The investigating officer told my sis that that officer in charge is a junior, and under such circumstances, he surely defend himself.  So what?  he's at fault and yet he still got the cheek to push responsibility and gave us false information?  Sept 5, we'll see them in court.<br><br>Feow Feow, thank u for comforting me.  But I cannot forgive them.<br><br>bbb</span></div>

Who wants to see a dead body when we could have actually seen his last before he was pronounced dead.  i read the medical report.. I know the pain my dad was going thru.  He was struggling and in great pain.  If we were there with him for the 3 hours when he was alive, perhaps he might live.  We couldn't make it there...he went thru all that alone.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>What were they doing?  I wana know.  6 hours?  It's not a joke man!  If the one lying there was their father, they would be as annoyed as me.  My sis called up the officer in charge and he said he could not help us.  But we actually found out from the hospital that as long as an officer is around, we could see the body.  So my sis confronted him over the phone.  Insisted that he give us his identification number etc.  And you know what?  He gave us a false name.  We only know some time after the funeral.<br><br>I'm NOT pointing my finger at the driver, coz we still duno whose fault was that.  We will only know on the day of the hearing.  But I duno whether they will defend the driver, coz he's a Malaysian.  I'm angry with those people involved, for not informing us, for not helping us, for pushing responsibilities when what we wanted was just to see his body!  We waited and waited.. Sis and her frens fought for it..then we could see the body after 12am.  We waited around 2 hours.  The investigating officer told my sis that that officer in charge is a junior, and under such circumstances, he surely defend himself.  So what?  he's at fault and yet he still got the cheek to push responsibility and gave us false information?  Sept 5, we'll see them in court.<br><br>Feow Feow, thank u for comforting me.  But I cannot forgive them.<br><br>bbb</span></div></blockquote>Though I'm not speaking of all policeman, but yup... There're certainly SOME VERY IRRESPONSIBLE POLICEMAN around... I've personally came across a couple... They can just stand around with their arms folded while the other party is breaking the law before their very eyes, then they turn to you and ask you to 'settle this' yourself... And often, their superiors would just defend them if they maintain a relatively good rapport with them... Afterall, the superiors would still need their men to work for them....</div>

Draft a formal complaint letter to the Head of Investigations Traffic Police, and list down in chronological order what happened.
