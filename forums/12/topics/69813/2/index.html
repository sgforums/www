I'm not saying that she is rite ... just saying that it's a habit already. Infact i despise girls who wanna just live off their BF, let alone a friend ... but, you can always not allow it anymore ... if you realise that she does not wanna go out with you in future just coz she had to pay on her own,  then isn't it obvious enough that she is only after the attention and free entertainment ?? I would say, stay off such girls ....<br>Inversely, since this guy is a student and the girl is drawing a regular income, shouldn't she offer to PAY ??? I know I would....</div>
