I mean, yea you can get attracted to someone at the first sight, but love is something that takes time to grow. It will only come when you know someone better, knows of his/her better side as well as his flaws, and dun tell me oh he/she is oh so perfect, every human being does have their own imperfections, otherwise they are not human. And yea, I do think sometimes the word love is used too loosely as well, that is why I tried to not use it in my post, I used like most of the time because I am not sure I have really known the guy yet. But yea, a relationship can be based on like at first, it will slowly from friendship towards something deeper, and of more physical nature  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>just a tot...<br><br>i.c.y</div>

" two billion times.. Then she said..oh yeah we went ring shopping together. So why did she flip out if (fill in my boy's name) asked her to go ring shopping with her? That is so ridiculous.. we think that she flipped cos she so wants to be asked by her boyfriend .. or rather defacto. ahhahha.... awww well.</div>

But when you talk about 'like', there'll usually be a certain amount of 'love' involved... 'Like' is like a form of potential energy for 'love'... It would have to depends on the situation...<br><br><strong><br>I read somewhere that love is "taking away the hugs, the physical contact, the sweet nothings you whisper to each other, etc" and you still love that person a lot.</strong><br><br>Maybe? There're always alot of ways in which you can 'define' love... On the other hand.. Those who cannot tolerate the request for not hugging his / her partner; or physical contact; or being asked not to whisper sweet things... Are you SURE they ain't experiencing LOVE <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"><br><br><strong><br>In that case i'm sure a lot of relationships are not love-based.</strong><br><br>Weak is the mind of many humans.. As far as a 'definition' for love might seemingly stands true.. It doesn't necessarily means that the opposite is not true... There're many types of 'love' around, and those 'definitions' you've come across just happens to be describing some of them... If I look at my father and say.. "Father is old, mature and has grey hairs...' Does that mean that those without grey hair, ain't mature and old can't be a father?<br><br><strong><br>And can like, turn to love?</strong><br><br>Yes... Obviously...<br><br></blockquote></div>
