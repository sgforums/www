I wish to settle e matter quick because I donÂ’t wan it to affect my studies.. I'm taking my O's this year n this problem has been troubling me for a long time..<br><br>I have two close friends whom I get to know them in sec 1 [letÂ’s call them A and M].. Both of them live in e same block while I live further from them.. Living in e same block, e both of them r naturally closer.. When we r in sec 1 n 2, we often hang out together.. But when it comes to sec 3, they often went out without me.. E places they go to is either e shopping mall near our house or to M's sister's bf's house.. They went there to play with her sis's bf's brother[call him Y] who is in sec 2 now.. IÂ’ve met him once[a few months ago] but we din talk much that time.. On that day, we [ me, M, Y and Y's friends] went to watch a movie together.. After that, Y invited us to his house.. M went but I did not as it as too late..<br><br>(p.s: me n M are in e same class.. A is in another class)<br><br>I feel that it was A who do not want me to go.. Sometimes, she would pick on me particularly and often hit me deliberately..<br><br>A few months ago, I talked to M.. She is more understanding n considerate.. E matter is about her neglecting me for another friend[X].. But it is solved now.. I told her that she does not treat me as her best friend but she said she did.. Etc etc..<br><br>However... ...<br><br>After school today, we went to e shopping mall with X.. At around 2pm, M and A went home.. But at 3pm, I called A and asked her if she wanted to come out again.. But she lied to me that she is going out with her pri school friend.. But we even intended to go out e whole day today.. Y would she meet her friend?? Besides, she sounds rather frightened.. After that, I called M and she is not at home.. She said she wanted to go home to sleep.. But it turns out otherwise.. I went to their house and no one is at home.. Obviously.. She lied to me..<br><br>I feel that our friendship is not very true.. They hide lots of things from me although they claimed that they treated me as a best friend too.. I do not wish to spoil this friendship.. But I donÂ’t want this kind of treatment anymore..<br><br>What should I do??</span></div></blockquote>it means you are not really true friends. true friends do not hide things from each other.just because you used to play together or whatever doesnt mean you are true friends. maybe you should talk to them about hiding things from you, be firm when talking about it and dont be afraid to "spoil the friendship". because if there is no trust there isnt friendship in the first place. also, there are true friends in life, you will know it when you find them  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>oh and btw, reading your post is like reading some complicated algebra matrix and mathematical sets!!!!

            <div class='col-md body'>In any friendship, there must also be intimacy. Perhaps it's the way you talked to your friend about the way they neglected you? Perhaps the way you put your words?<br><br>Anyway, in life, we always move on and change is the constance in life. We never stop changing friends. The thing abt having friends is that you can be able to love them as they are and in return their love for you.<br>Not only that, it's rather important that at your age right now, you'll need friends who can stretch you, challenge your mentality and help you grow in maturity. As the saying goes, you can never soar like an eagle if you hang around with turkeys.<br><br>Brace up! It's never too late to change your friends. Although you may tressure your current friendships, let it be bygones and move on. In fact, it's better if you move on, coz if you stay where you are, you'll fall back. Advance my friend!<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
