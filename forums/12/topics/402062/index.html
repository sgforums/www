              <p>I think you are taking lust to be too serious. Like a sickness. If you love someone, you need to have the basic lust. Therefore they can coexist. And love is unquantifiable and subjective. It comes down to what you believe.</p>

              <p>Fugazzi,it may not be the case whereby one looks for appearances
              and such to meet one's ends.....to me,it might seem tat u
              appreciate that certain someone with good looks and these
              factors(good looks,hot body ,etc...) might act as a catalyst to let
              urself make the first move...</p>

              <p> I cannot make you wrong nor can i make u rite. Life is a flux n it is not cast in stone! That is being un-nice. I merely offered views and opinions. If it does not resonate of u or with u lump it.</p>
