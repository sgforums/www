              <p>U married a bloody srilankan from a 3rd world country? WTH?</p>
              <p>And he lives in Africa? Another 3rd world country.??!!</p>
              <p> From what i know of is they were former rebel LTTE group members who escaped to Australia and other countries. This is the reason why he keeps talking about being arrested ?</p>
              <p>SG gals arent that dumb. never marry a sri lankan, china national or any other foreigner without verifying his credentials</p>

              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Just read below lah, better than the viciouskitty who was married and was not a good wife and poor husband gotta look outward for fulfilment, hahahahah.   So you have a failed marriage because of you being a bitch and yet dare come here advise TS.  You are the one who really is genuinely in no position to advise TS.  You are worse than females who are not married.    hahhahaha</span></p>
