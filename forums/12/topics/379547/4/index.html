              <p>I hope you mean you are willing to forget that guy and forgive
              him.</p>
              <p>You were scammed. That's it.</p>
              <p>The marriage is genuine for you, for him  it is a marriage
              of convenience. That  is why he is afraid of the police in
              Singapore. He thinks that such marriage is illegal and he has
              fled.</p>
              <p>Do not harbour any ill feelings. At your self or at him.</p>
              <p>Seek proper legal help, consider this case as abandoment, and
              see what your options are.</p>
              <p>Relegate him to history, concentrate on you and your child
              for the future.</p>
              <p>Don't focus on you marriage opportunities for the future. What's
              the point of having the greatest opportunity for marriage, when you
              only need one spouse. That will always be within your means, not
              matter what your circumstances are.</p>
              <p>But please be more circumspect next time, ya?</p>

              <p>She means she cannot forget him, but neither can she forgives him.</p>
              <p>To the TS, don't worry too much about getting another husband. It is better to stay single than to be with someone who will not love you or take good care of you.</p>

              <p> From what i know of is they were former rebel LTTE group members who escaped to Australia and other countries. This is the reason why he keeps talking about being arrested ?</p>

              <p>I agree with Flapdoodle, one of my friends had a relationship with an old Westener, together they had a baby, but after the guy returned to his country, she couldn't find him anymore. Now she is a single mother with a kid with blond hair. Who knows, probably this guy already had a family back at home.</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>I am a 24 year old.  At the moment, I am expecting after barely 4 months of marriage. I married a foreigner, who took off saying he is scared. He has quoted so many things that he is scared of among which is he does not have a job. We have been fighting so much since we got married, and I told him that I cannot live on like this, I feel like dying. He is mentioning this as a reason that I might complicate him in a police case now. He is giving new reason everyday from not contacting his parents often enough. I know in me that it is not true. Someone who is so scared of getting arrested, only takes off when he learns the wife is expecting. I find that hard to believe.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now, he has told me he wants a divorce because nothing will work out between us. I am at a crossroad. I am unsure how I am going to bring up this baby. And what life would be after the marriage dissolves. Singapore is a rather closed community. Would anyone date a mom with a little baby. There are just a million thoughts in my head at the moment. I feel so lost. I feel I should give up on this marriage. I know my husband (soon to be ex) will keep finding reasons to avoid responsiblity and his family will continue to back him up as if he is still a little boy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Feel so stupid for agreeing to marry him..</p>
