              <p>I am a 24 year old.  At the moment, I am expecting after barely 4 months of marriage. I married a foreigner, who took off saying he is scared. He has quoted so many things that he is scared of among which is he does not have a job. We have been fighting so much since we got married, and I told him that I cannot live on like this, I feel like dying. He is mentioning this as a reason that I might complicate him in a police case now. He is giving new reason everyday from not contacting his parents often enough. I know in me that it is not true. Someone who is so scared of getting arrested, only takes off when he learns the wife is expecting. I find that hard to believe.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now, he has told me he wants a divorce because nothing will work out between us. I am at a crossroad. I am unsure how I am going to bring up this baby. And what life would be after the marriage dissolves. Singapore is a rather closed community. Would anyone date a mom with a little baby. There are just a million thoughts in my head at the moment. I feel so lost. I feel I should give up on this marriage. I know my husband (soon to be ex) will keep finding reasons to avoid responsiblity and his family will continue to back him up as if he is still a little boy.</p>

              <p>I think you already do realise, that he is really trying to put the distance between you, him and dont want you close.</p>
              <p>And it looks like you already am ready to simply drop him, and settle your issues now in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Here is a few option, which you can consider.  And I do not intend to pressure you any further.  But if you truly need a sounding board or someone just to talk to, to get your decisions mapped out.  Do let us know.</p>
              <p>1) Contract work if I understand, does not qualify you for paid maternity leaves nor are you really protected in the legal sense in Singapore.  You need to sound out with your employer about how you being pregnant might affect your current job and future career prospect.</p>
              <p>2) With your pregnancy now.  That shows that your marriage is consumated, means that you can only get a divorce, unless you are willing to bite the bullet and acknowledge that your pregnancy is a result of infidelity.  That should get you a annulment instead of a divorce that could drag to 3 to 4 years depends on who initialled the legal moves.</p>
              <p>That will totally mean that you drop him out of you life, and you can shift your focus to more important issues that will crop up.</p>
              <p>My idea is for you to compartmentise your emotions right now, to solve matters instead of getting you involved in long drawn out emotional issues that will burn you out and get you to make rash decisions.</p>
              <p>3) Pregnancies can be terminated legally in Singapore.  If thats against your wishes, religion or whichever issues.  Do consider those implications too, if you are really going to move forward for your future.</p>
              <p>You can also opt to type type type on the forum and let it goes thru your natural course and lifespan.  This is afterall, still your choice.</p>

              No marriage is certainly not a gamble. But many people seem to marry fast and early only to divorce early too. People nowadays just don't have commitment to hold on to their marriage perhaps due to no small reason that people today may age but it doesn't mean they are matured in character take your own leaders for an obvious example.<br><br>
              Well it was your decision to get married shma so now you have to be strong. You don't know what tomorrow is gonna bring so be optimistic about life. Optimistic happy people tend to get partner much sooner.

              <p>Shma,</p>
              <p>Your husband is a lost cause. To divorce him or not , is no longer an issue of importance.</p>
              <p>You need to think about your future. What do you intend to do with your unborn child ?</p>
              <p>Do you want to be a mother, or do you want to seek out other men ?</p>
              <p>If all you think about is how men will perceive you and your market value to them, then it is better for you to forgo this child of yours and dissolve this marriage.....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A mother cannot be selfish to only her own needs for now. When the child is born, your priorities should be the care of the child until he/she no longer rely on you to provide for all aspect of their needs.</p>
              <p>Until then, he/she will be the center of your life. Every decision you make will be for the well-being of the child.</p>
              <p>You need to make up your mind and stick to it.</p>
              <p>Your husband may have physically abandoned you, but in Singapore's society, it is perhaps better to be married in name than to be a "divorced" should you decide to keep the baby.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Since he is the one demanding for a divorce, then wait for him to file the papers. There is really no need for you to lift a finger for him.</p>
              <p>There is no law in Singapore that states only wifes can file a divorce paper. If he wants it so badly... tell him to go do it himself.</p>
              <p>What have you to lose ? He is already a nothing when he married you, what else can he "squeeze" out of you should he divorce you ?</p>
              <p>Do not let ignorants like them ( your in-laws)  disrupt you from your own path.</p>

              <p>In that case, let him demand for the divorce.  He can demand all he wants.  And its up to him to pay for it and he can wait the nice 3 to 4 years for the decree nisi.</p>
              <p>You in the meantime. Should focus on getting a place to stay, make sure the roof cannot be taken away from you.  And make sure you got finances to not worry you or starve you and child.</p>
              <p>Settle down, relax, enjoy your experience with your pregnancy and let everything move its course.</p>
              <p>Confirm that when you give birth, you will be focusing yourself on your baby, which is the love of your life.</p>
              <p>and if the divorce does comes thru, 3-4 years later, your child and you couldnt even be borthered by who that scum of a husband/father or shitty relatives are.</p>
