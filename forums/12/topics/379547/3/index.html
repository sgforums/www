              <p>TS.  I as mentioned by fanta g/f.</p>
              <p>Is divorced.</p>
              <p>However, just very recently, like Tues nite.  A gentleman went on bended knee and proposed.</p>
              <p>He is single, matured, with a very stable and good carreer, tall, good looking and is not a ah pek type.</p>
              <p>I would say, love is not impossible in the future.  But that timing will not be as what you expected or wanted.</p>
              <p>On keeping your child, then you need to believe, that your timing will be different,  because when your child is born.  He/she will be the love of your life.  And no matter how......they will love you back unconditionally.</p>
              <p>And that itself, beats find love from any opposite sex.</p>

              <p>1. I am deeply moved that you care so much for the life inside your womb. He/she is innocent and must never be deprived of a chance at life.</p>
              <p>2. As your hubby is irresponsible and unlikely to change for the better, take this opportunity to make a clean break with him now. Your marriage in registered in Singapore and Singapore laws applies. It very much favours womenhood, as it rightly should, for often, the women are sorely disadvantaged against in other countries.</p>
              <p>3. You must secure a job, to prove to the courts that you have the financial capabilities to provide for your child, as well as prove your capabilities that your child would be looked after when you are at work.</p>
              <p>For this to happen, you must accept help from each and any sources. Contact your family or relatives for help. THey may not had been in good terms with you for marrying this irresponsible rascals, but they are human too, and can be moved if you make that appeal to them. Singaporeans may seem calculative and aloof, but their hearts are made of flesh. I know them well, for I too am a human.</p>
              <p>To provide for a baby child in Spore is of not much costs. Govt clinics usually would help defray medical expenses. Food and lodging are actually minimal.</p>
              <p>Only issue would be infant care, for the child's behaviour would take some time to adjust to human hours, and would be a strain to you if you have to work the next morning should he/she cry all night over some medical issue. This you must prepare in advance and most certainly with help from someone else.</p>
              <p>Being a single mom in Spore carries little or no stigma at all, for our Singaporean women had proven themselves intelligent and fully capable at all levels of society.</p>
              <p>The only stigma is your perception of the guilt you feel over a divorce, which is of no fault of yours, but a mistake made, which all humans made too in many other ways. None of us are perfect.</p>
              <p>There are men who will love you and your child, only that such men are not listed on the phone directories or simply a face you can find on the street. It takes time, and you must seriously seive them out, not look for another bum who would only take advantage of you and your kid. You too need love and concern, but you must be careful and wary, not make the same mistake of giving yourself to another wrong guy.</p>
              <p>In the meantime, do what you can, survive as best as you can for your child, do not be afraid to seek for help. SOme will turn away from you, but not all, for we are still humans. Be strong for your child and start saving up for your future. No need college plans at the moment, but at least food on the table, roof over your head and some left over for leisure you and your baby would deserve from time to time.</p>
              <p>You are not alone, nor will ever be, as long as you live within a civilise society such as ours. Good luck and cheers, it aint the end of the world yet.</p>

              <p>I am a 24 year old.  At the moment, I am expecting after
              barely 4 months of marriage. I married a foreigner, who took off
              saying he is scared. He has quoted so many things that he is scared
              of among which is he does not have a job. We have been fighting so
              much since we got married, and I told him that I cannot live on
              like this, I feel like dying. He is mentioning this as a reason
              that I might complicate him in a police case now. He is giving new
              reason everyday from not contacting his parents often enough. I
              know in me that it is not true. Someone who is so scared of getting
              arrested, only takes off when he learns the wife is expecting. I
              find that hard to believe.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now, he has told me he wants a divorce because nothing will work
              out between us. I am at a crossroad. I am unsure how I am going to
              bring up this baby. And what life would be after the marriage
              dissolves. Singapore is a rather closed community. Would anyone
              date a mom with a little baby. There are just a million thoughts in
              my head at the moment. I feel so lost. I feel I should give up on
              this marriage. I know my husband (soon to be ex) will keep finding
              reasons to avoid responsiblity and his family will continue to back
              him up as if he is still a little boy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Feel so stupid for agreeing to marry him..</p>

              <p>Hi shma,</p>
              <p>I deeply sympathise you, but you must move on now, especially since you intent to keep the child. Since he wants a divorce, and you have no more feelings for such a heartless and useless man like him, then let him have his way and get the divorce over with.</p>
              <p>Planning ahead, you may want to seek help ahead of your delivery from your parents, and have them look after your child for you after giving birth, unless you are earning enough yourself to employ a nanny.</p>
              <p>Do not feel guilt or regret your decision, for you will be better for without such a man in your life. As for your future, you need not worry too much about it.  As women, we have to be strong on our own and not always rely on men, though I will be lying if I were to say I don't appreciate having someone who will comfort me when I am down and give me his shoulder to lie on when I need it.</p>
              <p>Thus, it will be better to leave everything to fate and see if a good man comes your way, and focus on planning ahead for your child first.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

              <p>thanks to those who gave me  their heart felt advice. I am alot braver and confident to face whatever that is ahead. I do not have control  over what happens on his side. But the last  I can do is to  keep myself happy and start planning for the future.</p>

              <p>And he lives in Africa? Another 3rd world country.??!!</p>
              <p> From what i know of is they were former rebel LTTE group
                  members who escaped to Australia and other countries. This is the
                  reason why he keeps talking about being arrested ?</p>

              <p>I hope you mean you are willing to forget that guy and forgive him.</p>
              <p>You were scammed. That's it.</p>
              <p>The marriage is genuine for you, for him  it is a marriage of convenience. That  is why he is afraid of the police in Singapore. He thinks that such marriage is illegal and he has fled.</p>
              <p>Do not harbour any ill feelings. At your self or at him.</p>
              <p>Seek proper legal help, consider this case as abandoment, and see what your options are.</p>
              <p>Relegate him to history, concentrate on you and your child for the future.</p>
              <p>Don't focus on you marriage opportunities for the future. What's the point of having the greatest opportunity for marriage, when you only need one spouse. That will always be within your means, not matter what your circumstances are.</p>
              <p>But please be more circumspect next time, ya?</p>
