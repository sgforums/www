The beginning stage where love grew in us - the memories retains subconsciously. You are looking back at the past not with a hidden liking, but with a possible thinking: If she was with me, how would my life be like? This is because this crush was kept inside you and never had a chance to foster. Now that you preview it back - it's always a seed and the seed always feel the same. It would be much different if she was your ex. You already knew how the seed would be like when it mature into a young plant - the feelings thus, would be different.<br><br>Different people varies in different degrees.<br><br>Cheers</div>
