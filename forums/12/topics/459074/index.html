              <p>Typically, when guys are confronted or when confronting someone (others 
              guys usually), they wont hesitate to act like a tough guy and will 
              challenge the other to a fight. Especially in front of girls. Maybe most
               see it as an opportunity to show the females that they are the tougher 
              and superior males. Matters of the ego.<br> <br> Im a guy, I rarely got into any confrontation. In the past when I was 
              confronted, when a girl is present, this guy acted so hostile without 
              trying to figure things out. But I stay calm and try to talk things out.
               Most may call me a coward, but for me I like to think things first and 
              not act irrationally, just for the sake of my ego. Especially when I do 
              not have much details about the situation. And I tend to give it a 
              thought first if the matter or the girl is worth the trouble. I dont 
              think I need to get physical with anyone just to be a man or the 
              dominant one. For me, violence is not a solution. Last resort, if I had 
              to, I probably just give that person a piece of my mind and dont give a 
              damn about what he or she thinks. I would only talk in a hostile tone if
               I feel Ive been pushed too far or after I failed to try to reason. 
              Lastly, I dont know why but I always hesitate to act that way in front 
              of outsiders, especially women. Just that I like to have a confrontation
               in private. <br> <br> For me, a real man will know when its time to be quiet, when to walk 
              away, when to stand up and fight (verbal or physically) for himself or 
              his loved ones if necessary.<br> <br> Getting into some silly fights over a trivial matter to me is simply too juvenile.</p>

              <p>Well jello, thats your own opinion and your own definitin of what a real man is. Everybody have their own definition what a real man should be, thus making it really vague. </p>
              <p>What i said is just my own idea of a real man. Some would say a real man never show fear in any confrontation. Some say real man is a man one who say whatever he wants to say or do does whatever he wanna do. </p>
              <p>Whatever you think how a real man should be, then so be it. Cuz thats your own ideal definition to it. Not because its the truth as nothing is true anyway.</p>

              <p>Dear Undiscovered soul,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Personally speaking, i think there will always be people out there whom think they can bully and intimidate others into accomodating them.</p>
              <p>You probably have encountered some of them</p>
              <p>Perhaps they are more rich or more sucessful, but to tell you the truth, such people, sometimes, I just despise them.</p>
