              I worked part time in a accounting firm for 2 weeks. I did say I prefer not to work at all on my 1st day, but she said her staff went awol and she needed someone to take over. So I agreed and we both agreed on the pay. Then 3 days later her staff came back and on the Friday of the 1st week, I asked for early release. She refused said there is another urgent job. I told her I wont be able to finish in 4 days as I have urgent personal business on the 2nd Friday. She agreed. So on Thursday of the 2nd week, she didn't come back to office and didn't answer her mobile. I called her 4 times. I wrote her an email detailing what I have done and asked for payment. When I called her the next day she only wanted to talk about the work and the line went dead when I talk about payment.
              
              Then this Monday when I called her, she said I haven't finished the assignment and so will not pay. I told her I already let her know I cant finish the work and she was aware of it and that for this kind of assignment will normally take up to a month. She could easily ask her staff to take over, which is what employers do when their staff resign. Unless of course my cost is free compared to her staff's.  So against my better judgement I said I can work 1 more day to complete at least the work papers for her but the typing of the accounts she can ask her staff to do. The next day she sent me a text msg saying she pay me 2 more days to complete including the typing. Problem now is, I said OK but after the 1st day, realised the 2nd day, even if I come to work for her I wont be able to finish. Now I am concerned she will use it against me. How can a simple part time work become like this? I expect a salary payment on my last day not this kind of crap and excuses from her. Her staff told me if I get paid on contract my commission can be 55%! and I realised my salary for the 2 weeks only amounted to 12%!.  I am more upset over my 2 weeks gone than money. I was told to withhold my work till she pay. Which is fine with me. Except she insisted I come work at her office instead of letting me work from home. I have to say she change the terms so often. She did say I can work from home but earn a salary rather than commission. Then she told me no. But I cant let her steal my time and work. Since she claim she has to get someone redo (I know that is a lie because it will mean she has to pay 55% - (US$4,250)) then wouldnt it make more sense to (stoop to her level) and delete my work of 2 weeks? What is there to stop her even I spend another 2-3 days to complete and she still wont pay? I don't have a written contract with her. Also, working extra days for her is not benefiting me as that means I have to take unpaid leave. I never expect an accountant to be so unprofessional as not pay salary. She can complain her staff doesn't do work yet she pays them because they have contracts. I am guessing she must have done this before to others and gotten away with it in the past. What can I do now? I don't want her to get away with this.

              <h1>WorkRight</h1>
              <p>The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) and Central Provident Fund (CPF) Board
               are stepping up our efforts to bring about compliance with the CPF Act 
              and Employment Act (EA), so that employees, particularly more vulnerable
               groups like low-wage workers, enjoy their basic employment rights under
               the law.  Areas of focus include payment of CPF contributions, on-time 
              payment of salary, overtime payment, provision of paid annual and sick 
              leave, and adherence to working-hour requirements, amongst others.</p>
              <p>We will do this through a two-prong WorkRight initiative covering 
              enforcement and education. Besides ramping up enforcement, we will be 
              reaching out to the public through a publicity campaign which aims to 
              educate workers on their employment rights under the CPF Act and the EA,
               as well as to educate employers about their legal obligations. </p>
              <p>Everyone has a part to play, even if you are not an employer or even an 
              employee.  If you know of employers that are non-compliant, you can 
              report by calling this hotline: 1800-221-9922, or email <a title="workright@mom.gov.sg" href="mailto:workright@mom.gov.sg">workright@mom.gov.sg</a>.  The identity of the caller will be kept strictly confidential.</p>
