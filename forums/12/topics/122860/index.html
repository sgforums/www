Whenever, I trying to get him out for a drink or two he will say that he is not free.  When someone else ask him, he will be gladly going out with them.

            <div class='col-md body'>well,if he really treats you as a good friend..he wouldn't be jealous or treat you in this way..maybe the two of you should find some chance to talk things out as all these may just be a misunderstanding~ if after talking out with him and he still insisted the same way as now...then i think he is also not a good friend to be~</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In a team, there can be 2 kinds of leaders: One is the manager, and the other the leader.<br><br>The leader is often the popular one, people would listen to him, feel motivated to work, inspired etc.<br><br>The manager is the one who's in-charge of making sure every thing goes well in the group, the decision-making and stuff..Admin work in a way.<br><br>Also, you two should listen to each other and discuss your decisions. Sometimes a good decision maybe derived from both your ideas.<br><br>If he's so childish and wants to go about pouting, then he's not really a true friend.

You said u made some unpopular decisions as a leader and your friend was pissed about it. So my question is whether you as the group leader have really done your part in listening to what the other group members have to say? Becos from the likes of things, it seems like you're making the call here with no attention given to how your other group members (which includes your fren) feel or think. If that's the case, you should reexamine the way you have been leading the group. A good leader not only leads, he listens too. If you have been ignoring the feelings of your group and doing things your way, then it's understandable why your friend is treating you this way because in his mind, you have turned out to be a pompous prick. (sorry for being blunt if that hurts, but I have my suspicions that you may have been acting like one in this situation).<br><br>On the other hand, if you have actually weighed your group members' suggestions, and your friend isn't happy about it because he wants it his own way, then your friend is at fault because he isn't working as a team here but rather he is trying to outshine you and take over your leadership role. You may want to reevaluate your friendship with him then as he is clearly not playing the role of a friend by being envious and petty.<br><br>You're the best judge of things so let's hope you make the right call from here on. Best of luck to you overseas.</div>
