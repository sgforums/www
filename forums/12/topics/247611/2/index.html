We are all people and we have our moods.  Ultimately, people got to know that only they themselves can help themselves.<br><br>You made it seem that people in trouble are totally helpless.<br>However, from what lots of us know, Q was not really vulnerable and I didn't seem to see that she had been misled or forced into an the movie outing with D. Apologies if this is brought up again.<br><br>Much of my shallow experience tells me that problems people face, mostly people created them, by themselves. However, not everything can be taken so seriously and not every time a person rant, we have to run and make things better. Life is not like this.<br><br>However, all I can say is that you clearly have a motive. However, you do not represent all of us in your overpowering means to push people's opinions aside.<br><br>I cannot represent everyone but I, like the TS, would like AA as it is/was. Non of us has a issue with it.  Do you have an issue with the mods? Go speak directly and clearly with the mods. Don't complicate the issues further with your messages that require reading between the lines.<br><br>With this said, I know you also have a bone to pick with me and I am sure you will take all effort like vk to steam roll me over at any opportunity. However, face it in life, who has never quarreled with someone, even loved ones. However, we all have the grace to accept, forgive and move on as none of us are saints. I had in all the time, never changed nicks and been straight to the point. So if you have an issue with me, do raise it and see if the air can be cleared. But from my knowledge of your past conversations and actions. I can only say in advance, I will agree to disagree.<br><br>This is the only day I taxed my brains so much!<br><br></div></blockquote>Why are you harping on the issues?<br><br>sounds like you arent over it yet.<br><br>come come....tell auntie VK whats actually borthering you on PM.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The way the TS stated his post, i thought I was looking at NKF saga part II.<br><br>But I don't think this forum is abused. Because it really did what it says it does. Help people solve their problems, by getting people to give solutions to our problems.<br><br>The mod in question did that here. Whatever he does outside of this forum, is really none of our business, and not the responsbility of this forum. I am not condoning his actions, but i think as adults, we all know what should be done or shouldn't be. If we do something wrong, then we must be prepared to face the consequences.</div>
