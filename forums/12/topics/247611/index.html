Confused and frustrated? <span style="color: red;">Let our resident Agony Aunts provide you with a solution!</span></span><br><br>That what the line at the top of this forum says.<br><br>It seem that some forumers, a moderator included, have their own agenda, other than seeking advice.<br><br>I hope the integrity of the Aunt Agony forum will be maintained.<br></div></blockquote>I think different people have different intepretation of this. Personally, I never felt this referred to just the mods only. It refered to any o the forumites who surf sgforums and AA in particular and give out advice to ppl. VK has done that on occassion and a lot of other people.<br><br>Never has it been that giving advice (non-professional) was limited solely to the mods alone.<br><br>I think there is a seperate issue here about the role of a mod esepecially for AA. Some people believe the role of AA should be different from that for other forums. I personally see no diff between the role of mod in AA or elsewhere.<br><br>If people wanted to give advice, they don't have to be a mod to do it. If somebody wanted to PM another forumite and ask him or her out, it doesn't require mod status to do so. VK has asked Devil to meet up thousands of times, Devil just didn't agree.<br><br><strong><span style="color: blue;">My point is this, different people have different intepretations about what Mod in AA is. And also different intepretation of the heading of AA.</span> </strong>Maybe it's confusing, maybe it's wrong, maybe it's politically correct. All I'm saying is please realise the differece in intepretation.</div>
