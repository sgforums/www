Anybody will be attracted to people who likes them. It is human nature.<br><br>So the question is whether you treasure your relationship with your gf.

You will be troubled.<br><br>Since you are already in a relationship, You should stick with it unless the relationship is not working.<br><br>You decide. We can only advice you and if you make a mess of it, hahahaha... you come here, we are still here to help you sort it out!<br><br>On the other hand, you can just pretend like nothing is happening and just be friends with your colleague.

            <div class='col-md body'>You are attracted to her because she shows interest in you and somehow it flatter you. But think twice, are you willing to give up your present relationship for her. It is impossible to be double crossing and the consequence is no good. If you don't like her reject her firmly, ignore her sms, please spare a thought for your the other half. She may be upset by your action.<br><br>PS. fyi those third parties have a name and that is 'slut'. Maybe she is toying with your feeling. She can chased after you and so do other men.</div>
