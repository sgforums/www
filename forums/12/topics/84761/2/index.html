            <div class='col-md body'>Religious are weird. Religious often consists of a creator and we are often seen as their product. Let take Christianity for example as usual. Okay, don't argue with me Christianity is not a religion. When making my IC, the person asked "Religion?" Then my mother replied for me Christian. Oh whatever, back on topic.<br><br>Lets look at it this way, if God created us, why did he created us? If you look at it at a positive way, you can say because he want to share life to the people. But since he created us, won't we be part of him by default? And since if this is so, isn't he sharing with himself. Look at it in a positive way, he feels bored and needs some company, entertainment. So he created us. And since the first of our kind, Adam and Eve betrayed his trust and he does not bear to kill them so he sealed us away from him. To him we are just like a show.<br><br>See, there are many loopholes in religions.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>I think if u go thru every religion, their history, their literature, like what some researchers did, there are many loopholes or unanwered questions especially when it could be regarding some point in the course of founding of a religion.<br><br>Another point will be the principles, the essence, the views of each religion. Many like atheists would argue against the existence of God or supernatural beings, or even certain taboos - like why is pig not to be touched or consumed in Islam.<br><br>If one were to be like these people and start debating about it, there will be no end.<br><br>What, and usually (thankfully) is enshrined in many country's constitution is the right to practise one belief, without of course the usual threat to national security and peace.<br><br>What is bugging me is that many who come to me and say i am sinful, and should repent...according to their beliefs. Worse when they know my beliefs, they still do it, in very provocative manner. I think what people gotta learn to be very sensitive to others beliefs and try as much as not to intrude or trod down on their religions.</div>
