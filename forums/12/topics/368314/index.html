              <p>There are many different types of guys and girls out there in this world, though somehow those truly good guys often get stuck with horrible girls and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>vice-versa</strong></span>. ( I am not being a sexist here )</p>
              <p>Ask your friend to forget about this girl and look for a new gf. It will probably hurt him to do so, but it will be better this way than for him to be harmed by this girl any further.</p>

              <p>nah he didn't do it in return for anything.  he loved her but at that time she was obsessed over her past to feel it.  seeing the state she was in, how could he leave ?</p>
              <p>he's not complaining.  what's there to complain about ?  it's just me looking at his story and being retrospective here.  in fact, he has already moved on.</p>

              <p>But in my opinion, just because he took care of her last time, he shouldn't expect an obligatory response from her this time around, although from a third person perspective, we would say she should. Love is unconditional and it should be sincere. If she is like that, then she's the one at fault. How much can your friend tolerate?
