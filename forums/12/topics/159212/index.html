Get to know them, show that you really care, and are not just interested in being more than friends. Be nice, be YOU!!! Unlike what you said, not all gals only go for looks. In fact most of my friends are attached to guys who are average looking but have great personalities.<br><br>I realized from personal experiences, when you go all out looking for love, it often eludes you or youÂ’ll find something that looks like love but is not love. However if you do not look for love, youÂ’ll find it in the most unexpected places.<br></div>

To me, is not about correcting your self confidence and esteem or even mindset.<br><br>You should start -<br><br>Exercise more regularly<br>Get to go outings more and mix with people, get your social life going.<br>Draw a line between work and personal well being, it's healthier.<br><br>Handsome, look better? Work on it.<br>Do something about it. What makes you happy?

You got to stand up against your ex and to PROVE to her that you will be so much stronger without her existence and that the next girl that comes along - she will be so much better than your ex.<br><br>But before that could happen - how much effort are you willing to improve your overall self image, esteem and confidence? Just how much?<br><br>If you wanna change something, you cannot have a half hearted way of doing it. You must stir an emotional drive and muster all your energy into improving yourself.<br><br>P.S: I have seriously seen this woman who lost more than half of her weight because of powerful emotional drive. The reason is simple: she wants to make her boyfriend's decision to be a correct decision... to be with her and that Love has transformed her completely. She doesn't want her boyfriend to regret having a relationship with her... and this creates a powerful force that became unstoppable. (She isn't tall, but her weight was 80++ - now, 42kg)<br><br>Just how much effort are you willing to improve yourself?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>
