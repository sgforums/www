Unless he has cheated on you, talking to girls is nothing wrong. As long as he is faithful, what do u have to fear? No doubt that it is only human to feel this way, but what u should do is to show the other gal a united front, how much u stand by your man, rather than to show her that there are any signs of conflict between you and him.</div>

But now he has told u honestly about this girl, and he did say he will solve the problem right? like i said, the last thing u want is for that girl to see that u don't trust your man, the lasy thing u want for her to see is that you and your man don't get along, and the last thing u want for him to feel is that he is not trusted and misunderstood by you, because all that would serve to do is to give him 2nd thoughts about continuing to be with u.</div>
