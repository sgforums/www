Now that's a little far fetched, not to mention psychotic. I'm sure u are attracted to his looks and wouldn't wanna ruin his pretty little face. Anyway I share a similar experience... though I am on e receiving end of e jealousy rage.<br><br>After I got attached, I was still receiving smses/emails from girls whom I went out with when I was single. Not wanting to hide from my gf, I showed em to her everytime. She always got mad coz these girls expressed interests b4. She insisted that I reply and let em noe I'm now happily attached. Initially I felt it was moronic and rude to reply in that manner. Afterall they were juz asking how I was and trying to catch up with me. Still I gave in eventually, and willingly for I rather give her a peace of mind she deserved. Needless to say, out of courtesy those girls wished me e best (though some never even bother replying) and had never sms me since.<br><br>My gf also bought a pair of rings which I wore like a wedding band. I guess that wards off attention too.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Hope these help.<br></div>
