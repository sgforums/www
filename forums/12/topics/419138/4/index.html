              <p>But marriage is not something like an academy examination or a job career or even a driving licence so to speak, where you can succeed if you work hard and smart.</p>
              <p>As long as you do your part as a wife or husband, love and care for your partner thru eternity as promised in your marriage vows, the rest belongs to the nature, so what if it end up with your spouse suddenly said, "I want a divorce", you have to take it, dun tell me you go jump down immediately meh?? if so, mortuary will be very busy.</p>
              <p>Chiong into wall also at least got chiong mah, everything goes thru experience, without experiencing it, how you know it will not be successful. Got chiong, got hope, no chiong, completely no hope</p>

              <p>This is my situation:</p>
              <p>I'm a Singaporean girl in my mid 20s who have been living and working in Europe for many years. I married and divorced at a very young age. I am once again, looking for a serious relationship that I can form a family with and I would prefer to consider an Asian man, preferbly with a Singaporean as I am looking forward to settle down back home.</p>
              <p>I only have one relationship in my life but I've gone on casual dates with a couple of native Chinese expatriates (by native Chinese, I mean PRCs but I find that term discriminating). I don't mind settling down in China since it's nearer to home as compared to Europe or the States but I think I would prefer Singapore ;-) I don't have many friends or relatives in Singapore and neither do I have Singaporean friends overseas. However, I would like to return home to settle down once I find a good job in Singapore which shouldn't be a big problem I believe.</p>
              <p>My question is would Singaporean men mind a Singaporean girl who has been divorced before? Is there even the slighest problem with the issue of being a divorcee in Singapore? I was married overseas and never held any traditional wedding ceremony. Of course if I am in a stable relationship, I will tell the guy about my divorced status, but is it advisable to keep my status as "single" once I'm back home?</p>
              <p>(Disclaimer: This isn't an advertistment, I just want to find out about the local situation.)</p>

              <p>Laverne, for an obviously intelligent person, you asked a very dumb question. There will be men who would never marry a divorced person and, on that same whom-won't-I-marry continuum, there will be others who would. Even in conservative singapore, you will be surprised by the plurality of opinions. You may argue that, in general, Singaporean men will be less keen than their european counterparts in marrying a divorced woman. But talking in general is useless when you are marrying just one, not a people.</p>
              <p>How it will play out for you is also influenced by your own eligibility. J Lo will have her fourth husband if she is so inclined. So if you are young, pretty, rich, and intelligent, you'd stand a good chance in meeting someone who will overlook/accept the fact that you were married. Assuming he belongs to the group of folks who prefer a spouse who were never married.</p>
              <p>IMO, you don't have to let a potential mate know about your previous marriage until he becomes so. You will have to make that decision when that point in time is.</p>

              <p>Like what The Bear said, you don't have to hide your past. Just let any potential partner know; you'll be able to seive out the bad nuts and find someone with a big enough heart to share the rest of your life with you.</p>
              <p>I'm sure you don't wanna invest time and effort into someone who would eventually reject you once he finds out that you're a divorcee. Just ignore the narrow minded assholes.</p>

              <p>for me as gal, i dun expect in today context to be a long life story, if I do get a divorce so be it, if humans finally cannot get together, it is best to part, why drag on with the misery, but after the post divorce, i would had learnt that in life, do not expect everything to last forever, and with that, I might tag along my love life a bit more careful..but if you so hard up and insist that it must last, so be it, if it last, good for you, if it dun, then...too bad. But that does not imply marriage is a risk. Even going back to single again, i would said that, i had experienced marriage life.

Fact is, you are used. The only realistic thing to do is to find another guy whom is also a divorcee, talk is cheap. Sure everyone can be an angel here but when it comes to the real thing and thats to marry a divorcee, heaven can become hell. Things like how the family, friends and relatives think or pressure will start coming in and its highly unlikely that you will succeed in your quest unless you are very confident that you have something that every men sought after. Otherwise if you are no more or less different from every other woman, i can tell you your chance is close to zero.</p>

              <p>Thanks zzlee, littlemissbonkers and especially African Killer Bee for your insight.</p>
              <p>My next question is to zzlee, define "used".</p>
              <p>Is it a psychological stigma against this status as someone who was married before? (Since marriage is supposed to be something sacred and a lifetime committment...it's like normally something you do just once in your life.)</p>
              <p>Or is it again, the concept of "virginity"? Would those friends then accept the idea of non-virgins who were never married before?</p>

              <p>"used" in this case means the status of having married before. like a used shoe. i know of friends who mind this but i have equal number of friends who doesnt mind divorcee at all.</p>

              <p>at the end of the day, like what others had said, it doesnt matter what singapore guys think. as long as you met one who is willing to accept you and love you for whom you are, that is the only thing you need.</p>

              <p><br>sometimes girls who lose their virginity to their ex-boyfriends or ex-husbands, would have expected to be together with that guy for life (generally speaking). so even if they lost their virginity as well as got divorced, it's something that they themselves did not want to happen.</p>
              <p>so whatever it is, be it your gf/fiancee/wife is a divorcee and no longer a virgin, it's not what happened before that's important.. it's what's going to happen that counts.</p>

              <p>But a society like singapore which is still very much conservative in it behavor tends to differentiate the so call used ones from the new ones. A guy may love a divorcee, but he may have to face family pressure, even tho he careless about what family or relatives said, the stigma of marrying a divorcee (no more virgin) could hamper the family reputation and the so call face ...which is vital in our society no matter what races you are in.</p>
              <p>Marriage in our asian culture is unlike the west, to many, divorce is a bad omen, no doubt with western influences and education, the culture had tilted to be more open, but there still exist within asian family values to have their son or daughter to marry a decent good gal or guy who has not marry before, and it is not wrong, morally speaking, that is suppose to be the way. The asian takes marriage as an important occasion and a new lease of life for the newly wedd couples, unlike the west, which is more of a ceremony just to certified both husband and wife, and off they go enjoy themselves.</p>

              <p>Thanks for your replies.</p>
              <p>It would not matter to me if the reason for 
                                  objecting to getting along with a divorcee is that she is someone who 
                                  was "used". A woman is a human, not an object. I know a traditional, 
                                  patriarchal
                                                          society sees it as a man's world but 
                                  nonetheless, appraising anyone basing on "new" and "used" isn't 
                                  respectful, not even to a bachelorette whom they classify as "new", so 
                                  let alone using such measures to gauge the value of your life partner.</p>
              <p>There
                                   are indeed valuable principles of a traditional and even a patriarchal 
                                                         society. I think the main value of patriarchy is the order and harmony it creates within the unit. It should not be about power and dominance. That is abusing the system. I would for instance, understand if the 
                                  stigma of being associated with divorce is related to the idea of a 
                                  broken family unit, or a woman who was non-virtuous or not dutiful. I 
                                  can even understand if there is this discomfort in knowing that the 
                                  person you're closing a once-in-a-lifetime and sacred ceremony (aka 
                                  marriage) with, isn't doing it for the first time. But in the case of 
                                  measuring a person basing a "new-old-discarded-etc" rating, it is simply
                                   an issue of the man's character. It is has nothing to do with being traditional. And living with someone of such a 
                                  character might lead to other complications in the marriage.</p>
              <p>Anyway, AFB does have a point in saying that we are marrying just one 
                                  person at the end of the day, so all the different opinions of the 
                                  society do not matter.  But psychologically, I am affected. It's because 
                                  when I get into a new relationship and find a great guy who loves me for
                                   who I am, I hope I can give him the best too. Hence how the society 
                                  sees his wife (i.e. me) would be important to me because I would like to
                                   be the best possible person he can marry. And the reason why I wouldn't disclose my marital status, since no one at home knows about it
                                   afterall, isn't really because of my own reputation. It's mainly so 
                                  that my future partner wouldn't have to face any unnecessary stress.</p>
