              <p>my friend just intro me a malaysian chinese professional. she is cute (her dreamy eyes really killer) and is quite understanding in terms of relationship. really a good wife material as compared to the other sg gals i am dating so far. except for a few bimbos, the sg gals i dated so far are quite decent and well mannered. maybe i should give other nationality a chance this time round.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>one thing for sure, sg lady hitting 29 and 30, they tone down their expectation alot. they are much friendlier, down to earth and easy going than their 20s peers. if u dont mind the age, most guys can find happiness in age group 29-33. :)</p>

              <p>Thanks for your replies.</p>
              <p>It would not matter to me if the reason for objecting to getting
              along with a divorcee is that she is someone who was "used". A
              woman is a human, not an object. I know a traditional, patriarchal
              society sees it as a man's world but nonetheless, appraising anyone
              basing on "new" and "used" isn't respectful, not even to a
              bachelorette whom they classify as "new", so let alone using such
              measures to gauge the value of your life partner.</p>
              <p>There are indeed valuable principles of a traditional and even a
              patriarchal society. I think the main value of patriarchy is the
              order and harmony it creates within the unit. It should not be
              about power and dominance. That is abusing the system. I would for
              instance, understand if the stigma of being associated with divorce
              is related to the idea of a broken family unit, or a woman who was
              non-virtuous or not dutiful. I can even understand if there is this
              discomfort in knowing that the person you're closing a
              once-in-a-lifetime and sacred ceremony (aka marriage) with, isn't
              doing it for the first time. But in the case of measuring a person
              basing a "new-old-discarded-etc" rating, it is simply an issue of
              the man's character. It is has nothing to do with being
              traditional. And living with someone of such a character might lead
              to other complications in the marriage.</p>
              <p>Anyway, AFB does have a point in saying that we are marrying
              just one person at the end of the day, so all the different
              opinions of the society do not matter.  But psychologically, I
              am affected. It's because when I get into a new relationship and
              find a great guy who loves me for who I am, I hope I can give him
              the best too. Hence how the society sees his wife (i.e. me) would
              be important to me because I would like to be the best possible
              person he can marry. <strong>And the reason why I wouldn't disclose my
              marital status, since no one at home knows about it afterall, isn't
              really because of my own reputation. It's mainly so that my future
              partner wouldn't have to face any unnecessary stress.</strong></p>

              <p>unless u see alcohol as a sin, open a pub is perfectly alright. it is a place where people want to chill and feel like home. of cuz, some pub in boat quay has pinoy gals who scantily dressed and get touchy. i am not referring to those as i believe they are mostly flaunting the law.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i think the rest of the pubs who has waitress accompany customer are pretty alright. what a male customer wants at the end of the day is fun company time through ktv/pool/chit chatting/playing games. of cuz looks does comes into play when attracting the bee into the pub.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>it is not easy to run a pub and customer retention is very impt as ur waitresses are your most impt proxy to your customers.</p>

              <p>Sorry I deleted that part of my post, too much details. But yea,
                  you got the story ;-)</p>
              <p>I don't think that the local girls are blaming foreign women or
                  whatsoever. It's just discrimination in general. I really think
                  Singaporean girls are fine. They are simple, hardworking and rather
                  capable. Not many asian girls contribute to the family finances but
                  most Singaporean girls do. It isn't easy for a woman you know,
                  juggling both the household and work.</p>
              <p>Honestly lah...if a Singaporean guy has a choice between a local
                  and a foreign girl, my advice would be for him to choose the local
                  one. At least local girls are simplier, many foreign girls have
                  other motives when finally deciding to marry a man (whether it's in
                  Singapore, or back in their own countries).</p>
