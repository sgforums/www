              <p>definition of much older is related to being independent.</p>
              <p>since the average male university graduate is 23, he wont become independent until at least 5 years in the workplace. even then, he cant afford his own place. ie. independence in the true sense of it.</p>
              <p>from the HDB point of view, only a single aged 35 and above can own a HBD flat. below that, u need to be married.</p>
              <p>so i would simplify the definition as 35 onwards.</p>

              <p>Sorry I deleted that part of my post, too much details. But yea, you got the story ;-)</p>
              <p>I don't think that the local girls are blaming foreign women or whatsoever. It's just discrimination in general. I really think Singaporean girls are fine. They are simple, hardworking and rather capable. Not many asian girls contribute to the family finances but most Singaporean girls do. It isn't easy for a woman you know, juggling both the household and work.</p>
              <p>Honestly lah...if a Singaporean guy has a choice between a local and a foreign girl, my advice would be for him to choose the local one. At least local girls are simplier, many foreign girls have other motives when finally deciding to marry a man (whether it's in Singapore, or back in their own countries).</p>

              <p>you will find that true love and all that crap you see on tv doesnt exist especially with a local woman and white guys at the end of the day its the hot sex that comes to mind when you group this 2 together = local woman bad?</p>

              <p>definition of much older is related to being independent.</p>
              <p>since the average male university graduate is 23, he wont become
                  independent until at least 5 years in the workplace. even then, he
                  cant afford his own place. ie. independence in the true sense of
                  it.</p>
              <p>from the HDB point of view, only a single aged 35 and above can
                  own a HBD flat. below that, u need to be married.</p>
              <p>so i would simplify the definition as 35 onwards.</p>

              <p>@russiabear: Back to your previous comment once again. You're saying that it isn't advisable for me to disclose my status right at the start. But then, he wouldn't bring me home to see his parents right at the start too, right? Sure, I can understand that there is this..stigma..when you know that the guy or girl has been divorced before. It kinda prevents you from getting to know him or her better. That is why it is better to only disclose that part of yourself until later. Hmm...what's your take on this then?</p>
              <p>And most of you guys say that it wouldn't be a problem...would you yourself then even consider a girl who has been divorced before? I don't mean anything personally, just want to know how people really think, if they encounter such a situation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And @<a href="/users/252354">Kirin_Rider</a>: Firstly, you're totally out of point, no one is talking about white men and no one is talking about love or sex here. Secondly, you're having a big (racist) misconception about white men too.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>@PedoBear: It's ok. Just my advise, basing on my knowledge of Chinese women. They are definitely not simple girls, although it doesn't mean that they are not nice. No doubt that many Chinese girls I know here in Europe are intelligent, educated and they probably earn more than me and have no intention of cheating people around them, but they are nonetheless, just not simple. Singaporean girls might seem "stuck up" but that's really just it. Beneath this personality, most of them are actually rather simple people. And it's always advisable to marry a partner of the same cultural background.</p>

              <p>ok. basic guy (and mine) perception is this:</p>
              <p>stage 1: see pretty girl, go for her.</p>
              <p>stage 2: identify status of girl. if single, good. if divorced, check if got kids, otherwise it's free sex (since divorced sure not virgin)</p>
              <p>your response to stage 2 : single</p>
              <p>if you dont say you are divorced, you are basically a single girl to guys. so there is no stigma. and the r/s progresses.</p>
              <p>at some point, status is revealed. if you already have sex with him, 
              then it probably isnt an issue to him. if you havent then he will feel 
              cheated - he could have had sex with you from day1 but didnt cos he 'respected' you. this can turn messy in the future.</p>
              <p>your response to stage 2: divorced</p>
              <p>if you identify your status upfront, he can choose to abort or continue (on the basis that he will probably get free sex without commitment from day1). my advice is not to have sex just cos of mutual attraction, if u are looking for LTR. if he chooses to continue even though u are divorced but not going to have sex with him anytime soon, min. 6 months, he is likely to be a keeper.</p>
              <p>more later if u interested to ask more...</p>

              <p>This is my situation:</p>
              <p>I'm a Singaporean girl in my mid 20s who have been living and working in Europe for many years. I married and divorced at a very young age. I am once again, looking for a serious relationship that I can form a family with and I would prefer to consider an Asian man, preferbly with a Singaporean as I am looking forward to settle down back home.</p>
              <p>I only have one relationship in my life but I've gone on casual dates with a couple of native Chinese expatriates (by native Chinese, I mean PRCs but I find that term discriminating). I don't mind settling down in China since it's nearer to home as compared to Europe or the States but I think I would prefer Singapore ;-) I don't have many friends or relatives in Singapore and neither do I have Singaporean friends overseas. However, I would like to return home to settle down once I find a good job in Singapore which shouldn't be a big problem I believe.</p>
              <p>My question is would Singaporean men mind a Singaporean girl who has been divorced before? Is there even the slighest problem with the issue of being a divorcee in Singapore? I was married overseas and never held any traditional wedding ceremony. Of course if I am in a stable relationship, I will tell the guy about my divorced status, but is it advisable to keep my status as "single" once I'm back home?</p>
              <p>(Disclaimer: This isn't an advertistment, I just want to find out about the local situation.)</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>I don't mind. Just out of curiosity, who initiated divorce? You or the husband?</p>
              <p>When I say I don't mind, I mean I don't mind dating you. But when come to marriage, you got to be serious and make sure want to work thing out, not take the easy way out.</p>
              <p>I know one fren, he divorce one time also when very young, early 20, but when he go into second marriage, he not happy, same prob again, then he think of easy way out bcause he done before, divorce again at 31. Then at 35 divorce again. Recently 41 marry again.</p>
              <p>I am not generalising, but some people who divorce tend to think it is ok to divorce again. I only say that when dating somebody to consider carefully before making decision or else take marriage for granted.</p>

              <p>Dont keep anything as secret especially something as big as a marriage/ divorce......because eventually one way or another he will find out and when he does, it will be a shock especially since you have been hiding that fact. That will make u look bad and untrustworthy.</p>
              <p>Best policy is just to be upfront.</p>

              <p>It would.</p>

              <p>Well at least you dont have any children yet.</p>
              <p>I believe it is still possible.</p>

              <p>@Julian.khor: Hmm...Divorce is definitely not a runaway-solution.
                       But sometimes we don't have a choice, people make mistakes in life. If 
                      you mean dating as in a steady, long term relationship between a couple,
                       yet it is a r/ship that does not have a plan for marriage at all, then I
                       wouldn't even get into such a r/ship in the first place. I am looking 
                      to form a family back home in Singapore, not for random romances (there 
                      are tons of chances out here in Europe for such romances, but I am 
                      not in my teens).</p>
              <p>@Veggie Bao: There are different ways of picking
                       your partner, i.e. through sifting out choices because it's time to get
                       married and form a family, or through love. If a very eligible 
                      man/woman is gonna pick a woman/man by listing them in an excel sheet 
                      and comparing their qualities, then I think being a divorcee is 
                      definitely something that would make him/her cross the person out ;-) At
                       least that is the case for some Asian countries like China. I'm not 
                      sure about Singapore. But if you're speaking of true love...I think 
                      being divorced without children wouldn't really come into question then.
                       Hence I was wondering, how much do Singaporeans actually mind a 
                      divorced status.</p>
              <p>@shrekho,mistyblue and Fcukpap: Yep and thanks :-)</p>

              <p>@russiabear: About virginity - as I've been out of Singapore for
              a long time, I wonder if Singapore is still conservative about that
              issue. I always believe we are, although the rest of Asia have
              already forsaken that idea. It isn't about reputation, it is about
              self-respect and virtue. I think a girl should cherish herself
              regardless of her past, i.e. divorced or not, a virgin or not, she
              should not easily give herself in to a guy unless she knows that he
              will be responsible towards her. Despite what the other Asians have
              told me, I still believe that being a non-virgin out of a failed
              marriage is an understandable issue, but being a non-virgin for
              someone who has not been married <strong>might</strong> be
              questionable This is really subjective though, perhaps I'm just
              conservative because up till now, no one has agreed with me. If I
              have to be honest, one of the reasons why I married so young was
              because of such an issue. That is why I have never regretted
              marrying him, he truly loves me and wants to be responsible towards
              me. My ex is a very good person. Nonetheless it was perhaps a
              mistake to be together, that was why it led to a divorce
              eventually. So if virginity is an issue with regards to my status
              as a divorcee, I think this wouldn't be something that I have to
              dispute about. Like I said, it isn't about reputation. It's just
              self-respect and a virtue. As to whether I'll go to bed with a guy
              early in the relationship, obviously I wouldn't and wouldn't
              recommend other girls to do that when they are still fresh in a
              relationship.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>about virginity, the world hasnt changed much. those who say they dont mind, oso dont mind multiple partners, and lack the integrity to hold on to a r/s (less motivation to work at it)</p>
              <p>virginity is still a man's world. nuff said</p>
              <p>about divorce and single status for marriage. it's the norm to want to have the better deal in the marriage. hence old rich man, young virgin (or pretty) girl. so for a family of a single man to marry a divorcee, even without kids, it is pretty tough. unless the family is open. fair trade and stuff like that, even if never said openly.</p>

              <p>about virginity, the world hasnt changed much. those who say
                  they dont mind, oso dont mind multiple partners, and lack the
                  integrity to hold on to a r/s (less motivation to work at it)</p>
              <p>virginity is still a man's world. nuff said</p>
              <p>about divorce and single status for marriage. it's the norm to
                  want to have the better deal in the marriage. hence old rich man,
                  young virgin (or pretty) girl. so for a family of a single man to
                  marry a divorcee, even without kids, it is pretty tough. unless the
                  family is open. fair trade and stuff like that, even if never said
                  openly.</p>

              <p>I agree that regarding the issue of a girl's virginity, we're debating in a man's world. I am conversative too. In reality, most Asian men actually do mind. It's just that most people in other parts of Asia also no longer expects their wife to be a virgin, unless she is their university sweetheart. I am not sure about Singapore now, but during my younger days back in Singapore, most still do expect their wife to be one. Actually I can understand the other asians. Unlike Singapore, the other asian 
                  countries are huge and their cities can be hundreds of km apart. The singles do not live with their parents, they 
                  have their own apartments or student hostels. When living alone outside, 
                  many singles tend to be less disciplined.</p>
              <p>My point about virginity was that, it will not be a topic I will bother to dispute about if someone uses that against my divorced status. This is because this isn't something I have to hide, i.e. it isn't an affair or it isn't that I slept around randomly while being young and single. I was married. Chasity isn't about reputation, it's about virtue and self-respect.</p>
              <p>As to being divorced and not divorced, sure "unmarried" is definitely a better "deal", if a "deal" is what a person is looking for in a marriage. A more educated wife or a prettier wife also makes a better "deal" for a partner, doesn't it? See my comment to Veggie Bao about listing potential partners in an excel sheet. It's just a matter of, how much Singaporeans in general, mind a divorced status. What I would like to know is that in Singapore's society, is this something that most would definitely not accept, or it is just something that would make them waver when considering a serious relationship with her?</p>
