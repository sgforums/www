              <p>Zweiz are you being an ass because you are obstinate (in which
              case I’ll ignore you) or because you’re obnoxious (in which case
              please accept my virtual middle finger)? Laverne has said she will
              talk about her previous marriage <span>WHEN</span> it’s
              appropriate for her date to know. how’s that unreasonable? Do you
              go around telling your dates all potential deal breakers that might
              exist between you and her? First date? If so you’re even more a
              weirdo than I imagine.</p>

              <p>There are plenty of people like that around here. Best way out is to ignore them.</p>
              <p>So TS, maybe you should try ignoring unconstructive comments and just focus on getting the right guy out there.</p>

              <p>Laverne, are you actually in Singapore, or still in USA/Australia?UK?</p>
              <p>If you aren't in SG, then this thread can only help you so much.</p>
              <p>Basically being divorced is a disadvantage, but not nearly as much as being divorced with a child.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The only real way to know is by living in Singapore. You're only 25-26(I assume), so spending a year in SG doesn't really matter much, and you'll be back in Asia.</p>

              <p>I think there are but not many happy marriages and I believe for
              those happy marriages, there are times when they are not happy

              <p>To get married is to get a certificate to produce children legally. If you don't wish to have children, I don't see the point of getting married. Just stay together will do. Why so troublesome get married and when not happy, have to go through troublesome process to divorce.</p>
              <p>I have asked my friends who are divorcee. I asked them whether do they wish to get married. They told me they just got out of the shit, why jump in again ?</p>

              <p>@AKB: Thanks again heh<br>And you summarized my long-winded posts in a couple of sentences ;-)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>@OneWithTheForce: I'm still not in Singapore at the moment.<br>If I move, it'll be for something definite. Being a single, definite factors would be the location of my family members (parents and siblings) and a job. Of course the factors would be different if I were married. When I have found something definite for me to move, I'll also have to consider how the situation will play out for me in the new environment. That's where questions like marriage, my divorced status and social stigma comes in. But these are just a few of the many aspects in life.</p>
              <p>As much as I would prefer a Singaporean partner, I don't think I should move back to Singapore (or to anywhere else) just to look for "love and marriage". The questions posed here are based on my previous plans that my family members intend to stay in Singapore and that I will be looking for a job in Singapore. But sometimes, è®¡åˆ’èµ¶ä¸�ä¸Šå�˜åŒ–ã€‚</p>
              <p>What's your opinion then?</p>

Not even the crockcoaches</p>
              <p>If a man grew old gracefully, you can see his grace of nice old age appearances, care for his grandchildrens, childrens and wife. Think for the best for his decendents, alway put his family first by his heart, go tour with wife, respect his wife contribution to build this family...die hor, even me angel also visit him and bring him to heaven</p>
