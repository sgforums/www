              <p>I'm Chinese.</p>
              <p>As for parents who mind, that is what I was also thinking about. Well, how strong will Singaporean parents object to a divorced daughter-in-law? I think marriage is the union of two families, not just two persons. I know it's subjective but are Singaporean in-laws generally completely close minded towards all divorcees? Or will they accept a girl if they see morals and/or qualities in her?</p>

              <p>Heh...I think I'm outta such issues. Besides, I don't know how much a flamboyant guy can attract me. I am working overseas, have travelled for many years and my previous husband was rather good looking himself ;-) I guess it's just that I want to move on in life and get on track with the right responsibilities, i.e. be a good wife, daughter, daughter-in-law and mother. Perhaps that's why I'm looking to go back home to Singapore. I like someone traditional, mature and quiet. Besides, I was never into the gaudy kinda lifestyle anyway.</p>

              <p><br>i guess its not really that bad, its just that the local girls had build a really bad reputation around themselves</p>
              <p> the current trend is that if a local girl fails to hook a man before she stops schooling, chances are shes out of luck</p>

              <p>realistically speaking, the men around your age would prefer a single lady. if u had not disclosed your status at the start, it would be considered as deception. the good thing is, guys usually dont mind being deceived. the bad thing is, their parents mind, a lot. so probability for success is close to zero here.</p>
              <p>so yup, get independent men (which means usually older men, much older men). then your probability for success is much higher.</p>
