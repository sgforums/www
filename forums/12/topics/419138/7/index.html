              <p>Thanks for your kind words AKB.</p>
              <p>Realistically,
                                                                                                   being divorced is not the norm in Asia, and it isn't exactly something good 
                                                                                                  either. At the same time, most people would not bother about other 
                                                                                                  people's
                                                                                                   business, good or bad ones. They would only speak badly of the others 
                                                                                                  to lighten their own burdens, i.e. to make themselves feel better. So if
                                                                                                   someone needs another person's issue to make their problems seem 
                                                                                                  smaller, they would for instance, bring up my case of being a divorcee. 
                                                                                                  That would however not be fair to my partner, because he had a clean 
                                                                                                  past, but would need to bear with nasty comments because of someone he 
                                                                                                  loves. So yep, I would feel like I've indirectly done him wrong, although it's inevitable. Well, we cannot change the past.</p>
              <p>As to your question about my age , you can do the math. You see, I started school a year 
                                                                                                  earlier, don't have to serve 2 years of NS, finished tertiary education 
                                                                                                  at the fasting possible pace and got a job right after graduation.</p>
              <p>(No prize for guessing my date of birth. Basically I seem to be doing things ahead of the others of my age, even when it comes to marriage and divorce &gt;_&gt;)</p>

Fine, put westerners aside on this if you want, there are also many eligible Chinese guys actually (I don't know what's up with the PRC stigma). It's just a matter of where the girl wants to settle down. Do Singaporean men have something 
                                                                                                  against Singaporean girls marrying foreigners or is it just you? Besides define "better", especially in the case of having to hide any sort status just to "get" a supposedly "better" guy; a truly good guy respects and likes a girl for who she is. (Am I answering my own question here? heh)</p>

Perhaps Europeans just officially separate or divorce when the relationship fails, backstabbing their partner with another man/woman isn't quite their thing. Sure there are European men who go sexually astray occasionally, but the concept of "a wife as a keep-at-home possession" along with "young, roadside flowers for every-other-thing" isn't instilled in the European culture like it is in some Asian culture. And also, a western relationship is definitely not

                                                                                                  that they can be a little...suicidal when the relationship fails. So girls have to be very tactful and
                                                                                                   considerate when they are in a relationship with such a westerner. A

              <p>also, you're the one going on about foreigners. a divorcee means a divorcee to me. all things being equal, i would pass on divorcees (hence, good decision to hide. just don't expect me to applaud you)</p>

              <p><br>You mentioned "fails marriage <strong>overseas</strong>" and "a better <strong>sg</strong> guy", sounds like it's hinting at issues on foreign marriages to me.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You still don't get it, a "good decision" to hide isn't because it would give divorcees more choices on people who would otherwise "pass on divorcees". Doesn't make sense anyway to hide from a potential partner if he isn't able to accept it afterall. Hiding just protects the future partner from having to face unnecessary stress.</p>
