              <p> </p>
              <p>Laverne, It's normal for people to choose jobs with other motives besides career or money, such as speaking the language, having friends or relatives there, wanting to travel etc.  Being in a relationship is one of your priorities, so I think you might want to consider working in SG, just so you can get a relationship.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for your original question about if being a divorcee matters, I know a lady who is divorced with a young child, but still getting dates almost weekly, because she is very attractive. Looks are more important. If you're ugly, overweight etc, then being divorced is just another stone weighing you down, but not the main one.</p>

              <p><br>As a demon you dun understand, even here i also get scolding from all types of uncles and aunties, especially so, my banned aunt fantagf and Uncle PKyap, so imagine in real life with my master, but then, she taught me that sometime, scolding is because of Love,as in a mother to a daughter love, a senior care for a junior kind of love. Many parents also scold their teenage child, but because the child, especially sg spoilt child, do not understand the basis of why parents scold them, they turn to run away, go drinking, hip hop and so on.</p>
              <p>As I said many times, marriage is only a legal aspect of laws created by human beings, you are not obligated to marry someone as long as both are comfortable with each other staying together, but becos marriage had bind itself to the legal aspect of a country as being the legal biological parents, the right to purchase houses, the right to apply for childcare, education etc etc..marriage somehow make it way as part of your human living condition.</p>
              <p>From early men and women, where got marriage?? they just get together, have sex, care for their youngs as all living thing mostly do, and maybe have a small campfire and roast deer meat celebration, that is all. By the system by human that bind both genders to a so called civilisation marriage, so be it. But then, at time human of modern time so called civilised can be more brutal and cruel than their early men ancestors.</p>
              <p>In the book of Genesis, the old testament which is also part of the Quran, your god said, go on and be men and women, make decendents as much as possible to fill this world, for all men are equal. Your God did not say go and get marry, or men can be up and down, those high up control those below...which is sadly, happening today.</p>
              <p>As for Nun, the meaning of detachement forbid one to be attached, not to mention marriage, cos if you are attached, you will have more problems and more problems create more sins and karmatic effect. So, in a turtle shell, to me, marriage be it first, second and third, i dun give a damn, it is just a paper of legal aspect, for men and women are born nake and free, why let a paper make one attached and adhered to it, which to me is simply stupidity.</p>

              <p><br> As a demon you dun understand, even here i also get scolding from

              Love,as in a mother to a daughter love, a senior care for a

              <p>As I said many times, marriage is only a legal aspect of laws
              created by human beings, you are not obligated to marry someone as
              long as both are comfortable with each other staying together, but
              becos marriage had bind itself to the legal aspect of a country as
              being the legal biological parents, the right to purchase houses,
              the right to apply for childcare, education etc etc..marriage
              somehow make it way as part of your human living condition.</p>
              <p>From early men and women, where got marriage?? they just get
              together, have sex, care for their youngs as all living thing
              mostly do, and maybe have a small campfire and roast deer meat
              celebration, that is all. By the system by human that bind both
              genders to a so called civilisation marriage, so be it. But then,
              at time human of modern time so called civilised can be more brutal
              and cruel than their early men ancestors.</p>
              <p>In the book of Genesis, the old testament which is also part of
              the Quran, your god said, go on and be men and women, make
              decendents as much as possible to fill this world, for all men are
              equal. Your God did not say go and get marry, or men can be up and
              down, those high up control those below...which is sadly, happening
              today.</p>
              <p>As for Nun, the meaning of detachement forbid one to be
              attached, not to mention marriage, cos if you are attached, you

But in life we need to do what we ought to do, especially when the time comes for it. I know this sounds like a moral education textbook, but it’s about being a responsible grown-up, forming a family, having a job and contributing to the community. This applies to both men and women. What’s the point of bumping around and wasting time? IMO, a woman’s youth starts to expire by the time she is in her late 20s. Perhaps if I were a couple of years younger, I wouldn’t think much about such issues. Or perhaps it could also be that after having travelled the last years, it just makes me think that I really ought to settle down now. Besides, my parents are getting old and have been asking me to go home and re-marry.</span></span></p>

              <p><br>When I sent in my email to HDB several weeks ago asking about HOW ON EARTH CAN A SINGLE GUY apply for a government flat, guess what they replied?</p>
              <p>The issue is barely moralistic, it is about stupid, govt-damned targets. They need babies, and to have babies you need proper family structure, who cares if alot of growing up teens are facing depression and porn or drug addictions, just send them to the counsellor. They need new families to be formed at such and such a rate, in order to keep up with the jonessehs (how to spell, I am a Singaporean my whole life, I don't travel unless for pleasure), and the moment you touch down in Singapore, you'll have to find your nice dinner events to meet Mr Right.</p>
              <p>And guess what, I will not be able to logically avoid divorce, if the government do not lower their birth and boom targets. After all, if a woman stops conceiving at 40, and the government still needs babies, and man can reproduce into their 60s, by hook or crook divorce is not only inevitable, but a mandatory economic evil. How else to sustain aging population woes when humans are designed with flaws and the economy needs to rush like a juggernaut? When a relationship is stale, babies to be born are born, and the world is still hungry for figures to be met, push them into divorce, give them incentives to divorce and remarry.</p>

              <p>@Laverne - Hi, frankly, I think it is just how you handle the situation that matters, and not whether there is a stigma.  Telling your friends or relatives when you are back in Singapore that you are a divorcee will invite a lots of questions, since you are in your mid-20s.  Just saying that you are single will suffice until you meet "that" someone, then you just tell him.  I just read recently somewhere that 30% of marriages in Singapore ends in a divorce.</p>
              <p>Anyway, I just got a divorce, which is why I am looking at this forum.  I am still trying to accept the reality because my divorce was over so fast.  My ex-wife admitted to adultery in the affidavit filed, I did not even have to get a PI to prove it and the divorce was finalised in less than 6 mths.  She admitted in Aug 10 and everything is over in Dec 20.</p>
              <p>As a man, I am only able to tell a few people what really happened, as I am afraid I might break down when telling close friends.  As such, I am only comfortable writing and writing in this forum is the first time I am putting this in writing.  Putting up a brave front means having a lot of activities but emptiness within.</p>
              <p>Anyway, drop me an email at <a href="mailto:youmakemyday@singnet.com.sg">youmakemyday@singnet.com.sg</a> if you need any advice or information.  We can be "pen pals" (if this term still exists ;) ) as I have to admit, I need to "talk" and there are not many ppl I can talk to. </p>

              <p>What you need is a man who accept your past and there always men here in Singapore who will accept your past who maybe need you to accept his past as well.</p>
              <p>Your martial status shallnt be a burden in your search, in fact it shall be your yardstick. If he cannot even accept your past how can he accept you? Therefore I think you shall in fact stated yourself as divorced instead of single to filter the right guy for yourself.</p>

                  exists ;) ) as I have to admit, I need to "talk" and there are not
                  many ppl I can talk to. </p>
