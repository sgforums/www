              <p>i will give one practical explanation for being 'used'. in general, most young ppl who get married in SG will buy a new HDB flat together, and enjoy a grant (discount).</p>
              <p>http://www.hdb.gov.sg/fi10/fi10321p.nsf/w/BuyingNewFlatEligibilitytobuynewHDBflat?OpenDocument#FlatFirstTimer</p>
              <p>so let's say they divorce later on, sell off flat. find another partner, and marry. this time round, they are 'used' and are considered 2nd timers if they apply for new HDB flat. they will have to pay levy, or else buy open market HBD.</p>
              <p>in relation to HBD, there is also a limit to the no. of times you can take a HBD loan (which is lower than commercial bank loan).</p>

              <p>yes, i agreed with you that the word "used" is hurtful and <strong>derogatory</strong>.</p>
              <p>but it is also reflect how some male view divorcee.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>dont worry about not putting too much stress on your partner. I have relative who married a divorcee with 2 kids from previous marriage. We do talk about it initially but easily get over it after we know her.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>you seem to have a sincere heart and i am sure guys will see through that and accept u. it is only a matter of time but make sure you start grooming yourself too before you enter the dating scene again. most ladies stop maintaining their physique after marriage. sadly to say, most of the time, men are shallow. we judge ladies within the first 5 mins and men will only proceed with courtship if there is slight hint of lust.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Thanks for your replies.</p>
              <p>It would not matter to me if the reason for objecting to getting along with a divorcee is that she is someone who was "used". A woman is a human, not an object. I know a traditional, patriarchal society sees it as a man's world but nonetheless, appraising anyone basing on "new" and "used" isn't respectful, not even to a bachelorette whom they classify as "new", so let alone using such measures to gauge the value of your life partner.</p>
              <p>There are indeed valuable principles of a traditional and even a patriarchal society. I think the main value of patriarchy is the order and harmony it creates within the unit. It should not be about power and dominance. That is abusing the system. I would for instance, understand if the stigma of being associated with divorce is related to the idea of a broken family unit, or a woman who was non-virtuous or not dutiful. I can even understand if there is this discomfort in knowing that the person you're closing a once-in-a-lifetime and sacred ceremony (aka marriage) with, isn't doing it for the first time. But in the case of measuring a person basing a "new-old-discarded-etc" rating, it is simply an issue of the man's character. It is has nothing to do with being traditional. And living with someone of such a character might lead to other complications in the marriage.</p>
              <p>Anyway, AFB does have a point in saying that we are marrying just one person at the end of the day, so all the different opinions of the society do not matter.  But psychologically, I am affected. It's because when I get into a new relationship and find a great guy who loves me for who I am, I hope I can give him the best too. Hence how the society sees his wife (i.e. me) would be important to me because I would like to be the best possible person he can marry. And the reason why I wouldn't disclose my marital status, since no one at home knows about it afterall, isn't really because of my own reputation. It's mainly so that my future partner wouldn't have to face any unnecessary stress.</p>

But in life we need to do what we ought to do, especially when the time comes for it. I know this sounds like a moral education textbook, but it’s about being a responsible grown-up, forming a family, having a job and contributing to the community. This applies to both men and women. What’s the point of bumping around and wasting time? IMO, a woman’s youth starts to expire by the time she is in her late 20s. Perhaps if I were a couple of years younger, I wouldn’t think much about such issues. Or perhaps it could also be that after having travelled the last years, it just makes me think that I really ought to settle down now. Besides, my parents are getting old and have been asking me to go home and re-marry.</span></span></p>

              <p>Well, I am not sure how singaporeans' perception towards divorce, but I think it is safe to assume that your problem may lie on the older generation aka parents. I think reason for the divorce is also crucial. Is it merely because incompatibility,  financial problem, adultery (if yes, on whose part)?</p>
              <p>There are also other factors such as....family, career, belief, finance, etc etc</p>

              <p>I surmise that the so-called ''problem'' is not that of perception but rather the disease of self-consciousness. Having a porous self or at least being conscious of the ego might have one gravitating towards a different perspective and it is so freeing!</p>

              Laverne there is still a stigma and the ah soh brigade will gossip. The good news is that the stigma has less of a sting these days as divorces become commonplace. Personally I know few who would judge a failed marriage unkindly. most folks understand how challenging a marriage can be so few would cast stones unless you are tiger woods, Larry king or huang yi liang. There you go, local context. 
              
              I think your issue comes more from within you than anywhere else. Perfectionist? Religious upbringing maybe? A failed marriage can make you a better partner so in that sense you are giving the dude you marry you very best. Well at least the better you with an added benefit of experience. And if you marry a man with broad shoulders, so to speak, he will be able to handle your past with maturity and grace. 
              
              Just curious, how's it that you are in your mid twenties and you have lived and worked in Europe for many years?

              <p>This is my situation:</p>
              <p>I'm a Singaporean girl in my mid 20s who have been living and working overseas for many years. I married and divorced at a very young age. I am once again, looking for a serious relationship that I can form a family with and I would prefer to consider an Asian man, preferbly with a Singaporean as I am looking forward to settle down back home.</p>
              <p>I only have one relationship in my life but I've gone on casual dates with a couple of native Chinese expatriates (by native Chinese, I mean PRCs but I find that term discriminating). I don't mind settling down in China since it's nearer to home as compared to Europe or the States but I think I would prefer Singapore ;-) I don't have many friends or relatives in Singapore and neither do I have Singaporean friends overseas. However, I would like to return home to settle down once I find a good job in Singapore which shouldn't be a big problem I believe.</p>
              <p>My question is would Singaporean men mind a Singaporean girl who has been divorced before? Is there even the slighest problem with the issue of being a divorcee in Singapore? I was married overseas and never held any traditional wedding ceremony. In fact, almost  no one in Singapore knows I was married. Of course if I am in a stable relationship, I will tell the guy about my divorced status, but is it advisable to keep my status as "single" once I'm back home?</p>
              <p>(Disclaimer: This isn't an advertistment, I just want to find out about the local situation.)</p>

              <p>If you have no kid and only divorce, then it will have no problem finding another suitable life time partner.</p>
              <p>Also, you need to be sincere that you are once divorce when you go out with someone you think you can settle down.</p>

              <p>however, if you are looking at men in their mid-20s when they have probably just started working a few years (no thanks to sg gov for taking away 2 yrs for national service), they would have hardly any savings so the gov titbit is a huge chunk of spare change.</p>

              <p>u r right. i guess 90% of sg guys stay with parents until they get married or they reach 35 yrs of age to get a HDB.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>not many are staying alone. renting is not feasible as a room usually cost 600-800 per mth. tt is quite stretching for a fresh grad.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>getting a studio apt is almost impossible unless their parents are willing to throw in the downpayment. even so, the monthly mortgages are eating away a huge chunk of their income.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>coupled with sg small size, there isnt really a need to move out. that explain mostly why most single guys are living with parents well into their 30s.</p>

              <p>Well, I am not sure how singaporeans' perception towards divorce, but I think it is safe to assume that your problem may lie on the older generation aka parents. I think reason for the divorce is also crucial. Is it merely because incompatibility,  financial problem, adultery (if yes, on whose part)?</p>
              <p>There are also other factors such as....family, career, belief, finance, etc etc</p>
