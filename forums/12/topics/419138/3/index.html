              <p>I agree that regarding the issue of a girl's virginity, we're debating in a man's world. I am conversative too. In reality, most Asian men actually do mind. It's just that most people in other parts of Asia also no longer expects their wife to be a virgin, unless she is their university sweetheart. I am not sure about Singapore now, but during my younger days back in Singapore, most still do expect their wife to be one. Actually I can understand the other asians. Unlike Singapore, the other asian countries are huge and their cities can be hundreds of km apart. The singles do not live with their parents, they have their own apartments or student hostels. When living alone outside, many singles tend to be less disciplined. My point about virginity was that, it will not be a topic I have to dispute about if someone uses that against my divorced status. This is because this isn't something I have to hide, i.e. it isn't an affair or it isn't that I slept around randomly while being young and single. I was married.</p>
              <p>As to being divorced and not divorced, sure "unmarried" is definitely a better "deal", if a "deal" is what a person is looking for in a marriage. A more educated wife or a prettier wife also makes a better "deal" for a partner, doesn't it? See my comment to Veggie Bao about listing potential partners in an excel sheet. It's just a matter of, how much Singaporeans in general, mind a divorced status. Is it something that most would definitely not accept, or it is just something that would make them waver when considering a serious relationship with her.</p>

              <p><br>yalor, in fact, those men also, before marrying us, all also dunno lost their virginity long long ago liao...wa lau, what so shame about losing virginity, can sew back by surgery mah, then come back and be virgin again. Divorce rates are increasing and marriage rate is decreasing, some people like my Uncle, married just to get a HDB house, but never live together, each goes on each own life, rent out HDB for 5 or 10 years, later, sell, both earned and share and then, divorce, marrying in singapore can also make money ok.</p>

              <p>Elindra has my reply.</p>
              <p>Anyway, I think there's no need to dispute against mindset about divorcees if it's really just about "virginity". Like I've said, virginity isn't about reputation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As to family and society pressure the guy might face, this could be an issue. That is also a reason why I don't think I should disclose my status to anyone except to the one I'll re-marry.</p>

              <p>I don't think there is a need to disclose this to anyone except to someone you already intend to date seriously.</p>
              <p>Not because there is a need to HIDE but simply because what is the past is the past! It is clear you have moved on from the past, and as long as there is no longer any inconvenient baggage from the previous rship, thats it! You've moved on.</p>
              <p>There is a need to tell the person you intend to marry next - only because your philosophy about life and values change because of your experiences - if anything I think people who have been divorced learn to take their second chance at marriage far more seriously  and with more commitment. But it isn't about accountability - it is about sharing what makes who you are today.</p>

              <p>If u do not see yourself as a divorcee, there should not be a problem with getting to know any man. However, to use another to escape oneself, to fulfil oneself or to prop oneself is heading for another disaster.</p>
              <p>Assuming u do get to know another guy and  if he <span style="text-decoration: underline;">appreciates u for what u are and what u are no</span>t that is in itself is telling that he accepts himself (which is so very impt) and hence this freeing stance of accepting you.</p>
              <p>The same goes for you! <em>One who is unfree on the inside can never free another</em>. As such, one would gravitate towards another only to end up using each other. That is the misery of relationships not that being in a relationship is unwise. It is the misunderstanding, the misinterpretation and the hurrying to cement a relationship all to self-preserve onself thru another in this sleep-walking predicament is accidental. Two self-fufilled individuals have much to share, appreciate and still be. Two personalities (masks) dont and cannot share - it is a mutual benefit scheme.</p>

              <p>@Julian.khor: Hmm...Divorce is definitely not a runaway-solution. But sometimes we don't have a choice, people make mistakes in life. If you mean dating as in a steady, long term relationship between a couple, yet it is a r/ship that does not have a plan for marriage at all, then I wouldn't even get into such a r/ship in the first place. I am looking to form a family back home in Singapore, not for random romances (there are tons of chances out here in Europe for such romances, but I am not in my teens).</p>
              <p>@Veggie Bao: There are different ways of picking your partner, i.e. through sifting out choices because it's time to get married and form a family, or through love. If a very eligible man/woman is gonna pick a woman/man by listing them in an excel sheet and comparing their qualities, then I think being a divorcee is definitely something that would make him/her cross the person out ;-) At least that is the case for some Asian countries like China. I'm not sure about Singapore. But if you're speaking of true love...I think being divorced without children wouldn't really come into question then. Hence I was wondering, how much do Singaporeans actually mind a divorced status.</p>

              is this something that most would definitely not accept, or it is

              <p>Laverne, for an obviously intelligent person, you asked a very dumb 
                      question. There will be men who would never marry a divorced person and,
                       on that same whom-won't-I-marry continuum, there will be others who 
                      would. Even in conservative singapore, you will be surprised by the 
                      plurality of opinions. You may argue that, in general, Singaporean men 
                      will be less keen than their european counterparts in marrying a 
                      divorced woman. But talking in general is useless when you are marrying 
                      just one, not a people.</p>
              <p>How it will play out for you is also 
                      influenced by your own eligibility. J Lo will have her fourth husband if
                       she is so inclined. So if you are young, pretty, rich, and intelligent,
                       you'd stand a good chance in meeting someone who will overlook/accept 
                      the fact that you were married. Assuming he belongs to the group of 
                      folks who prefer a spouse who were never married.</p>
              <p>IMO, you don't have to let a potential mate know about your previous marriage until he becomes so. You will have to make that decision when that point in time is.</p>
