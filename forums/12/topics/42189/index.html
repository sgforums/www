Of course there could also be more complicated reasons but we're not going into the issues here as they're not really related for now....<br><br>1. What you know about her? How do you find out that she's who ya described her to be? Are your sources reliable?<br><br>2. Since she likes to BACKSTAB EVERYBODY, it should make her gossips relatively unreliable to the ears of others. You should not worry too much for now as you've mentioned that whatever she've said about you is UNTRUE. Action speaks louder than words and light shall prevail one day. HOWEVER, sometimes there're just some 'stupid factor' in humans. ie. some of them believe in gossips easily. So....<br><br>3. Your bf should know what is going on. Don't require him to take action or confront against his sister, but just knowing that such a case exist would put things slightly to your advantage. As for his relatives, just be who you are... You can't please everybody... If you can please them GOOD FOR YOU... If ya don't, they probably might not even buy it from you no matter how good you are.....?<br><br>~good luck!<br><br>Regards....</div>

As long as you know, that is the most important part. As for your bf's sister, as much as it hurts to acknowledge the fact, if she was really working well to gel with you, she would be working to support you not aiding in the spread of lies. I think that you should confront her and tell them how hurt you feel that she would go against you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>I know that having a bf with a close-knit family is hard since everyone knows everyone, and I know this is easier said than done, but you have to have pride in yourself, and keep your head high. Eventually, rumors fade away and things get back into the normal groove  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Its good to know that at least you have your boyfriend supporting you and that you are not completely lonely.The best way to solve this is to ask your bf's sister to meet you somewhere and ask your boyfriend to tell her that all those rumors that she is believing in are not true and that she is jealous of your bf's attention since she is his sister and is trying to spread all this kind of rumors. I am sure that once your boyfriend talks to her, she will definitely believe him and that way you will have all your trust back. You can also try to talk to her about this problem and if she is unwilling,ask your boyfriend to talk to her because many times, people tend to believe others and they dont actually believe the one who is close to them.<br><br>It takes some time, but usually things turn out for the best. In the meantime, take comfort in your bf and your family and take care of yourself. Keep your head high, and ignore the thoughts of others. take care and hang in there.<br><br>Cheers  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
