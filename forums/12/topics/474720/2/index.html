              <p>if u read thru the replies of others the general idea is that u shld not set out and try to live by yerself at age 16</p>
              <p>However shld u choose to I respect yer decision which u r ultimately responsible for.</p>
              <p>I will however tell you why it prob will fail.</p>
              <ol>
              <li>at age 16, your wages will probably be very little....in other words u will be cheap labour</li>
              <li>to rent a house - yer looking at upwards of $3k a month. In other words to pay for freedom = $3,000.00 per month. Assuming u want the cheapest possible ... you could rent a room for maybe $4-600 per month.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>With your miserable wage and the rent you will need to pay. Your studies will most likely suffer.</p>
              <p>And unfortunately in the dog eat dog world that is Singapore without education it will be a major setback.</p>

              <p>I think its best you stick to your mum....just tried to ignore her scoldings loh...living and renting a room can be a temp solution only...when the real world kick-in, you'll regret leaving the house....you'll need at least 1.5K job and will you still be studying? If so you'll need even more $ for fees, expenditures, textbooks, etc. I don't think its wise to leave just yet...treat it like a training...</p>
              <p>I have a friend whom had almost the same propblems as you....he endured until he graduated from the University...then he left the dreadful place...</p>
              <p>I would suggest you do the same...get the education first....endure....good things will happen!</p>
              <p>If you can't wait that long...and don't want to study anymore, you can leave immediately and get a "buddy" to share room with you....can mean $250.00 if possible...then if you work a simple job in retail, maybe can get $1.5K salary....should be enough to start your life over! Good luck! It'll be tough but its your choice!</p>

              <p>A little girl had a big argument with her mom, and ran away from
              home. After a while she was hungry and saw a roadside noodle stall.
              The stall owner, seeing her in a sad condition ask if she wanted to
              eat. She replied that she was very hungry but have no money. The
              uncle cook her a bowl of noodles. She thank the uncle profusely
              saying how nice he is. The uncle replied that he only cook one bwl
              of noodles. There is someone who will provide her food, place to
              stay and education. The girl was surprised who will do that for
              her. The uncle continued to say that this person did not receive
              the gratitude that he have received from her.</p>
              <p>Her mother has been providing food, place to stay and education.
              But she choose to get angry over other issues. Did anybody force
              her mother to take care of her?</p>

              <p>Story.</p>
              <p>A little girl was being emotionally abused at home by her mentally unsound mother. She would rountinely accused the Dad of the girl of posioning her food, drinks and sabatoging her career, hiring people to spike her food. She would also drag her daugther into the accusation, crying to her little girl on how much pain she is in, to the extent of showing her "posioned saliva" and calling the police to the home. She neglected the emotional well-being of the girl, pushing the adult's responsibility and pain on her when she was only 11. She never talk to her and ask her for her problems, she never knew that the girl was routinely bullied in school, her teachers scolds her everyday and her failing grades, she only saw her problems not her daugther's pain and suffering at school. The girl never once spoke about her problems at school. </p>
