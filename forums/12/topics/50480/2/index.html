What is your most objective assessment of the situation? If you decide that it's best to discontinue contact as it will only fuel your feelings for her (after you've decided to let go completely), that may be the best for that situation.

She didn't use the 'let's be frens' reason though.

However, if it has to be done, it has to be done. Its just that i need some pple (pang2 guan1 zhe3 qing1) to give me their opinion from an unbiased basis. I thank u sincerely from the bottom of my heart for giving me the above advice. It does help in a way  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>Not forgetting the others who have kindly (though sometimes curtly) given me their views....thank you so very much!</div>

There's more than just her out there in this world.

THat would be a good sign. And if you happen to be ready , and of cuz if she is ready too. Things might just work out well.<br><br>At least she looks for you when she needs help. But as i said, friend or lover chemistry, this one no one will know except yourself. You can go out alot of times and still have the friends chemistry only. You can don't go out at all and yet have the lovers chemistry over the phone. Too many factors to consider.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Gary25....sounds like you are really pinning for her...<br><br>since u asked her to be ur stead before, i dont find it hard for you to ask her again. but of coz u gotta state ur stand so that she feels safe to continue a platonic friendship with you if she is still not keen to be ur gf.<br><br>***<br><br>just wish to clarify something.....were u ever attracted (at all) to any of those guys who wished to go steady with u? im sure u would have found some of those guys, or at least one, who u felt would make a good bf (of cos u must have the chemistry with him to begin with).....<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">i was asked twice by 2 guys. one was prob in a haste...coz he got some kinda image problem. he is a malay guy and he hates his height. so i know his style is to frequent get acquainted with a companion to show to others that he is wanted. of coz this is really obvious. i rejected him straight away...told him that i prefer to be friends.<br><br>the second guy i rejected...after that i kinda regretted...but thinking of it there was no turning back. he was my internet friend fr irc and we exchanged a lot of emails and seemed to him both of us got chemistry. oh well to me he seems to be someone who i can email a lot with. we didnt really get on the fone...but mainly on messengers...but he asked me to be his stead without knowing how i look like.actually it was just purely this reason that i rejected him...coz i felt that i wont accept someone who did not 'analyse a person wholey...that includes looks....i want to make it fair to the other party. and also another reason is that i am not confident in a distance r/ship. he was at then preparing to study in melb.<br><br>we went out twice...but no sparks i suppose...prob coz i already said no. later on he told me he got attached with a sg girl studying in adelaide...oh well if i told him abt what was i actually thinking... maybe i wont say 'no' in that haste manner if the clock turns back.<br><br>later on i had few more encounters esp when i started working. got some jerks...and some nice guys...yes i do have someone in mind now...but i dunno how will it progress</span><br><br>quote:<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>personally i rate chemistry as the highest factor in deciding if i want to be together with someone. if i feel something for a guy, the ways i show interest is by taking interest on what are his interests...being initiative and basically more communication. but nevertheless i will never pop the question of being his stead...~ this is the only thing i wont do...<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>may i ask y that is so?<br><br>i<span style="font-style: italic;">t is a personal preference. i prefer my hubby to be family oriented...so actually guys who likes kids do appeal a lot to me. and with a heart of gold...actually i only discovered i have this soft spot for such pple. basically i know i need someone of a complimenting personality so that both of us can 'fill in each other's flaws'.<br><br>i feel that i am still a woman after all...guys shld do the chasing...despite having some 'tomboyish' personalities. i dun think that being tomboyish must have that crew cut look or flat chested look. i can still look elegant and feminine on outside, but i am quite 'strong-headed' within...~</span></div>
