Think, if the amount of time spend together outside, etc is not bringing her to talk about herself occasionally - then that should be a utter failure right?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Share about her personality is a small, but advantageous, step in your final goal. Continue onwards and if done naturally, she will be communicating with her inner realm with you. Alot of friend wouldn't bother to ask much? Because they ain't interested in her wor... in the Art of Seduction: observing details is crucial.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Now for the question about barriers: The Barrier theories works as a psychological defense in protecting your mind and heart. People are defensive about their personal thoughts is because not everyone love to share themselves with others. The sharing part is like a gift from the emperor - only those whom they feel is trustworthy/best friends/pals/etc, they would.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>The counter for Barrier Theory is to march indirectly into your goals - Nobody ask you to barge into the fortress gate and combat the troops stationed there. She will get defensive because your inner thoughts is something you share willingly - not pressured to. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>The effect is like a flower - luring the bees with its scent, indirectly helping the flowers to pollen its seeds.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> There are many ways in trying to achieve that effect.

I sorta said that he shld go chase her cos he told me that he had some feelings for her (her character was magnetic)....However, he told me that he had confided his feelings for her with her bro and her bro told him to back off! now i dunno wat happened between the two of them (my classmate and her bro) but apparently the same thing did not happen to me. Now to me, that could be becos of two reasons: one, he doesn't know that i like his sis too.....or two, he doesn't mind me being with her, which again i think is kinda ridiculous.....</div>

Wait Gary25 become more entangleed inside the relationship deeper and then IF the outcome is negative then he will be very hurt. I agree with fumih_21.<br><br>Chemistry is the most important factor and it is definitely not an overstatement.<br><br>Mind you when i say chemistry, its not chemistry between good friends where you can chat and talk, its a lover's kind of chemistry, They are worlds apart.<br><br>If she has the feelings for you then it will be nothing can change that for the moment, if she does not have any feelings for you then no matter how hard you try, it's not going to be a "happily ever after" kindof ending.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Does she like any other guy now?</div>
