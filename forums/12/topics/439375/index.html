              <p>*Warning: Long Post*</p>
              <p>I know of someone who is living a lie.</p>
              <p>[Background info]<br><br>He's just a below average student who has a good command of english vocabulary. He likes to brag and very narcassistic. He went to a neighbourhood school, didn't do well for his O levels except an A1 for his english. His math &amp; Science were F9 &amp; E8 respectively.<br><br>After O lvls, he took a private diploma course. And then he decided to take his private A levels. Before his results were out, he was bragging that he was going to the UK to study at LSE. When the A lvls results were out, he was silent. Very unusual for someone who loves to boast around.</p>
              <p>Somehow, a few months later, he publicly declared that he's an intern for KhattarWong. When someone questioned him on his admission for intenship as he has yet to complete his 1st year law studies, he replied that he was a special case.<br><br>When one of his friends who got into khattarwong as an intern, he couldnt answer her who was his mentor.</p>
              <p>A few months after, he went to LSE singapore orientation programme and made friends. When UK unis term is about to start in sept, he told them that he was going to cambridge uni instead. When people questioned him that how could that be possible since offers were closed by June. Again, he replied that he was a special case. <br><br>Of course he lied to everyone that he was from RI. He met up with RI juniors. Even bought the school uniform.</p>
              <p>His family is not rich and his parents are divorced. Both living in HDB flats. But he claimed to everyone that he lives in a landed property etc.</p>
              <p>And his stories on romance is clearly right from a novel and fantasy. How a girl could not want him because he is too rich.</p>
              <p>And his father was arrested for impersonation as a police officer before. But he claims that once he graduated from Cambridge uni, he will be given by his father a law firm, and boasting that his father is a famous lawyer that non have heard of.</p>
              <p>He even took photos from the internet of london and paris claiming that he took them. It was obvious that those photos were taken from different cameras.</p>
              <p>Now he's claiming that he's an intern for the ministry of law. In a year or two, he's going to 'graduate' and I am afraid that his deception will escalate and he would impersonate as a lawyer then.<br><br>I personally think he's a sick individual who needs help. I've tried many times to help him to make sense. And all he did was sprewing vulgarities at me. <br><br>I am someone who was very close to him and when he registered for his A levels as a private candidate, I was there. The last time I tried to put some sense to him, he replied that 'I got into RI, but I never told you'. <br><br>Is he breaking the law or anything with his deception and lies. If I cant put some sense to him, maybe the law can.</p>

              <p>If he is lying then yes it is breaking the law, because it involves fraud.......for example supplying false information, or even giving fake documents.</p>
              <p>Even if everything is not on paper (no fake documents) but just by verbal lies only, I would say it is still qualifying as breaking the law.</p>

              <p>He is not breaking any law by telling you his tall tales.</p>
              <p>He is a compulsive liar. There is nothing wrong with him. He just like to spin some details of his life. I have a friend like that also. I just listen and never take him seriously, on whatever he say, even on the rare occasions when he is telling the truth. He is a fun guy and a joker. Those fibs are harmless, and it is not any information you rely on that are crucial to you.</p>
              <p>But when you want to talk about him to another person, don't forget to add the words "He said he blah blah blah...."</p>
              <p>Don't destroy his world.</p>
