              Your close friend is suffering from inferiority complex because he had an unhappy childhood.
              
              He did not commit any offence because no one or organisation has suffered any loss as a result of his lies.

              <p>Thank you for your responses. <br><br>He was a good friend of mine. And he's getting from bad to worse.<br><br>He may not break any law YET.<br><br>And his lies only make him more bitter to his friends as well.</p>
              <p>He doesnt want to listen to me. Instead, he thinks I am pest.</p>
              <p>And the think is, I've chatted with some of his friends and mutual friends that he lied to, and ALL of them knew or at least has doubts of his stories. Those who were close asked me to help him get help. Others just laugh behind his back. He's really making a fool of himself.</p>
              <p>I dont know how to help someone who doesnt want any help. I was hoping the law could at least mend his ways.</p>
              <p>He's still in his early 20s. Instead of lying to ppl, I would prefer that he chase after his dreams than living a lie. Then what happens after 10 years from now? What is he going to do?</p>
              <p>I dont know why I still care when I shouldnt. After all those times he called me names after I tried to wake him up.</p>

              <p>he is living in dreamland.he needs help before everyone in bedok area end up really tasting part of him.</p>
              <p>its best he seek help from a psychologist or professionals which he might strongly decline.</p>
              <p>best is you get 10 thugs to force him to produce results or end up getting beaten up severely.thats the cheaper and effective way.</p>

              <p>*Warning: Long Post*</p>
              <p>I know of someone who is living a lie.</p>
              <p>[Background info]<br> <br> He's just a below average student who has a good command of english
              vocabulary. He likes to brag and very narcassistic. He went to a
              neighbourhood school, didn't do well for his O levels except an A1
              for his english. His math &amp; Science were F9 &amp; E8
              respectively.<br> <br> After O lvls, he took a private diploma course. And then he decided
              to take his private A levels. Before his results were out, he was
              bragging that he was going to the UK to study at LSE. When the A
              lvls results were out, he was silent. Very unusual for someone who
              loves to boast around.</p>
              <p>Somehow, a few months later, he publicly declared that he's an
              intern for KhattarWong. When someone questioned him on his
              admission for intenship as he has yet to complete his 1st year law
              studies, he replied that he was a special case.<br> <br> When one of his friends who got into khattarwong as an intern, he
              couldnt answer her who was his mentor.</p>
              <p>A few months after, he went to LSE singapore orientation
              programme and made friends. When UK unis term is about to start in
              sept, he told them that he was going to cambridge uni instead. When
              people questioned him that how could that be possible since offers
              were closed by June. Again, he replied that he was a special
              case.<br> <br> Of course he lied to everyone that he was from RI. He met up with
              RI juniors. Even bought the school uniform.</p>
              <p>His family is not rich and his parents are divorced. Both living
              in HDB flats. But he claimed to everyone that he lives in a landed
              property etc.</p>
              <p>And his stories on romance is clearly right from a novel and
              fantasy. How a girl could not want him because he is too rich.</p>
              <p>And his father was arrested for impersonation as a police
              officer before. But he claims that once he graduated from Cambridge
              uni, he will be given by his father a law firm, and boasting that
              his father is a famous lawyer that non have heard of.</p>
              <p>He even took photos from the internet of london and paris
              claiming that he took them. It was obvious that those photos were
              taken from different cameras.</p>
              <p>Now he's claiming that he's an intern for the ministry of law.
              In a year or two, he's going to 'graduate' and I am afraid that his
              deception will escalate and he would impersonate as a lawyer
              then.<br> <br> I personally think he's a sick individual who needs help. I've
              tried many times to help him to make sense. And all he did was
              sprewing vulgarities at me.<br> <br> I am someone who was very close to him and when he registered for
              his A levels as a private candidate, I was there. The last time I
              tried to put some sense to him, he replied that 'I got into RI, but
              I never told you'.<br> <br> Is he breaking the law or anything with his deception and lies. If
              I cant put some sense to him, maybe the law can.</p>
              <p>Thanks for reading this very long post.</p>

              <p>i guess it depends on what motivates him to lie.</p>
              <p>personal gain? low self esteem? habitual? addiction? what's your take? </p>
              <p>trying to scare him into stopping with the law may not be effective. he has a make believe life, career, home, education so far... he'll be putting up a tough fight to keep his lies together. </p>

              <p>he may benefit from professional therapy. at this moment they remain conjectures... low self esteem... learned behaviour from his parents... there may be deeper underlying causes and triggers too.</p>
              <p>is therapy an option for him? will he be open to it?</p>
              <p>just a personal suggestion... as human beings... if we have a positive experience, in his case perhaps an incident resulting from something nice and 'real' he did... a situation or an accomplishment he can take pride in without having to lie or embellish to anyone else, we seek to recreate those experiences again. so we either succumb to 1) punishment (the threat of jail), 2) negative or 3) positive reinforcements. </p>
              <p>just my 2 cents worth.</p>
              <p>btw he must have done something right to have a friend like you through these years. </p>
