              <p>how? i always can't seem to balance out things well. there was a
              period of time i tried to keep to myself abit and he told me he

              and their aborted child. he told me if i break with him cause of
              that, it will be the worse decision i made. he say he'll help me
              get over but... i seriously don't how to get over that fact. he
              still sometime will think of her and that child. but he explain
              that he no longer dwell in the past anymore?</p>

              <p>don't interpret him, instead interpret yourself and what you want out of life.</p>
              <p><em>"one time i told him he likes to avoid problems, he say not all
                                      things need to be solved. really there are problems

              <p>I think you're just confused and too soft-hearted and "in love" to leave this guy. Maybe you need someone strong and convicted in their beliefs to look up to as a role model bf. But all that I see from here are his excuses and though he comes off as strong in his stance, he is not a good model. All that he is good for, is to confuse you and draw you away from what you think is right and draw u off your reality further and further. Perhaps one day, even when he declare that an apple is really an orange, though confuse you are, you would still choose to believe him. Wake up! Can you see what he is doing to you? This has nothing to do with religion, more to do with his weird character and the harmful effects he's having on you.</p>
              <p>WAKE UP!</p>

              <p>you are turning to him because you think he gives you a sense of purpose in life and that he directs you. Dear girl, have more confidence in yourself. You deserve a better guy. Allow yourself to be treated well by others and don't be too embarrassed if others are nice to you.</p>
              <p>otherwise, you'd be trapped in this vicious cycle of confusion and the cold and hot treatment he deems fit to treat u by him. How he live his life is his, how people are going to treat you is under YOUR control. You can always walk away if you feel some people are not respecting you and it is within your control to make new and better friends. You are not helpless.</p>

              <p>Is he your first bgr relationship ?</p>
              <p>Have you tried out other guys yet ?</p>
              <p>If you experience the same with several other guys.. then yes.. you are over sensitive.</p>
              <p>If he is the first guy.. you won't be able to judge yourself... because there is nothing else to compare to.</p>
              <p>I suggest you give this relationship a break.... after you have tasted other flavor.. then you decide if this guy is right for you.</p>
              <p>Surely.. before you spend $200 on a dress.. you would have tried on several different dresses before you settle in with the one that fits you best, feels most comfortable and makes you shine ..... yes ?</p>
              <p>So girl.. don't fret.. don't let someone else makes you think you are inferior.. because you are not.</p>
