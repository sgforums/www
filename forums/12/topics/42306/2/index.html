Ok, just yesterday, I went out with my ex gf.. I met her at around 6pm at city hall mrt station, before that I smsed her and asked her where she was and she said that her train was reaching kallang a, den I replied back telling her I was at kallang already, what a coincidence. Then after boarding the train, I chose a seat and sit down, playing with my hp.<br>When I reached city hall, I called her to ask where is she, then she say she reached liao. At that time, I were getting nervous already. I didnÂ’t know what she look like now as I havenÂ’t seen her for 3 years +. Then I looked around.. no sign of her. Den she said Â“ IÂ’m on your rightÂ”.. so I turned right, then left, still canÂ’t see, so she said Â“I think I saw youÂ”. Then my heart beat faster, and faster and I saw her walking towards me. Omg, Â“she look gorgeousÂ” I told myself, her hair is straight, with highlights and she wore a square dangling earing on her right and a chain like earing on her left and sheÂ’s still as cute as she was in sec 3 that time.. she is the type of girl I like.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> . I started the conversation with Â“eh, I thought you on the same train with me, how come you are over thereÂ”. I was quite nervous, so I also dunno what the hell IÂ’m asking. Then we continue our conversation while we were walking together, we donÂ’t know where we are walking to, but just walked on... we walked from citylink to suntec city to buy the movie tickets for DreamCatcher.. after buying the tickets, I suggested walking to marina square.. then she said sheÂ’s hungry, so I asked her what she would like to eat, and she suggested Â‘simply thaiÂ’, so we walked back to citylink and we saw a queue over there, then I suggested Â“sakae sushiÂ” then she look at me and give me the kind of angry face that says Â‘I want to kill u for asking me to walk so far and walk back againÂ’ then I was giggling and showed her my tongue..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  But I enjoyed walking here and there doing nothing, chatting with her .. den when we reached suntec city, she say Â“Why not we go marche and eat?Â” den I agreed..<br>After we found our seats, we sat down awhile as she said that the queues were quite long and why not sit down and chat. After chatting for about 5 mins, I suggested we go and choose our food. While I was looking around, she pull my arm with her delicate fingers for a while.. I suddenly felt closer to her, just like last time.. my heart sank and i followed her willingly. We went around looking for what to eat, and I left her alone there at the fish stall while I went over to the steak stall.. during dinner, I looked into her eyes while I was talking to her, but I looked away a few times as I was feeling abit shy. We chatted about our secondary school classmates..  I was hoping that the time will slow down and we could sit there for the next few hours.. but, fat hope. After dinner, we did sat down for awhile and chatted as the movie starts at 9.15 and itÂ’s only 8 at that time..<br>few minutes later, we continued our journey. I was quiet for some time as I could not think of anything to say. So again, we walked with no directions in our mind. We went to several hp shops as she said she wanted to buy a new phone for herself.. Then I saw a model shop and decided to go in and look at car models, I noticed that she like cute cars and vintage cars.. but not for me, I still prefer the Evo 7s. and later, we went to Harvey Norman, or some electrical store, walked around, looking at softwares, tv, handphones, cameras, blah blah blah ..<br>then, itÂ’s about time to go to the cinema as the show is going to start.. When we reached the cinema, we sat down and we were silent for 10 minutes.. During that time, I was thinking about the times when we were together at bishan, watching movie together last time. Feeling abit sad also ..<br>During the show, there was some part which were scarry and she used her hand to cover her eyes, and I was beside her looking and laughing at her. Opps, then she turn around and hit me on my arm to shut me up.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> After the show, I send her home on the cab, I didnÂ’t bare to leave her.. but I donÂ’t know how to tell her, her mum called her during the show and asked her what time sheÂ’s going one, and she said soon.<br>After she left the cab, I was all alone by myself, feeling happy, as IÂ’ve just seen her since 3 years ago and sad while thinking of the times we were together when I was in sec 4.<br><br>IÂ’m really lost now, I donÂ’t know whether I should go back to her or I should leave her alone. SheÂ’s not attached at the moment. I feel sad when I think of the times when we were happily together, going to the library and study, went to the library at orchard, sit down together and reading together, we also took a train frm I think kallang to boon lay for no reason, and gone back to city hall if I didnÂ’t remembered wrongly.. Help! What should I do?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br></div></blockquote>Firstly, wat is the reason u 2 broke up 3 years ago? Watever it is this reason is important as u haf to overcome it if u want to et back together with her.<br><br>Secondly, find out if she stil love u... ad if u still love her truely... Afterall, u 2 did left each other once. So confirm this feelings  before u make any decision. If u love her and she love u, u shld noe wat to do. If its a one party thing, sad to say, pls let it be...<br><br>Since she is not attached... and if things turn our tight for the above 2 cases...

            <div class='col-md body'>What you are feeling now is only temporary. You may feel good seeing your ex. now no matter what the reason is behind the break-off. But be rational and don't make mistake again.<br><br>I relate this to an analogy....<br>Lover is just like a book. Before you start reading it, you feel like you are in some kind of suspense and hope to read it through. The cruel fact is that once you have come to the last chapter, you most probably going to leave that book alone on your shelf again because you have known the story. Very seldom would you read it again. But imagine if you were to read it again after a long time, perhaps you have forgotten the story and like to read it again to fill up the blanks in your mind regarding the story that you vaguely remember, the feeling is like when you first read this book.<br><br>The analogy is the same here when you meet her. It's natural to feel close to her now and the more so, that you have not seen her for long, cos that was what attracted you to her in the first place. But, be rational and think what went so wrong that you have to break? If that is so serious... do you think if you are to get back together, the feeling (maybe the rocky relationship) that you have would not repeat but only the close chemisty feeling will?<br>Think about it carefully.<br><br>Of course, i'm not saying that once finished reading a book, everyone would find it not interesting anymore. What I'm saying in fact is, whether you remember what attracted you to read that book and even you have come to the last chapter, how much have you understood from the story? And do you feel as attracted to that book as before though finished reading.<br><br>I can tell you my book is a colourful one and never will I get tired even though I have come to the last chapter. I just enjoy reading it again and again.<br><br>What about you...?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

I will be happy to get to know and understand her better again before i go any further.. </div></blockquote>Hey! How r u doing? Actually they're all quite rite. And you seemed to have sort things out within yourself these few years as well. Being possessive is not really a veri bad thing, afterall u loved her. But being over-possesive is a diff story. Too bad u din have a good tok wif her about her hugging her ex thingie. Now, history is well, history. During the years while u guys are apart, she prob. have experienced things that have changed her personality and expectations in life and I assumed you have too. It'd be good to really understand how she feels now and what she has become...afterall trust is a very impt. foundation in a relationship tat works....u noe my 1st bf din trust me one bit and is always very insecure, in the end, he decided to wait for me to grow older and then start a relationship again. But it doesn't work tat way for me. If he had trusted me, things will be a diff story. So u see, u have to see and weigh if you can ever step into the relationship wif her (if things work out well) wif trust again. Perhaps spend more time with her as a fren, let her also understand you as the person u have grown into. Let her feel that she can communicate all things wif you. Then perhaps when u guys do get tog., she can also learn to respect tat u will rather she be honest wif u then destroy trust by lying.  Cheers!</div>
