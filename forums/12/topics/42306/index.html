            <div class='col-md body'>A story to share with you all and need some comments or help from you people. Ok, just yesterday, I went out with my ex gf.. I met her at around 6pm at city hall mrt station, before that I smsed her and asked her where she was and she said that her train was reaching kallang a, den I replied back telling her I was at kallang already, what a coincidence. Then after boarding the train, I chose a seat and sit down, playing with my hp.<br>When I reached city hall, I called her to ask where is she, then she say she reached liao. At that time, I were getting nervous already. I didnÂ’t know what she look like now as I havenÂ’t seen her for 3 years +. Then I looked around.. no sign of her. Den she said Â“ IÂ’m on your rightÂ”.. so I turned right, then left, still canÂ’t see, so she said Â“I think I saw youÂ”. Then my heart beat faster, and faster and I saw her walking towards me. Omg, Â“she look gorgeousÂ” I told myself, her hair is straight, with highlights and she wore a square dangling earing on her right and a chain like earing on her left and sheÂ’s still as cute as she was in sec 3 that time.. she is the type of girl I like.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> . I started the conversation with Â“eh, I thought you on the same train with me, how come you are over thereÂ”. I was quite nervous, so I also dunno what the hell IÂ’m asking. Then we continue our conversation while we were walking together, we donÂ’t know where we are walking to, but just walked on... we walked from citylink to suntec city to buy the movie tickets for DreamCatcher.. after buying the tickets, I suggested walking to marina square.. then she said sheÂ’s hungry, so I asked her what she would like to eat, and she suggested Â‘simply thaiÂ’, so we walked back to citylink and we saw a queue over there, then I suggested Â“sakae sushiÂ” then she look at me and give me the kind of angry face that says Â‘I want to kill u for asking me to walk so far and walk back againÂ’ then I was giggling and showed her my tongue..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  But I enjoyed walking here and there doing nothing, chatting with her .. den when we reached suntec city, she say Â“Why not we go marche and eat?Â” den I agreed..<br>After we found our seats, we sat down awhile as she said that the queues were quite long and why not sit down and chat. After chatting for about 5 mins, I suggested we go and choose our food. While I was looking around, she pull my arm with her delicate fingers for a while.. I suddenly felt closer to her, just like last time.. my heart sank and i followed her willingly. We went around looking for what to eat, and I left her alone there at the fish stall while I went over to the steak stall.. during dinner, I looked into her eyes while I was talking to her, but I looked away a few times as I was feeling abit shy. We chatted about our secondary school classmates..  I was hoping that the time will slow down and we could sit there for the next few hours.. but, fat hope. After dinner, we did sat down for awhile and chatted as the movie starts at 9.15 and itÂ’s only 8 at that time..<br>few minutes later, we continued our journey. I was quiet for some time as I could not think of anything to say. So again, we walked with no directions in our mind. We went to several hp shops as she said she wanted to buy a new phone for herself.. Then I saw a model shop and decided to go in and look at car models, I noticed that she like cute cars and vintage cars.. but not for me, I still prefer the Evo 7s. and later, we went to Harvey Norman, or some electrical store, walked around, looking at softwares, tv, handphones, cameras, blah blah blah ..<br>then, itÂ’s about time to go to the cinema as the show is going to start.. When we reached the cinema, we sat down and we were silent for 10 minutes.. During that time, I was thinking about the times when we were together at bishan, watching movie together last time. Feeling abit sad also ..<br>During the show, there was some part which were scarry and she used her hand to cover her eyes, and I was beside her looking and laughing at her. Opps, then she turn around and hit me on my arm to shut me up.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> After the show, I send her home on the cab, I didnÂ’t bare to leave her.. but I donÂ’t know how to tell her, her mum called her during the show and asked her what time sheÂ’s going one, and she said soon.<br>After she left the cab, I was all alone by myself, feeling happy, as IÂ’ve just seen her since 3 years ago and sad while thinking of the times we were together when I was in sec 4.<br><br>IÂ’m really lost now, I donÂ’t know whether I should go back to her or I should leave her alone. SheÂ’s not attached at the moment. I feel sad when I think of the times when we were happily together, going to the library and study, went to the library at orchard, sit down together and reading together, we also took a train frm I think kallang to boon lay for no reason, and gone back to city hall if I didnÂ’t remembered wrongly.. Help! What should I do?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br></div>

The key personals involve you and your ex gf.

If so, possible regret about that *last* relationship? The desire to be in a relationship?<br><br>III) 3 years passed - time change, people change: She is definitely not the girl you knew 3 years back. There would be differences since then - check it out.<br><br>You could try and attempt to get back, and if you DO get back with her - show grow and maturity since the previous time you both were together, well at least, it will seemed that this period of rest does the both of you well. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear kohanson,<br><br>They say that true love is the only love that lasts forever. I believe there are many kinds of love, and true love is just a phrase people use to aggrandize their feelings  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><strong>Love</strong><br>it comes so many different ways and lasts for all different times... and with the least expected people! So, yes, it's perfectly possible for you to be in love with ur ex. In all honestly, this is not for me to decide. The best advice i can give you is to follow your heart. it will never lie and if you can listen to it without your head getting in the way... you will know. She is a great girl and u share many memories with her but why did u break up with her in the first place?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>Love knows no age. The only reason adults say that teenagers can't be in love is because at this age it is virtually impossible to understand it. And that's just the way it is. And even adults don't understand it very well. But, if you really think it may be, then your best bet is to just let it grow and not worry about it. Being in love isn't something you should fret about at this age.... when it's real.... you will know it for sure and won't have any question or doubt in your mind at all. Seriously... have a GREAT time like always when you are with her and just live it up from there. Ask her out often<br><br>But, i will warn you. If you are in love, or believe to be in love... watch how you handle that person's heart, and how she handles yours... cause it will hurt more than you can imagine. There is no telling how long you will last, and i bet you two talk about the future together... it's a wonderful thing and lots of fun.... but... it makes the hurt even more if or when you broke up. Good luck to you  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> ... and just follow your heart. Remember.. it's not a good relationship if you dun share anything in common.<br><br>Cheers  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>P.S. If all fails, pass me her hp number  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>By the way anson...My best advice to you would to just keep yourself busy and hang out with friends and family and don't let yourself just sit and brood about the whole situation. You also have to realize that the only thing you can do now is to just learn from the whole experience and make positive what seems very negative to you. Also, just be patient with yourself, as the only thing that's really going to fix things up is,time.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>I have learned from others advice, that it is very helpful to this sort of emotional pain to think about something or someone else. Just don't dwell on your past. Try to get something creative to do instead of self-pity. Look around for other girls. There are other girls out there besides the one that you just broke up with. Give other people a chance! That way you don't have to worry about missing out on someone great.<br><br>Love is merely an emotion produced by chemicals in your blood. If you want to forget her, you can think in terms of pride: are you really going to let some chemical in your blood rule you forever, make you so miserable? Start reasoning that way, and you will soon find yourself over her. This always works for me when it comes to resisting females, so I am confident in saying that it will help you as well.<br><br>I hope this helps  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
