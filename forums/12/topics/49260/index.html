            <div class='col-md body'>It is common for couples to lose interest in sex once they have sex too many times already. Cool it and give each other time off.<br><br>There is no cure to this becos once you lose your sexual drive with the other person you can not revive it up to 100 % again. Live with it, besides, physically we are less capable to have sex as we age, so accept this as natural degression.<br><br>If you subscribe to alternative lifestyle , you can join those who swop partners. This will revive your sex drive, but not intended for anyone.</div>

A routine relationship will dampen intimancy in later stage because psychological effect.<br><br>Combination of these two reduced your wanting to have intimate contacts with him.

Ok....<br><br>Yes, you can put the blame on work stress.. (who says you can't anyway..?? Hehheh...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> ) But that certainly doesn't mean that you can't do something about it...? And I suppose that's why you're posting it here..?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Let's see... Does your bf know much or feel much about this issue? Have ya discussed it with him before...? Well, it's certainly a good way to start..? 1st of all, let him know that you're experiencing much stress from work and you somehow feel that it's affecting your 'relationship' with him... In verbal words, e-mails, letters, sms or through phone... Whichever way you're more comfortable with...? (now, talk about the advantages of technology advancements..?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> ) ENDS with this... Let him know that you would like very much to do something about it... (in a positive way... and it's IMPORTANT you let him know that you're not blaming him... Cause some guys just tends to have STUPID thoughts...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> )<br><br>Some things you can do :<br><br>1. Do the relaxing things the two of you used to do together... Enjoying the moments... And it would be NICE only if you make sure that you have abundant time together for these occasions... Don't rush... Do things slowly and naturally... Make SURE that none of you is rushing off for any appointment after that...?<br><br>2. BALANCE work &amp; life... This is a GENERAL approach... For work stress can not only deteriorates your love life... It can also affect your health, friends' social circle and family ties etc... The LAST thing you want is MORE COMPLICATIONS into the matter... Keep AFLOAT.. It's YOUR LIFE... Learn to handle and manage it EFFICIENTLY.....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>3. Learn TECHNIQUES to relax... Aromatic therapy... GYM and sports... Light mediation... Breathing techniques... Whatever which would be of much help...<br><br>4. Realise it's A DIFFERENT world... WORK and AFTER work... People tends to feel tired after a day of work... But they've probably forgotten! Life has JUST BEGAN! Is your life all about the paper works and jobs..?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  HELL! NO, OF COURSE! Your ACTUAL life begins AFTER your work... So are you gonna WASTE your life away...?<br><br>5. Learn to LOVE &amp; ENJOY your job... A way to REDUCE work stress... If you know how to manage and cope with your job scope and duty effectively and balance the priorities and importance of things.... Make jobs easy, make life even easier for you...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>6. ESCAPE from the 'reality'! IF all things' really SO TIGHT... Both of you should plan for an 'escapade'...? Be it a local venture or an overseas trip... Set aside EVERYTHING and create those SPECIAL MOMENTS for YOURSELVES only (privated &amp; limited... Hehheh...  &lt;:mrgreen<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> ....?<br><br>Wish these advices would have been of much help?
