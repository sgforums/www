Therefore there is no 100% that you enjoy to grow old, in my teaching, the ability to grow old and walk the end of life is a blessing, not a torture or something of a worry, should be a celebration, welcome the old instead of everyday wasting time and money worrying it and trying hard to look and stay young is much better ya.

              <p>ah! but within the emptyiness, lies the true.</p>
              <p>My master once answered my question as follow</p>
              <p>Master nun of the Hwa mountain: Lingmei, what are you thinking? go kitchen steal food again??</p>
              <p>Lingmei: no lah, master, i am just wondering, if buddha keep teach emptyiness in to us in his empty sutra, that was is the point of life, simply nothing</p>
              <p>Master: So far, among my disciplines, only you bring up this question, this show that you think well, very smart too. Listen Lingmei, the meaning of empty in buddha teaching is not about totally emptyiness, in true, it is to forgive, and if can, forget and move on. In whatever we do, we need to have a empty mind inorder to be conscious of what we are doing, if your mind is full of thinking of what that is not suppose to think about anymore, you cannot concentrate on the next thing that you are going to do. To enter Nirvana, you need to empty all of what you have here and before. Look at the rubbish bin, if in the morning you do not clear it, then nobody can throw their rubbish, because the bin had become full. Empty oneself mind before going to work, study or simply shopping is good for health and one consciousness.</p>
              <p>Lingmei: Thank you master for the teaching, i go empty the rubbish bin first...run!!!</p>

              <p><br>in life, there is nothing much to settle about, remember, humans are like same as animal, just that we are the most intelligent, but we do hv the instinct to migrate, as herd move and bird fly from one place to another, humans are the same, they dun like to be stagnant in one place, they like to move around, from point A to B to C, so I will not just settle now just becos i like someone or someone like me, i prefer to be free and able to migrate wherever I want, to roam the world with no worries. And if any man really loves me, he must have the same passion as me, to be free from all those husband and wife stuff, free from relationship problem, just be happy and travel the world or place as and when we like.</p>
              <p>But hor, this type of man, very hard to find, only in those old days nomads who travel from silk road to changi road, you can find such people.</p>
