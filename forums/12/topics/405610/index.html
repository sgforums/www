              <p>okay this is troubling me.... I have a daughter who's currently studying in secondary school and most of the time when she finishes school, she'll go to her grandma, my husband's mother's place instead of coming home... this is making me think that she regards her grandma's place more home-like than our own house. possibly, this happened because i used to leave her at her grandma's place during her primary school days as it was very near her primary school.</p>
              <p>I tried to ask her nicely to come home, after all i'm her mother and she is supposed to do that. however, she refuses to come back and if forced to do so, she will throw tantrum and give me cold shoulders.what should i do to make her come back without hurting both she and her grandma's feelings?</p>

              <p>grandma's place only what.. what if its YOUR mum's place, would you be having the same response?? Is your relationship with your mother in law not very good and you feel that your mother in law may bad mouthed you in front of your child and thus causes further strains to your relationship with your daughter??</p>
              <p>Remember its only the grandma that she is always visiting. Wait till she starts going to her bf house fequently, coming back late with untidy hair and clothes, then you will be more morE moRE mORE MORE troubled..</p>
              <p>Sometimes, kids during this adolescent stage is very hard to teach them. They tend to be rebellious and its only when they grow up and think back, then they will realise that they have been stupid in the past.</p>
              <p>Find a time, and talk to your girl nicely, and if possible involve your husband as well.</p>

              <p>TS I think you should talk to your mother in law about this. Find out what your kid does while she's over there. In fact, you can even ask your mother-in-law to supervise your kid and make sure she's doing her homework and stuff.</p>
              <p>And hor....be polite when you're talking about this...try not to sound demanding no matter how worried you are....dun strain your ties over this.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile maybe you can organise some parties or etc and invite your in laws over. Foster family ties.</p>

              <p>i was brought up by my grandmother since i was very young. my parents will leave me there from monday to friday and "collect" me over the weekends.</p>
              <p>later when i'm in upper primary school, i will then go home every evening when my mum finish work and fetch me home from grandma's until sec 1 when of course, adolescence sets in in the later years...</p>
              <p>today, i'm close to my parents and still close to my grandma... but now with a family of my own i don't visit her that often... my bad... sigh, i'm sorry grandma... love you still, lots! </p>
              <p>TS, i think your worries are quite unfounded... grandma always taught me to love my parents more and to not "torture" them with my antics and she implanted the filial piety mindset in me since young. she also shared my father's history with me and i know how hard his life has been since young. with that perspective, i understand my father more and why he does things this way, that way... i must say learning from grandparents are virtues from a different era which is lacking in today's society. of course not all she taught could be relevant in today's context but if your daughter absorb only the positives from her grandmother, all is not so bad afterall. </p>

              <p>TS,</p>
              <p>Change the way of your Parenting style...</p>
              <p>Start by going to your inlaw hosue often and after dinner come back home with your daughter.....Get that Gees.</p>
              <p>Also your daughter is a Teen she is giving you message day 2 day.....so maybe you might want to change from controling parent to becoming "Her Friend" </p>
              <p>Start to come down to her level and move away from controling parent. Stop judging her......She maybe seeking Space from your controlling style. but at the same time she might be seeking affection that she is not getting from you but grandmother.</p>
              <p>Have you ever had a "Girl Time out" alone with your Daughter / s </p>
