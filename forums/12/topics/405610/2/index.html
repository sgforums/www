              <p>Change the way of your Parenting style...</p>
              <p>Start by going to your inlaw hosue often and after dinner come
                  back home with your daughter.....Get that Gees.</p>
              <p>Also your daughter is a Teen she is giving you message day 2
                  day.....so maybe you might want to change from controling parent to
                  becoming "Her Friend" </p>
              <p>Start to come down to her level and move away from
                  controling parent. Stop judging her......She maybe seeking
                  Space from your controlling style. but at the same time she might
                  be seeking affection that she is not getting from you but
                  grandmother.</p>

              <p>Hmm true, i know that her rebellion is inevitable. maybe its because i
               didn't spend much time with her during her childhood. well trying to 
              become her 'friend' is somehow an engaging thought. i will try not to

              <p><br>yeah "Girl time out" is like go out together and do some "nail"  or something both of you enjoy "together secretly" don't even let your husband know.....take the afternoon off from work find some thing to do with your daughter together. Break the routine once in a while it bring out fresh perspective. Your daughter will see it. she is old enough.  </p>
              <p>There are 2 perspective on this....</p>
              <p>1) children will growth up so shifting of parenting style from control - guiding/mentoring by friendship. She will gain confident and better in school work.....You kind of have to take proactive step to bond with her at every "stage" or else her friends and internet will take over. before the eventual "let GO"....</p>
              <p>2) Sometime you kinda of have to recall what you like and do at her age and lower yourself down to that level to be her friends. </p>
              <p>Remember :   if you got something negative to say just hold your tongue for "Girls time out".  Just have fun.  non judging.</p>

              <p>Hmmm.....i think you need some practice and certainly need to do homework on getting her "trust" before you can proceed.......start gathering information of what you know about your daughter?</p>
              <p>Determind the moment to talk to her when both of you are in syn. Eventually you have to find the right moment.........you know it when it happen.</p>
              <p>Take a few moment each Day and Visualized those "right moments" and visualized those "Happy" activities that "both" can do together.  </p>
              <p>i think some preparation such as</p>
              <p>1) reflecting what you were like when you were her age?  How do you speak at that age and what was actual intend?</p>
              <p>2) list down what you think she likes vs what you enjoy.</p>
              <p>3) Do you know her friends at school?  (Do you notice your daughter don't have friends at school?)</p>
              <p>4) when is her birthday do you ever give her a "birthday Bash" invite her friends small group?  Teen birthday party and kids birthday are different.  (that is the easyest thing to do to be part of her life! organized birthday ) </p>
              <p>5) Did you know by building relationship between you and her; help your daughter to learn how to make friends in school.</p>
              <p>5) Activities helps to break the ice. you probably need to work on "Trust" from her. You must have hurt her at some point that you didn't even realized.</p>
              <p>6) Friends don't judge but have fun together.....and can relate.</p>
              <p>If you can't relate now....how do you proceed to the next topics.......</p>
              <p>7)she is a girl....eventual "girls talk"  share with her your first crush..."she will be shock" who is mom!!!........what i am trying to say is you have to break down first before she does.  bring your level down let her see you were once like her..... Tell her is perfectly normal to be interested in boys....the do's and don'ts </p>
              <p> You certainly do not want her to learn flowers and bees from friends and internet.....So this "Friends thing is more important for you as a parent.....You want her to come to you in confident when she has questions on bees and flowers.</p>
              <p>What is not</p>
              <p>1) you sit in your room and tell your daughter you wanna be friends.......she is going to give you the strange Look.......and stay far away.</p>
              <p>2) don't asked question......if she don't like so long as you know she isn't going to Take drugs or get pregnant.</p>
              <p>3) Don't use her information to judge her.  she will stay away you for a long time.....</p>
              <p>All these takes time.....Good luck.</p>
