And seldom offer to pay for dinning out although her pay is quite OK.<br><br>that is my version of the story i try to ask myself think on her side.<br>i told myself, no matter what for the sake of children i will hold this family together.<br>do any bros have any similar less than happy marriage.<br>please share if you can.<br><br></div></blockquote>Well this is sad, family means union and supporting each other..<br><br>I really cant believe she cook less then 5 times in 5 years. I mean this is not what a wife should be. Very sorry, she gave me the impression of that she's a very lazy women and take things for granted.. everything seems so easy to her and enjoying your hard earned money... Maybe you should just talk to her bout your money for daughter's education and restrict how much money she can spent ?<br><br>Why not sit down with her and talk bout money stuff.. then go to daughters then breakfast then anything u feel not comfortable..at least let her know.. did u ? its ok to be upset and angry with her.. it doesnt mean that u both wil immediately divorce after quarrel..<br><br>First , u need to let her know wats bothering you..<br><br>U need to tell her u need some support and you're really tired after your work and appreciate anything that she can do at least to lessen your burden..<br><br>Just tell her that.. U need to be tougher than she is.. if she nags.. stop her.. not by bad way but in polite way,, if she still doesnt understand.. sometimes..scold is the only way.<br><br>i just think you're being too soft hearted to her..<br><br>Hope your family will stay and get better..<br><br>Remember , communication is the best way<br></div>

I believe you were sort of expecting that to happen one day (reading from what you had shared so far...)<br><br>I think your main focus now is your kids.  You have every right to be part of their lives so try your very best to fight for custody of your children (in a very sensitive way ofcourse).  Even if they live overseas, try to keep in touch with them as often as possible and make every effort to go and visit them and spend time with them.<br><br>Whatever happened between you and your wife, your children do not have to know all the full details.  Just continue to show them and give them assurance how much you love them.<br><br>Be strong and take care!!!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>
