From wat u had written, wat i feel is tat u n ur wife may hav lost some communciation, when is the last time u n her has a heart to heart talk? You have been on biz trip at least twice a mth, so when u r back, u cherish ur time wif ur daughter, so hav u been spent some precious time wif ur wife too...dun forget women r sentimental human. Although she is a mother now but doesnt mean she dun need the caring and "romantic" moments wif u.<br><br>What i thk is tat maybe she jus wan to let u do ur husband part when u r in sg. From ur previous post,  i realised ur wife is grown up in a westernised env. so therefore u need to balance u n her thinking. Ur posts sound to me tat it's either ur daughter spent time wif u or ur daughter wif ur wife..so when is the last time the three of u spent some quality family time? If u r busy to plan some outinmg lik picnic, maybe jus a meal or movie. Maybe u would think who am i suggesting ideas n giving opinion (I AM NOT MARRIED) however i hav seen countless fiends who are couples..believe me, dad always play the "angel" role n mum play the "devil" role. wat i thk ur wife may jus wan to have a fair role in ur family.<br><br>Last but not least, the advise is --- TALK TO HER ! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> </div></blockquote>I strongly agreed with the above writer. me not married either but i tink best is u shld at least plan an outing as wad i mentioned earlier on to bring one another together. regardless is westernise or locally, in a marriage, communicate is one that you MuST have in it.<br><br>All E best 2 U.. keep us Updat on ur progress!!

Only when u fixed your relationship than you can talk about being a role of a mother and wife and most notably husband.<br><br>When u talk it is not about what she should do "this"and "that"  as a mother also it is not how you expect "Your Vision" of the future life together to be like.<br><br>Relationship takes 2 hand to clap. the life style that both of you undertake together rather than singlely ur point of view. U as a man will have to take a step down. (don't get views from your mother  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> )<br><br>She is obviously bored and probably lost in this live style, And she don't feel that you are emotionally bonding with her. (not sex)  Also importantly did you make her feel that she is an important part of your life and u need her as much as she needs you?  Did you shower her with.....and not sex.<br><br>I am sure u do a good job explaining why u need to do what it takes to feed your family. But that is no enough.<br><br>every person has a point of communication some thru writting, some thru verbal communication.  U must pick a right Mood when she is listening.<br><br>Good luck.<br><br></div>

But tat's the asian culture of what you think, in westernised countries, it's not that way. So you can't blame her for not doing your way.<br><br>Maybe both of you can sit down together and write down on seperate sheets of paper of your expectations or what the other part haven't done enough. You might find that she also have tons of things abt you to write. Then work on it together. Set a dateline for each other and review again. Talks can be forgotten but when u write it down, you'll not forget and have a better understanding of the situation. But to do this, both of you have to keep and open mind and not jump into defensive mode and say you are not like that etc. It's all opinion and thoughts of each other.

            <div class='col-md body'>I really think you need to be persistent to resolve the issue.  You said after few months things went back the old ways.  That's what happen to me before and I had reminded my wife about it.  Over time,things got out of hands and I had remanded her and told her off about what we discussed about.  Sometimes, it was my fault, but more often, she was of 2 minds and hoping that I could do everything for her, she just sit back and relax.  Ended up, always grumbling.<br><br>Why Husband always think its wife fault whenever there is a quarrel? True and not true.  My case, especially during our early yrs in marriage.  I had promised certain things before marraige and I am still fulfilling that promise till now.  But for my wife, she really needs time to adjust to changes and aloing the way, often complain this and that......<br><br>Often when we quarrel, hse always said I win the arguement and she could not rebute a single thing I said about her...  I said it seems that way, but sometimes, what she said was right, just that in the heat of arguement, she lost her poised.  But I actually reflected upon it.  Making matter worse, she often describe and item, e.g. A but tells me its B. So given that, how on earth can we talk?  It was untill much later when my 1swt child grew oldewr and told her the same thing then did she realised the problem.<br><br>Of course, we had hardly any quarrel nowadays, except when she throw temper, hte children will  also get it for nothing.  ANy overdone by her, she will get remanded by me.  Often then not, I will just keep quiet or tell her at night before we sleep.<br><br>Regarding husband and wife stuff doing things at home.  She came from a background where her mum does everything for her.  While I grew up where I had to fend for myself for almost everything. like sewing my torn clothes as a small little boy, cooking marketing, caring for my granny, babysitting, etc.. almsot all house chores... cleaning, sweeping, mopping, washing,... etc..<br>THat's the promise I made to her, take care of  her.  I still do but lesser extent as I do have much time to cook in the morning before going to work.  My daughter's morning preparation has "eaten" into my time.  Wake up in the middle of the night to tend to my children when they were sick, pee, cry, milk, diaper, etc....<br><br>Since the beginning of this yr, things had changed, now hardly cook before I leave for office.  Not forgetting Sending my 1st &amp; 2nd child to school on bicycle leaving the 3rd one sleeping at home with my wife looking after.  We used to wake her up and bring her along as my wife send the 2nd one to school while I send the eldest to her school.  There were some arguement initially over this as my wife refused to change her way because I find it hard for the 3rd child waking up early in the morning simply because my wife had to send the 2nd child to school and no one look after her.  And her health is kind of affected as she became to fall sick easier.<br><br>It was after an incident that she realised my suggestion is workable, but she just refused to understand  ... only needs to leave the house earlier by 5 mins, I can send both of them to school... now she never said anything at all.<br><br>My wife is a full time house wife now, she does the washing tution the kids. Apart from that, I still handle the children to sleep do the house bill, plan for holidays, 1st person to wake up, last person to sleep.  On top of that, get the children to visit the doctor if there is anyh timing clashes with my other kid's schedule.... many more.  I don't find it a hassle, but sometimes, I still would tell my wife off.  WHY, she just take it for granted... and then... I know from her reaction... she knewn what I was referring to ... she become "AUTOMATIC"....</div>

She had never sent our children to school and I am the one who would prepare breakfast .  I would do as much as possible and of course sometime I would get lazy and that when she will  " remind " me ..  I had my fair share of quarrel and all those frastrations ...  I had never blame her solely for it ..  I always believes it take two hands to clap....... am I henpecked ? not that I think of but importantly there must be tolerant and communication ...   the first 15 years of our marriage is based on communication ...  when we feel like talking we would just sit down and talk into the wee hour of the morning and off to work with one or two hours of sleep..  I felt very blessed ... now, she would go to bed with her book and I would be sitting in front of TV ...  hardly any communication ...  What I am trying to say is this, marriage requires a lot of hard work ..  We were working very hard to sustain a beautiful marriage but now, we are both tired ...  perhaps it had taken a toll on us ..  I used to think I was the most blessed in the whole wide world as I got a very understanding wife ....  I wish I can still say the same thing ...   Misty, not everyman is like what you say ..  and of course it is not necessary the woman fault ...   the main problem lies in communicating ...  after about 27 years of marriage, I still need to communicate ... and communicating is not just talking ...   it requires a lot of effort and the timing must be right ...   like the TS, you and your husband need to talk too ...    the decision to get married - the reason will still be there ...  you will need to explore and find it again ... while I am in no position to say I had done well, I am sure you can always try to sort out your problem too ..  As for TS, I feel that he need to talk to his wife sincerely ..  Has he ever put himself in his wife's shoe.  If he is the wife, will the husband has the same complain ...   ?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Most husband still the old chavinistic type, expect wife to do housewife.  However, there are few that are the opposite.  Amidst, the chores that I had done at home, its simply human to complain and sometimes she did it in the presence of my friends when they were discussing about their husband and I overheard what she said.  I immediately interrupted their conversation and corrected her in the presence of my friend's wife much to her embrassment.  Initially, I had told her not to do it during bed time, as its not fair to me as I was the person that did the work but she claim husband never help just like my other friends.<br><br>Subsequently, I was fedup and then I would interrupt.  After a few times, she stopped doing that all together.  Communication is very important here.  we had gone through rough periods, and  when she told me there is nothing to talk about, yet she told my friends wife I had nothing to talk to her... it made me very furious and I had rebutted her strongly..  And on several occasions I insisted we talk, then ....slowly... our situation improved.  and now.. we seldom quarrel and most time, at good terms.  I don't blame her at times for her reaction as she is quick and have a shorter temper.  Meaning, just a little bit, things can just balloon and she will act IMPUSLIVELY... that's what make matter worse.  That's her, we both are of the opposite character, in some ways, we compliment each other.. me being "Long sighted" and she, "short sighted".<br><br>Guess it takes time to really understand each other and maintain connected.  One thing we try to do is, avoid carrying our anger over the next day...  At least, I was mentality prepared when I 1st met her and I knew she is very dependent on me, being the husband.  In fact, I understand her character and behaviour more than she understands me.  That sometimes can be an advantage, at times, disadvantage as I see through her action.. and cause more friction.. But now we are much better than those initial years being married...</div>
