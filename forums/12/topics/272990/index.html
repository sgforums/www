            <div class='col-md body'>Hey bro...well i thk ur marriage stil can be salvaged. From wat u had written, wat i feel is tat u n ur wife may hav lost some communciation, when is the last time u n her has a heart to heart talk? You have been on biz trip at least twice a mth, so when u r back, u cherish ur time wif ur daughter, so hav u been spent some precious time wif ur wife too...dun forget women r sentimental human. Although she is a mother now but doesnt mean she dun need the caring and "romantic" moments wif u.<br><br>What i thk is tat maybe she jus wan to let u do ur husband part when u r in sg. From ur previous post,  i realised ur wife is grown up in a westernised env. so therefore u need to balance u n her thinking. Ur posts sound to me tat it's either ur daughter spent time wif u or ur daughter wif ur wife..so when is the last time the three of u spent some quality family time? If u r busy to plan some outinmg lik picnic, maybe jus a meal or movie. Maybe u would think who am i suggesting ideas n giving opinion (I AM NOT MARRIED) however i hav seen countless fiends who are couples..believe me, dad always play the "angel" role n mum play the "devil" role. wat i thk ur wife may jus wan to have a fair role in ur family.<br><br>Last but not least, the advise is --- TALK TO HER ! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

I feel that the main issue for you is that you have a set idea what an ideal wife should be. You must appreciate her for what she is, she must have some virtues that you like? It is painful for both you and your wife to fit her in a mould. Be flexible. No GIRO for cc bills is an example. Be flexible, rather than lament that things are not happening the way it should be.</div>

Talks can be forgotten but when u write it down, you'll not forget and have a better understanding of the situation.
