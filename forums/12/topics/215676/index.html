The breathing problem probably due to the haze... still if you are worried you should just see your GP.  Take care.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Do they have to do with your hubby? In laws? Business?<br><br>Do you exercise regularly?<br><br>My ADVICE for you would be....<br><br>So long as you're not doing anything 'funny' or extreme to yourself... You exercise, watch your diet (but no need to get all to carried away) and see your doctor when you're feeling unwell.... That should be GOOD ENOUGH.<br><br>Though there're some rare occasions where diseases are not so easily detected, they usually don't happen on NORMAL people. And often it's just useless to worry too much over such rarity... BUT...<br><br>Giving yourself UNNECESSARY STRESS and WORRIES is MOST LIKELY to give you HEALTH PROBLEMS... If not ADVOCATES any already existing disease(s) within YOU.....<br><br>If you still refuse to heed, I'll simply wash my hands off you.</div>
