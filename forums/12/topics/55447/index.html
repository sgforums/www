(This was what i think when i read the part highlighted in red) As i read more, (the part highlighted in green) i think she is just too scared to meet up with you although she really wants to. Maybe due to depressed memories and stuff. Your ending story, (the part highlighted in blue) to me, she has already move on with her life but because she was once yours. She just wanted to know how you are doing and living your life. Most girls are like that so just get used to it.<br><br>Even if she wears the pendant that you gave her, it might be because she loves the pendant you gave due to fond sweet memories. Even if you want her back now, i don't think that she is ready to give you another chance.<br><br>If i were you, no matter how it hurts... i would let her go because it takes time for her to trust you again and to gain that trust again it hell not going be one easy job. Just let nature take its own course and just talk to her as a normal friend. But if she is meant to be yours... one fine day she will come back to your arms. Till then the choice is yours... wait for her or move on.</div>

She's probably still interested, but that doesn't give you a 'green light' straight away. Is she currently attached? Perhaps it's because of the 'fear factor' years back like you've mentioned.<br><br>It's not just a matter of whether you should step into her life, it's also a matter of whether she would allow you to?<br><br>But in case you really have got a chance with her again... Try to take things slower this time round....</div>

Many people falls under this category because time went pass so long without contacts and any sudden contacts may seemed awkward.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Even though you both have known for years, nevertheless, this awkwardness will exist.<br><br>To handle this situation is to avoid making hasty decision. She is a girl and would have her woman's intuition to depend &amp; guide her in making her choices. You mentioned that the chat wasn't very gd - this implied that she wasn't very keen OR wasn't very comfortable to chat with you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Like trust - such issues have to build slowly and gradually. When you initiated an outing, she paused and asked useless questions NOT BECAUSE she wants to make you wait - rather she wants to buy time to consider carefully if she should go anot.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> When you actually called - its the pressuring tactics that she retreated from - therefore rejecting your date.<br><br>What should you do?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Learn the art of respecting inter-personal space and freedom. You should understand that you could and would be very comfortable to have a nice chat, go out, etc with her, but that <strong>doesn't mean </strong>that she would feel the same way.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Everything must happen slowly, but gradually.

            <div class='col-md body'>its very obvious that u still occupy a special place in her heart, else why would she still be wearing your pendant for 3 yrs, and kept asking about u from ur bro.<br><br>probably she's trying to play hard-to-get, see if u r REALLY sincere about asking her out n stuff.. tat's y she said the "y not ask ur frens" kind of thing. probably u shld juz sae u juz wanna go out with her, den drop little hints to tell her tat maybe u 2 can be together again..<br><br>but do take things slowly though. n be sure to treat her much better than however u did last time? cos if u screw up again, she'll lose all the faith, trust and hope in you, and since u said she's got potential to be your "The One", don't let her down.. cherish her like u would cherish urself ( :</div>
