CB so i go meet her alone lor and intend to tell her i want to break up. we went dinner, movies and all the while i was waiting for a chance to tell her but just couldn't find a chance. seeing her so happy if i suddenly tell her, she will cry in the public again and it's not the first time she makes me embarrassed. We went to bedok reservoir park and i intend to sound her there but when we sit down a while she starts to touch here and there and unbotton her shirt and hug me. I didn't push her away because she hug me very tight. Today I am playing disappear again. I am not going to answer any of her calls, her sms or whatever. I made up my mind that's the last time with her. I disappear until she give up on me. I can't use the trick which i intend to use; tell her i want to eat soft rice. stay at home and she support me..she says even if i don't work, she will still earn money to support me. Btw, i don't eat soft rice. i want to move on and find a girl who is better maybe one that don't love me so much. she is like "ai ni ai tao sha shi ni" that kinda women. creepy</div></blockquote>it's so predictable... next <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
