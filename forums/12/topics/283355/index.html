( background of Z)</blockquote>I'm trying to be as neutral as possible here (but I think I'm *unconsciously* siding with Z), but point out my mistakes if I do make any. I have excluded the background info about Z as it may be biased. No offense, TS.<br><br>Firstly, did any one of you guys asked or hinted Z to call? Or was he acting like a smart Alex then?<br><br>And you <strong>should</strong> have interrupted the call if any one of you is in any way in disagreement of the arrangement made by Z, that is, to wait for the shopkeeper to open his store.<br><br>Let me guess something (which is quite obvious here) - A is more well-liked by your group as compared to Z. (You won't label him as "Z" if he is well-included into your group, right?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> ) So, I mean, it maybe natural to view A's "pang-seh-less" is more important than Z's accountability to the shopkeeper. But by leaving with A, you guys are just pang-seh-ing Z. And imo I think you have indeed been a little too mean to Z. While he was nagging about you guys leaving the shop, you could have stfu him by:<br><br>1. Offering some sort of "compensation" like waiting for him on the next occasion if he is down for some detention or something and give him a pat on his shoulders before leaving the shop. It's not that easy to face an uncle who is disappointed to see only one customer standing when he's expecting half a dozen - alone, as a student.<br><br>2. Call back the storekeeper and explain to him the situation. (takes quite some confidence to do it) It won't kill him to open his store 15 minutes earlier, but by not answering for the departure, Z may lose trust from the storekeeper.<br><br>3. If my first question was a positive, you should have stayed at the shop as it was partially your intention to wait for the storekeeper to arrive. And instead, offer Option 1 to A.<br><br>Anyway, not much meaning in dwelling into events that have happened. Ultimately, if you think you are in the wrong, just treat him better next time round, or apologise to him directly if you dare. Otherwise, just continue life as usual. Incidents like this may fade away eventually as time pass by, but if you guys are putting him at the bottom of the priority list at each occasion, he might just break off with you guys, or continue to be a brainless asssucker for as long as he like.<br><br>And - I'm not Z, or in any way affiliated with Z, directly or indirectly. Just leaving my liang fen qian here.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yes... we are kinda biased against Z, not the group, but me i biased against him a lot... other ppl are more to the neutral..<br><br>reasons for that i am biased against Z is that, he has a bad attitude towards me... and the backgrounds of Z + many more...<br><br>and, i was suggesting A and even insisted A to go home 1st, but he still wanted to pei us, we naturally ate faster...<br><br>yes one of us asked Z to call, but the one who asked Z to call before that he said: " maybe the uncle is inside, Z u got his number right?"<br><br>later before we leave the shop, the one who suggested Z to call, called the uncle and explained the whole thing and then apologised...<br><br>Z still very buay song, keep saying us wrong or wat... we kept quiet for long, then after like 5 mins of interval scolding, i decided to retort him back to appease myself.... and i tot he was wrong at that time...<br><br>but later when i reflect, he was not so at wrong, is only his tone of voice that is so wrong...<br><br>i actually tot of apologising to Z, but i rmb last time when i apologised to him, he accept it as if i owed him thousand of bucks, then he even say i shouldnt do this and that.... so on...      after that day i apologise to him, he treat me as if i am a fierce tiger to live with....<br><br>i am very confused whether i am wrong or right...<br><br>thank you for those constructive comment</div>
