              <p>strum, the greater the fear of losing something, the more likely you'll lose it.</p>
              <p>Girls can sense insecurity, and it will make the limited time you have with her unpleasant. Don't become her emotional burden, she's probably frustrated about how to assure you now.</p>
              <p>I'll say have more confidence in the relationship. What's yours will be yours, if you feel and show that you are optimistic about your relationship, it may make things easier for both of you to breathe.</p>
              <p>Good luck!</p>

              <p><br>We know that you loved this girl.</p>
              <p>But the question that you need to find out for yourself is.....</p>
              <p>DOES SHE ALSO FEEL THE SAME ABOUT YOU?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It seems to me that although you claimed to love this girl, but you have absolutely no idea whether she loves you or not.</p>
              <p>If you had any clue about how she felt about you, whether it is true or false...you won't have so little faith in your relationship. Girls can lie easily, but it's up to you to find out the truth and the lie. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>if one day... she comes and tells u she had been with that kor kor in a relationship, then just give up on her.. thats because, she can easily go with another person when u love her so much... which means she is not as committed in this relationship as much as u commit...  or rather, she doesnt match u, or rather she is not good enough for u..</p>

              <p>A bird is never meant to be kept in the cage. Even a guilded one. Birds must be free in order to appreciate the beauty of them blending into nature, giving you great joy.</p>
              <p>So must love be not kept caged in order that you may experience true happiness.</p>
              <p>You are attempting to cage her, akin to holding water in your hands. You still have a beautiful relationship with her. Don't make that terrible mistake MOST men do, and that is to CAGE her. She will feel stifled and in time get bored being caged by you, no matter how good you may think you treat her. Ultimately, she will fly away.</p>
              <p>Let her have her friends and party all she likes. If she truly loves you, her heart belongs to you, no matter whose hand she holds or lips she kisses. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Being young means making mistakes, it is perfectly normal and ok,You both are not married yet, do remember.</span> And true love is more than skin deep. She and you are not objects to be admired and then put away back on the shelf when bored.</p>
              <p>As long as you both are not married, <span style="color: #000000;"><strong>it is ALWAYS best to be friends.</strong></span> Aim to be the one whom she will come running to, not someone else as she is doing now. Win her trust and love, not by being a prison warden, but a forest ranger who keeps the beauty of nature free.</p>
              <p> The happiest couples are those whom married as friends and not as prisoners to each other. </p>

              <p>well, instead of whining like a sixteen-year old girl on an online forum, to people who obviously don't sincerely give a damn what happens to you. why don't you take the time to CALL her now and just chat with her?</p>

              <p>Lets go for the worst case.</p>
              <p>If one day she tells you she is sick of you and leaves you, what will you do?</p>
              <p>Cry and sulk around?</p>
              <p>But if you are prepare for it then is different.</p>
              <p>To TS always have gal friends around, since your gf is always busy with her school guy friends, you can have gal friends too right?</p>
              <p>Never ever put too much love on someone who has shown signs of uncertainty in a relationship.</p>
