            <div class='col-md body'>A few questions for you to ponder about:<br><br>Qn 1. Why do you think people committ suicide?<br>Ans: Unable to handle stress and face reality, in turn lost hope in life.<br><br>Qn 2. Do you think they have ever thought about the consequences if they really did committ it and died?<br>Ans: No, they probably think they will go to heaven.<br><br>Qn 3. Do you know anyone who has tried to committ suicide before?<br>Ans: No, I did have similar thoughts before, I think.<br><br>Qn 4. Did you know that committing suicide is an offense?<br>Ans: Yes, but that is only applicable if you fail to die. What are they going to do? Punish your ghost?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>wasn't there another thread about this b4? anyways, i wun specifically answer the questions. instead, i'll share my experience, and the thoughts and situations i had and was going thru at that time. perhaps it'll offer some insight to the suicide mystery.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by HENG@:</div><div class="quote_body">i was not too willing to talk, but, thinking about it, if i can help others, why not.<br><br>Back in 2000, I was 17. Was in SAJC the 1st 3 months, found the environment to my liking there. After the 1st 3 months, was forced by parents to leave SAJC for NJC. Found the NJC environment very stale and too much emphasis placed on mugging and not to my liking. I had problems adjusting too.<br><br>Back then, I was more shy, and was not used to reaching out to make friends just like that. In addition, cliques formed during the 1st 3 months in NJC further intimidated me from getting to know more people there. As a result, i ended up not having many friends and raging against my parents for pulling me out from an environment i was comfy in and into one which i disliked. And as I found it hard to make friends, I increasingly hated the school more, and that hindered my ability to make friends even more, and started affecting my sch work. I started skipping classes, then school, then it became a habit, so much so that I would arrive in sch at 8am for attendance, then leave sch at 8.30am, arrive at Orchard Rd at 9, where i spent most of my day, hanging out, sometimes alone, sometimes with outside friends. I started caring lesser and lesser for my sch work.<br><br>As a result, the few days which I did spend in sch, only increasingly frustrated me, and tests and exams really got me in a bad mood. outside, i looked like i didn't care at all, but inside, the image of seemingly being crappy in my studies was very much causing me grief. Yet, by then, i simply could not study anymore, because I was in a blind rage.<br><br>I started to get very very depressed, having already been depressed due to the issue of being unable to accept then environment, and being unable to make any friends. I kept wondering why things were the way they were, why didn't my parents listen when i insisted that NJC was unsuitable for me, and what did I do to deserve such unglorious treatment. I wondered why I was even alive at all, and started to wonder about suicide. On a few occasions, I nearly threw myself off buildings, and I had always thought about committing suicide in sch, to show how very upset and how much i hated the school. I thought maybe if I had died in the school, that they would finally realise something was wrong, and they would be guilty and regret having not paid more attention to my situation, esp my classmates.<br><br>My Civics Tutor DID notice that I was in depression, and sent me to the sch counseller. But such councellers are easy to fake, as long as u can maintain a positive face in the room, and say nice things for them to hear, to get it over and done with. The main reason I agreed to go, was to let my parents and classmates understand how seriously depressed I was, to need counselling. I even ended up with the priviliege of being able to walk into the principal's office w/o appointment, impromtu, just to look her up for chats. And I did get kicks picking on teachers, and breaking many rules, with no fear of punishment as the sch was afraid that it would worsen my hatred of the sch. As a result, I was able to break many minor rules and get away with it, such as leaving my shirt tucked out, leaving my hair long, wearing chains on my neck, skipping classes, not handing up homework, etc. In spite of my many transgressions, I was never sent for any detention.<br><br>After sometime, while I STILL hated my sch and my surroundings, I realised I didn't want to die. By that time, I had chanced upon a path of life I wanted to take, and I realised I had so much to do, so much unaccomplished, that, however much I hated the sch, dying meant I wouldn't be able to chase my dreams. I wanted to stay alive, to show that I could do what I wanted to do, to show that I wasn't going to make it easy for them to beat me down(at the point i did think everyone wanted me dead, and staying alive was very much a show of defiance), and that everyone who thought me a loser would one day be proved wrong. Today, I am glad I didn't die.</div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The answers are not always so easy and clear to be a simplistic ...running away from the pain or responsibilities etc....  Its often very complex and very difficult to articulate the whys.  I have several friends who have contemplated it and even tried it.  I know of people who did it and succeeded and I have personally witness 1 where she died.  Its pure heartache on both sides!!<br><br>Depression is not something to be treated lightly.  It is something that needs serious attention and the people who suffers from them need not be shy or ashame because they have it.  As a matter of fact, I find that the people who battles depression, many of them are far stronger people inside than many others.  They have the courage to fight it daily even every hour.  They suffer only because they had the misfortune that they were dealt blows after blows which caused them to become overwelmed!<br><br>All you who have friends who are depressed, please do the following, give them time to talk to vent all that they have inside.  They need a release, to talk and get it out.  Please do not judge them or try to change their way of thinking unless you know what you are doing and are trained and if you are trained, you will know that you need to just let them talk.  just talk.<br><br>Please do not say things like<br><br><strong>-  there are people in worse state/condition/suffering than what you are going through"</strong><br><br><strong>- Its only a relationship/its only a girl/boy etc</strong><br><br><strong>- pull yourself together/be strong</strong><br><br><strong>- do some charity work and work with the less fortunate that way you will see how much more other people suffer than you...</strong><br><br>The above are just some of the things that we should not say... they are <strong>totally not helpful whatsoever</strong>!!!  There are many reasons why this is so and I dont want to spend time explaining them here as yet.  But what you can do is to just give your time and attention and often thats all they need to get on the road to being themselves again.  If the person remains depressed, then he/she will need to get some help.<br><br>Like I said before, I have discovered that many people who had suffered from depression are actually people who are much stronger than others think they are.<br><br>If you are depressed, please do not think that you are any less of a person than the next guy.  Honestly, it is my experience and believe that anyone who had to go through what you had gone through would most likely be a similar state of suffering as you are.<br><br>franzx</div>
