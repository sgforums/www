I notice that the advise you give is usually very helpful. But do you think i should at least try to tell her how i feel for although i do agree it is not right to be a third party and i might not be successful even if i will to be one. It is not that i want to be the evil one to do something to spolit someone relationship but this is the 1st time i really feel for someone and feel that i should at least tell her how i feel but do scare of what the outcome might be like (she just stop been my friend after i tell her). A past relationship end up sour due to my lack of courage to tell the other party how i feel for her and i do feel regret for it. Now i do not really want this regret to happen again. So, what youy think? Should i tell her or not? In what way should i tell her about this? I had been thinking about this for the past few days and your advise might be able to help me to decide.Thanks again.<br><br>BrenBren<br></div>

Thats why i had to desire to find out at least her reaction to my feeling for her, no matter if the answer is positive or negative.

I notice that the advise you give is usually very helpful. But do you think i should at least try to tell her how i feel for although i do agree it is not right to be a third party and i might not be successful even if i will to be one. It is not that i want to be the evil one to do something to spolit someone relationship but this is the 1st time i really feel for someone and feel that i should at least tell her how i feel but do scare of what the outcome might be like (she just stop been my friend after i tell her). A past relationship end up sour due to my lack of courage to tell the other party how i feel for her and i do feel regret for it. Now i do not really want this regret to happen again. So, what youy think? Should i tell her or not? In what way should i tell her about this? I had been thinking about this for the past few days and your advise might be able to help me to decide.Thanks again.<br><br>BrenBren<br></div></blockquote>I thank you for your compliment - Kinda sweet to hear such thingy occasionally. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Ok, expressing huh?

In the end, it all boils down to whether you decide to heed the angel or the devil's words.
