            <div class='col-md body'>Well, as said above I've just ROM with my boyfriend. But we r still waiting for our custom...etc.<br>well....I'm not sure why guys like sex so much? My bf wants it everytime we meet up. Although recently, after serveral talks on how I feel about him always wanting sex, he changed abit. Well, he told me that he would masturbate before meeting me in order not to make the request to me.<br>Sometimes, I feel very guilty towards him. Actually, everytime we meet, I just hope we can like talk about things that happened to us recently,you koe, a good heartly talk then go shopping,watch movies...etc. The normal things couples would do except sex.<br>But my bf everytime we meet up, he would do some irritating  actions like touch me all over,then he will say he can't resist touching me and find me very attractive to him even if I'm not naked at all. It's true, sometimes while we walking ard, or shopping, after maybe holding me or hugging me for a while, his 'thing' will stand immediately. I find that very amuse, do guys really do that?<br>I thought you guys only stand when you see a naked girl? any guys out there have this kind of experience? can you tell me what you r thinking or how u r feeling at that time?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think it's normal fof him to "stand" as he said you are attracted to him mar....You said wanted to do normal stuff instead of sex everytime. You'all can have sex first then do normal thing lor. U didn't specifiy everytime u'all meet is how often. 1 week? or everyday? if 1 week then it is very very normal. If everyday then maybe i think i should pity you. But One thing is for sure....his sex drive is higher than you. Or should I say....he can't satisfy u? Coz in fact ger's sex drive should be higher than guy.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi juna,<br><br>As you might have read the above replies, it's true that some guys have high sex drive, it could be due to hormones overdrive or that person is being over-exposed to porn flicks. Whatever the reason is not the main concern.<br><br>I can see that this could be a future problem after marriage. We all understand that sex after marriage is healthy, but when the balance is not there anymore, meaning one party demands more sex than the other, it will ultmaitely affect the marriage life, causing stress and frustration for both parties.<br><br>Being a fiancee, it's good that you care about his feelings, but you don't have to feel guilty about not satisfying him in one way or another. I'm not saying that you shouldn't do it, but at the right time and the right place. it's a good sign that he's willing to change, but do not ignore this issue, after all you are going to be with him for the rest of your life, that I assume. Have a really good talk about this and make some plans and arrangement, explain to him about your feelings, while at the same time, think about his feelings too. The aim here is to have a win-win situation.<br><br>If he loves and cares about you, I'm sure he will understand. Let him know that there are many ways of showing intimate affection without sex. I always think that too much sex between a couple is not magical anymore, make love, not sex.</div>

Don't worry so much. When u start to love someone, its natural u have no lust for her, coz u respect her alot, full respect. Its your love that sex is not involved yet, thats the starting part.<br><br>But one day when u both are together, kissing, hugging, etc etc will come.... then sex topic will slowly come in by time also.<br><br>Then u will find having to "do" with the person u've always loved so much is great... *both of u will do it with respect, then passion* and slowly u will want it more... this is how "sex life" derives between couples. But this kinda thing must control of coz, if not wait u or her become sian then jialat liao lo~  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
