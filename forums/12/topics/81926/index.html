            <div class='col-md body'>Hi.<br><br>About 2 years ago, I enrolled in a one-day computer course in school and managed to know a friend. So after the session, we bade each other farewell and left. By sheer coincidence we met each other again a week later when we happen to board the same bus and chatted on the journey.<br><br>School started, we all became busy and we never kept in touch despite the fact that we have each other's email addresses.<br><br>Then recently, I met this friend again in school at the exam hall.while waiting for exam to start. My friend saw and stared at me but never approached me. I too was hesitant to go over because we've not kept in touch and feels a bit weird and dunno what to say. So we didn't approach each other or said anything and left,<br><br>Then recently, I thought it may be good for me to send my friend an email saying how sorry I was for not going over that day and also sent a casual greeting asking how life has been. My friend never repiled.<br><br>But now I still think to lose a friend like that is pretty stupid.  So what can I do now? Continue sending emails hoping that the cold stalemate will be broken? Will it become irritating and I become a parasite instead? What can I do now?</div>
