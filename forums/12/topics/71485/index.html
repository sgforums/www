I've made up with my boyfren 1.5 mths ago. <strong>Made up?</strong> yup... we led our own lives for almost 6 mths. Initially, he refused to associate with me becoz he was just too mad at me. why? becoz i 'cheated' on him in a way. Though how much i've tried to assure him that nothing of such sorts will EVER happen again, he just refuses to give me a 2nd chance. devastated i was, but as i reflect on the things i've done, it made me realise that he was the one and only one i truly loved. I held on to 6 lonely months, waiting on quietly for him to forgive me. It paid off.<br><br>i noe, definitely, there'll be a 'wound' there, a stain... the trust has been breached, and insecurity is a sure-will-have. and he's been hurt by me. but it's all about how i help him heal. help him and myself build up the trust once again.<br><br>Things has been well for the both of us so far. Why? becoz i'm repented. I wanna make up for the wrong that i've done. i have the will to make things right again. becoz i truly love him. i proved it to him.<br><br>IZeNI, you are just like my bf, and I, i'm just like ur gf. but you see, the difference between us is that i've realised my mistakes, and i cherish the chance my bf has given me. i don take him for granted. i won't allow any chances to arise that may jeopardize the r/s.<br><br>but wat about ur gf?<br><br>i'm not saying that she doesn't love u or wadever.. but maybe u could tok to her about it..[/b]</div>

Since love would have sink relatively deep into you through the 3 years relationship, to see it being destroyed eventually - you don't have the heart to or simply can't bear to.<br><br>Your love is generous enough to accept her if that's what she wants.<br><br>You have gotten what you wanted; she came back.<br><br>So now, you are lost emotionally. Why? Forgiveness not as simple as 'I won't mention this to anyone (social norms - face), would accept you back, etc' and forgiveness comes automatically. Look at yourself now - you got her back, no doubt - but do you think you have gotten the love you wanted?<br><br>You want to accept someone who have broken your trust, this girl has much to prove herself because there is alot of work to do to rebuilt what she had lay destruction in your relationship. If she refuse to rebuilt and assume to navigate this relationship in the original direction you both would once surf and enjoyed - this relationship has lost all meaning - do you think she learn her lesson and truly repent? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Bottomline - are you happy? <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Do you even see lasting positive changes in your relationship?</strong> </span><br><br>Cheers</div>
