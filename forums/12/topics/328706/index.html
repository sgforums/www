              I have liked this m'sian girl since last year, but recently, I started to talk to her when I found out that she is working at a supermarket near my home. During other times, I'll see her in the school computer lab.
              
              Usually she will be doing her work with her male friends in the lab and I didn't dare to go forward and talk to her. When we meet eye to eye, I just smiled at her and she will smile back. But that's about it. Not that I dont want to go and talk to her, but I was kind of nervous everytime I see her. 
              
              Also, one of her male friends are in bad terms with me, because we had a fight over rent issues (which later I moved out because I didnt want to see him again).
              
              To me, she is a perfect girl who I think I can get along very well with. The kind of a nerdy type that don't sport any make ups and wears T-shirts to uni almot everyday. So ordinary but so extraordinary to me.
              
              I feel that time is running out because the semester is coming to a close in mid nov, and she will graduating and  returning to m'sia and I will also be going back sg.
              
              I really hate myself for not being a MAN despite being 24 years old. I know I should do something fast, because there are other guys who are interested in her. It will be a massive lost opportunity if I dont take any actions.
              
              Sometimes I just think too much and therefore, not acting natural anymore. I know this kind of things should be taken to as-it-comes-along but I am hesistating alot because of unforseen problems that might happen. It worries me a great deal. After all,we are from different countries.
              
              Should I go for it and show it through my actions that I like her?
              
              What do you guys/girls think about this issue?

              <p>There are few with courage to woo gals.    Far too many cowardly guys in sg.     They just simply allow themselves to be obstacles.   Cowardly guys, guys with no confidence, are very unattractive to females.    How do they expect gals to give them chance if they behave this way, OMG.</p>

              <p>Let her know your presence first. Okay somehow you got that. Smile and eye contact.</p>
              <p>I think if you confess to her now (and suddenly), she will be  =O  speechless. </p>
              <p>First, you need to talk to her first. Chat up. At least get her name, numbers, msn, etc. So that in case she left the country out of a sudden, y'all still can contact through a certain medium.</p>
              <p>Yes you should go for it. The confession part can come later. Establish a base first yo. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>There are few with courage to woo gals.    Far
              too many cowardly guys in sg.     They just
              simply allow themselves to be obstacles.   Cowardly guys,
              guys with no confidence, are very unattractive to
              females.    How do they expect gals to give them
              chance if they behave this way, OMG.</p>

              <p> I am not afraid of failures or rejection, but I do need a good approach to make friends with her. I had no guts all of a sudden when I see her with her friends, it is kinda hard for me to talk without feeling a sense of awkwardness.</p>

              <p>Should I visit her at the supermarket this weekend? I was thinking that I could go earlier in the day when she is working, and ask her out casually for a coffee after she gets off from work.</p>
              <p>Will it be too fast?</p>
              <p>Somehow, I also think that she will appreciate more if I chat up with her in front of her friends, so I don't know if it is still a good idea if I should disturb her at work.</p>

              <p>Well, you know, sometimes there's just only so much energy one has for people. Just imagine if you are a popular star, can you invest so much energy into all who like you? As much as you'd like to be friends with them, you also need to take care not to neglect your family and loved ones.</p>
              <p>It's like spreading kaya. If you only have a certain amount on hand and you need to spread it, the more you spread on other bread, the less you have.</p>

              <p>ok, time to report!</p>
              <p><br>Last saturday, I brought her to the city for lunch, and took a long stroll around the harbour before settling down for chilled coffee.</p>
              <p>I must say that it went very well, even better than I have expected! There is so many things to talk about, but I found myself chitchatting non-stop. She would reply me or ask me questions now and then, but I got a feeling that she is a quiet girl. Maybe she is shy, who knows.</p>
              <p>But when there is a period of silence now and then, we would just look at each other and smile. No feeling of awkwardness at all. Throughout the date, I also tried to shows some signs that I like her.</p>
              <p>At the end of the day, she told me that she will call me again for a second date, and it will be her treat this time. I am not too sure if she means it or just used that as a goodbye greeting.</p>
              <p>My friends told me to play hard-to-get and not to call or text her (unless she take the initiative first) but I feel that I should at least be caring and send her goodnight smses.</p>
              <p>I also got this strong urge to tell her that I like her (because I really do) but everyone just told me to hold my horses and wait out after a couple or more dates and not scare her off.</p>
              <p>Lastly, I found out that she is just staying a street away, and I have this crazy idea of sending her flowers to her mailbox...</p>
              <p>I really need good advices this time...and thanks for reading this boring story!</p>
