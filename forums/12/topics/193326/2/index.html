So harsh decisions, no wonder you are regreting now...<br><br>come on pp..I hope some people take r/s more seriously, esp if you are older now, or into marriagble age. Dont just jump onto any available boat, and regret when the boat starts to leak.<br><br>Some people just wanted to be loved, so when there is someone ready to shower him/her with it, they just get into a r/s, and then, regret later again.<br><br>Sun baby, i think you shld really think twice now( i guess you are regretting some of your decisions). Do you want to be with this man, and truely love him as who he is and vice versa? Ask him..and stop indulging yourself in those honey words he may said to you.<br><br>Rem, think of a r/s that last for a lifetime, a commitment that both parties are willingly to make. Hope your relationship will last...<br>good luck!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
