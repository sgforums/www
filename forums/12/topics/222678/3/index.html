And for me, I working from morning 8.30Am to night 12am, as I am holding two jobs. One Full time office job and one full time at The Pub. He don mind that me working pub. Only hope I know wat I am doing. But until now we Never chat on e phone coz he don like to talk on e Phone.He doesnÂ’t seems to Care 4 Me as time goes by. We even meet once in two week. When he book Out he only will spend his time on his doyta and sleeping. He will never spend<br>Time with me even not trying to understand me more. I am very vexed. Does he love me? Is it I have no time to acc him?<br>Should I give up this useless relationship?

I remembered my 1st bf who was in NS during my younger days.  He would always meet up with me after he booked out and i would be the last one he saw before he booked in.  Can still remember the broad smile he had the moment he saw me after each of his book out.<br><br>Guys are human too, gfs want to see them, they would want to see their beloved gfs too.  If they really want to see their gfs, they will definitely make time.<br><br>But everyone is different, the frequency to meet up would of cos be different too.  But meeting up only once a fortnight, not chitchatting over the phone and no frequent sms-es at all is definitely weird for someone in love.</div>
