It depends on the skills of the seducer as well as his/her looks. You can't expect a nerdy guy to be able to seduce a pretty party girl right? Even his skills with seducing is at absolute perfection. He can't even pass the first stage ie physical attraction. The girl doesn't allow him to seduce. Similarly, it does not work for a nerdy guy on a handsome sporty hunk. Just does not work that way.<br><br>Your analogy on chefs...It's like comparing two different things together. It's like comparing apples and oranges also.

It depends on the skills of the seducer as well as his/her looks. You can't expect a nerdy guy to be able to seduce a pretty party girl right? Even his skills with seducing is at absolute perfection. He can't even pass the first stage ie physical attraction. The girl doesn't allow him to seduce. Similarly, it does not work for a nerdy guy on a handsome sporty hunk. Just does not work that way.<br><br>Your analogy on chefs...It's like comparing two different things together. It's like comparing apples and oranges also. Females are always better in this area of seduction and/or relationships. They might have perfected or were born to be good to begin with. Males can be just as good but in relation to the females, they are a small bunch.<br><br>doko<br><br></div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> I don't think you get what I am trying to say - in reference to the analogy I have given, I am actually implying that having MORE doesn't always mean better in that sense.<br><br>The Law of Seduction states that either you are seducing or you are being seduced.

I was referring to BGR seduction-related matters. In BGR issues, my view is that females are born seducers whereas males who are in small numbers, are naturals. Of course, through trial and error, males and females can be great seducers in this aspect.<br><br>I don't want to generalise but I just can't help but feel this way. It's like the law of nature taking effect.<br><br>In order for seduction to take place, attraction must begin. That is why I feel seduction and attraction are inter-related. If I like the girl, I make it easier for her to seduce me. Same case for the girl.<br><br>You mentioned you have seen nerds managed to get party girls but what is the story behind it? Not that Im questioning your experience, but there are some things that goes behind the scene you may not know. For example, this girl just like this nerdy guy's face for some unknown reason. But don't you think it is a rare case compared to the number of party girls willing to accept a nerdy guy as a bf? Maybe the guy is rich? Maybe the guy is just for company? Maybe the guy is the rebound guy?<br><br>Then, you brought in other areas of life which you put them into the seduction category. I call it "selling yourself" to others. How you create a posture and a kind of image to others through your style and personality. There are different  ways to sell yourself. True, in some ways, it is a form of seduction and/or salesmanship...the ability to rapport.<br><br>To tell you the truth, I like this topic a lot and I don't like that John Crap either.<br><br>Thanks for replying.<br><br>doko <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
