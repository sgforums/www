Hence you are making yourself even more confused. Isn't it easier if you continue to go out with her without thinking too much about her actions, and if you are curious why she behaved that way, you can just ask her straight away. There is no use keeping everything inside yourself. Communication is the key of every relationship.<br><br>Sorry if this is not sth you want to hear.</div>
