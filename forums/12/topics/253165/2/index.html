TS obviously have tried to communicate with her mum already but still fail. afterall who likes to come here n whine abt his or her problem? she needs help and constructive advices from us, NOT just critics only.<br><br>to TS, ur mum is typically those kind of old fashioned thinking woman who cannot accept the fact of staying out or going overseas with a guy before marriage. i stress, BEFORE marriage. We cannot change their thinking, however let me ask you this way, if next time your daughter wants to go overseas with another guy who is her bf, what will be your concern? when pre-marital sex now getting more common, ur mum's concern cannot be avoided~.<br><br>different mother will have thinkings. dats the reality. you are already 24 years old, so ya. why nt talk to ur mum? hmm...<br><br>actually why nt wait till after marriage den u all go on holiday together? Yes, u talk abt ur personal freedom but i advice u to think abt ur mum. n if i were ur bf, i wouldnt actually asked u to go on a tour with juz 4 pple, with another couple somemore. yeap.<br><br>cheers~</div>

She has been very independent since she was a pre-teen and never gave me cause for any concern.<br><br>TS, the only plausible reason I can think of as to why your mum is so strict is because of your tendency to behave impulsively and/or have gotten yourself into fixes before that needed your parents to extradicate you out from? Are you the tong tong hee type of girl that's why your mum so worried for you?<br><br>If you say you are responsible and not what I stated above, then your mum must have watched too many TVB dramas and think that once you are out of her sight, the worst case scenario will befall you.<br><br>I believe there are mums who are control freaks.

It's HER way or I am an unfilial daughter.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  Oh well, I survived the emotional blackmail and I only visit her when necessary to avoid her 'nostranamus' predictions of how my children will end up due to my parenting style.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by melody83:</div><div class="quote_body">have a quarrel with my mum yesterday about i wanting to go to Bangkok with my friends (her and her bf) and my bf in Sep. But my mum strongly against it so she scolded me and my friend for inviting me to go Bangkok with her and her bf. Mum even said my friend "People hiao, u also hiao. People go tour with bf why must invite both of u?"<br><br>I really cannot stand my mum. i really don't see that there is anything wrong for going for a holiday with my bf. I already 24 and my bf 28. Me and him have been together for 4 yrs. And y must all this sort of nonsense be happening to me? Cannot go chalet, cannot go anywhere that must stay overnight. Cannot go bf's house cannot come back before 12 midnight. Everytime go out with bf very stress, always must go back on time. If fail to do so, she make sure she scold me till i cry for two days before her anger goes off. Although she gives me what i want, she control my freedom. I get things i wanted but not freedom! Even hid my passport so that i cannot get out of the country.<br><br>y, y must she be like that.. she knows my bf dun smoke, dun drink, never go pub and all these..<br><br>i really wanna to go holiday with my friends and bf  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br></div></blockquote>What I feel after reading your problem<br><br>1- Over Protective (mom)<br><br>2- You often Listen to her, thus she has the Total Control over you (and she will expect this same thing of total control of you if you don't wake her up and break free, short of rebel in a way, but do it gently)<br><br>3- Occasionally, speak to her, tell her what you want, and expect from her<br><br>4- Talk to her about marriage, to make sure she realise that you're not her young baby daughter 24 yrs back.<br><br>5- Talk sense, and use a softer approach, perhaps go shopping with her and have lunch and dinner than talk about it.<br><br>Don't confront her directly, if there's no distraction, your mom's defendsive barrier (out-dated &amp; over protective mother feelings) will be up<br><br>6- Intro you bf to you mom, let her know that you're in safe hands and you have found someone whom you can depend on just like your mother having found your dad (remind her on this thus perhaps she will realise that you really have grown up)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You can't demand freedom just because you are over 21 years of age. Freedom must be earned so that your mom will trust you to be safe. Obviously, she hasn't much confidence in you yet especially when there's only 1 guy and 2 girls in the group. Besides, BK is notorious in that there is the existence of lotsa temptation which your mom obviously fears you may not be able to resist.......<br><br>The more you demand, the more your mom will resist giving her approval. Instead, employ the more mature and sensible approach of sitting down with your mom to have a quiet heart-to-heart talk. Doing this also shows your mom that you've grown up and able to handle your own stuff....... whereas demanding freedom is a most childish way that only reinforces your mom's disapproval that you haven't learnt to be sensible and still immature.
