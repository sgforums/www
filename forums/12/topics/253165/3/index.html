            <div class='col-md body'>Hi TS,<br><br>I had this problem too, although my mum did not outright say i cannot do this or that, but when i stayed over at my ex's place, she'll use the guilt factor on me...<br><br>so listen to rainee and Yun, formally introduce ur bf to ur parents and let them see what a responsible and decent (I hope) guy he is,<br><br>and if even after getting to know ur bf on a deeper level doesn't help, do what I did.<br><br>Sit down with your mum one day and have a talk with her... let her know...<br><br>1) u know she does this out of concern and love,<br>2) that you are already 24, a responsible and working adult,<br>3) u have been dating him for more than 4 years,<br>4) that he is a trustworthy guy,<br>5) if she is afraid of u two "getting too close" let her know that just by not staying over, or spending the night together does not mean u two do not have the opportunity to "do it", that she has to Trust you,<br><br>This worked with me, as in she still doesn't like it when i used to stay over at my ex's place, but she'll only grumble but not excessively...<br><br>take note, this only might work if u have shown your mum in this past few years that you can make responsible decisions and that you have grown up.<br></div>
