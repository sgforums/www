            <div class='col-md body'>I have almost the same problem as you, just that my social circle is smaller than yours<br>I love to go watch shows too, etc<br>I sometimes think abt ending it too, but you know i think abt it and theres sooooo much i like to do for the world and experience for myself.<br>I used to always cry for no particular reason also, but i have since snap out of that retarded phase.<br>No use feeling sad for yourself, no one would see it and what you want is attention.<br>Life so far for you, has just been going with the 'flow' everything life throws at you just accept. Make things happen for yourself man! Don't wait for people to ask you out or get to know you.<br>Your parents treat you bad, well so be it. But next time when you are older treat them better.<br>Don't think of ending it. You could well be a person of great things, the world needs you.</div>

Everytime you want to reach out to the world the world always seemed to reject you.<br><br>I'm a person that think too much for my own good, i think of questions that is either deeply offending or strike fear into ppl and by nature i dislike confrontation. It's not a matter of winning or losing but i dislike losing control arguing over a matter of little importance. So it was better to stay away from me before the urge to ask the questions overcome reason.<br><br>I've been going out and doing things alone for a few years and you may start to realise you don't need a lot of friends to enjoy life. A few hours spent walking, admiring the surroundings and comtemplating about life's wonders is far more fulfilling than being someone you're not just to please your friends. Not to say you should totally give up on socialising though  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">, a rare moment of messing around and joking with friends is still very precious and enjoyable.<br><br>I see you've been trying to seek female companionship, maybe it's a soul mate you're looking for, someone you can click with spiritually and mentally.  But you think that it is a female you're looking for. Not asking you to be a gay, but maybe the person that could understand you might not neccesarily be a girl.<br><br>You are seeking for the one, aren't you? Much like me. However, unlike me you might still have a choice. Do you want to think that you are wrong and a fluke of nature or do you want to believe that it is the society that is wrong? The answer to that simple question might be far more fasincating than you imagine.</div>

It has little to do with these people generally.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>What do I mean?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>It means: all that sort of friends you are mentioning are all different people altogether. But in the end, everyone always somehow disappoint you, felt that they ain't good friends, etc - this only meant one thing: there is something about <strong>yourself</strong>, which you don't realise, that is pretty antipathy.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>If you look at all these issues one at a time: a similar pattern surface - you mentioned nothing about yourself at all. Under psychology: Johari Window - hidden self: your character - a subconscious part of it which you don't realise, that is the root of all these.) I don't know what is wrong, because I don't know you personally and even if I mention any of such traits, your sensitive nature would resume that I am being offensive, therefore I shall hold my lips this time.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>P.S: Everything happens for a reason - source for that reason and you will see the picture. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>

How old are you now? Are you a fortune teller? Why don't you help me tell my future for a change? Or.... Maybe let me tell you something...? With every minute you spend in this world you would probably be learning new experiences every now and then... Why give up on everything after you've invested so much? Where are your fruits..?

You probably would be uneasy if ya go. Probably because you've already got this form of mentality drilled so deeply before you attend it.

Are you a fortune-teller?<br><br><strong><br>net friends.<br>some of them i see them,talk to me,give me attitude.<br>anyway i dun wanna talk abt it too much.</strong><br><br>Then meet OTHER people...

Do you still have strict restrictions imposed on you? If ya do you can always try to work on it... It's YOR LIFE, it's in your hands... Stop putting the blames on everybody else though it's probably gonna make explaining things to yourself MUCH SIMPLER...

Frankly speaking I don't know? Maybe both of you just don't click? If you don't work out with this person you can always go for another? Join us at outings? Don't always go for 'one on one' where you're always upset about people...?<br><br><strong><br>so that sums up most of the ppl i know.</strong><br><br>How many people you know? I think by your 'rule' nobody should survive liao... Since most babies born would be spanked on the ass to make them cry for life and breath... If they're mentally aware enough to think a bit, they've probably CONCLUDED that the world is EVIL and consist of BAD people who spank them for no obvious reason... I believe you're a SCIENCE student or sort of? And I trust you know the 'Rule of Sampling'? Think about it....<br><br><strong><br>i am very disappointed in life liao.<br>i feel like going out.go arcade,movies.anywhere.<br>alone.</strong><br><br>There's a point in my life when I've done that, and I believe that I'm not the only one who does that? If you have to just go ahead? There really ain't nothing wrong with that...?<br><br><strong><br>because there wouldnt be a problem of latecoming.mis-communication.honestly i feel like crying.this is the first time i feel like crying after so many years. i really cannot take it anymore. </strong><br><br>Well...

            <div class='col-md body'>hmm.. agree with Yunhaier... i duno u either.. but if the same thing happen on you over and over again with different persons.. then maybe the problem is with you? i cant conclude whats the prob, but maybe subconciously you know.. ? think about it... what is the reason? would you always withdraw when you feel that this person is not nice to you? maybe you should go on trying to be nice? it takes time for us to know a person. tho' 1st impressions count.. but it might not really stay...<br><br>Or maybe, you have been to sensitive or possessive towards people around you? or you been expecting alot from people around you? i'm not saying that these are definate answers... but you might want to think thru?<br><br>And guess we just have to learn to be more optimistic in life.. feeling down once in a while is only natural.. but life still goes on.. you can choose to smile thru the day or frown all 24 hrs.. but since you will have to pass thru it either way, then why not smile right?<br><br>goodLuck  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> [/i]</div>

Things in life are often on a constant run... Changes... Sometimes it's NOT the REALITY which is affecting you... Instead it's the MENTALITY... Something which you HOLD ON to so DEEPLY... Even way after things have gone over... I'm not saying it's OVER, I'm just suggesting it COULD be? Or one day when it happens.. You probably won't be ready to accept it....<br><br>Reality is NOT 1-dimensional... It's known as the '3-dimensional' world.... And often when people see things, there should be AT LEAST 3 different sides to it... Straight to the point here... It's not what reality IS.... It's where you're looking at it from...? MENTALITY....<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> hmmm<br><br>The problem is we're NOT beggars nor charity? Don't EXPECT people to be nice to us for no obvious reason? I'm not saying they can't be... But just because you're like that or some of them are like that, you EXPECT the rest of the world to be like that... That's IMPOSSIBLE... Otherwise we won't be called INDIVIDUALS....<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> i am not expecting them to be nice to me or something.just that i try to be nice to you and ends up i get this kind of attitude loh<br><br>Virgos can basically be quite ok people... Maybe except when they're under STRESS... They changes quite alot upon that and admitably ain't a good handler of stress... The only small bonus for them is that they can be trained to better handle stress...<br><br>The other bad news is Virgos tend to be more pessimistic in their thinking &amp; often thinks too much over things... Which easily push them to the edge..? Well... Sort of...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> i never knew what was stress until i stressed myself last yr.<br><br>If you really want it SO BADLY then WORK for it or FIGHT for it...? I used to be like you and I've done my part for what I hold today... Ain't gonna share my method or suggest anything to you here, but all I can is... If you REALLY WANTS it, and you KNOW that it's something which you DESERVES... GO FOR IT....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow">  o..k..<br><br>I won't be surprised if she's a little intimidated by someone who actually left 5 missed calls on a single night? Especially if that someone is someone who goes after her demanding an EXPLANATION for that minor incident... (I'm not saying you've done that, I just thought you MIGHT have? Or hold that tendency to?)<br><br>Cut short here... If you find that to be such a worthy person, the MORE you should WORK to keep that friendship instead of reprimanding her...? Also, I'm sure you can find more of such people if ya expand your social circle a little (despite what your parents might say... I really don't see what's wrong with expanding your social circle as long as you're not dipping your head into BAD company 'Private Limited'?)... They might not be easy to trace down but I can ASSURE you they're OUT there...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> not trying to be rude her but tell that to my parents for the second part.<br>ok fine...5 calls too much.<br><br>I mean she should be EXCUSED. She probably might have let it slipped her mind or have something to attend to? And if she's only using an EXCUSE against you, it's OBVIOUSLY an EXCUSE to get you off..?

Justice? Well... WELCOME to REALITY... Though many would very much yearn for that IDEAL WORLD you've mentioned, things are often not necessarily the same... Of course, things would be so much simpler if we can just follow this 'system'... But the FACT is REALITY ain't that SIMPLE...
