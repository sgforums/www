Think about it this way.. if one girl were to keep saying she wants to break up each time you both quarrel.. This goes to show how keen she is in this relationship.. She can have or not to have.. since you mention that she has lots of friends out there to accompany her.. that even prove the point of having a relationship to her is nothing..<br><br>Ending or not.. is up to you decision.. if you have already made up your mind then dun turn back.. Maybe this way.. you feel better and happier.. to jus let go.. Holding on to a relationship where you see no future.. pointless.. and jus for the sake of being together.. Do you think in the end you'll still happy??<br><br>Cheers..</div>

But time will heal.. depending on how long it takes.. YOu still have feelings for her.. But then if you insist on carrying on this relationship.. it wont do you both good.. if this were to drag on.. you be hurt even more.. cos you are giving youself a false hope..<br><br>Hoping that she will change for the better.. she will understand you alittle more.. she wont stop goin out with that bunch of friends.. Are you hoping and wishing that one day these will happen?? Seriously.. it will not.. like what everyone always says "it takes two hands to clap"<br><br></div>

Cos i bet there's no one ever tell her such things before.. so you'll be the first one.. telling her what's wrong.. About the relationship.. about her.. about you.. how you feel.. and how she always been undreasonable this and that..<br><br>At the very least you explain to her.. what's the cause of all these.. This time round.. not her asking for a breakup.. is you who intiated.. i know is very hurting.. but once you say it out.. she listens and know about.. both still can be friends.. I'm sure that last time none of her bf did that.. Mostly all breakups.. are jus breakup.. and that's it.. Have you ever know what's the reason behind it??<br><br>People often don't know.. and will never learn.. as they thought is always not their fault AT ALL.. you never know.. cos the other never ever say it out..<br><br>Cheers..</div>
