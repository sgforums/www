            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by skitzern:</div><div class="quote_body">wah lau eh...ok this is about my sec 3 sister again.<br><br>ok today i went school n got back at about 5pm+. my sis was home already, inside her bedroom. then when i went to my bedroom, n sat on my desk, i realized my stack of magazines i placed at the corner of my desk has been like kenna touched or rearranged slightly!<br><br>then i suspect my sister has been into my room n read or look thru my magazines without my permission. oh ya the magazines were men's health, maxim n FHM...<br><br>then i looked at my bed, it look a bit creased! i m sure someone has been lying down on it. i think it's surely my sis. so i look at my pillow n sure enough, i found a strand of long hair. long hair leh, i don't have long hair. so confirm must be my sister. my mum has short hair n so does my dad. i went to smell my pillow n bloody hell, got my sister's shampoo smell....<br><br>then i looked at my bottle of vodka on my desk (i opened already)...the alcohol in it looked lesser. probably my sister drank it. wah kao! how could she?? n i also wonder god knows what other things has she done... maybe look through my drawer of personal stuffs..<br><br>kanina so i can confirm that when i was not back home yet, my stupid sister must have been to my room n read or look through my men's health, fhm n maxim magazines. probably lying down on my bed n reading them. n then drinking my vodka<br><br>n surely not my dad or mum. my dad left the house at i think 6pm to drive taxi n my mum always busy with housework in the morning before she go to work. they were got so bo liao come to my room to kachiao?<br><br>wah lau, if she wanted to read she could at least ask for permission right? i don't like people to go inside my bedroom n touch my things without my permission or when i am not around. n furthermore drink my precious vodka! how could she? damn it. i hate it when people intrude my privacy n personal space.<br><br>i wanted to confront her n ask her if she did, but i m sure she will surely deny it n kick up a big fuss. so i forget it lah...<br><br>so at dinner time i sat down n stare at her with a buay song face, n she avoided my gaze. she must be guilty.<br><br>u guys every has such encounter where ur siblings go to ur room when u r not around n touch or look at ur things?<br><br></div></blockquote>Your sister has traits of becoming what my sister is today - a criminal.<br>It all starts with doing smal things like these and ends up stealing thousands from my mother, stealing the car at night (no license mind you) and returning it with scratches all over.<br>I hope your sister is just being juvenile and dosent end up like my sister. Sometimes i wonder if i have a family car to drive tomorrow or a house to live in at the rate my sister is creating all these nonsense. Oh well, time to look for a PR in another continent. My brother's doing the same too.</div>
