            <div class='col-md body'>My mum succumbed to cervical cancer 8 years ago when I was just 13.<br><br>The medication and the suffering her mother is going through is understandable. Cherish all the times you have left with her. However do not think much about when she is going to leave you. That will only bring more sorrow to you and your family.<br><br>This is the time for you to show her how much you really love and treasure her. If she scolded you for even the tiniest reason you can think of, just let her be. Do whatever she asks you to do and if she craves for some food, no matter how weird it may sound, try your best to fulfil that.<br><br>And certainly, matter of life and death is within the hands of God. Let's hope for a miracle to happen and she be cured of that dreaded disease. Be strong and I pray for her mother's recovery. Have faith in God.<br><br>You can give this advice to her. I wish you all the best.<br><br>Cheers and warm regards</div>

When one has fallen, the other must stand firm. The last thing that should happen is both parties succumbing to stress and tension and break down. You are the 'stronger' one - serve to empower your gf in times of needs.<br><br>Cheers</div>

During this time, u hafta be strong for her, even tho u're probably bearing the brunt of wat she's feeling @ the moment -- anger (why is this happening to Mum?), frustration (why can't I do anythg to alleviate her suffering/make her feel better?), sadness, devastation, &amp; a whole lotta other emotions.<br><br>Plenty of gd advice has been offered by the posters here.  Pls try to heed it.<br><br>RP<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by xking:</div><div class="quote_body">My gf mum is dying of cancer.....duno how to help. at times she just throw temper at me.for nothing....i got upset too but in the end...We hardly hav time for each other nowawdays.<br><br>I hope to cheer her up.

Yes, understandably that she will vent her frustrations at you since she has noone else to turn to. But, now's the time for you to be her pillar of support and just be there and helping her and her mom in any means you can ie driving or calling a cab when visiting the doctor. getting something that will make her mom happy be it a gift or bring her mom somewhere she wanted.<br><br>Cancer is one of the most pheared... umm... the treatments you have to go through are harsh.</div>
