Tell me, are u the oni son in the family? If so, then it's 'justifiable' that they are protective of you. They are afraid that u mixed wif bad company but what can u do abt it? Simple actually, bring your friends to your house once in awhile. Just ask them to come over for a game session in your room, watch vcds or even have dinner with your parents. Important thing is to assure your parents that u are in gd company of friends. Let them know who your friends are. Then, the least they will feel more obliged to let u go out as often or even as late as past midnite. They need assurances u c. Tell either your mom or dad that u r going out with friends whom they visited ur place b4. Ya, tis sounds unmanly but it'll helps.<br><br>I do believe the notion that if u work for your own money, it's justifiable to buy something of your own. But do think abt this, are u buying a digital camera just for fun? Just bcos your of peer pressure? Are u gonna use it often to justify buying it? Be practical, dun buy if it's not really neccessary.<br><br>Lastly, somethings neber change. Action speaks louder than words. Instead of taking pains to talk to your parents, start helping out in the housework... washing plates and such after makan. Clean up your room once in awhile. U know, stuff like that. Slowly, they'll notice that u are more independent and active in helping out the chores... they'll lose the grip on you and maybe the relationship is better.<br><br>Cheers ya.<strong></strong><strong></strong></div>

Always tell me to help out the housework, dun go out too late and such. Then I started to be responsible and they began to see a change in me. It's more significantly while I was in NS.
