Must be a gina or a weakling that don't know how to fend for herself that need the 'macho' bf to shelter her. How long are you going to shelter her? All her life? Eventually one of these days you will get tired of trying to shelter and protect her or maybe you 'go' earlier than her then who is going to protect and shelter her?<br><br>Second thing hor, are you working in her company to SEE it really happen? She cannot bluff meh just to get your attention. Or it was all in her mind that people are bullying her. Or maybe your gf tried to bully the old staffs but failed miserably.<br><br>In either of those two scenarios hor, you have no right to interfere. You can only lend a listening ear and maybe advice. Worse come to worst ask her resign and look for new job if she cannot win in office politics. YOU are only an outsider. What right have you to 'kaypoh' what is happening in her company? Beat the woman up for bullying your gf? So you think you become your gf hero? And you sound like a 'gina' oso'. Grow up and learn to be more mature in thinking!
