I had a god son. He passed away when he's 5mths old and before that everything seemed fine until he started crying non-stop for no apparent reasons and there's no physical illness or symptons that he's sick or not feeling well. There's no fever, eat as per normal but just cry alot. The crying started three days before he passed on. According to the doc's report on the death, my little god son had acute lung infection and it got him way before the sypmtons can show. Reason why the infection kill him before any symptons show? Easy...babies organs are not yet fully function well and the organs are still weak and easily get infected. The fact is they already am feeling uncomfortable just that they can only cry.<br><br>Don't risk if you love your kid. I'm serious. This is not a sob story I make up to make you birng your kid to the doc. For such a wonderful little life who can only cry to show discomfort, please don't risk. My god kid would have been 8yr old now if he's still around. It don't cost you much to bring your kid to the doc but it'll cost you your entire life if anything happens to him.</div>
