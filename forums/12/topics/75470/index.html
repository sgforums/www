In the first place, <strong>nobody say that, even by doing the right thing, the relationship will be ever-lasting.</strong> We all discover new things about our partner and our relationship everyday - it is this discovery that made us closer to reality... made us realise if she is really the one we will be together in the end.<br><br>She needed to breathe, not because of what you did, but because she feels that the relationship is restricting her mobility. Like a bird in cage, there are things in life where she may like to do, but the liability of a relationship could tie her down. She may dislike such feelings - always have to put bf as top priority and such. This may choke her and she feels enslaved.<br><br>So how? What to do?<br><br>Two words: Release her.<br><br>If she feels her self actualization lies else where for now, let her go because she wouldn't feel happy if this stage cannot be reach. You loved her? You must see blessing in her life - if this relationship cannot allow her that kind of happiness, why restrict? Has your love gone to such heights yet? Or are you still lingering in physical possession stage? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>
