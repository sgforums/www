What you can do.. now is maybe msg her lesser.. maybe once every 2 days that sort.. and take it slowly.. its not that you do not have a chance with her.. but maybe not the right time now..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Anything u do will still constitute pushiness<br><br>Just don't talk to her for a few months or unless she icq u . See how it goes. And IF she asks if you are angry or sad, just say you were busy that time. Talk to her normally as u would any friend . Don't talk romance shit or dating . It will turn on guard lights and see how it goes. Maybe by then u have another gf LOL</div>
