              <p>Dear all,</p>
              <p>Recently got together with a girl about 2-3mths back. Really different from all the 2 exes that I was with. But she's got an overwhelming distrust for me and Whatsapp is not helping at all due to its "Online" and "Last Seen Online" status updates. </p>
              <p>She consistently thinks I'm lying to her either texting other people or texting other girls of which I'm not. Her insistence of me lying and distrusting me has come up practically every week. Every time I find myself having to defend myself because I'm not the type that likes being accused if I've not done something at all. </p>
              <p>Any guys/girls experience the same thing?</p>

              <p>Her accusations (imho) aren't valid. I mean take 2 nights ago, I sent her a goodnight message at 2300, off my wifi and data to prevent any messages coming in etc. but guess what, she screenshot and sent me my last sent at like 2307 or something. How to proof to her that I'm not messing around? </p>

              It is utterly undignifying that one wants to relate to another and expects another to conform to onÃ©'s capricious, whimisical and palpablly unreconciled ''insecurities'' within oneself.
              This is no relationship and to assume that one is, is merely being delusional. Selective self-deception belies this stance. As to whom is rite/wrong, is not the issue that needs to be grappled with. Rather, self-honesty make avial oneself to the possiblity of reconciliation, n by that is implied, not to another but withIN oneself.  There is no such thing as a ''good'' relationship. It is a myth and it is the undoing of many .... There is this and this is all that matters - the ability to relate to oneself and from there being able to understand the other's foibles or what have u. The first ripple makes all the difference. The quality of one's life is not dependent on relationships but rather the quality of being able to relate.
              
              PS - As for comparison, it is neurosis!

              <p>and Cycloneeee.. NO.. there are no better girls out there.. all girls ARE LIKE THAT...a lot of them just show themselves not to be.. but when you are with them.. the story changes..</p>
              <p>Don't worry about it.. girls get very suspicious in the early phase of a relationship.. it's because they probably have been played out in the past.. after some time, they will get over it.. they can't be feeling suspicious all the time.. they will get tired of it..</p>
              <p>If you really don't like the suspiciousness.. it's really easy to handle it.. you pamper her, she will not be suspicious.. girls are feeling people.. when they feel you love them, they feel secured.. giving your gf kisses and pecks, hug her.. stuff like that.. not when she's asking for it.. but at moments when she less expects it.. she will start to feel comfortable in the relationship..</p>
              <p>For those who don't know.. the girls who are suspicious.. are the faithful ones.. if your gf is not jealous.. you better be worrying.. (but this 'rule' doesn't apply for long relationships that have lasted for many donkey years.. )</p>
