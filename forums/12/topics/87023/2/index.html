I initially love the girl because of my initial perceptions about who she is, but later on in the long run,I love the kind of girl who ACTUALLY responds to my affections, and because of the graceful creature she is full of faith and empathy and is friendly. But attractions are the 1st step in anything.<br><br>Haha ur not the only guy. I have a friend (girl) who is always flooding ME with smses, keeps asking wat i am doing and telling me what she is doing.</div>
