            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks for all the replies. I am taking it slow first to sort out my feelings, in case its just a crush. I find her attractive not just becos I like her looks but also I find it enjoyable talking to her. Not sure if the attraction is 2 sided, hope I don't mistaken over friendliness for interest again. I am not very experience in matter of relationship and past rejections by girls of same race make this 1 sees so much more unlikely. How to know some 1 likes you?</div>

BTW you can check my user id in hardwarezone forum, I am using a similar 1 and I don't chiong my posting. I only post in thread I am interested in and quite rarely.Only found out about this forum today when I do a search on indian girl relationship(or something similar). I am rather glad some 1 else share my view in seeing beauty in other race but sad that I am question in my first thread. You know it would be better if you question some 1 not only for 1 coincidence(more than 1 occurance) or if some 1 is posting rubbish. If you consider this thread is rubbish you can just leave. Thanks for your attention.</div>
