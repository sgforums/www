ARGH!!!!</div></blockquote>Do what I do ... *Hee Hee* Grab a really good book, preferable Sci-Fi/Fantasy and read it at every single bloody opportunity.  Goods ones to recommend are Brian Lumley's Vampire series (Horror/Sci-Fi), Terry Prachett &amp; Niel Gailman's Good Omens (Comedy), The Last Legends of Earth by A.A. Anato??? (forgot the name) &amp; Greg Bear's Hammer of God (Sci-Fi).  If you are unsure about which books, ask me.  I'm good with them ...<br><br>Or you can write a diary/journal in your weaker language so that you can think things through first before putting them to words.  I encrypted mine with hieroglyphs ...<br><br>All in all, it always boils down to attitude.  When you are ready, You Are Ready.<br><br>Be well.  :-)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi Inzaghi,<br><br>it would seem that my determination is just ainÂ’t strong enough, barely a few hours and here iÂ’m again. one part of me hopes that the Chit Chat forum takes just long enough to resume working status so that by the time it does, it doesnÂ’t matter to me anymore, on the hand, the other part of me misses it although i must say, not as much as before though. but then again, it could be due to the depressing day iÂ’ve had and will have for a few more days.<br><br>and helloooooo, since when am i always kanna banned? only kanna censured once and i stopped flirting there with pacman because i know he will abide by the rules and not flirt with me, so why make myself lose face there? cannot flirt there, i flirt in here lor  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">.<br><br>alamak, Inzaghi you young, young only, 28 years old max, can get heart attack ah, just reading the flirting posts? er, then how do you cope with the excitement of the actual handy panky?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">! er, then i shall make you people more jealous then although i think in this forum, not a lot of people will read it but what the heck?!<br><br>with regards to faroutnews.com, you donÂ’t need to register, you just type your name and post, so anybody can impersonate anybody there.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">.<br><br>and with regards to the Utopia forum, just click on Â“Hop To:Â” and choose Utopia from the Category: Free Forums, but nobody posts there either, although Revey did post there last night, i havenÂ’t seen sparkle though.<br><br>so, hereÂ’s to make people puke and jealous again  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> :<br><br>hi pacman  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>the sky in Singapore yesterday was still clear and bright, not cloudy at all  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> unfortunately yesterday was a particularly busy and distressing day, especially around noon when the news came, man i was so sad and depressed, am still depressed. reached home around 4 pm, didnÂ’t notice the sky at all although i knew that it was a sunny day, had a short nap to sleep off the sad mood, felt a little better when i woke up, felt even better after a short email to a friend, yeah much better and off i go again. the Singapore sky around 6 pm was beautiful again because i was happy again, one side of it was clear and blue and the other was a little cloudy, just like how iÂ’m feeling, optimistic and pessimistic at the same time. *sighs* this is going to be a long week, not because of the concessions iÂ’ve to make but the pain and concern i know iÂ’ll feel, i feel iÂ’ve failed in my duty.<br><br>saw three, yes three low flying airplanes in the sky too on my way to Yishun, i wonder if theyÂ’re the same plane? and the half moon was visible too, yeah at 6 pm, seeing the sky and thinking of you made my carelessness easier to bear. am i feeling guilty? a little but iÂ’ll rationalize it away soon, i hope iÂ’ll remember this lesson for life.<br><br>as i looked out of the window this evening from where i was, i saw this huge, mature rain tree, the leaves were folded by then, the sky was blocked by the tree and the flats, shall i think of you in future when i see rain trees too?  er, but then, how would i be able to concentrate and work? missed the sunset today because i was in the wrong direction, but tomorrow when i look out of the window, thereÂ’ll be no flats to block my view and it will be spectacular, it always is when i remember to look up and look out of the window. er, may i think of you then?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>at 7.45 pm tonight, the Singapore sky was still blue, it was getting darker, by then the glorious sunset has passed but stars came out to cheer me, itÂ’s really hard to see bright twinkling stars and i counted 5, mind you, i wear glasses and itÂ’s good enough that i can spot them.<br><br>i came across an eye chart today, tried reading the words without my glasses, canÂ’t read beyond the 3rd row from 3 to 5 ft away, oh man, i needed to stand within 1 ft of the eye chart to read the very last line, while the 70 plus year old woman who was with me rattled off the numerals on the very last line of the eye chart standing at 5 ft away, it was the only fun incident for me today.<br><br>10.00 pm on the way home, thinking of what to write to you, still feeling happy and yet feeling sad. 10.20 pm to now, totally sad, tomorrow is another long day, i hope iÂ’ve happy news. when i stare out of the window tomorrow, overlooking town, i hope nothing blocks my view and if possible, to remember to think of you and be able to smile.<br><br>if things does not improve and my mood does not improve, this would be my last flirting post to you, it doesnÂ’t mean i donÂ’t think of you, just that the mood for flirting is not there, i hope everybody recovers and then pacman baby, iÂ’ll be chasing you passionately across the forums again, just like old times. take care and God bless.<br><br>yours,<br>colette</div>
