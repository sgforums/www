Or you wasted ten years revolving your life around a woman that doesn't give a damn about you? NEVER pin your hope on somebody to tell you straight into your face to 'Move On; it's impossible between us' - because only a handful of people would react in such a way. Most of them prefer to lead their life, regardless of how others, whom they have no feelings for, loved them like crazy.<br><br>This isn't faithful... this is delayed delusion and truely long lasting indeed. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>You held onto a blind faith, thinking that if you could work hard by waiting hard, you may probably end up with her. You force yourself into delusion mode, slogging like a mad man, shifted your focus, but refuse to accept this cruel reality that has slap you not once, not twice, but several times. </strong></span><br><br>Love is MORE than working hard my dear. Hard waiting equals nothing if you mean nothing to her. Have you thought of the fact that you are shoving your liking down her throat? So what if you have spend ten years waiting for her?<br><br>What has TEN YEARS have to prove anything?<br><br>So what if it is TEN YEARS?<br><br>It doesn't matter, isn't it?<br><br>The fact remains - your refusal and resistance to move on cost you one decade of youth. Continue to play fool with yourself, bask with self lies, get dead drunk and live in your world of delusion, you can persist in this dream of yours for the next ten years or how many 'ten years slot' you could spare - Nothing will change.<br><br>If Love was in the picture, you two would have been together right from the start.<br><br>Don't kid yourself.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>
