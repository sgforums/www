            <div class='col-md body'>Oh man this is really so sad and torturing. Its really an undying love~ This is so rare. Are you a Taurus? Famous for having a mind set on something and not change it. A round of applause for your determination man!<br><br>I hate to spoil your plan but sometimes you have to learn to let go because you are hurting yourself so much. If she is yours, she will be yours long already ever since you first asked her. 10 years is way too long, you cant spent your life just waiting and waiting. How many more years to spare?<br><br>Learn to open up your heart to others who may love and treasure you more. You wouldnt know what you have missed just waiting for her so long. Love cant be forced, it happens naturally. For her you can just wish her happiness, be happy that she is happy, and make yourself happy too.    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> smile~ Dont drown yourself in deppression and unhappiness anymore. You wouldnt want her to be guilty for making you like that too.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello Yonghao<br><br>I really feel for you. I am sure at a later point of time, there will be people telling you to be yourself and how the right girl will come later. But I am offering you the last throw of the dice to win her over.<br><br>I canÂ’t guarantee you get that SL girl, but itÂ’s worth a try.<br><br>But first of all, you must really realize where you failed to impress her so that when you get another shot, you will not screw up.<br><br>Reasons for her low interest in you:<br>1) You are a desperate guy in her eyesÂ…Part I<br>At the initial stage of a courtship, you must make SL wonder about you. The more time she spends time thinking and wondering about what you might be doing, the higher her interest level will be. Then she will have a desire to know more about you.<br><br>But you are always available to her. You fetch her from work, you kept hinting about hitching up with her. And you think by being persistent, she should feel touched and she will suddenly realize you are the one for her? Truth is, you are suffocating her. Imagine a girl doing the same things you didÂ…always available, always hinting about a possible relationship, whatever interest you have in her will evaporate as well.<br><br>2) You appeared desperate in her eyesÂ…Part II<br>You placed SL on a pedestal and regard her as some kind of goddess. You even declared your love publicly to let the whole world know how wonderful and important SL is. The problem is when you start treating someone like she is precious gold, she WILL think that she is precious gold!<br><br>And the result? She will start to think, Â“If I can get this guy to be so interested in me, then I definitely deserve better than him.Â” That means you are always a back up guy to her. Never give her a reason to believe she is better than you at the initial stage of a courtship. You can hint about your interest but you must show by your actions that you are equally happy without her<br><br>3) You appeared desperate in her eyesÂ…Part III<br>The best way to get a girl interested in you is to show her what you have to offer first.<br>SL is a young girl when you met herÂ…she is probably still a young lady now. Girls of her age look out for a few personality traits: A fun guy to be with, cocky but humorous, confidence, strength (as in not supplicating to women all the time and have his own opinion about things) and looks obviously.<br><br>What you should have done is to display what you can offer to her by showing some attention to her at first. Then, you withdraw and take away some attention from her to confuse her and make her wonder more about you. That will raise her interest level.<br><br>Your friend QW is an example of a cocky and Â“full of himselfÂ” type of guy, he can keep SL interested for a while. She is attracted to his confidence.<br>The other friend YH did not supplicate to her when he is criticizing her mum, he says things as they appeared to him. He doesnÂ’t seek to please her or seek her approval. She could be intrigued by the strength and dominance he displayed.<br><br>And you? You showed her sincerity. Then you wondered why she is not touched by it? But hey, my dog is sincere too, so what? If you two are already in a relationship, then sincerity is very important to her. If you are courting her, you have to display some of what you can offer to her that will make her attracted to you, then she will consider whether you are sincere. But you didnÂ’t show her enough. Instead you vomited your emotions all over the place by declaring how you wish to hold her hand?<br><br>Recommendation:<br>1) Cut her off. No more emails/phone calls/sms from you. Cut her off to ensure that she must initiate contact with you. If she doesnÂ’t initiate contact, her interest level is officially zero and she doesnÂ’t even care whether you exist.<br><br>2) Be genuinely busy with something in your life. When she do contact you, make sure your excuses are valid for why you have not seen her or met up with her. You should in the meantime be pursuing your own life and your hobbies. Self improvement is very important. There is no point getting her if you donÂ’t have a life except working.<br><br>3) Keep maintaining this pattern for a while so that she does more of the initiating than you do. Keep your conversations light and pick up key words she mentioned, then you expand the conversation using those key words to keep her talking (a conversation is like a tree with many branches). The key here is to keep her talking, then be the one to end the call first. Make sure she doesnÂ’t suspect you are lying about being busy.<br>When you are finally getting a chance to meet her alone, you are going to show her fun and make sure she has a great time. No more expressing your love or any thing like that. DonÂ’t try to advice her if she mentions any relationship problems, concentrate on showing her a good time<br><br>4) Keep pushing and pulling and maintain this pattern. Observe carefully whether she is treating you any differently. This time, you are going to be VERY sure that she has interest in you before you HINT about your interest. HINT means you donÂ’t overdo it! Remember what I said about how your desperation puts you out of the game.<br><br>5) Be willing to lose her. This is the final throw of the dice really.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yonghao honestly speaking when I read your passage for the first time I really felt sad for you. but I really want to point out a few things that may point to the fact that it was a total waste of effort and love.<br><br>1)  "declared in class to everyone of my classmate i love her."<br><br>I just find this a abit strange if you love someone you should tell her privately why must u declared to the whole class? Will she be embrassed? ever thought of her feelings?<br><br>2) . " At that time i have a girlfriend from other school call SM but she is not the one i love. "<br><br>So you love SL but you when out and found another gf? Wow nice leh and the best part u do not love her at all. So am i right to say that SM is just a toy to you? Just curious as to why you want to be with someone whom you do not love?<br><br>3)  "i every friday not working sure fetch her after work. one sunday at year2000 before CNY i call her to tell her i really wish to hold her hand care about her but she told me she not ready to accept my love as she need time to forget QW. fuuk i told myself, what the hell i doing unable to show her i care her, like her, love her. i got drunk daily almost even at my friend birthday i can finish a 3/4bottle of martell before midnight where the birthday cake not cut and have the gut to drive from east coast park to west coast."<br><br>You asked her to be your gf, she rejected you nicely as she could not commit to a new relationship so fast. You could have waited for her and give her care and concern waiting for her to change her heart but you went drinking instead. Do you realise that you could kill yourself if you drink and drive?<br><br>4)  "finally i call SL in my car at her house downstair, she told me yes, i bless them, and in my heart the feeling i got the same actually what i got in 6 year ago. i drop the phone i scream and shout in the car and drove to kent ridge to scream and shout my anger out, i drink again, got half drunk. i wait ten year plus for her."<br><br>You bless them? humm... then why the screams and shouts in the car? Wow nice blessing.. If you really want to bless them from your heart, your heart should be at peace cos she had found someone who can take care of her and not screaming, shouting and drinking to numb your senses. This signs shows that you just want her to be your gf not love her truly at all.<br><br>5) "i wait ten year plus for her. i wait for her 5 year to forget her unpleasant past. i got this ending. i miss out so my girl, never get serious in woo and court a girl, yet i got this. stupid right, this call friend"<br><br>This part I got to ask you properly, : " Did the girl ever say she loved you at all during these so call 10 years of wait?" She never right? When you were down and out was she there for you?<br><br>So am I right to say for these 10 years she never say or hint to u that she liked you at all. You turn to drinking, shouting, screaming and nearly got kill for someone who heck cares about you. Is it really worth it ?  At this point of time she is the arms of someone whom she loves and does not care for you at all.<br><br>My advice for you is this : you have already wasted 10 years of your life on someone who never love you, how many 10 years do you have left? I know is tough to forget her back the very fact is that she never love you at all. YOu tried 10 years liao not tiring meh?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There is a story about a fly and a closed window. The fly wishes to fly out into the open space, instead of remaining cooped up in a room with no way for it to get out other than a small window located at the top of the room. So every morning, the fly would bang itself on the windowpane, convinced that if it does that enough time, it would one day be able to fly away into the open space, and be free again.<br><br>The fly died without ever regaining its freedom <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>my man, yonghao, curiousOrange has written some very good advice for guys who are chasing girls...Should never come across as desperate, have passion and drive in our own lives, never be a pushover, never let her know that she's got you around her little finger... Some good advice.<br><br>But the recommendations for what you should do: wait for SL to initiate contact, push and pull the string in hope that she will develop some attraction for you... this course of action takes time. Her impression of you has been cemented over many years. It will take quite some time to change it.<br><br>Well, I feel you should try to let go. To quote starExcaliblur, "Sometimes we look so hard at the closed door that we didn't see another is already open waiting for us"<br><br>Cut off contact with SL. Forget abt her. You can live without her. Trust me, the pain is only temporary. It always is. You are an eligible guy, have your own business, you're an entrepreneur. As much as you love and want SL, I can feel there is already alot of bitterness towards her. A relationship cannot be built with that standing in the way.<br><br>Be strong. Will yourself to let her go.</div>
