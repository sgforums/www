            <div class='col-md body'>Well, from a guy's perspective, when he goes too deep into a relationship, it freaks him out because he is going to lose his independence, and more importantly a sense of self. A word of advice, give him a little freedom, so that he may find his inner self. Then, you will see the person that you fell in love in the first place.</div>

Too conscious and "ZAI YI" whether he sms you anot.. Love is not said thru sms.. I know girls sometimes will like to hear such things.. but if he says it everytime.. wouldn't it be meaningless after awhile.. ONce a while you hear him say out of no way.. you feel so much happier... then he says this to you.. everytime he sees you.. or sms you...<br><br>Love is all in the heart.. Not sayiing jus for saying..<br><br>Calm yourself down.. don' woory too much on this.. it's normal.. if you still think is a porblem to you... or there's a need to tell him how you feel.. then do it.. Keeping to yourself.. you tend to let your imagination run wild.. asking yourself many "WHYs".<br><br>One day.. when you cannot take it.. you'll explode like a volcano! maybe you sit down and ask him.. in a casual way like.. "hey.. today busy with sch/work? i sms oni put smiley ah~ nothing else liao meh?? " something like tat.. dun meet him.. and show him.. a long pull face.. he had a long day too.. when he sees you like that.. he oso sianz....

I know girls sometimes will like to hear such things.. but if he says it everytime.. wouldn't it be meaningless after awhile.. ONce a while you hear him say out of no way.. you feel so much happier... then he says this to you.. everytime he sees you.. or sms you...<br><br>Love is all in the heart.. Not sayiing jus for saying..<br><br>Calm yourself down.. don' woory too much on this.. it's normal.. if you still think is a porblem to you... or there's a need to tell him how you feel.. then do it.. Keeping to yourself.. you tend to let your imagination run wild.. asking yourself many "WHYs".<br><br>One day.. when you cannot take it.. you'll explode like a volcano! maybe you sit down and ask him.. in a casual way like.. "hey.. today busy with sch/work? i sms oni put smiley ah~ nothing else liao meh?? " something like tat.. dun meet him.. and show him.. a long pull face.. he had a long day too.. when he sees you like that.. he oso sianz....
