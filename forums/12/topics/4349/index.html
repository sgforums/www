            <div class='col-md body'>Depression is being listless, melancholic, lethargic and wallowing in self-pity rolled into one.<br><br>Cure?  Laughter but sometimes people wants to be depressed so they can self-pity and take comfort in that fact.  Apart from 2 tight slaps to her face and ask her to wake up.  The cure is still up to her to crawl out from that state.  That's the most succint way I can put it.  No rudeness or agression intended.    :p<br><br>[This message has been edited by Klactovak (edited 30 June 2001).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Depression can be manifested in may forms(depending on individuals) other than the few Klactovak has stated. When u have depression, u can also experience insomnia, lack of appetite, fever and others.<br><br>The best cure is relax, through outdoor activities, or anything. However, to cure it takes time and it will still come back when u feel stressed or wateva that had caused ur depression.<br><br>'Live life to the fullest each day.'</div>
