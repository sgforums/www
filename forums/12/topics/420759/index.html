              Life is full of up and down, almost everyone knows that. But sometimes we are not strong enough to tackle these emotional swings, and when we suffer from it, we will vent it out, hurting another person.
                      
              To start it off, let me describe my case. I am only a Secondary 4 kid. This is the age where kids start to prepare for their Os, aiming for top JCs or best Poly course. For me, I experienced no difficulty academically but there is something that constantly bugged me, my social being.
                      
              Everyday I dread attending lessons, fearing that one of my classmates will again start mocking me, and everytime he does that, I felt violent, literally, wanted to bash him up but of course I understood resilience and tolerated, quietly.
              Now, here is the scary part, whenever I had difficulty in school, I will vent it out when I return home, by screaming and accusing my mother. I know this is very bad, very very bad but I really cannot help it. I will describe it as it feels great that someone had tears in her eyes, cause I felt, someone at least understood what I felt but at the same time[though when my classmate accused me I didnt cry] I felt guilty of those hurtful words used.
                      
              I know this should stop but I cant! It sort of happens automatically when I am upset. Schooling should be all about fun and new great experiences but I do not enjoy these but contradictingly, schooling is a miserable place for me.
              
              Fellow forumers, any advice you could give?

              <p>This is a chain reaction, and a really bad one.</p>
              <p>You are bullied in school, so you came home to bully your mother. </p>
              <p>There is nothing to feel guilty about what your classmates said, there is only sadness to be felt. If the teachers are unable to do anything about those monkeys, you can seek the discipline master for help. If he/she is unwilling to do anything, seek the principal for help. If the principal does not do anything, send a letter to MOE for help.</p>
              <p>Of course, to do the above, you will require a lot of courage. And that is what you are missing right now. With courage, you will not back down when your classmates bully you and vent the anger on your mother. I am not asking you to fight, but to seek authority help. If you actually sent a letter to MOE, your principal will certainly be force to act, but use that only as a last resort.</p>
              <p>I am sure that a lot of people will be scolding you later, so be prepared. After all, your mum brought you up all these years, and you treated her as nothing more than a ventilation cylinder. Once you have the courage to stand up against those monkeys, you will have to muster up the courage to apologise to your mother for treating her like crap all these while. </p>

              <p>You are taking your mother for granted, since she will always be there for you no matter what you do.</p>

              <p>If you really want to vent your frustrations, go beat the crap out of your classmates instead, deal with the problem yourself, don't take it out on your mom.</p>
              <p>I hate to say it, but your a loser. I'm sure you are angry now, but if you don't want me saying that, then start learning how to deal with your own problems.</p>
              <p>I was a loser too, but eventually, I fought back, now I can proudly say that I can deal with my own problems. You got to learn to stand up for yourself.</p>
