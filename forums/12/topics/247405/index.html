Sure you can use the $ to invest on other thing BUT without the willpower to invest how can you invest big bucks ? Buy 4D You can wait and soon when you strike you will relieased that you had lose more $ , buy stocks ? Sure but isn't it too risky? and end up paying debts ? So there is really no shortcuts in life everything got to start from a very small step.<br><br>Felt that their $ had been cheated ? Then why must they attend the 2nd or 3rd day lessons ?

            <div class='col-md body'>I am currently feeling really unmotivated by my job. Late daily hahaha. Just dun like my colleauges...actually we never talk coz of generation gap. I wonder is it me ? The job ? or the people ? Now too tired to try other jobs to know if it is a purely "me" problem. Just wondering if any other people had experiences where "people ie colleauge" problem can cause one to feel unmotivated to work. In my previous job, I was much more motivated ...working into late nites, striving for promotion...but not now.</div>
