When it comes to feelings, it's the same. No such things as girls understand girls better thus they can withold the r/s better.<br><br>2) Those who are born les. (ok...I know this might lead to some argumentative comments from some)<br>These people, no matter how much they hate to be les, there's no way for them to have likings for guys unless of course they are determine enough to lie to themselves that they like their guy partner.<br><br>3) Those who are curious.<br>These people are often reffered as confused and undecisive or are more open to experiments. On nicer terms, they are explorer.<br><br>There are many other more but ultimately all I can tell you is, just be yourself and be true to your own heart. It doesn't matter if you are les or straight.</div>
