              <p>Hello people. this thing has been bothering me for quite sometime.. It goes like this... I'm the youngest at home and i have a super ill- tempered sister. not only ill - tempered but also controlling me. Such as having the " before 12am curfew" and she intrude my privacy by peeping into my handphone all the time.. when i disobey her such as going home after 12am , she will just go crazy and start to whack me up. all the kicks, slaps and scratches. FYI, she is  small in size around 40kg?  while i'm a basketball player. I did not punch her in the face but instead push her aside. After all. i respect her as a sister.</p>
              <p> Next, She dislike my bf because i used to have alot of quarreling issues with him. however, now we've sort things out and are happier than before. But then she continued to be very rude to him and also wanting me to leave him. Even on the day when my grandma passed away, she Insists that he cannot come and pay respect to my grandma and even give excuses saying things like grandma dont wanna see him either. She just want things in her way. she'll never know how the others feel. </p>
              <p> Now, She create an issue for me and my bf. And it's affecting us alot more. She even want to confiscate my phone so that i cannot contact anyone. I believe that you guys will be wondering where are my parent and what's their reaction.Well, My parent is more relax on me and they always shield me from her vicious attack. And and and i'm 20 this yr.. i feel so uneasy with this life. hai..    </p>

              <p>My parent give up on her. there is no way talking about it. She will ask you to shut up. She is the so called Queen at home. I've tried everything over the years. Nothing works. I talk to my bf only when she's asleep. And delete all the messages after viewing including received calls. I dun think there is a need to blow up the matter by dealing it in court. It will only tear the family apart. Sueing is definitely out of question.</p>

              <p>You got to tell her off firmly. You got to stand your ground. Tell her she is the elder Ok you respect her, she can yell all she want, but no physical contact, ie no hitting and kicking. Or you will hit back. You must mean it. She is a bully and she acquired this trait because her fierce method always works.</p>
              <p>You are grown up now, and cannot be expected to tolerate this kind of bad behaviour from her. Don't take the "Its because she loves you" crap. What she is expressing is not the emotion called love. It is a different emotion all together and is called frustration. She is not getting what she wants. It not your job to find out what's bugging her, its her problem (get her to post it here). Just don't let her take it out on you. It could be some Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, or Bipolar Personality, emotional trauma; like bf dump her, or just simply low self esteem.</p>
              <p>Tell her off, she ought to respect you too, remember that.</p>

              <p>Hi CfCJ,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Try as you might, there are times when it's impossible to sustain positive relationships with everyone in our lives, be it friends, lovers or even siblings and your closest kin. Taking a step back and mellowing out may work on some but not on chronic bullies.</p>
              <p>I agree with Mancha for the most part. If you've tried hard enough to maintain good sisterly terms and she isn't reciprocal, it's time to stand up for yourself. I'm also in favour of distance from people who are destructive. Blood relation, at times, are merely accidental DNA. Don't go through your days burdened by this.</p>
              <p>Are there reasons for her to treat you badly? For instance, sibling rivalry? Are you the favoured child? Tried getting second opinion from your folks?</p>
              <p>If you're not quite sure if she means well or she's just pure malice, use your gut. You'll be fine as you get older and as you slowly come to live your own life and learn how to discern between good and bad intentions.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Chinese families are usually full of dramas, especially families filled with women folk. Imho, they're almost always the shit stirrers. Me thinks it's prolly the estrogen at work.</p>
              <p>Next time she lay her hands on you again, be civil, but tell her you're going to have to defend yourself with force.</p>
              <p>This kind of sister usually won't believe you and she'll provoke you with a second attempt. Since you sound like a bit of a softie, don't feel bad about it when the moment comes. Give her a decent wallop and show her you're no pushover.</p>
              <p>Unless her anger has a life threatening effect on you, imho,
                                      threatening her with a police report is just overused shit stirring
                                      method. If and when you do decide to use this measure, be sure to
                                      follow up with real action. People take you seriously when you mean what you say. They learn how to treat you with respect when your word counts. It's ugly business but some times it's necessary for your lot in life.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>No matter how bad it gets, just remember that she's the unfortunate combination here with immaturity, excessive anger and emotional difficulties. And she's most likely going to carry it forward in other aspects of her own life. Time will show many qualities in everyone of us. Don't lose your cool the way she does. </p>
              <p>Ride it out till she gets married. Then continue to keep a distance until she shows signs of remorse.</p>
              <p>Just my two cents worth. Take care of yourself babe.</p>

              <p>CfCj,</p>
              <p>It's unfortunate you have such a dysfunctional sister.</p>
              <p>How many other siblings do you have ?</p>
              <p>While many see her as being "loving".. I beg to differ.</p>
              <p>She is invading your privacy and disrespecting you.</p>
              <p>There's probably many reasons why she's treating you this way.</p>
              <p>I should say.. she's probably suffering from some unresolved self-esteem issues.</p>
              <p>Her actions are beyond sibling rivalry.</p>
              <p>Perhaps in her eyes.. you are the favored child. And she resented the fact that you are the reason for her lack of parental attention.</p>
              <p>Since she cannot change her parents' behavior, she's taking out her revenge on you.</p>
              <p> However, if your parents had always expected her to take care of you when you are young, she is probably having a hard time letting go of this apron string.</p>
              <p>And since you get more autonomy as you grow up, she's finding it more difficult to exert control over you. And her diminishing control ability is frustrating her, that is why she now tries to control you via fear. Fortunately.. such methods only works for a very short time.</p>
              <p>You need to keep reminding her that you are already 20 years old. And she needs to grow up.</p>
              <p>The best way for you to break yourself free is simply to ignore her. Keep a distance from her as much as you can. Don't share any personal info with her. Simply put.. just keep her outa your life.</p>
              <p>Her attempts to take away stuff from you .. is  just another  threat and  control  tactic.. which .. also.. fortunately  are futile  efforts. So don't let it bother you so much.</p>
              <p>Her tyranny .. is a part of her character..if she don't start to change... she will be paying for it in other relationships throughout her life.</p>
              <p>So you see.. you're not the one getting screwed.. she is.</p>
