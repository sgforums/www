I had exchange room with my brother for his marriage. He is a super negative person. His negativity is imprinted into that room. So when I moved in, I could not take it. I moved out of the house. My room had been "cultivated" by me to be yang qi. His first comment about my room is that its always hot. But eventually he made it lose the yang qi. Eventually i realised its his character. No one can help him or his marriage if he choose to be negative. When when I moved back, and I took a look at my old room, it was cold and lifeless.<br><br>I don't know how to explain, but I never liked his room. Its always cold, dank, always feel uneasy and very depressed in that room. I was glad to move out quickly after that. Its hard to explain. My room was also not ideal but by luck and chance I did a couple of things that helped.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>FYI, my brother is divorced, made my mom and dad's life a living hell. lost his child, wife and is onto the next woman to "complete" his life.<br>Beyond fengshui and common sense, if a person is always depressed, its hard for others to help. The depressed person has to help himself. Its a knife edge that the depressed walk, and in depression he might not have the energy to do anything drastic. But if he does not get the support and someone anyhow console him and give him just enough energy, he might do something bad to himself. Its a bad situation to be depressed.  Its my companion and my shadow, always ready to come and become my best friend. Then cling on like a monkey refusing to get off your head, sucking all the life out of everything. Everything is hopless and grey and everyone is negative and everything that happens is bad and so on. Its a never ending spiral downwards, endlessly and it built itself deeper when you thought you are already deep and you know it will never end.  Unless the depressed person pick himself up. Its never an external help that helps the depressed person.</div>
