            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>Frankly, shifting house may not work out and furthermore like what u said, it would be a risky financial burden for u and ur family.<br><br>Try to look at solutions within ur means.<br><br>How about redoing the house. That is painting, changing some furniture, shifting the location of the furniture, etc! Very importantly, the family must be involved. If your father is still stubborn and don't wish to participate, just get urself, ur mum and very importantly ur brother to work it out! Furthermore, CNY is coming and would be a good excuse to redo the house.<br><br>Maybe you guys can get some ideas from Monday show Bai Jai Le! Get ur brother to be involved and perhaps add in some fengshui stuff like got water and stones, etc (I not sure but perhaps u can post another qn on house fengshui)<br><br>Include changing the outside corridor as well since he complains about his neighbours...<br><br>By working on the renovation, he will get recognition from the family. Hopefully get ur father involved as well. Ur brother will be doing sth for the family and u and ur mum must show appreciation. How much u let go for him to handle is also critical to getting some confidence back in him. However, redoing the house will not be sufficient to bring his confidence back.<br><br>Other than that, u brother need to go out and meet ppl. He has to start working and get appreciated. A lot of ppl mistake making money from work is the most important thing. I disagree and I tell u that being appreciated in life is just as important and often more important!<br><br>Getting job for him can be difficult. I would think even starting off with doing some social work (low paid or even free) is helpful in letting him see ppl worst than his plight and letting him feel important.<br><br>Forget about girl relationship. He needs to get his confidence back and step out of depression first.<br><br>Another idea for u is to ask him or even urself to find comfort in religion. For example, sitting down in a Buddhist temple and meditating or chanting can calm urself.<br><br>As for harsh talks, it's not easy to get it to work and it will backfire most of the time and even if it does, u brother may get very bad opinion of u thereafter.<br><br>Cheers and Be Strong Yourself</div>
