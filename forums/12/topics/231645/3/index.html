No talking so deeply or profound at that moment. He needs to release some of those depression level.<br><br>If you have any vcds or shows that is positive, like hope, friendship values or funny (what genre does he prefer?) tell him to see it. Maybe he like playing certain sports, but dun wanna involve many people? Then play with him alone first.<br><br>These things have to be done slowly and you don't force him to do things he not ready to do. Let him get to it by himself.</div>
