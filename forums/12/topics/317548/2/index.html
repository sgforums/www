              <p>no woman no cry is actually a reference to england's prior control of jamaica. "woman" is a reference to the Queen of England. they used to protest in Trench Town all night long against england. a purely political song.</p>
              <p>i listen to three little birds by bob marley whenever shit happens.</p>
