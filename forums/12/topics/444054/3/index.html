              <p>Options:</p>
              <p>1) Move out - Very high chances you may end up with an even worse upstair neighbour with more kids, or worst ! operating a small factory above. Then waste all $$$ and effort.</p>
              <p>2) Play loud music - Your upstair neighbour won't hear but your side neighbour would surely hear. You become a nuisance to somebody else</p>
              <p>3) Complain to police or town council - chances are they will play tai chi, and move you from one department to another. What is the likeliness they can take action? Arrest your upstair neighbour? Any proof? Very hard to proof</p>
              <p>4) Use pneumatic drill to disturb upstair neighbour - again you make new enemies with your side neighbour, may disturb the baby, etc. Moreover, more holes in your walls.</p>
              <p>5) Use bamboo pole - So far best idea. Very conspicious, upstair neighbour won't know you do it intentionally.</p>
              <p>6) Buy house - cannot afford</p>
              <p>7) Move to highest floor (no upstair neighbour) - Good idea !</p>
              <p>8) Buy house in Johor and go to work via causeway - Good idea but get stuck in traffic, got to wake up earlier</p>
              <p>9) Kill the upstair neighbour and dump their bodies in Bedok reservoir - Hmm, tempting but very hard to smuggle out bodies for disposal.</p>
              <p>So option 5, 7 and 8 unless there are better suggestions.</p>

              <p><br>Many people do not understand what is the real true of karma, karma is not bad, it is both bad and good, it is a reflection, your noisy neighbour will one day face their reflection, if not from you, it will from someone who bought your house. Once you let your neighbour taste their own karma, meaning what they did get reflected, they become quiet, and for you, you did a good deed, because the whole neighbourhood become peace and quiet, and your karma will be good</p>

              <p>again you are not enlighted in buddhism, buddha is not a
              religion, it is a teaching of life, those who go pray and kowtow
              one, I have no comment, but if you read the sutra from the lotus to
              the 10 worlds sutras, buddha already tell you he is no god, but a
              teacher</p>
