              <p>i called the hdb the day before going up to approach that dam neighbor. the hdb sent email to me that they had already go to that dam neighbor house and tried to persuade them to reduce their noise activity. but the noise seems not going down, so i go up and look for that dam neighbor and den the problem comes.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="icon_mad.gif"></p>
              <p>i ask them to stop playing with that dam ball in a peaceful manner and 10mins later, wife come down and shoot back me that i am rude?!?! give so much rubbish reasoning and really pissed me off so i raised my voice with her. now today his husband not happy come down at my doorstep to create chaos. called police and they tell me to call community mediation centre to settle this problem! called hdb the person who email me back, he say he forgot to tell me not to go up approach that dam neighbor cos that husband is a hot temper guy =.="</p>
              <p>so the ending is i have to endured their dam noise <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_frown.gif" alt="icon_frown.gif"></p>
              <p>but i find the using bamboo stick method quite good le, at least can give back some noise back to them. but as for hiring the foreign worker come to my house, that one <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>my parent already cannot tahan foreigh worker liao, if hire them come my house, i will tio nag by them forever<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>

              neighbor. the hdb sent email to me that they had already go to that
              dam neighbor house and tried to persuade them to reduce their noise
              activity. but the noise seems not going down, so i go up and look
              for that dam neighbor and den the problem comes.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="icon_mad.gif"></p>
              <p>i ask them to stop playing with that dam ball in a peaceful
              manner and 10mins later, wife come down and shoot back me that i am
              rude?!?! give so much rubbish reasoning and really pissed me off so
              i raised my voice with her. now today his husband not happy come
              down at my doorstep to create chaos. called police and they tell me
              to call community mediation centre to settle this problem! called
              hdb the person who email me back, he say he forgot to tell me not
              to go up approach that dam neighbor cos that husband is a hot
              temper guy =.="</p>
