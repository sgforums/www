              <p>Move out, no solve problem because what if your upstair neighbour move out and then move in with noisy neighbour?</p>
              <p>Best is not to buy house, best is to RENT. So when you not happy with noise, can move out easily. If you buy, have to hassle with selling your place and buying new one.</p>
              <p>Soundproofing is expensive. What spec? If you want to soundproof like sound recording studio can cost you a bomb and no guarantee you cannot hear footstep or knocking sounds</p>
