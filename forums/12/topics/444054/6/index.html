              <p>i ask them to stop playing with that dam ball in a peaceful manner and 10mins later, wife come down and shoot back me that i am rude?!?! give so much rubbish reasoning and really pissed me off so i raised my voice with her. now today his husband not happy come down at my doorstep to create chaos. called police and they tell me to call community mediation centre to settle this problem! called hdb the person who email me back, he say he forgot to tell me not to go up approach that dam neighbor cos that husband is a hot temper guy =.="</p>
              <p>so the ending is i have to endured their dam noise <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_frown.gif" alt="icon_frown.gif"></p>

              <p>Mr nature,</p>
              <p>I have to spell bad news for you. Your situation is not good. If you don't get along with co-workers or friends, you can easily avoid them but if you have bad conflict with neighbours, it can be very bad, because you see them everyday  !</p>
              <p>I hope you spoke politely to your upstair neighbour. However, judging from their reaction, I think you scolded them? I understand your frustration but if you don't use diplomacy on your neighbour, if you make them hate you, it can get very messy.</p>
              <p>At least if you spoke politely to them, tell them not to play ball, if they don't listen, it happen again, they don't take you as a threat. But now, they are angry, I am afraid that your upstair neighbour may try to take revenge. My cousin once have problem like you, after he got into argument with neighbour and tried HDB and police, the neighbour purposely cause more trouble to provoke him by making even more noise upstair. So be ready, if your neighbour is hot temper only - ok, but if they are revengeful - you may have to tolerate this.</p>
              <p>Also you effectively involve your parents into the conflict. Did you ask them for permission before you lodge complain or spoke to the neighbour?</p>
              <p>PS: YOU better stock up on bamboo brooms. You may get ball noise or upstair noise attack like 2 am. So you better be ready for retaliation. If your parents stay at home during day, ask them to use bamboo attack !</p>

              <p>Mr nature,</p>
              <p>I have to spell bad news for you. Your situation is not good. If
              you don't get along with co-workers or friends, you can easily
              avoid them but if you have bad conflict with neighbours, it can be
              very bad, because you see them everyday  !</p>
              <p>I hope you spoke politely to your upstair neighbour. However,
              judging from their reaction, I think you scolded them? I understand
              your frustration but if you don't use diplomacy on your neighbour,
              if you make them hate you, it can get very messy.</p>
              <p>At least if you spoke politely to them, tell them not to play
              ball, if they don't listen, it happen again, they don't take you as
              a threat. But now, they are angry, I am afraid that your upstair
              neighbour may try to take revenge. My cousin once have problem like
              you, after he got into argument with neighbour and tried HDB and
              police, the neighbour purposely cause more trouble to provoke him
              by making even more noise upstair. So be ready, if your neighbour
              is hot temper only - ok, but if they are revengeful - you may have
              to tolerate this.</p>
              <p>Also you effectively involve your parents into the conflict. Did
              you ask them for permission before you lodge complain or spoke to
              the neighbour?</p>
              <p>PS: YOU better stock up on bamboo brooms. You may get ball noise
              or upstair noise attack like 2 am. So you better be ready for
              retaliation. If your parents stay at home during day, ask them to
              use bamboo attack !</p>

              <p>You see, last time the neighbour did not intentionally do the noise. Now TS argue with them, they do even more, and intentionally to provoke TS. So it is "intention" + "non intention" noise.</p>
