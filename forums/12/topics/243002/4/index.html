            <div class='col-md body'>Hi. I know it is very frustrating to msg someone on yr mind and to wait for a reply from that special someone for ages. Always look on the bright side of things. Always give the other party the benefit of the doubt. Most importantly, I feel that being in a relationship, both parties must always respect and trust eachother. Learn to trust your gf and give her some personal privacy. Being too possessive in a relationship most of the times spell the end of a relationship.<br><br>Why don you try this next time. When you msg or call her and there is no reply. Giving her the benefit of the doubt, she will call or sms ypu back when she sees the msg or missed call. Meanwhile, do something to get her off your mind, like meeting up with friends, watching tv or something you were supposed to do. Like this when she calls or msg you back, you can than talk to her since she should be free than she would contact you.<br><br>hope this helps. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
