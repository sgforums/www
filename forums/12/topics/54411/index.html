            <div class='col-md body'>Guys.... I wrote this forum minutes after I woke up because I remember it so clearly and bothers me....<br><br>here are details I still remember:-<br><br>I dreamt I know this girl who has a boyfriend and their relationship is almost gonna bust. So she is going out with me. However, she seemed not serious as in my dream, she starts fooling around with guys (playing with them). However, she comes back to me everytime, just a normal boyfriend-girlfriend relationship......<br><br>the last part is the weirdest.....<br><br>I told you all that nothing hanky-panky happened between that dream gal and me. So called her ex, her and me often meet. Her ex would like boldly ask her whether has she slept with me before. She would "always" say never.<br><br>Her ex would always start to scold her why she never have sex with me, scolding her that she is not loving enough, even challenge her to have sex with me in the public. (of course she flatly turned down). I on the other hand would tell her ex not to rush thing so soon and just let be as she deem happy to do so though I felt a bit dissappointed.....<br><br>I always feel that dreams are reflections of our thoughts and I have no idea what my dreams are telling me about People out there who are kind enough, can you interpret what my dreams are telling me.............<br><br>Thank you in advance.</div>

(Presenting telling us) and you mentioned you, her ex and herself are good friends (Ex present obstacles and external factors affecting your viewpoint or simply affecting you about the matters of the heart).  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>The last part is a clue about yourself and your attitude towards matters of the heart; your subconscious mind is trying to tell you never to rush things when it comes to BGR. Sex is presented by lust is signified by your Mars energy. Obstacles may prove to be on your side, but its always good to let nature run by its course. Respect people's personal space and the wanting to know each other better would do well.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> 2 Cents of thoughts?<br><br>Cheers</div>
