            <div class='col-md body'>Hey man, sorry to burst your bubble but i'm afraid it's just not possible.  These universities are far harder to get into than NUS.  You can have 4As, GP A1, "S" Paper distinctions and still fail to get into those universities (of course you can get in without such stellar scores if you have proven intelligence and notable achievements).  You generally need an SAT score of above 2100 among other outstanding qualities to get in.  Of course some are easier than the rest but they're all really competitive.<br><br>fiske's guide to US universities should give you a pretty good idea of what's required.  do not that it costs around $100 to apply to the unis so don't do so without thinking carefully.</div>

How come can become 1800 de? But I took the test in year 2001, so there might have been changes to the system  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Abt the A Levels grade, not too sure abt dat, cos I am from Malaysia so they looked at my SPM results instead, but I think it depends on what course you are applying for. If you are applying for Engineering, definitely need to get at least B in Maths and your Science subjects lor...<br><br>Then need to see your TOEFL score as well...<br><br>Ivy Leagues universities are definitely a lot harder to get into, one of my frens who got into MIT have a score of 1590/1600. But Northwestern shud be able to get in wif score around 1500/1600, dependent on your A-Levels results as well and what course you are applying for. Certain courses in the same universities are harder to get into compared to the others, esp those that are ranked very high. For instance, it is harder to get into the Electrical Engineering course in UIUC compared to the Business course, cos the EE course ranked higher than the Business course.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wega007,<br><br>I realize you indicated in your opening post that you weren't keen on attending a community college,<br><br>However, you could use a CC as a "stepping stone" for gaining admission into a four-year university. In other words, get admitted into a CC that will take you on the basis of your A-level grades, study there real hard for a couple of semesters to get a good GPA, then apply for transfer admission into the four-year university of your choice. More likely than not, a certain percentage of the credits earned at the CC can also be transferred with your admission, decreasing the amount of time needed to complete the four-year degree.<br><br>Just a suggestion.<br></div>

Among all these, not all have what it takes to get into a good enough US uni to give them a headstart in life.  i think that says something about the difficulty you'll face in getting into a good uni.<br><br>the worst unis that i will consider going to in the US are probably unis like michigan, wisconsin, nyu, northwestern or some such university in that league.  remember, it is not good enough to go to a reputable university.  you need to prove that you have what it takes to do well in NUS (thru ur A level results), such that any move you make in your uni seems like a matter of choice rather than necessity.  if employers thing you had no choice because you couldnt get into a local U, or that you took the soft option, it's not gonna do you any good unless you come back with some stunning result like a summa cum laude from a reputable but not necessarily stellar uni.</div>
