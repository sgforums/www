Yesterday, she told me not to see her anymore and that she thinks she will lose God trust and security for her. She said she feels guilty as she has committed adultery. The point i was after her is because she was enstrangled from him. They are separated. I was heartbokened and sad. What do you guys and girls think of this affair? Its easy for her to dump me but its difficult for me to forget her and all the wonderful memories. Sobs</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmmm.. given tat she is a devoted christian, i think she is right abt her faith. its adultery and yes, it is wrong. why not you give her some time to cool off and think it thru, abt you n her, and her n her husband. it will do no good to encourage or push her abt this r/s, coz u r asking her to sin against God n her conscience.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In my point of view... allow her to fully settled her problems with her husband first then only should you come into the picture...<br><br>Meanwhile, just be a close friend to her and stand by her during this period of time... nothing beyond what a close friend should do is what I would suggest to you...<br><br>If you love her then you should try to understand her and respect her faith and thus only would you understand why she behave in a certain way...<br><br>Don't be afraid of losing her in your life...  This is because if both of you are meant to be together than you would be... else no matter how hard you try... it would not be...<br><br>Just remember... The more pushy you are... the further and faster she would move away from you...<br><br>Hope the above helps...</div>
