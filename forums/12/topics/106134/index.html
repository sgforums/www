            <div class='col-md body'>After reading kiekie's thread, she actually inspired me to share my life story with the people here as well. I'm not trying to create a drama now, just felt like expressing out, and let people know what we've seen in movies, are actually the exact scenerio in life...<br><br>"My parents divorced when i was 1 year old... I had an elder sis who's 2 years older than me. According to my mum, my dad was a flirtatious chap. But it was an arranged marriage by my grandparents and she had no choice but to marry my dad. On the day of their marriage, my dad actually went out to look for other gals instead of spending the marriage night with my mum. He drinks, gamble and flirt around. He even brought gals home to my AMK flat. Poor mum had to lock herself in the room with my sister and me. Whenever my dad got drunk, he would beat my mum. And there was once when he actually chase my mum out of the house, grabbed me and threw me out too. My mum was fast enough to catch hold of me. If not, I don't know where would I be today. My youngest aunt (mum's sister) was at the scene today. Even up till today, she can vouch for what had happened that day. Their marriage failed and she had no choice but to divorce him. My mum decided to leave my dad and carry me away. As my sister was sleeping at that point of time, my paternal grandma asked my mum to come back for my sis the next day. The next day when my mum came for my sis, my paternal grandma refused to let her in and chased her away. They fought in the court for our custodies. My dad got my sister and my mum was granted mine.<br><br>Mum had little education and love to sew. She worked at a sewing factory, making clothes for people. She bought me up single-handedly. Since young, I had always been well-liked by people. Everyday after my kindergarten, my mum would come to pick me up, and brings me to the factory where she worked at. Her lady boss was a kind lady who allows my mum to keep me by her side when she work. I was a very good child that time. I sat  by her, studying on my own. Sometimes, dozing off in the afternoon time, and she would wake me up when it's time to go home. My mum never had to worry for my studies because I can always study on my own. I remember when it was the the graduation day, my form teacher actually bought presents for the top 3 students of my class. But apart from that, she also bought an extra present for me although i came in 4th. During weekends, my form teacher would bring me out to walk walk too. She really dotes a lot on me.<br><br>I went on to Primary 1. That time, my mum got to know a man called S. S is a drug addict and prison was his 2nd home. My mum thought she could change him, but she's wrong. They got married and stayed in a 3 room flat together with S's mother. Not long after, Mum gave birth to a baby boy called W. W had a weak heart, a slight hole in his heart, which was probably caused by S's drug addiction. I remembered seeing different uncles in my house, all looking stone and haggard. They always lock themselves in a room and I only knew later that they were taking drugs when they open the door occassionally to come out to take things. When mum is not around, S would asked me to his room, massage for him and asked me to suck and lick his nipples for him. I was about 8 or 9 years old at that time and I seriously didn't know what's wrong with that. I didn't know that's actually a form of sexual acts. I didn't tell anyone about it. Mum was with S for about 3 - 4 years until he got caught by the CNB again. It was partly my fault. 1 afternoon, I remembered I wanted to go downstairs to get some fruits. The minute I unlock the pad lock on the gate, a group of CNB rushed into my house and stormed into the room to nab S. All the drugs were at the scene. After that incident, everybody starts scolding my mum a vixen. And starts to put the blame on me too. LIfe became even tougher and mum had to take on 2 jobs to support W and me. In the daytime, she continue to work in the factory. At night, she worked as a hostess. Ironically, she got the offer from my maternal grandma. My maternal grandma is in the prostitution line. She opens a prostitution house. I remember mum would dress up beautifully for work at 7pm. Before she goes to work, she would bring W and me to my maternal grandma's house so that she could take care of us. She would only pick up home in the late hours of the night at about 3 or 4am. I always saw mum crying to herself, sitting by her favourite sewing machine. Eventually, she divorced S and took me by her side again. She's unable to take W along.<br><br>Because of this, W hated my mum. Mum had 2 sisters and 3 brothers. My youngest aunt (M) doted on me a lot while my eldest aunt (H) doted on W. All along, H kept in touch with W and even took care of him on behalf on mum. As W grew older, his father (S) told him a lot of bad words about mum and W grew to hate mum. He wouldn't acknowledge mum and me. When i saw that scenerio, my heart sunk with mum. We both cried and it was really heart-aching.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">To be continued...</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>All along, my sis continued to keep in touch with us. She would lie to my dad frequently that she has got excurisons or camping, as so to come over to stay with my mum and me for a few days. My sis hasn't got a good life too. She works at my relatives' shop during her hols and gave the money to my dad for his gambling. My dad often brings his so called 'brothers' home and one of them even masturbated in front of my sis when my dad is not around. (This is what my sis revealed to me recently when we poured out our sorrows.) She started to mix with bad company in her school. Stayed back 2 years in primary school. While i always excel in my studies since young. I got into the best class in EM2. Because of this, relatives start to use me as a comparison and she felt inferior to me since young.<br><br>My mum got to know a lot of guys in her trade and they were all wooing her. They bought us on trips to malaysia on several occasions. I even caught them making love in the toliet and the sight was so painful for me. I cried maybe because I felt that my mum is being bully. (COme on, who knows what is love making at that time.) But eventually, they left my mum because they made her decide between me and them. Until 1 day, my mum got to know P. He was a rough guy who job is to ferry those huge containers from site to site. Earning about 4k per month and is a divorcee too. He has an extremely bad temper but he is a guy who know how to take care of family. His ex wife left him because of his abusive temper. He doesn't smoke or drink, but he splurges heavily on 4D. He rented a room for my mum and me, brings us out, and seems to dote on me. In the end, my mum stayed with him when his divorce papers are done. Mum doesn't have to work as a hostess anymore because he can support us now. But he also banned my mum to contact my maternal grandma because he cannot stand my maternal grandma asking her own daughter to work in such line. He continued to shower care for us, hugs me occasionally, and treats me like his own. I was about 11 years old that time. But he is 1 eccentric freak too. He doesn't wears anything at home except for his briefs. All the windows in the house and door are always shut closed. He has a niece who is of the same age as me called A. A is in the same primary school as me and she is in the same class as well. He starts to compare me and A's results. A came from an english speaking family and studies better than me. Imagine when I got 207 for my PSLE and A got 231, I got a beating from P because I was poorer!! Yes, soon his abusive character revealed. He expects me to go home straight after work everyday, no outing with friends, nothing! I must do sweep the floor, clean the window panels, wash the plates, wash the clothes...etc everyday. Soon, mum gave birth to my 1st baby sis called R. R was the gem of his eyes and she got the best of everything. But R is a real cutie. She brought him luck on the day she was born. He strike 1st prize from her birth cert number. He starts to beat me for every minor mistake I done. Whenever R fell down while she's learning to walk, I would get a beating. Mum was so helpless because if she intervenes, she will get a beating as well. All sorts of vulgarities from him. There was even once when mum was pregnant with a 2nd child, they quarrel and he pushed Mum. She suffered a miscarriage. They quarrelled almost everyday and i would hide in my room and cry. I couldn't do anything. My studies start to get affected.<br><br>When I got into a secondary in my neighbourhood, he transferred me to another secondary school because he says I knew too many people there and want me in a new envoirnment. I had a puppy love when I was in Pri 5. We were together for 2 years and broke off when we proceed to Sec 1. He retained 2 years in primary school and was 2 years my senior. Once, I went to his house and he even intended to make love with me. I was shocked and quickly ran back home. Heng ar. The choice to transfer me away was a bad choice. My sis's secondary school was very near to mine and we met up frequently. I saw all her bad friends and i was still very very pure and naive at that time. She was an ah lian and told all her friends to take care of me should they see me outside. News spread and even people in my school knew that i"ve got 'backup'. I got adapted in my new school every fast because of the 'strings pullings'. My form teacher dotes on me too. I got $500 as a scholarship in Sec 1 and $300 in Sec 2. Slowly, my grades start to drop. I daren't not even take part in PE because all the caning marks were on my legs. I couldn't wear shorts. I couldn't go out with friends at all and my mum got to help me to hide from my stepfather. Soon, I start to take for granted and demand more. I start to play truants. Nevertheless, I still got into the Pure Science Stream in Sec 3. It was also the turning point of my life. My sis dropped out of Sec 1 but continued to meet me. Soon, my dad learnt of our meetings and said he wanted to meet me. All these years, 14 years, I've never seen him. So when I got to see him, I took advantage and demanded money from him. Every meeting, he would give me few hundreds of dollars. Mum doesn't know about this. I used the money to buy MC, branded stuffs, splurges on whatever my friends want. I paid for their everything just to get their accompany. But still, my dad was like a stranger to me. I felt awkward calling him.<br><br>One day, my form teacher gave a call to my mum to inform her of my attendance in school. When i got home, she confronted me about it and asked what am i going to do about it. When my stepfather comes home, he will sure beat me to death. Mum is already pregnant at that time again. I told mum I'll pack my clothes and stays at youngest aunt's place for some time. She agreed because she also knew how severe the beatings can be. I packed my clothes and left home. But in a moment of folly, (i was stupid and childish) I went to find my friends instead. Never go to my aunt's place. In the end, they lodged a police report for a missing child. At night, I went to find my sis and stayed with her. She was staying with her bf that time. But who knows, my mum had already informed my sis about me. The next day, my sis dragged me to the police station to meet my mum. God damn it. I was so mad with my sis. I was pulled home by my stepfather. Yes, I got the cane. I really couldn't take it anymore. The next day, after he left for work, while my mum was bathing my baby sis, I ran away from home again. This time, I vowed not to find my sis. I hang out with bad friends under void decks.... 2 days later, during a spot check, I was arrested. Mum decided to send me to Girls' Home and I created a havoc in the police station. Officers scolded me. I told Mum :" If you do that, You are not my mum anymore." I know I broke mum's heart but I was too agitated at that time. My 3 yr old sis (R) came to me, touched my leg and say :"Jiejie, don't cry.." But in a fit of anger, I pushed my sis and asked her to get lost. I started to get rebellious. When all my relatives know about this, they were SHOCKED. I had changed from a sweet, innocent child to a rebellious, bad attutide kid. In the end, conclusion was, I stayed at my youngest aunt's home, completed Sec 3 with the 2nd last ranking in class. After that, I quited school and became the 1st Pure Science Student to quit school. All the teachers were shocked too...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>After I left school, i started working as a waitress. Got to know more friends and even saw my 'first love' on my 1st day. Call it coincidence or 'fate', we went out on that every 1st night. He's the one in my primary school. After a few outings, I was with him again after 3 years. On 1 fine night, he tried his luck again. But, unfortunately, I wasn't ready and he didn't managed to succeed again. A month later, we broke off.<br><br>I lost my virginity to a guy (he's my bf at that time) in my workplace, out of curiousity. I was very silly. We only lasted 2 months. After I've worked for a few months, I told my aunt that I'm shifting out. I don't want to bother her family anymore as she has got a child too and they're only staying in a 3 room flat. I went to stay with my dad and sis. Dad has always felt a sense of guilt towards me and is especially nice to me. He gives me whatever I want and never dares to talk loud at me. I start to take for granted. I don't greet him because I feel uneasy. The feeling is like calling a stranger "Dad". I got to know more and more people and starts taking drugs too. But i wasn't an addict. Just trying out for fun. I was a typical ah lian and was always changing bfs. Very bad...<br><br>When i was 18 that year, something happened. I was working in a prestigious nightclub with my boyfriend. Went for interview together and got the job. We worked as waiter and waitress. There was this captain there who treats me really well. To me, I only thought that because I'm new, that's why he's very patient to teach me things. For your information, he's a Malaysian. 1 day, he asked a group of us out. He says he's on leave for a week, to go back to Malaysia and will spend the last day of his leave with us. Everything was decided. But on the actual day, my bf got to work (it was a last minute thing), and some of the people backed out. When i reached the meeting place, only L and me were there. We went ahead with the plan since we're out. We went dinner and drinking at my usual hut. I know the people at that particular disco. We drank a lot and i am one  who can control my liqour well. But still, I was knocked out. All the drinks were prepared by the disco's bar captain as she knew my preference. When I woke up, I was in a hotel room, naked. L was sitting by the dressing table. I was shocked, stunned, trembled and speechless. I saw L's luggages in the hotel room. He asked me to dress up and he send me home. I kept quiet all the way. Before i left the hotel room, I took a look at the room number. When i reached home, I tried to recollect everything. I had bruises on my body and forehead. I don't remember a single thing last night. I reckon L had it planned all along. Why would his luggages be in the hotel? He had a flat in Singapore. He must have checked into a hotel when he reached Singapore, before coming to meet me. I was devastated. My bf kept calling me and demanded an explanation for not returning home the whole night. I told him what happened. He wants to report this to the police but I don't dare to. Kept crying and broke down eventually. In the end, he forced me to go to the police, or he'll bash L up himself. Finally, I chose the police. 1st, we went to the NPP and told the officer. Next, he referred us to the main police station. I had to repeat the story to another female officer. Then, I was quickly referred to hospital for a checkup. There, I had to tell the doctor what happened. I had 3 tube of blood being extracted for tests. I fainted after that. The case was brought up to RIS (Rape Investigation Squad) and I had to repeat the story to my female officer in charge. They quickly went down to the scene to search for evidence. The police are really fast. Luckily, the room wasn't cleaned yet. They took the bedsheets from the scene. There were even blood stains on the sheets. My bf had been very understanding. He stood by me all along and tries not to remind me of what happened. Everyday, I had to go to record my statements repeatedly. Police went down to the disco too and gather information. I had a total of 20 witnesses including the bar captain. Police were also afraid of me lying and I had to go throught a lie detector test called the "Polygraph Test". Again, I had to repeat the story again to the tester. I passed the test.<br><br>I was sent for counselling and again, I had to repeat the story. I was on the brink of madness. I'm going to explode anytime. I couldn't sleep well for 3 months. I was always awake by shock. I would jumped up and my bf would be awake too and he would quickly calm me down. Needless to say, I never go back for work at the nightclub again. After 7 months, I received a call from my inspector asking me to go to the lawyer firm. They had engaged in government lawyers to fight for my case. I went there, repeat the story again to the lawyers. That time, I was already feeling better. Until when they showed me photos of that scene, I broke out and cried again. I decided not to sue him because I didn't want my parents to know about this. I don't want to appear in court of so many people and repeat the story again. I cannot take it!!! The police tried to persuade me, but to no avail. In the end, the police couldn't charge L with rape. They could only charge him with possession of illegal VCDs after ransacking his house....<br><br>The case was finally closed a year later...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks all for your comments. I shall continue with the next trauma of my life...<br><br>I broke up with the boyfriend who went through the ordeal because I wanted to start everything anew. I'm grateful to him but I just don't want to be reminded of it again. The useless me starts to resort to pills to forget everything. But I never took it with guys, I only had it with my gal pals.<br><br>In Sept Year 2000, I met O and had a relationship that lasted for 2Â½ years. IÂ’ve really been through a lot with him. (Some of the things are not appropriate to list it here). He is also the only guy who has made me pregnant 3 times within 6 months. Needless to say, I had 3 abortions because of him. First one was in Jan 2001. We were not ready and he doesn't want to be tied down so early. Second one was in Mar 2001. There was something wrong with the foetus and doctor says I couldn't keep it. Third one was in Jun 2001. Doctor says the previous 2 abortions were too close, and my womb is already weak. Even if I want to keep the baby, I would suffer from miscarriage probably at the third or fourth month.<br><br>He raises his hands on me, he flings outside, he never gets down to earth and his temper is exceptionally bad... You all may say that IÂ’m a fool to have stayed with him, but still, love is blind. I must say I have always been a caring n nice gf to him. Always stayed by his side no matter what. But, something happened on the 12th Jan 2003, which changed the whole thing.<br><br>His grandpa passed away. And he was really sad. He is the eldest grandson and he is remorseful for not showing respect to his grandpa when he was alive. Devastated, depressed n lost is what I would describe him at that moment. I know that he is really heartbroken this time because he cried. Still, I stood by his side and it was only then he realised how much I cared n loved him. He promised me he would turn over a new leaf n would treat me good.<br><br>On that night (11th Jan), all his friends and me were all at the funeral. The funeral was at AMK.  We gals were playing mahjong, and O was chatting with the guys. At about 2am something, O's mum asked him to send one of his relatives home. Den 2 of his cousins followed him to send their relative home who was living in Yishun. I remembered OÂ’s last words to me. He said :Â” Girl, wait for me, I send my relative home. IÂ’ll be back shortly.Â” Then he went off.<br><br>At about 4am, we received the news that OÂ’s car got stuck in a drain. We thought that it was a small drain by the road that type one. So, we thought it was nothing serious. All of his guy friends and OÂ’s cousin went to find O, hoping to pull the car out of the drain. Not long after, One of the guy's gf received a call from her bf saying that OÂ’s head was bleeding. I started to worry. At that time, the gals had already knew what happened to O. But they kept it from me. Immediately, I called O. But I canÂ’t get through his hp. I started to sense something was wrong. Then, they told me that O had an accident. I called the guys, but they didn't tell me much. I could hear the guys shouting at the background. The scene seemed like a chaos. We wanted to go down to find them, but we don't know the exact location. And the guys also don't allow us to go, because they are scared that we will be a burden instead. No choice, we waited at the funeral. Half an hour later we received their call again, saying that O is now on the way to Tan Tock Seng. We quickly rushed down in a cab.<br><br>When we reached the hospital, O had not arrived yet. But shortly after, OÂ’s ambulance came. He was totally covered in blood. I couldnÂ’t recognised him. One of the guy was in the ambulance with O. I shouted at O, but he has got no response already. He was pushed into the A&amp;E. No one was allowed to see him. We waited outside. Meanwhile, I went to take a look at his cousins. 1 had slightly cuts, the other had minor head injury and had 18 stitches on the wound. They told me that there was a slight rain at tat time. O was driving a Toyota Corolla. Suddenly the whole car skied. The doors on the driverÂ’s side brushed through a big tree trunk and fell into a big drain. The doors were dented. Think the impact caused OÂ’s right side of his face to knock against the window. All the glasses cut on OÂ’s face, eyes, mouth, hands, and legs. The worst thing was, he was bleeding profusely from his head. His cousins fainted on the spot, but rescued soon. It was 4 taxi drivers who stopped by to help them. They were pulled out of the car. But they couldnÂ’t pull O out because his door was dented. So, they called for the ambulance. The 1st one came. The paramedics tried to saw open OÂ’s door. But their motor had no battery. So they called for a 2nd ambulance. Time was wasted in the process. O was trapped in the car for an hour. According to O's friend, he keep talking to O to keep him awake. O was conscious all along. His friend kept asking O not to sleep and must hang on. The whole car in a 45Âº position. O was holding on to his seatbelt. Finally he was rescued out. In the ambulance, his friend was still asking him to wake up. (he says Â“Ki lai, mai koonÂ”) then O suddenly sits up. And the nurse pushed him down. When the nurse tried to do injection on him, O could still say Â“maiÂ” (meaning NO) with his hand waving. This already showed his determinations to live on. O had got a very strong character. Just as when they were about to reach the hospital, O passed out.<br><br>Back to the hospital, the doctor says O can be wheeled to the normal ward. And asked us to wait outside the ward. We were relieved, thinking that O is fine. We waited outside the ward and saw the nurses preparing the bed for O. Before they could settle O, we received another news that O had severe head injuries and there was blood clot in his brain. He needed to be operated immediately to remove the blood clot. All of us really broke down cause we knew that any operations on the brain involves a certain level of danger. Furthermore, the doctor says that the chances are not very high; told us to be prepared for the worst.<br><br>Luckily, the operation was a success after 4 hours. But O was wheeled to the ICU cause his condition is not stable. They said tat he is still in a critical condition. When we saw O in the ICU, he was in a coma. His heatbeat was not stable, he was breathing with the help of a breathing machine. The machine pump oxygen into his lungs. He had stitches on his face. His right eye is very swollen. And his head is bandaged. His hands and legs are ok. Doctors says that OÂ’s head will continue to swell in the next few days. And they could not assure us when or will he wake up. He explained to me that the blood clot had pressed against his brain until veri small. In fact, his brain turned purplish. A lot of his nerves were affected.<br><br>O was in a coma for 12 days. He opened his eyes on the 23rd January. Only his left eye opened. His right eye was still swollen. Slowly he start to get better. Until now, he has moved back home. But he needs to go thru therapy. Up till today, he still canÂ’t talk, cause his brain has not recovered. Brain controls every part of our body. His injury affected his speech and movement. He did not lost his memory. His memory is still perfect. He can recognized us.<br><br>The decision to leave him was difficult and heavy. I loved him a lot, but I have to be realistic. My parents disapproved of our relationship. They don't want my life to be tied down to a guy who is bed-ridded. Morever, pressure from his friends, relatives and our parents has forced me to tell myself to break free from everything. After his accident, I"ve been indulging in alcohol to numb myself. I know what has past, has past. What i feel sad is God never gave him a chance to treat me well. It all happened so suddenly. Is this a punishment for him?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I fell into depression after OÂ’s accident. Drinking was the only thing I could do everyday. I go out everyday after work and returns home only after 3am. My work was affected. 2 months after I left O, on a Wednesday night, 5 March 2003, I went out with a gal friend to drink. I had drank a lot and reached home at 3 plus. I began to cry as IÂ’ve thought of him again. I had record of severe migraine all along and was taking anti-depression pills. The more I thought of O, the more I want to end everything. I took out all my pills and swallowed them. I think I had a total of 30 over pills. Mix of my migraine pills and anti-depression pills. I want to end everything, donÂ’t wish to think about it anymore.<br><br>But immediately after I swallowed all the pills, I began to regret. A lot of memories flashed back and I realised IÂ’m not ready to die. I quickly called my best friend and told her IÂ’m sorry. She called another of our best friend and they quickly rushed to my house. At this point of time, my dad happened to come home. He saw me crying and the leftover plastic holders of the pills and knew what had happened. He grabbed me and rushed me to Tan Tock Seng. We met one of my best friend downstairs and she went to the hospital with us. My dad and my friend were crying. I was already feeling very drowsy at that time.<br><br>I remembered I was wheeled into the A&amp;E subconsciously. The doctors and nurses attended to me. They inserted a tube down my throat to my stomach to pump out all the pills. I saw some greenish fluid being extracted out. The feeling was terrible and I passed out after that.<br><br>The next moment when I opened my eyes slightly, I saw a lot of my friends and family standing in front of my bed. I was in the normal ward and was still feeling drowsy. After awhile, I was suddenly pushed to the ICU (Intensive Care Unit) because I fell into a coma. I was in the ICU for 2 days, 1 day was in a coma. The verdict was terrible. When I woke up, doctor told me that the migraine pills which I took contains a very high level of morphine, which could damage any part of my organs, including my brains. I was in a life-threatening situation. It was also only then that I realised the seriousness of the whole thing. I was kept under observation. My heartbeat was not stable and my blood pressure was low. There was insufficient oxygen in my blood and they took 9 tubes of blood from me for tests. I was put on drip, no food or drink for me for 3 days. I was forced to drink at least 5 bottles of charcoal in a liquid form. Police came to take my statement and social medical workers came to counsel me.<br><br>The team of social medical workers knew me as OÂ’s gf because they were the group who attended to OÂ’s case. So, they knew the whole story and covered up in the report for me. Police classified it as overdose instead of attempted suicide. I spent 6 days in the hospital and was asked to go back for psychiatric treatments.<br></div>
