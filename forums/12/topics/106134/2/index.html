I believe if you reach out for help, there will be someone there for you. True, no one likes an emotional baggage, virtual or reality, but why do you think we here are posting at AA? Cause we're all kaypo's or act sincere? No, cause we genuinely want to help.<br><br>Perhaps some of your friends whom you told online didn't know how to help. Sometimes, when we don't know what to do/say, we just mutter something like 'oh, so sad. You'll feel better soon.' I'm guilty of this myself. But how do you know None of them were genuine? Some of them may want to help, but not quite sure if you'll accept it.<br><br>Relate this to love. Doesn't it pain to trust/believe that someone really loves you, tell them you do, and get ignored as well? But are you going to stop loving someone because of it?<br><br>Life and reality may rear its ugly head once a while, but sometimes we forget that life, can also be the most beautiful thing in the world..</div>
