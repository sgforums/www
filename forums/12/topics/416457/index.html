              <p>jokes aside, this is my take on why marriage sometimes does not work. I am not anti marriage for your information.</p>
              <p>1) see each other every day, see until sian</p>
              <p>2) see each other pattern and habits, see until sibeh sian</p>
              <p>3) values and thinking changes, so marriage grew apart because no common values and shared thinking</p>
              <p>4) either one is disgusted by one habits, like cutting toe nails in bed, or snoring loudly that one is unable to sleep or awoken in the middle of the night by snoring</p>
              <p>5) loses interest in sex because its always the same old position and the other half is unwilling to explore new positions</p>
              <p>6) the other half family interfere in their lives,either by coming to their house almost every other week, or the other wife going back to her maiden home very often</p>

              <p>well,firstly, marriage is really not about getting a spouse, it is getting another family.I guess u have to be clear, that u are now part of another family and similarly, ur spouse is part of yours.</p>
              <p>i think if U and spouse stands constant in time, u will just slide backwards while the world moves forwards. there is quite a lot to learn and experience with your wifey/hubbie.</p>
              <p>i do agree, sometimes, U wonder, what if U are still single? but sometimes, a bird in your hand is better than two in the bush.</p>
              <p>yes, u may have boring sex all the time, but it beats have the anxiety of waiting to find out whether U have aids.. anyway, sex is more than the act, but also the mental aspects too.</p>
              <p>and there may be children that seems to fill up the time. the joy of having interacting with them is superb. For a brief time, U go back to your younger days and impart what u know to your future generations.</p>
              <p>I guess, marriage is what U want it to be, just like your life. u hold the key to what u want..</p>
              <p>Enjoy.</p>

              <p>I do not know where do you get this but the Word "Marraige" came from French word "marier", which in turns orginated from the Latin word "Maritare" or "To Marry". The latin equivalent word for gamble is "Ausus" or "to take risks, to dare"</p>

              <p>Many marriages don't work because couples marry for the wrong reasons, and carry unrealistic expectations, like expecting a happily-ever-after marriage without putting in enough efforts to sustain and grow the relationship.</p>
              <p>In Singapore, for many couples, material matters are given far more importance than how genuine is the love of the spouse. During economic downturns, when many husbands lose their jobs, their marriages also go down the drain. Enduring hardships is not a strength of many Singaporeans used to living in comfort (and luxury for some).</p>
              <p>For the women, having to take care of children plus manage their own jobs is very stressful, especially for those who have to work long hours. Not many men can take take of their children well while their wives are busy. Many men want children, but are unwilling to share enough responsibilities of taking care of their children.</p>
              <p>If both parties are willing to each take a good look at their own weaknesses and work on fixing them, and be more forgiving towards the other's weaknesses at the same time, be willing to love the other party unconditionally, then the marriage will blossom, no matter what obstacles they face.</p>
              <p>Romantic unions are meant to help both the parties learn from each other and grow to be better individuals. When either party is doing their best to improve themselves, the improvements will be plowed back into the marriage and raise the level of love in it, enabling a constantly growing relationship.</p>
              <p>However, if both parties don't do anything to improve themselves, the marriage will naturally deteriorate with time. That is why many couples only barely tolerate each other, once the romance dies, but after many years, when they cannot tolerate anymore, and so divorces become inevitable.</p>

              <p>Society do influence marriage, like singapore, due to high cost of maintaining and living, stress here and there, make money here and there, meet people here and there, couples are easily stressed, end up drinking, careless about family and slowly...slowly..may find a colleague or friend that understand them...and that's it folks!</p>
