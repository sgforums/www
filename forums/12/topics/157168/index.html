            <div class='col-md body'>Poor Peanut Butter..<br>My parents used to quarrel all the time... and i know how u feel about it...<br>everytime the shouting begins... suddenly i feel so helpless<br>like i am 8 years old again, sobbing outside the door<br>listening to them scream at each other...terrified..<br><br>Things got really bad too about 2-3 yrs ago.. My dad has a bad temper<br>and though he doesn't hit my mom, he does flare up in other scary ways<br>I got through weeks just waiting for the next outburst and sometimes, when the outburst comes, I don't know whether to feel stressed or relieved<br>cos I've been EXPECTING it.. u know?<br><br>After a particularly bad.. quarrel.. where my dad lost control of his temper<br>I was terrified but.. it's hard to blame him cos.. u know.. he had issues growing up.. it isnt altogether his fault...<br>Hmmm finally my mom and I desperately convinced my dad for all of us to see a counsellor together<br><br>We went through family counselling which did help a bit, and slowly paved the way for my dad to go for further counselling and psychiatric help.It was a very difficult time and it took time.. it took us YEARS...  but I think what came through was my dad finally seeing how much we love him.<br><br>One thing I learnt is... you are not responsible for your parents' issues. So you mustn't blame yourself if you feel helpless. What you can do is to stand by them, support them through this difficult period. You can't make decisions for them. They may not have handled this well but they are adults.<br><br>-hugs- Hope things go better for you.</div>

Seek professional help.<br><br>1) Talk to either mum or dad - choose the one whom u are more able to talk to and u think will listen to u most.<br><br>2) Choose the right *Timing - when people are in *good mood they are more willing to discuss.<br><br>3) Be strong and positive - Ask questions with a *smile and listen attentively to them when they talk about their unhappiness with each other.<br><br>4) Only When they are 'open up'... then let them know how their quarrel affected you and the family as a WHOLE. Let them know ur intention to help and want to improve their relationship - see their respond.<br><br>During the conversation in case their mood turn bad - change to other positive topics, abandon the mediation. But dun give up, try again next time and use different methods. At the same time, seek sch or family counsellors for advices 1st before making the next move.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>At the start of the topic tt ur parents objected u to finding a pt time work, and instead wanting u to concentrate on ur studies. This shows tt how bad their quarrel with each other, deep in their heart they still luv u. <strong>Even if</strong> (touch wood) they know tt the marriage will not last, they will remain together just for the sake of u. As they know how terrible it is for a child to have a single parent. U see, maybe <strong>(maybe only)</strong> now their lives revolving around u and they wan to make sure u get the best. So the best thing u can give them now is to listen to them and study smart.<br><br>As nuchio had said tt you are too young and probably dont know the problem either. It is true. As a student, we do not experience much of finanical woes yet, the stress level in the working world and poor relations wif e relatives and is my child going to stray. From my own life experiences, these 4 things is enough to crack my parents. So listen to them study smart. Show them tt u r able to take care of urself, this way, there is one lesser worries for them.<br><br>Hmm... where is AA's counsellor, vampire Yun</div>

My parents were also uncomfortable with the idea of talking to some counsellor.. and its like.. geez.. what makes them think they are smarter than us and can help us??? The most difficult part is to get them TO the counsellor in the first place. In an asian society, where 'face' is very important, it is very very difficult.<br><br>BUT talking to a non-judgemental, unbiased stranger is good cos a counsellor is a trained listener. A good counsellor can help them to sort out their own confused emotions, and understand the reasons why they are frustrated with each other.<br><br><strong>it might be easier if it was only my father flaring up but the problem is both of them like to get angry from time to time, thus causing all the trouble. if i have siblings, it might be easier too, but the problem is i am the only child.</strong><br><br>Yes and No ba.. for me.. my mom was like a terrorized victim. She was suffering from a nervous breakdown etc etc. If both gets angry, at least both are managing to get their emotions 'purged'... Sometimes non violent anger is also a form of communicating that your parents have not 'given up' on each other, and are still struggling to communicate, even if they are not doing well at it.<br><br>I guess with a sibling you can have someone to confide in. But if your sibling is younger than you, and may not understand the situation, you may have to play good child plus good brother/sister too. Juggling protective roles is not something many people can handle easily.<br><br>-pat pat ur head- Take time out when you must. And Unless you are very sure you can play a mediator role, the best is not to take sides, even if one party 'forces' you to, cos chances are, it will turn them against each other.  Ultimately you know both your parents love you. Their relationship problem is something they need to struggle with themselves.<br><br>Be handy with the tissue, your presence, a listening ear, a nonjudgemental mind, a cup of tea, and a lot of love and respect.  At least when they are sorting out their own problems, you won't add on to their burden.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> That's all a filial child can do.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>parent quarrel is their issue<br><br>siblings quarrel, children and parents quarrel, people have different view points. And some times too strong.  Just don't assume blame for the quarrel. Its very disconcerting to see parents quarrel<br><br>My parent fought over my education in pri school. My dad didn't want me to study, my mom insisted. And in the end, she walked out and didn't come back until couple days later. My parents quarrel over many things from mundane to major issues. But its not everyday they quarrel and sometimes life, stress and changes cause tempers to flare. I remember once I was in the toilet while my parents fought just outside my toilet in the kitchen.. my dad had always had a short temper, stubborn and sometimes bordering on unreasonable and always want his way. So they threw hot water, thermas flask and such.. broke proceline bowls and such. I was in the toilet crying, and I held my glasses too tightly I broke it at the bridge. Later, then the quarrel lessen. I came out. I didn't want to spend more money on another pair of spec and so used glue and oil lamp flame to fuse the parts together.<br><br>If the adults are ready to change and they feel their r/s is at an interval they need to do something before the r/s break down. That is when intervention from a 3rd party might be useful. But know this. All families, all people, as long as there is a difference of opinion, there is potential for quarrel.<br><br></div>

If you can, perhaps you could try to find out more from one of your parents whom you're closer to...? But keep an OPEN MIND about what you hear and try to be OBJECTIVE about things... This is just a step for you to BEGIN to know of some of the things which might not have been previously known to you...<br><br>At the same time, if they think that 'you're still young'... Try to let them understand that they also ain't that 'mature' in the way they handle the situations.. And whether adult or not, problems still needs to be solved and faced... And if they consider you as part of the family, they should VERY WELL consider YOUR SHARE of the situation...<br><br>Last but not least, if you think you've got little say in things in discussions.. You can alternatively or at the same time try to get some activities involved which might strengthen the bond of your family.. eg. like meaningful family outings.. etc.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Peanut butter, sometimes in a relationship it is good to quarrel.. it is good to "fight" it "spices" things up in a way....<br><br>i mean when you are in a relationship be it BGR or siblings, or very very very close friends, there will always be a quarrel or a bicker here and there....<br><br>I mean which sisters, brothers do not quarrel, or fight??? but at the end of the day (or when they have calmed down) do they still love each other? of course they do....<br><br>quarrels are part and parcel of life....<br><br>I guess all you can do is monitor the situation... help only when you think things are getting out of hands... but if not, just stay out of their way and let them work things out their own way....<br></div>
