              <p>Me and my girlfriend had known each other for 8 months. We got together (during April) after knowing each other for a month. After a month of dating, we broke up due to lack of communications. During August, we started talking again, and soon during Oct 08, we met up. On Oct 10, I took the initiative to hold her hand while making our way to polyclinic (she had check-up). </p>
              <p>Just 18 days after we got back together, I went to her house. Solely in order to let us spend more time together, because her parents are strict on her and doesn't allow her to go out during her O's.</p>
              <p>We did not expect her parents to be home anytime before 5pm, so I planned to leave at 4.30. But at 4pm, her father came back. We panicked, she asked me to hide by the side of her double decker bed. But her father still saw me, and our relationship was exposed. Although her father said nothing during my presence, but after I left he had a long talk with my girlfriend.</p>
              <p>The following day, my girlfriend's mom asked about us, when we started, how we know each other, and my girlfriend spilled everything. Now her mother asked her to stop contacting me, but of course we didn't break up.</p>
              <p>But I cannot call her, if I want to go out with her, she must drag her friend along. Her mother says , we can't get '' too close '' , her mom thought that we've already broke up. And we can no longer hold hands, kiss, because her friends would be around.</p>
