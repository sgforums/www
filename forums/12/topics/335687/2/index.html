Spare a thought for others......Would u like ur child to be a lesbian or gay next time.....If not...maybe u should stop contacting her...And also get a counsellor to talk to......Or if the counselling dun work out.....Wait till u grow older...and find urself ur own life partner...At that time, even if u still are attracted to the same sex....No one would be interfering....</p></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Definitely...u will feel stress with the parents being on the look out of what is happening.....but shouldn't u be asking why they are doing tat.....it is impossible for the parents to give their daughters or sons blessings if they realize that they fell in love with someone of the same sex.....u would have do tat....coz u urself knows why u dun feel attracted to someone of the opposite sex...but tat does not means everyone would understand tat.....and as for ur gf sexuality....the main reason to wait for her to grow up is that......the parents will be more acceptable towards her being a lesbian when she is older....coz after so many years of mingling around....if at end of the day, she still feels that she is comfortable with someone of the same sex....the parents wun have any reasons to object...there might be resentment against it...but at the same time...they will be resign to it....as she would be old enough to make her own decision at tat time.....from ur intital posting..it is quite clear that u are still in ur teenage years.....give urself a few more years and i am sure next time the need to hide or avoid will not be there anymore.....</p></div>

              <p>I'm currently in such a relationship right now. I doubt you would feel any relieve by other forumers asking why not choose a guy instead. What I can say is, this is who we are, no point asking us to change.</p>
              <p>For me and gf, ours are in a pretty much hush hush tone. Our parents would skin us alive should they find out. So I guess you need a lot of coperation between you and your gf in keeping thing work out. My gf mum is also very paranoid and would check her sms-es. Somehow, we manage to get away with it.</p>
              <p>So yea, have good planning and all would work out fine. Hope to hear from you soon. =)</p>

              <p>just because it's a norm for society doesn't mean it's supposed to be the way to go.. just like certain African nations think that FGM is the correct thing to do.. so the children must follow the tradition too?</p>

              <p>maxsee, she from the start already clearly knows her sexuality, whereas for me..i started off being straight initially . Why should the parents object? if this has already became a fact that their daughter is a lesbian ,why object? pointless. why dont you jus say singaporean are jus conservatives. ? and her mom is extreme okay. seriously, tell me which parents install cameras at home to watch over the kids ?</p>
              <p>unidentifiedx, thanks . yea we've been tryin to plan all the things out , but it's always ruin by her mom. for instance, this thurs we planned to meet together with her friend. but her mom last min took leave and say she will be tagging along, jus in case i will be going . anyw thanks . we will work this out eventually .</p>
              <p>cool-gal, she's the butch.</p>
