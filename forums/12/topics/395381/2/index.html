              <p>I think you should mediate the problem first.</p>
              <p>Filing a civil lawsuit is easy lah.</p>
              <p>But don't you think it will create more stress to your wife at
              the work place ?</p>
              <p>Shouldn't your wife be complaining to her boss first ? Surely
              the company she works for would really appreciate if your wife goes
              through proper grievance procedures before she files the lawsuit.
              As it will also make the company look bad when this one hits the
              courtroom.</p>
              <p>And why the doctor never say anything to refute the accusation
              ?</p>
              <p>Sometimes I wonder, is silence an acceptance of what's happening
              ?</p>
              <p>Ur wife diam diam.. the doctor also diam diam... quite unusual
              isn't it ?</p>

              <p>in a polyclinic setting, the interaction between nurses and doctors are actually very minimal. there is no longer a need for a nurse to be in the room while a patient consults the doctor so in fact, the gossip has not reached the doctors' ears yet. it circulates mainly around the nurses and staffs... anyway, as i've mentioned; the doctor is so busy, he is practically daft about it.</p>
              <p>by the way, just last month the head of the polyclinic called a meeting and lectured all the nurses to stop gossiping among themselves the workflow of the doctors. apparently, it was the same nurse that started gossips that some doctor has lesser cases and sowed discord among the doctors. </p>
              <p>my wife is not silent about it but we agreed that we need "concrete" proof of the slander. we know even if we confront her now, she will just deny it all. she is famous for denying and will cry that we malign her... saying we are out to bully her and she is the head of nurses' blue eye girl,' a pet so we will be quite screwed if we do not take her down totally...</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>BTW if you really hire banglas to whack her or whack her yourself, you will most definitely go to prison, and have your face splashed in the news. If your wife still stands by you, then she is really worth it lor. But you'd have a criminal record. Is it worth it over that too-much-free-time gossip? Some people are just malicious. We have all met such people in NS and at work.They will get their retribution. It just takes time. Watch and see.</p></div>

              <p>One very important rule to remember if you want to sue someone for libel/defamation/slander- it must be proven that what he did or said was (i) untrue and/or (ii) baseless and/or (iii) unwarranted, and that through the person's actions, directly or otherwise, has caused you or your family grief and/or harm and/or financial loss.</p>
              <p>Has the gossipmonger been causing you or your family emotional distress? If so, get a psychiatrist to assess the situation. Keep detailed records of what the person said or wrote. Hearsay from other people around is not enough. You cannot prove that she started the rumours unless you can record her saying it.</p>
              <p>You can also work with her company to bring this gossipmonger down. Such people are unhealthy presences in the work environment, so let the polyclinic handle the matter first. If all else fails, consult a lawyer to consider the best way to deal 
              with the situation.</p>

              <p>Just to add on, I can empathize with you and how angry you feel- I know how terrible it can be to have to sit down and hear about the injustice brought upon by your wife. Not only is your family affected, but your pride is hurt and your trust in your wife and doctor is compromised, and all because of one mischevious woman's mouth. However, I urge you to throw away ideas of hiring a hitman. Violence (physical or otherwise) is not the only way to solve problems. We are all civilized, educated human beings living in a 1st world country; there is no need to resort to physical violence to teach someone a lesson, yes?</p>
              <p>I urge you to reconsider: are you going to fall into the trap of anger laid out by that sinful person, or, are you going to deal with this issue rationally and calmly, using whatever legal means you have? The choice is yours, ultimately. It's definitely easier to hire a hitman and get it over with, but that speaks much about yourself as a person. You are just going to degrade yourself to the level of a barbarian if you do that. Can you stand taking more blows to your pride?</p>
              <p>Treat this as a psychological war. To win, use your mind instead of your heart and hands. Eventually, the mind is greater than the sword :)</p>
