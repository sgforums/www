            <div class='col-md body'>Ok, so here's the story<br><br>yesterday nite me and my friends were all down a park, and a car drives past and yells at us 'you're gonna get it' and we're used to random jip from cars so we think nothing of it, 10mins later the same car drives back past and trhows a firework out the window and it lands a bout a metre away from us, me, Mehta (a boy I'm in love with) and another guy were terrified but no one else was that bothered, we'd eventualy calmed down about 40 mins later and some peple come back from the town centre and we were just telling them what happneed when a firwork is thrown in to the park from the back, so we all leg it and start running down a road and we hear two gun shots from the top so we all run all the way back to my house. Then tonight just me and my best mate were in the same park for a while coz everyone else was down the town centre and the<br>same car drove up and stopped opposite the park, i recognised briefly some fo the people and heard them say my name - they were most likely my brothers mates, ...they were cheking who was in the park then drove off and didnt come back...we think they were pretty much after Mehta coz my bro knows i'm mates with him and he hates his guts as do all his friends so now i'm scared so bad coz i think theyre<br>all out to get him, and if they'd throw fireworks at us god knows what else they'd do because that could bloody kill someone. And now I feel as if Mehta's life has been endangered because of me, and I know he already gets beaten up enough (he doesn't deserve it at all) and I am so terrified for him. I can't phone the police either as I don't know exactly who it was in that car. So please help me I don't know what to do!<br><br></div>
