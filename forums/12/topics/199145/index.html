            <div class='col-md body'>Met a girl a yr ago. Met her at an outing with my friends. She wasnt a head turner, a lil on the heavy side but had an attractive and confident personality. We exchanged numbers and a week only were we together. The first date ended well, subsequently, she steered the relationship rather rapidly which often left me confused and tired. I was what she was looking for, but for me, i wouldnt mind being together if we had similar interests and chemistry. Everything happened so fast that whatever beliefs i had in what a proper relationship should start and be were compromised. Overtime, through the months we were together, we quarreled often. Many a times i was left thinking if all these were worth it. She knew i would be leaving for overseas studies, and many a times the fact broke her heart which nearly left me stressed out myself...<br><br>I feel so responsible for her. I had to go overseas whether she liked it or not. It was my last chance for greener pastures and an oppportunity to make ig good once more. She constantly needed assurance if she was in my plans for the future. She feared she wasnt in it. Honestly, im confused if she's the one. Since the day we were together, there have been too many differences which really left me confused. Everytime we quarreled n made up, i secretly prayed and hoped God n time would lay the path out for us. The only thing i could do for her was to be as honest and truthful and responsible with my words. She's from a rather complicated background but all has been settled. She's financially tight that often left me worrying for her when she spends unnecessarily. Frequently i am often thinking of ending it all, but somehow i feel guilty to think of such thoughts. What is it with me? Before, all my previous relationships when the slightest hint of uneasiness about the relationship i would have ended it there and then. But i dunno what's holding me back. Her relatives all feel that she has found the right one and often they nag at her to treasure what she has. It has left alot of pressure on me. Whenever marriage is brought up, i try my ways and means to evade it. There's so many things i ahve not accomplished n done that i feel i want to experience them before thinking about settling down. Also, because of all these, i oftenlook at other girls. Thinking that i should deserve a better one.<br><br>Is it because of my past experiences in life that has left me compromising the best for second best? that all the mess i have brought upon myself? Why? I needed to let it all out....i feel im gonna implode. Help.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Im really confused. Often when we quarreled i asked for time to cool off, but she would be upset that i often gave in to her. I think im suppressing alot already. Now im starting to mind her physical self and her person as well. She had a rather complicated background. The only thing i liked about her, her intelligence. I know its wrong...but i cant help it. Alot of people have commended on my looks and said i would have no problem getting a pretty gf. I dun wanna start to smoke anymore... i dunno why am i so guilty and responsible....

            <div class='col-md body'>I am posting my views based on what you have written. Know this: certain things are very hard to be conveyed through written text. Face to face are usually better to convey what you want.<br><br>What I meant was: Do you love her well enough to <strong>confirm</strong> she is the one for you, to spend your lives together through thick and thin. From what you have written, it seems you are still not prepared to commit and may have doubts over her being the one for you.<br><br>Again from what you wrote, she seems to be convinced you are the one for her, thus her constant probing over your assurance of her being in your life in the future. She could have seen the security you can provide for her.<br><br>You feel responsible towards her but I do not see you writing anything about willing to commit. Do take note, being responsible and being commited are two different things in your mind. You don't have to answer the above question so hastily, think carefully: Do you love her enough to commit your life with her? Or do you want to venture more into the world before commiting?<br><br>I know you cannot answer the question now, because I myself have not found the answer too. What I do know is, when you found the answer, you will know what to do.<br><br>Do forgive me if I am misleading or have written anything you do not find to your liking. I am still learning and I hope we can all learn together.</div>

It's clear that she's not the one you are looking for in a life partner.Think, fom the very begining, you probably just take her as a  friend that you can connect with. But, she saw otherwise.<br><br>Things happened so fast to you is because you do not want to keep pace with the relationship and have no plans for a future with her.<br>This is in total contrast to what she thinks and as a result she would come across as being pushy.<br><br>If you do not see a future with her, and I have'nt touch on love/like yet, it's better to let her know now.</div>

(Uranus influence)<br><br>How wise could that be?<br><br>Your differences and minding it now is because of that risk you took without having to understand the woman you are having. It is like purchasing a product out of folly/heat of passion and realising it doesn't fulfill your needs.<br><br>The foundation of relationship is weak (CloUdiSm classify it as Morning Foundation).

Cruel to say, this must be mutual and if it isn't, it would be difficult for the relationship to grow beyond a certain level.

Once you have resolved your moralistic view, you would probably dash out immediately and this relationship would cease to exist.<br><br>If you know that you don't want this woman and that all reasons are supporting it, give it up before she weave more dreams and hopes towards a relationship that was never meant to be. Don't paint your woman a artistic picture of Love when in fact you are not truthful on your side of inner communication and feeding her with commas and question marks in your tale. I am pretty sure this suppression of yours has revealed nothing of what you have posted here to her.<br><br>You may want to talk about this, with maturity and wisdom and decide what you want for yourself, for her and for this relationship.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yunhaier maybe rite. Maybe i nid to get over the moralistic part. But i allowed it on my part as well. At the gathering i had wanted to know her too, just tht things happened to be easier for me cos she was proactive. We've been together for a year. But i've tried to hint her subtlely that we put in effort to make things work n let God do e rest. I am just waiting to see how things go. But she's the only girl so far that has bothered to put in so much effort for everything that sometimes im afraid once i've let go, i will not meet anyone better. I know...im my own greatest problem.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i hope ur not overseas by now because if ur, the r/s will probably be gone.<br><br>take this from me, you have to fix everything up now. i started dating my gf just before i went overseas for studying. she didn't like the fact that i wld do so, and neither did i. we did think of ending everything there and then in sg, but we just cldn't let go of each other. so we decided to stick it out. now, i'm half a year into my course and have abt another half a year left before i see her again. it hasn't been easy and at times, you do wonder if it s worth it. but i can tell you this. if you can't let her go, it will be worth it. but heck, u dun need me to tell you it's gonna need a lot of effort.<br><br>so, all i can tell you is that deep down, you do love her. try as hard as possible to work things out, and reassure her. give it all you've got. don't let oppurtunities slip away.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I dunno if i even love her. Cos if love, u'l want to be wif her every singel min. I just enjoy e intellectual side. But we quarrel so often tht i really nid not to see her sometimes. Prolly i am afraid wat if no other girls can put up wif my nonsense. But i always hope for a prettier gf, but than agn, a prettier girl does not mean a better girl. Arghh,...so confusing.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Insightist:</div><div class="quote_body">Met a girl a yr ago. Met her at an outing with my friends. She wasnt a head turner, a lil on the heavy side but had an attractive and confident personality. We exchanged numbers and a week only were we together. The first date ended well, subsequently, she steered the relationship rather rapidly which often left me confused and tired. I was what she was looking for, but for me, i wouldnt mind being together if we had similar interests and chemistry. Everything happened so fast that whatever beliefs i had in what a proper relationship should start and be were compromised. Overtime, through the months we were together, we quarreled often. Many a times i was left thinking if all these were worth it. She knew i would be leaving for overseas studies, and many a times the fact broke her heart which nearly left me stressed out myself...<br><br>I feel so responsible for her. I had to go overseas whether she liked it or not. It was my last chance for greener pastures and an oppportunity to make ig good once more. She constantly needed assurance if she was in my plans for the future. She feared she wasnt in it. Honestly, im confused if she's the one. Since the day we were together, there have been too many differences which really left me confused. Everytime we quarreled n made up, i secretly prayed and hoped God n time would lay the path out for us. The only thing i could do for her was to be as honest and truthful and responsible with my words. She's from a rather complicated background but all has been settled. She's financially tight that often left me worrying for her when she spends unnecessarily. Frequently i am often thinking of ending it all, but somehow i feel guilty to think of such thoughts. What is it with me? Before, all my previous relationships when the slightest hint of uneasiness about the relationship i would have ended it there and then. But i dunno what's holding me back. Her relatives all feel that she has found the right one and often they nag at her to treasure what she has. It has left alot of pressure on me. Whenever marriage is brought up, i try my ways and means to evade it. There's so many things i ahve not accomplished n done that i feel i want to experience them before thinking about settling down. Also, because of all these, i oftenlook at other girls. Thinking that i should deserve a better one.<br><br>Is it because of my past experiences in life that has left me compromising the best for second best? that all the mess i have brought upon myself? Why? I needed to let it all out....i feel im gonna implode. Help.</div></blockquote>learn to trust in this relationship and trust to learn more in relationships.<br>thats all i got  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  hope that helps la. haha</div>
