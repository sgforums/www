I know its that kind of fresh out of army, into the job... suddenly thrust into an environment with girls again, no more fucking sergeants and officers! But u gotta get used to that feeling first, that initial rush of excitement and passion to jio girls.<br><br>Nvr Nvr Nvr eever use that heaven or hell phrase on girls u are not sure they like u. U must be damn sensitive to know whether they got feelings for u, or at least they like u. Most girls wun go ahead with relationships with the 'give chance, see whether can develop' mentality. most guys can do that, labelled desperate...  When girls like u, they will drop hints, most wun be direct to say they like u but will still drop hints to lead u on. Singaporean girls are still conservative by nature, so u got take this important point then.<br><br>Dun think ur 'i love u ' phrase is gonna drive them crazy with excitement that they are gonna reciprocate ur feelings, sorry pal, doesn't work that way. Most girls are gonna only get all the most awkward and feel uncomfortable being with u, Remember this point too. U say that phrase, u run the risk of 95% that they are not gonna be ur frens anymore. Its the conservative mentality too. Take down this point too. Even then u dun have to say 'i love u' but put ur words in a more subtly way. Best is to keep things as frens and yeah, u can try to be more than frens but becareful and sense it from her cause girls give signals whether they want more or only want u as frens. U gotta be able to sense it. Best: Keep as frens, and develop more. If u know it ain't possible as lovers, at least u still have a good female fren!<br><br>Smoking, drinking, drowning ur sorrows, it juz shows how terrible as a gentleman u are, not able to control ur emotions. is this the kind of image u wanna project to girls? that uncoothe, urchin-like behaviour? or more of a self-confident, presence demanding person? Go read up on personal improvement, self confidence books on how to improve oneself not only in person, with pple but also helps ur career.<br><br>Concentrate on your career, but also show u place special emphasis on frens, family, and relationships of the heart. This kind of things let a lady know u are a good choice as a mate. U gotta know u are now in the working world. Girls have grown up to be ladies. They want cash and cars now, a good working person in the company is not only one who works hard and smart but is able to relate to pple, to empower pple, to inspire others to work well. This is a skill u gotta develop to let other pple feel ur 'presence' . Know u are dating ladies and in the end, they need money to eat, not love! Remember that, alwaz remember your core basics and from there branch out your secondary importances in life. Thats how so u dun lose track of your goals. Its career! Money makes the man. I see bloody ugly man with flashy convertibles and super delicious babes. i am not kidding, when u see such things, u get so jealous and wanna kick urself for not working harder! That is my inspiration!<br><br>are u doing journalism? u said media company. juz asking.<br><br>Work hard in career, girls will naturally come. Alwaz remember this<br><br>' A man is not marked by how he looks but by what he has achieved'<br><br>Look around u.. all the successful pple, are they good looking? nope, but they are powerful and influential pple who have the properties which i described above. Slowly study urself and do self-reflection and write out ur goals. Basics in life is money, alwaz remebmer that! u need money to eat, not love.  not saying all money and no love is good.<br><br>Even then if the girls dun like u and reject u, juz turn around and move off. hunt for others.<br><br>As i would say, 'life is simple, let girls do the chasing'<br><br>All the best<br><br></div>
