            <div class='col-md body'>hi all. i been very disturbed by this incident for a very long while already. its like this. my gf's colleagues/frenz  always seem to be very interested in my gf sex life. always when she goes out with me whenever she off work or during weekends, her stupid frenz will always tease her saying that she will be eating my 'carror' or not etc etc. i find it so annoying that ppl nowadays always seem to associate sex with relationships. its like if A n B are a couple, they will definitely be involved in sex!! it seems tat the majority of them asking this type of stupid qns are her male n some of her female colleagues.. my gf knows how to handle the situation but i find it damn irritating whenever i find out that those ppl keep asking her qns. why is it tt so many ppl always get this idea that relationship=sex? i'm sure there are hundreds of u who will surely think that a gal has been 'used' whenever she comes out of a relationship. rite? and i'm extremely sorry if i haf offended anyone with nmy frank comments. but this is wat i gather after hearing from many ppl about a gal coming out from a failed relationship .. even gals themselves relate about other gals to me as 'used'. now does it all matter if u sincerely love tt person? no rite? anyway damn pissed off with my gf frenz etc</div>

No harm done, so dun get heat up on these minor minor stuff, you think too much eh bro. Anyway if your gf can handle it, why not you?<br><br>And as for your topic "relationship = sex", well.... I can only tell you one word : Eventually.<br>And if you can't take this kind of pressure, you dun deserve to be in one, cos sooner or later, you'll use this "topic" to stir up a heaty conversation with your gf. The aftermath.... just use your imagination.<br><br>Besides, she's your gf... not your dog. Wat right have you got to restrict who she can or cannot befriend with? But no harm sounding out to her about your unhappiness and let her sayang abit.<br><br>Anyway, if I sound harsh in anyway, I beg your pardon.</div>
