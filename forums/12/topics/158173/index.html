Despite that, are we truly going to seal a relationship just because we know for certain that it wouldn't last? Which is more important? The ongoing process of understanding WHAT a relationship is all about or to keep pondering about long term relationship that must hint marriage? Logically speaking, it is the latter... but at her tender age??<br><br>***<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> You are just walking along Love's inaugural journey - the stage where we are taught our expression of feelings and emotions, reacting to that of a once-stranger... once-mere-friend. Your jealousy is a reflection of your fledgling emotions losing control due to incoming circumstances. You are unable to grasp hold of this new found emotion and it ran wild like chicken in a field. Some people never found the key to keep it stable - always experiencing petty jealousy in love, both big and small.<br><br>Your boyfriend, likewise, is on the road in experimenting Love. Everything seemed like a small matter to him because it doesn't seem a big deal at all because we are talking about puppy love - which trait is such that as long as I love you and you love me, everything else doesn't actually matters... god sis or not.<br><br>If learning to you is about passing your exam and the way is to study and memorised dead formula, you will do that because you want your paper at the end of the day. However, you will not acquire the essence of learning in that way, which will benefit you until you draw your last breath. This is the same as Love: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>man who doesn't demonstrate affection or romance by personality, will probably only 'perform' them in the beginning of the relationship or during chase as a selling factor.</strong></span> One of the reason why this loving...sweetie romance don't last is because it is not within your man's character to do so. It is done because it seemed essential to do so... to tackle you.<br><br>That is the reason why woman, after a couple of bad relationships, become resistance to flippant words and romance. They grew cynical in love, knowing that flowers, gifts and such is but methods employed by man to get them to fall in love. They became so afraid to step into the boundary of Love and fear if this man is like the one before.<br><br>You people are relatively young; please do not think that he is THE ONLY one for you. Relationship is unfathomable - one can never judge it's success due to a certain phrase, like honeymoon. Your REAL relationship begins after your honeymoon period, for that differentiate a substantial relationship from that of a false one.<br><br>P.S: Keep learning. You will get better at handling your emotions and relationship. I usually have the same advice for young people like yourself - <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>better to understand emotions and the 'rules' to this game of love, then to pay the price at much later stage in life.</strong></span>  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i wouldn't say he is not serious about you gal. but when the honeymoon period is over, things will dampen down a bit. it is only natural (especially guys his age) that he will start to communicate less with you and more with other girls. but does that really mean he doesnt love you anymore?<br><br>well.. it depends... for guys his age... i'd say he is losing that passion in you. and that is kinda dangerous indeed, since guys that age usually just go for passion in r/s (but i shall not stereotype too much here)...<br><br>just relax. don't be too INTO the r/s. at this age, studies should always come first. you may feel like you love this guy a lot and everything, but even if it should not work out in the end, you shouldnt get too upset about it. cos when you grow older, everything will seem clearer to you. trust me on that.<br><br>for the time being, relax and enjoy your teenhood.</div>

However, u still have a long way ahead.<br><br>In reality, we only can choose to walk forward; how often do u see pple walking backwards on the streets ??<br><br>Like what other had advised, you should reconsider ur r/s wif ur bf. Does he possess the type of qualities u see in a bf u want? Ask urself...<br><br>Of cos u will feel reluctant to let go.. cuz it's not u who have a change of heart, it's him. He still hold on to u is because he cannot find any good reason to break off wif u cuz u did nothing wrong. Is it worth it??? Cry, cry out loud and get him out of ur life. U dun need a rascal in ur life to torment u.<br><br>However, it's up to u to decide to stay and continued to tolerate, or to leave for good. Who knows, u may be better off w/o his existence! Rather than waiting for him to find his right girl and then say bye bye to u, i rather u ditch him first.... at least u won't be that hurt... cuz it's u who dun want this r/s anymore.<br><br>U r young, there are lots of things for u to learn. Treat this as a lesson and have ur own life. U haven't seen the whole world yet and u wana stick wif this guy...for the rest of ur life? I dun say he's a jerk, cuz he's young too. And curious and most guys enjoyed the attention and thrills from the opposite sex and girls as well.<br><br>And u too, should give urself the opportunity to go thru this life process. It won't be the end of the world if u both are no longer an item. One day, u will be grateful for tat he treated u dis way. Cuz if he didn't, u will nv find ur true love.</div>
