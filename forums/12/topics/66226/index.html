            <div class='col-md body'>hi all,<br><br>i broke up with my ex gf of 4 months about 2 months back. ever since the breakup i've been thinking of patching things up coz i really like her. she's my first gf, and everybody say that the first is always the hardest to forget. i was kind of persistant after the breakup, like calling her up and smsing her but she didnt reply of cause. until one day she told me that im very irritating and then i stopped.<br><br>so i left her alone. meanwhile i was still thinking of her everyday, controlling myself not to contact her or what. i bought stuff for her, made small little things of her, planning what to get for her for christmas and stuff, only to find out that she got hitched to another guy after a month. there goes all my hopes for getting back together. and about a week after i found out that she's attached, she told me she hated me for telling too many people and everybody's blaming her for initiating the breakup. But what could i do? if i didnt share my problems with my friends i guess i wouldnt be here anymore.<br><br>perhaps as im typing this right now, she's with that guy. i kept telling myself that perhaps she's on the rebound now and she doesnt really like the guy. and perhaps when it ends i can try again. but that only make me hurt even more. right now i am really in a dillema. I told myself that i gotta get over her and forget about patching things up. but deep down i guess i still love her.<br><br>dear aunt agony, can you help?</div>

Let me give you a piece of realism: no girl will like a man who is mentally weak and dependent on others. Stand up! Get yourself a hobby, and look to improve yourself as a person.
