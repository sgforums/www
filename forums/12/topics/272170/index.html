            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, I know there's a similar topic somewher before but I saw it expired w/o updates on outcome.<br><br>I signed a package with them, under pressure &amp; wasted a good 5hrs with them before that tryin to turn them down..<br><br>Stupidity kills, I only discovered articles abt them after I signed up. Guess everyone knows how notorius they are.<br><br>I have absolute no use for the package &amp; no time to use the benefits that come with it. FYI, I signed it back in June &amp; only had the time to do something abt it now.<br><br>I had emailed CASE &amp; to my dismay, they told me nbyn is not a easy company to deal with &amp; they had nvr won any case against them. Even to my even more alarm, the service officer told me the registrar flatly rejected a recent clientale who tried to lodge at SCT "Don't waste your time".<br><br>These words were mentioned during the mediation in front of nbyn representative.<br><br>Do I really have no way out?? simply cos i signed it "willingly"</div>
