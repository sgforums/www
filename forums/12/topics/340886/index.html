              <p>I guess I have similar mentality as you.</p>
              <p>Personally, I don't feel quite right to talk about sex/porn or watching porn among my male friends, let alone with female. However, I do joke around sometime (with my male friends only) but with limit.</p>
              <p>About friends ignoring you, I say that's part of life, get used to it. Friend comes and goes, but true friend (&lt;- hard to find, maybe your whole lifetime also cannot find one) don't.</p>
              <p>For the final question, why did you even scold them for in the first place? If it's me, I would not even bother about it. They are not worth to keep by your side if they were to disregard you.</p>
              <p> In short, Singaporeans in general are still quite conservative, but it is also a fact that our mindset are changing and are getting more open-minded as the generation goes on so live with it.</p>

              hohoho the second part I saw before. the weird thing is they are not even bf and gf. 
              The first part can tell that u are not an open minded person right?
              then as the fren part just forget about the incident and move on ba. 
              I think u may not want to put in too much on friendship. As one gets older, frens become lesser and lesser.
              You may want to focus ur attention on more important things like ur career, ambitions. Make money...
              Have u any person u treasure the most? Ur family? Ur parents? ur gf?
              U might want to focus ur attention more on them.

              <p>So if it was a guy who started the topic first, then it is right?</p>
              <p>What if both were guys and they talked about sex, not right too?? Because you assume one of them is gay? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"><br></p>
              <p><strong>Secondly, i came across a thread saying girl and boy

              <p>So if both were couples (or husband and wife <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">) and they watched porn together, then it is right?</p>
              <p>What you mean by not right? As in such acts are uncomfortable to you (hence 'not right') or something else? What is right and what is wrong? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>I guess I have similar mentality as you.</p>
              <p>Personally, I don't feel quite right to talk about sex/porn or watching porn among my male friends, let alone with female. However, I do joke around sometime (with my male friends only) but with limit.</p>
              <p>About friends ignoring you, I say that's part of life, get used to it. Friend comes and goes, but true friend (&lt;- hard to find, maybe your whole lifetime also cannot find one) don't.</p>
              <p>For the final question, why did you even scold them for in the first place? If it's me, I would not even bother about it. They are not worth to keep by your side if they were to disregard you.</p>
              <p> In short, Singaporeans in general are still quite conservative, but it is also a fact that our mindset are changing and are getting more open-minded as the generation goes on so live with it.</p>

              <p>yeap i am really conservative.. but i had become very open-minded now.. however i then found out that i was so conservative that even talking about sex stuff with opposite sex is so normal to my friends but absolutely strange and wierd to me..</p>
