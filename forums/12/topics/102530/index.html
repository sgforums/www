I have to clear my fulked subjects... at worst, graduating 1 or 2 years later.. than my peers.. by then i couldn't have frenz in my school liao... so sad<br><br>If i quit school, i feel very bad to my parents. They pay for my school fees and they not young anymore... really feel like working now but then with just an A'level cert.. wat kind of job can i get that can pay me reasonably well?</div>
