            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>I have this theory about relationships, let's see if make sense to you.<br><br>To me, it's not so much about how good a person is, or how many strong points he or she has. It's whether or not you can accept the person's weaknesses. Just for example, if a person was sweet, gentle, caring, basically everything "good", BUT they smoke, then for me, there's no point in even pursuing the relationship anymore.<br><br>Because what I've learnt is that people don't focus on others' good points, but they zone in on the weaknesses of their partners. Important to know is whether they can accept it or not. In the long run, you don't want to keep arguing over each other's weak points, in this case, smoking.<br><br>Please note that this is a very relative issue, because just because I don't accept my partner smoking does not mean that smoking is a bad bad thing. I mean, you should know what you can tolerate or cannot tolerate over a long period of time. Obviously if you are a smoker yourself then you won't mind your partner smoking, right?<br><br>You have to find out what you can accept or can not accept in a person. Basically, you have to ensure, yes I do mean ENSURE that you are able to tolerate your partner's weaknesses. Just another example. For me, I'm si-bey lazy, but my partner finds it amusing rather than deadly, so she is able to accept this weakness of mine.<br><br>In your case, your partner obviously takes you for granted. However, unless you have actually spoken to him about it, there IS a slight chance that he does not realise what he is doing! Some people just blurt out words as a reflex without realising what it does to other people. Before giving it up as a "weakness" you can't accept, sort it out with him first. Having said that, he still has to do his part for a relationship to work. He can't expect to just shrug it off as "I'm not good with words" and expect everyone to accept it. If you can, I really salute you.<br><br>After all, what is a point of a relationship if it does not serve to make the parties involved happy?<br><br>I do not guarantee this theory works for everyone, because in my opinion, every relationship is different and requires different things to make it "tick".<br><br>Just my 2 cents.</div>
