When i write letters to him, make him cards, buy him cookies, sweet talks him, he would always say i'm very bo liao...<br><br>i had told him that i get a little hurt when i make an effort to add sweetness and he ends up making me look all one sided... but he says he's not good at expressing himself...<br><br>I am a romantic person, i do not mind him not catching up with me, i know i have to accept the way he is... but i can't help but feel hurt.. can't take the feeling away...<br><br>His way of communicating is to keep banging me and it seems that i can never get a single compliment from him... i got myself a tan. and he says it's pretty ugly, but he has never said i was pretty when i was fairer.. get what i mean? All criticism... no compliments.. and i can say i'm rather above average looking... while i have men chasing my skirts... my boyfriend seems all disinterested in me... why get together if he has nothing nice to say about me? i just don't get it...<br><br>Should i continue to give in the relationship and stop calculating, or should i stop giving and see if he would do anything? I can say he does nothing for our bond... and he thinks that buying food for me and spending time with me twice a week is all he needs to do as a boyfriend...<br><br>Help me... i know i'm sounding petty here... but i really hope that he would help me work this relationship out... i really like him a lot... i don't want to give up but i'm not happy in the relationship seeing him so laid back and nonchalent...<br><br>Am i over reacting?<br><br>With regards,<br>Vonderful<br></div>

He's doing so little, that now, i feel that even a phone call or a hug is good enough... this is not right... calling and showing me affection (besides in bed, of coz..) are the basics of a relationship... but these are the things that seem so big now...<br><br>Is this what you call, "when you've been to hell, you learn to appreciate earth?"<br><br>He is someone who thinks that meeting too often is not good, but it's not that im sticky, i just miss him so much, you know the feeling of loving someone and wanting to see him so bad? I don't even dare to ask for a date, i'm afraid that he would find me too sticky... but we're meeting just twice a week, no quantity, no quality... He would be doing his stuff at home while i watch TV... and when it's bedtime, he would come and hug me to sleep... i cannot believe that i could feel so lonely even in his presence... i'm so so so lonely...<br><br>I want to accept him, but i'm just too weak to do so...<br><br>I dun want to make him change into a person he is not, coz that's not him anymore...<br><br>Actually i know what the best and perhaps, only option is--- Leave...<br><br>But sometimes, the mind and the heart just couldn't work in line...

            <div class='col-md body'>Being too nice is not a very good thing sometimes. It makes people take you for granted.<br><br>So you have to learn to stand up for yourself sometimes and tell him that you do not like the way he is treating you. Don't be afraid to speak your mind just because you are scared to hurt him or the relationship. If you are unhappy about something in the relationship, tell him directly so that both of you can discuss it. There is no point in hiding stuff and making yourself more miserable that way. Plus he might think he is treating you the right way since you never  complain and hence he will always think you are happy with the way things are going.<br><br>But are you really happy?<br><br>You need to be more assertive. Learn to stand up for your right and say what's on your mind straight to his face. And if he is treating you badly even after you have told him to treat you better, there is really no point in remaining in this relationship.<br><br>i.c.y</div>
