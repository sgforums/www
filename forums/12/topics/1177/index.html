Jokes might be difficult as u might worry whether the girl with respond correctly to ur jokes or worst, they might respond a HUH!? and the situation is embarrassing and you wish u had kept ur mouth shut.<br><br>How to make them like u? hMm.. humour + charm + sincere + style + helpful should be the keys to it i guess. just dun act like a fool or someone irritating.

            <div class='col-md body'>For me, i think being yourself is the last thing you should do.  If you're shy in the first place, being yourself will get you nowhere.  Being desperate like your nick suggest will scare away all the girls before you open your mouth.  Their senses are that good.  hahaha... ok, now that i've slimed the other guys before me, here's something for you to think about.<br><br>What you need to do is to build a good and charming character.  You have to be comfortable and confident in yourself before you can convince others to like you or make them laugh or talk about matters close to their hearts.<br><br>Both men and women speaks different kind of languages.  Women wants men to listen, but they don't.  Men wants women's attention, but are afraid of being committed, or end up with a whining woman instead.<br><br>I'm not doing all your thinking for you.  The above is enough for you to get a start on this matter.  Read some books like; Allan Pease's "Why men don't listen and women can't read maps" or Gray's "Women are from Venus and Men are from Mars".  Go scout around, there's lots of materials out there.  Don't just read books too, go practise what they teach.<br><br>To be a good conversationalist, be ready to listen, read a lot so that you've got lots of content to draw from, and be willing to express your opinions even if they don't agree with you.  Lastly, don't be a SNAG.  They're too nice and get bullied.  OK, shoot me if you don't agree with me.</div>

Juz be natural lor, duh. Treat them as a normal fren, not an alien or someone special. They r all juz like u, a human being.<br><br>2) Make them laugh, be humourous lor. This is a worthwhile trait to be cultivated. Learn to tell jokes, make jokes of everything. Tease them, mjoke abt them, abt words used, or even abt the surroundings. As long as u can find and think of sth funny, juz say it out, dun keep it to urself.<br><br>3) Make them like u... Juz like how u make ur frens like u lor.
