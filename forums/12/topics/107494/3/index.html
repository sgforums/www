Quite a interesting day even if I am not sure if it improve the R/S or not. 3-4 hours in the zoo(it rained but we have fun) follow by a 2 hours dinner(yippe she likes oyster too). We even went strolling down Orchard road, whereby I won her a soft toy from a funfair and we took a couple of pictures with the street lightings. Spend a bomb tonight but it was enjoyable(finally fulfill my dream to have a french dinner). The only regret is I am still unable to express my feelings to her.<br></div>

Yes I spend on her but I have a good time too so whats the problem? Hell I spend about $500-600 just celebrating my birthday with friends last year. As for the expressing part, its my own inferiority complex. I been having that problem since god knows when(maybe thats why I hate crowds). So you propose me to take her to bishan park and makan at hawker centre than stroll at Toa Payoh and buying her a rubber duck as a good way to celebrate christmas?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"></div>

Just do whatever that you are most comfortable with. Dun need to resort to some mind games or tricks just because you want to win her over, it won't work that way. I think he tried to use those on me last time, but then it backfired and ended up making both of us feeling miserable instead. It is not necessary to adopt a bad boy's attitude just to attract a girl...it depends on what she likes you to be. Like I am done messing around with bad boys who have done nothing but break my heart, so when he started to become himself and treat me like a princess again, I finally realize that I would want to give us a try <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>You don't have to force yourself to express your feelings to her. Just take things as it comes and it will happen naturally. Take the time to get to know each other better, as the best relationship always does start from friendship.

I don't like mind games or tricks nor do I support the 'lets be jerks' method. All I can do with any comfort when being with her is to be nice. Anything else will make me question whats the point of warping my soul and personality just to attract her. I know I can't pretend to be something else for long cos it will erode my inner spirit. So I guess while I welcome all the advise given, I can only take them with a pinch of salt. Anyway thanks for all the support for the thread  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  (especially thanks to i.c.y cos your replies always makes me feel good).<br><br>PS: No hard feelings MÂ©+square maybe one of this days we can have a discussion on different views of differnt people  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Pete<br></div>

Nor did i put in any words to encourage MIND GAMES or PLOTS.....i wonder where did all those come from. just by reading dating forums, i am concluded as such a character?<br><br>As for my present gf, i did the chase for six months then she agreed to get together. What i did? Just plain courting and persistance. Any pre-plans? Eh!!! i planned to give up courting her countless time!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br>All she did was to hold me back from my decision.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> All i advised was to have awareness where you might fall on the side of 'toe-licking'(means do not allow her to climb on top of you) -Princess treatment, be a gentleman and nice guy, but not be taken advantage of. You may claim that you've not been taken advantage of...this i'll let time tell.<br><br>The bad scenario is the part when you treat her nice and spend a thrifty amount of cash on her yet not dare to reveal your feelings to her.<br>Note::: She knows that you like her like crazy...........girls are very very fast in their intuition, unless she's super dense.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>I'll stop here. My point here is - some points that i commented isn't what you interpreted. Time will tell.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>in short dont let the ger climb over ur head. by treating her too good, sometime she might just take u for granted rather than appreciate u.<br><br>Yes, it's important to be a gentleman esp to someone whom u liked. Wat u've been doing is correct.<br><br>But there are some guys out there whom got involved so deeply tat they end up to the extend of being a dog to that ger! Only a handful of gers whill appreciated such guys while the majority of gers just tat them as granted.<br><br>I myself hate mind games, and I hate playing such games. But the reality is cruel.. not like comics, stories, dramas or movies where the leading female n male characters will end up together when the story end. So I decided to take things naturally, if u are over persisent.. the ger might just find u irriating rather than devoting.</div>
