We can't stop them,but we can prevent them. Fighting is not always the best resort or as effective as a loud scream. If its a night out and you're in skimpy attires, get a cab with a few friends and share the ride home. Don't zoom off immediately once someone alights, wait till she's safely in her home, or her bf's downstairs to pick her up.<br><br>But yeah, having some martial base is no harm. For that I'll recommend Wing Chun actually, since it was a style invented by a woman in the 1st place.</span></div>

It is also good to reveal "things" we know our partners will mind when disclosed at a later stage of the relationship.<br><br>For example, during the first week of my relationship with my current gf, I told her how I used to 2-time some gals I knew of. I told her its not a stage of my life I'm particularly proud of, but its something I want her to know then, rather than later. She was rather insecure at the earlier stage of the relationship, and many a times, our boat was sinking. But eventually, it worked out perfect.<br><br>sqully, there're guys out there whose personality repels those you've stated. However if there are some that doesn't and fret out, don't be despair, gold needs to be refined of its impurities to be at its finest. So be it when choosing one that's comfortable and accepting towards you.

Every single time you are unable to go out with her or talk to her becomes a personal affront. Everytime you wish to talk to her about your own problems, it somehow ends up being about her issues.<br><br>She wonders why no one wants to be close to her, but sometimes it is very very tiring and difficult because it is very 'energy consuming' to be her friend. and it is not easy for her because she is very absorbed in her own 'issues' and is unable to see that other people have other issues, and sometimes friendship doesnt HAVE to be about 'issues', and just by enjoying someone's company and doing things together is enough.<br><br>So... I think to find friends, it is impt for you to BE a friend FIRST by putting your own issues aside. Take your time to build a friendship because it doesnt happen overnight. FIND something to do, something that you enjoy, learn something new - and I find the friends you make this way its easier to keep because you have something in common.<br></div>

Everytime you wish to talk to her about your own problems, it somehow ends up being about her issues. </strong><br>She wonders why no one wants to be close to her, but sometimes it is very very tiring and difficult because it is very 'energy consuming' to be her friend. and it is not easy for her because she is very absorbed in her own 'issues' and is unable to see that other people have other issues, and sometimes friendship doesnt HAVE to be about 'issues', and just by enjoying someone's company and doing things together is enough.<br><br>So... I think to find friends, it is impt for you to BE a friend FIRST by putting your own issues aside. Take your time to build a friendship because it doesnt happen overnight. FIND something to do, something that you enjoy, learn something new - and I find the friends you make this way its easier to keep because you have something in common.<br>[/b]</blockquote>As i said,in reality i tend to conceal my problems. so i m not the one u mentioned in the highlighted part. in fact,i m more of the opposite. a distress rescue beacon ppl run to when they r in trouble. but the prob is most likely only when they r in trouble.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by sqully:</div><div class="quote_body">I came across an eerily familiar face on the way home yesterday. It is him. Him who did it a few weeks ago. I can still remember how  I charged home, showered rigorously, crawled under my blanket, laid on my bed, buried my head into my pillow and cried till I was so exhausted I fell asleep that night. Each time I experience it again, it just gets worse. The burdens of the previous encounters accumulate to bear an increasingly heavier weight on me. Flashbacks of the traumatic experiences hit me again. Sometimes I could feel my head exploding with these images. There are times the hauntings get so bad that I cry my eyes dry at night n wake up with slighty sore eyes, spending the next day in a daze. Why is Singapore so molesters infested? I hate these freaks. They derive their brief pleasures at the expense of inflicting a long suffering wound on me. Each one came along to stab it deeper as if to prevent it from healing.<br>It hurts so bad cos as much as I m angry with them, I am also angry with myself. Why couldnÂ’t I stand up for myself? Most of the times, I was so frightened I just froze and blanked out. Cornered to my seat, I didnÂ’t even attempt to flee, much less to confront them. Each time I wanted to confront them, I couldnÂ’t surmount enough courage to. I feared that they would yell Â“bhb!who wants to molest u?!Â” or something, yielding yet more humiliation for me. I told very few people about these encounters, and even if I did I wouldnÂ’t reveal everything. I didnÂ’t tell my parents anything at all cos I donÂ’t want them to worry about me, it breaks my heart to give them heartaches. I didnÂ’t really tell my friends cos I think they might not believe me and I donÂ’t know what they would think if I did. And I recall that there was this time I was chilling out with a friend, we were reading some magazine and came across this article about molestation. There was this line Â“donÂ’t worry people would love to save the damsel in distress, especially since you are prettyÂ” or something and I lamented what if the damsel is not. So I casually mentioned one of my encounters to my friend and said that Â“I donÂ’t understand why he picked me. ItÂ’s not like I m pretty. And I was always in baggy shirts and long jeans.Â” Â“Ya lor.Â” She replied.<br>Perhaps she didnÂ’t mean anything and it was just a simple reply but it sealed my fate to that of a silent victim and it confirmed my fears that those perverts had picked me cos no one would believe me if I had accused them of doing it. It was all still bearable until I encountered this Â‘Romeo turned pervertÂ” guy a few months ago, and my self-esteem plunged to an all-time low. I have been stuck in a state of perpetual misery since. The strong, sunshine girl who everyone used to know is finally tearing up from the inside. Their aunt agony is drowning in her own agony now. Bitterness filled the smiles and laughter I squeezed out of me. I desperately want to get back on my feet. ThatÂ’s why I m releasing some of the bitterness I feel inside here.</div></blockquote>I think i saw this thread before..
