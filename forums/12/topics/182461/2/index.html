In fact, most molestation strikes at ladies whom seemed docile enough not to retaliate. When your womanly instinct tells you that something is wrong... you must not shake it off, thinking that it is only an illusion.<br><br>It's your intruder alarm screaming warning into your head.<br><br>Do <strong>NOT </strong>allow this deep rooted infestation to proliferate into your soul and cause permanent scars that would render you disability in all aspects of your life.<br><br>I hope you can consider the following three points:<br><br>I) You do <strong>NOT </strong>have to resort to simplify/uglify your physical outlook to prevent molestation from taking place. You only need to deter people from taking advantage of you as you display signs of aggressiveness whenever perverts tries to be funny. When your self esteem is failing (in your case, it is likely to be), usually it will affect your outlook, the way you present to the world and physical appearance.<br><br>You are beautiful and lovable in your own ways. Let no one tell you otherwise, especially yourself. Do not lose this natural self.<br><br>II) Do <strong>NOT </strong>develop a twisted attitude towards Love and Relationship. Your shadowy past might inflict illusionary mindset of how you perceive man and relationship.<br><br>Not all man are perverts. Learn to be objective.<br><br>III) Restore yourself. Release the past that held you bondage and understand that things are happening because you are young &amp; is passive to respond. Release yourself also means having to exculpate yourself.<br><br>Free from blame... free to move.<br><br>I don't know how much damage it has cause you psychologically and emotionally, however, it would be good if you could relate this to people you can trust as it could help you to accelerate healing and resolve your unseen shadow. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I would like to add on further to what Yunnie has said...<br><br>I believe perverts choose their victims. They don't have to be very pretty, or have a very good figure. No.<br><br>They go for those that they think who will not report them. The docile people. And they may do it in stages... from being close to you from the start, then to accidentally touching you, and then the rest.<br><br>I seriously detest molesters, rapists.. etc, because they are the ones who make the female side dislike, detest guys, or maybe even go the lesbian way.<br><br>But, lets face it. They are everywhere. From Singapore, to Australia, to India... they're everywhere. And you can't do anything about it.<br><br>But what you CAN do, is to sound out. Cry out or scream when someone touches you with obvious malicious intent. If you think its an accident, tell the guy to be careful.<br><br>I can see that your self esteem has been seriously damaged by this and you need your life back! Resolve to do something about it the next time this happens... and if you can recall his face or see him again.. Just shout out.<br><br>The courage is within you. The world is unfair, but you can make it a slightly better place..<br><br>Be well..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by sqully:</div><div class="quote_body">I came across an eerily familiar face on the way home yesterday. It is him. Him who did it a few weeks ago. I can still remember how  I charged home, showered rigorously, crawled under my blanket, laid on my bed, buried my head into my pillow and cried till I was so exhausted I fell asleep that night. Each time I experience it again, it just gets worse. The burdens of the previous encounters accumulate to bear an increasingly heavier weight on me. Flashbacks of the traumatic experiences hit me again. Sometimes I could feel my head exploding with these images. There are times the hauntings get so bad that I cry my eyes dry at night n wake up with slighty sore eyes, spending the next day in a daze. Why is Singapore so molesters infested? I hate these freaks. They derive their brief pleasures at the expense of inflicting a long suffering wound on me. Each one came along to stab it deeper as if to prevent it from healing.<br>It hurts so bad cos as much as I m angry with them, I am also angry with myself. Why couldnÂ’t I stand up for myself? Most of the times, I was so frightened I just froze and blanked out. Cornered to my seat, I didnÂ’t even attempt to flee, much less to confront them. Each time I wanted to confront them, I couldnÂ’t surmount enough courage to. I feared that they would yell Â“bhb!who wants to molest u?!Â” or something, yielding yet more humiliation for me. I told very few people about these encounters, and even if I did I wouldnÂ’t reveal everything. I didnÂ’t tell my parents anything at all cos I donÂ’t want them to worry about me, it breaks my heart to give them heartaches. I didnÂ’t really tell my friends cos I think they might not believe me and I donÂ’t know what they would think if I did. And I recall that there was this time I was chilling out with a friend, we were reading some magazine and came across this article about molestation. There was this line Â“donÂ’t worry people would love to save the damsel in distress, especially since you are prettyÂ” or something and I lamented what if the damsel is not. So I casually mentioned one of my encounters to my friend and said that Â“I donÂ’t understand why he picked me. ItÂ’s not like I m pretty. And I was always in baggy shirts and long jeans.Â” Â“Ya lor.Â” She replied.<br>Perhaps she didnÂ’t mean anything and it was just a simple reply but it sealed my fate to that of a silent victim and it confirmed my fears that those perverts had picked me cos no one would believe me if I had accused them of doing it. It was all still bearable until I encountered this Â‘Romeo turned pervertÂ” guy a few months ago, and my self-esteem plunged to an all-time low. I have been stuck in a state of perpetual misery since. The strong, sunshine girl who everyone used to know is finally tearing up from the inside. Their aunt agony is drowning in her own agony now. Bitterness filled the smiles and laughter I squeezed out of me. I desperately want to get back on my feet. ThatÂ’s why I m releasing some of the bitterness I feel inside here.</div></blockquote>hey... sometimes friend's comments can hurt the most... I can tell u have quite a low self-esteem and this is actually what the pervs look for in their victima, they do not select victims base on looks per say. they are counting on the fact that because of their victim's low esteem, they'll keep quiet and not make a scene...<br><br>keep in mind that most of the times these perverts hate to have the attention drawn to them...<br><br>If this ever happens to u again (touch wood la!!), just turn around and shout "hey BACK OFF!!!" remember to look fierce... cos these men prey on ppl who are too timid to voice out.. so just shout at him.<br><br>what's the worse case scenerio, ppl may think you are over sensitive? but they will also be sure to have the doubt in their mind and that perv. would think twice before trying the same number again.<br><br>be brave!<br><br>Remember, NOBODY EXCEPT YOURSELF can make you the VICTIM...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by sqully:</div><div class="quote_body">I came across an eerily familiar face on the way home yesterday. It is him. Him who did it a few weeks ago. I can still remember how  I charged home, showered rigorously, crawled under my blanket, laid on my bed, buried my head into my pillow and cried till I was so exhausted I fell asleep that night. Each time I experience it again, it just gets worse. The burdens of the previous encounters accumulate to bear an increasingly heavier weight on me. Flashbacks of the traumatic experiences hit me again. Sometimes I could feel my head exploding with these images. There are times the hauntings get so bad that I cry my eyes dry at night n wake up with slighty sore eyes, spending the next day in a daze. Why is Singapore so molesters infested? I hate these freaks. They derive their brief pleasures at the expense of inflicting a long suffering wound on me. Each one came along to stab it deeper as if to prevent it from healing.<br>It hurts so bad cos as much as I m angry with them, I am also angry with myself. Why couldnÂ’t I stand up for myself? Most of the times, I was so frightened I just froze and blanked out. Cornered to my seat, I didnÂ’t even attempt to flee, much less to confront them. Each time I wanted to confront them, I couldnÂ’t surmount enough courage to. I feared that they would yell Â“bhb!who wants to molest u?!Â” or something, yielding yet more humiliation for me. I told very few people about these encounters, and even if I did I wouldnÂ’t reveal everything. I didnÂ’t tell my parents anything at all cos I donÂ’t want them to worry about me, it breaks my heart to give them heartaches. I didnÂ’t really tell my friends cos I think they might not believe me and I donÂ’t know what they would think if I did. And I recall that there was this time I was chilling out with a friend, we were reading some magazine and came across this article about molestation. There was this line Â“donÂ’t worry people would love to save the damsel in distress, especially since you are prettyÂ” or something and I lamented what if the damsel is not. So I casually mentioned one of my encounters to my friend and said that Â“I donÂ’t understand why he picked me. ItÂ’s not like I m pretty. And I was always in baggy shirts and long jeans.Â” Â“Ya lor.Â” She replied.<br>Perhaps she didnÂ’t mean anything and it was just a simple reply but it sealed my fate to that of a silent victim and it confirmed my fears that those perverts had picked me cos no one would believe me if I had accused them of doing it. It was all still bearable until I encountered this Â‘Romeo turned pervertÂ” guy a few months ago, and my self-esteem plunged to an all-time low. I have been stuck in a state of perpetual misery since. The strong, sunshine girl who everyone used to know is finally tearing up from the inside. Their aunt agony is drowning in her own agony now. Bitterness filled the smiles and laughter I squeezed out of me. I desperately want to get back on my feet. ThatÂ’s why I m releasing some of the bitterness I feel inside here.</div></blockquote><span style="color: green;">oi who the hell molest my fan? i got bust him! </span></div>
