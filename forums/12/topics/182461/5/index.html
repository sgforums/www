            <div class='col-md body'>Sqully, ( Hmm, I wonder what sign are you?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> )<br><br>I don't know how you look like, since I've never seen you, but I've seen some people who are perfectly fine, still think that they are ugly. For etc. one of the applicants for Extreme Makeover. Everybody kept telling him that he was perfectly good-looking, but he kept insisting that he was "ugly". Somehow, even if some people don't think so, there might be that one special person who thinks you are beautiful, no matter how you look like, how bad your hair is, when you've not brushed your teeth...<br><br>Even if you were "ugly", there isn't any use to mope over it, because our looks won't change at all. (unless you go for plastic surgery or something) So buck up, and be optimistic! Even if a girl was pretty, but was very proud or bitchy, people still wouldn't like her. Even if a girl was plain or "ugly", she had a good personality, who do you think people would prefer? Looks are pleasant, yes, but they are just one of the more easily shown gems. Personality, charisma... These are just harder to find, but they are gems too. So buck up, and smile! A smile could do wonders...<br><br>Buck up on your other aspects too. ^_^ Looks will fade over time, who will like that proud or bitchy girl then?</div>

However, for crowded cases, it's much more harder to determine because people are too close (butt's case). Some cases are accidental. From your posts, it sounds like it has been repeated. Logic tells me that it's not accidental, especially the part where you describe about moving up the skirt. It's obvious molestation. You have to report to the police.</div>
