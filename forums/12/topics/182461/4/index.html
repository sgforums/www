Doesnt mean being pretty means they deserve to be molested more. It works both ways. The posters totally doesnt mean to say you are ugly, just reassuring you that molestation can take place as long as you are human, regardless of race age sex looks. So if it makes you feel better, you can wake up everyday thinking.. "i am human, and because I am human I can be sometimes vulnerable and recognise that I need help." and having thought that, perhaps seek professional help until you feel better abt yourself.<br><br>The first step towards recovery is realising you need help and it is OKAY to seek help. </div></blockquote><span style="color: indigo;">well said, ShrodingersCat! </span></div>

But main point is that you lack of positive so does i but must always learn to over come things and learn to think of solutions and always have a SMiling FACE ^_^ , so wat if anithing really happen?? must you always like sit there or lay on the bed and cry to urself? or maybe pitying how bad fate you are??

Your parents don't want to praise you because they are afraid that you will grow up to be a proud person. To avoid this, they try not to praise you, only doing it once in a while.<br><br>Once you know this, try thinking positively. Have you done well in any particular area which you are proud of?
