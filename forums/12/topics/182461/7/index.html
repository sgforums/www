            <div class='col-md body'>Well... there are a million and one obstacles to getting rid of depression. Recognising she is suffering from it is one step. Being able to get the courage to seek professional help depends on the support of her family and friends.<br><br>If she is not able to get the support from them, and that is why she is here talking to us. Then I guess our responsibility is to encourage and support her that this is the right decision, instead of assuming that our reassurance can be a permanent solution to her. Yes, we can give her temporary relief, she might feel a bit better.<br><br>On another note, many people who suffer from depression NEVER recover from it. Which is why they need medication to help. It is an illness, not some temperamental moodiness or just temporary trauma. We belong to a generation where there is a growing awareness of depression as an illness. Seek Help for it. There's nothing shameful about it.<br><br>Why am I urging her? Because depression can go very very wrong if no professional help is given. Many of my family members suffer from it. One had just committed suicide because of it. He wasn't taking his medication when that happened. But he tried, he went to see a doctor at the urging of his children. Can we prevent something like this from happening? Maybe. Maybe not.<br><br>Not every person who come to Aunt Agony with a problem suffers from depression. But if, as in her case, it has been quite  awhile, and serious trauma forms part of her depression and she is unable to shake it off for some time, then really, it is urgent to seek proper help. Where can she seek help?<br><br>She can first look for the FSC near her home. They are free of charge, and you can find a list in the MCYS website. They provide counselling services.<br><br>GPs at poly/private  clinics can help if you describe your symptoms. They can recommend you to a psychologist.</div>
