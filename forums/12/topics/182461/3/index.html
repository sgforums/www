Your condition isn't too serious until you need medication, I think so. Get help soon, don't drag it. I am not sure if the psychiatrist will tell your parents or not. But if are uncomfortable with the doctors, perhaps try calling one of the helplines listed in this forum. They will be able to help. Since you can remember his face, just report him. Get a friend or two to go the police station with you. Preferably someone whom you trust.<br><br>People always have this misconception that ugly women won't be molested, as seen in your post. This is completely wrong, and that is why you are often targeted. Your low self-esteem makes you even an easier target, because he knows he can continue torturing you mentally.<br><br>After this, train on your courage. Know how to reject people. Don't just sit there and let them terrorize you. Know your rights. Remember, never to hit back. Just run away. Hitting back will result in a lawsuit for injuring people. When sitting in a bus, avoid sitting inside. Sit outside so you can flee easily.<br><br>Don't stay out for too late in the night. Come back as early as possible. If you are going to be late, ask someone to fetch you. Call your parents or if your parents allow, stay over at a friend's house.</div>

If you read the newspapers, you are not alone in this. There have been rape victims, victims of family violence, people who can't take break-ups etc. It has been a recognized problem in society and sociologists have long studied it. There are many councillors, psychologists and social workers who are well-trained in handling these issues. Now that you are brave enough to post it online, take a step further and seek professional help. Give yourself a chance to recover. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>We are only online computer geeks. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> We can only give you some advice.

"why do u like me? I am ugly and fat".. and the guy says "I dont mind. you have a great personality and I love it"<br><br>and the girl only hears "he thinks I am fat and ugly and the only thing he likes about me is my personality".<br><br>Basically being molested has nothing to do with how you LOOK. Doesnt mean being pretty means they deserve to be molested more. It works both ways. The posters totally doesnt mean to say you are ugly, just reassuring you that molestation can take place as long as you are human, regardless of race age sex looks. So if it makes you feel better, you can wake up everyday thinking.. "i am human, and because I am human I can be sometimes vulnerable and recognise that I need help." and having thought that, perhaps seek professional help until you feel better abt yourself.<br><br>The first step towards recovery is realising you need help and it is OKAY to seek help.</div>

A little sidetrack here... Somehow I feel that the police in Singapore is more like working for the gahment (full-stop) than doing the public a service... Like many professionals out there, they've learnt to become more 'practical' and 'realistic' in this environment created by our gahment... They're now more like private militants small wing army employed by the gahment for their own usage... Even the so called 'maintaining peace &amp; order' is only so as to put the whole Singapore under a more managable control under our leaders...</div>
