Thanks for ur advice and many others' advices as well, i m not sure if i replied to a similar post or pm but ya..mayb i was quite flustered when i saw so many posts asking me to report to police n seek professional help cos that was wat i alr decided not to do when i chose to reveal it here. Thanks folks, i know it was out of good intentions and i appreciate it. but i hav alr made up my mind,to spill it out here,get it off my chest and give myself a second chance in letting it go and getting back on my feet on my own terms.<br><br>and well,some details are rather straining to recall. so that's why i didnt really give very explicit description on certain parts of the incidents or describe all the incodents. for those who doubt my account cos of that, i m sorry but i'd hav one less person convinced than to put myself thru mental torments. that's why i dun hav descriptions of all my incidents. some i only see images, dun recall the details so might as well let them go n dun try to piece them back. i talked one particular incident in detail cos that is the one most embedded inside my system.</div>

Seriously, you have to report to the police since you are hitting adult age soon. Get someone you trust to go with you and report. Either way, speak to a councellor first. See what kind of help they can offer, then consider your options. If they offer the same things as we have been saying, then find one day and go down to the police station.
