              <p>actually didn't quite know it would end up like this. The company I am working for has got many branches throughout singapore and through the interviews, I was allocated more of lab work.</p>
              <p>It actually does cross my mind very often to overcome this problem of my own when I reached that place. To be a better communicator, etc and be able to find things to talk with other people, instead of always just products and results.</p>

              <p>not difficult one la .. conversation on topics that isn't about work, but occurs within the context of work is rarely deep, if of any substance at all.  who ask you to talk heart-to-heart. not some love hotline you know.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i give you example.</p>
              <p>A: "Hey! Mr X hot day yea?"</p>
              <p>X: "Yea damn hot ..."</p>
              <p>A: "Singapore for you. How was your w'end?"</p>
              <p>X: "blah blah blah blah blah"</p>
              <p>A: "O RLY? how was it? i was thinking of doing the same"</p>
              <p>X: "blah blah blah blah blah"</p>
              <p>of course X will also ask A some questions. that's conversation for you. mots important thing is to ghek your smile ... give off that false radiance, and confidence. inside you can be sian but don't let it show.</p>
              <p>i tell u another thing, u never want to get too involved with your associates/networks. keep it biz. also coz if they tell you something personal, and you forget, damn malu. example:</p>
              <p>X: "I have 3 daughters"</p>
              <p>... 2 weeks later ...</p>
              <p>A: "hey! how's your son?"</p>
              <p>X: ".......... ccb"</p>

              <p><br>bro trust me it's not difficult. practice with everyone. when you go supermarket, speak to the auntie at checkout - ask her about her day, and let things lead on by themselves.</p>
              <p>if you still cannot ... then practice your smile ... i know people give off an aura of happy - it's very disarming, and puts people at ease so the other party is always the one talking, while they're just standing there, smiling and nodding. go to BMW, and watch those pretty SEs .. once in a while, there will be some old uncle who come in, damn yaya .. he will tell the SE, "eh you know ah i got XXXXXX .. but YYYYYYYY" ... watch how the SEs smile, nod and listen but never play to his nonsense, because if they do, he'll keep going on and on and on or worst, ask them "come check out my XXXXX".</p>

              <p>I'm not sure leh, but a lot of times I feel that I have to really clean up my language and etc before I talk.</p>

              <p>And sometimes it seems that I have to know a lot about the surroundings so that can talk to others. Also a bit of a show-off, I guess, but trying not to be too proud of a person though.</p>

              <p>When I went over to EDWM to participate in the forum there, and talk about issues, I realized that I talked like this.</p>
              <p>"<span id="intelliTXT">How to handle growing up?<br> <br> In loads of **** right now. As in can't handle work environment and all I talk about is just crap and ****.<br> <br> Got do loads of uncluttered **** all around places like knowing about
              geylang, pornography all the stupid weird techniques and office
              politics.<br> <br> How to handle growing up and discard all these crap away and be a man liaoz?<br> <br> And somemore got ego problem also. Damn crappy."</span></p>
