              <p>Both of you are healthy individual. He with strong Testostoterone and You with strong</p>
              <p>estrogen. both of you are actively seeking sexual partners that makes  both of you a good couple for procreation.</p>
              <p> But if you have not intention to have long term commitment than you should not have copulate.Because once you "make love" or have sex your brain probably produce dopamine a chemical to make you feel "Love"  </p>
              <p>You are obversely attracted to this person "physically" could be by smell or find him a suitor to have your offspring  that is why you are willing to copulate with this individual. </p>
              <p>Reviewed your preconcieved idea of lifestyle and talks to your "Sex partner" or lover for a commitment relationship bring up one notch.</p>
              <p>Life Changes it happen all the times....its normal many times we don't know where we are heading meet the unexpected person......Ask yourself are you happy with this "person".  What do you feel when he is not beside you.</p>

              pregnancy happens, I know who the father is.</p>
              <p>The relationship was fine and it went on for 4 months. And
              yesterday, he suddenly said he has feelings for me and wants a real
              commitment. I was taken aback as I didnt feel the same was as he
              did. Now, after his confession, I kind of like him. but I still
              think I am not ready. So, I ended things with him. Now, I cant stop
              thinking of him.</p>
              <p>What do I do?</p>

              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"> Your relationship began from a contract. <br><br>The clauses are spelled out clearly, almost like terms and condition to define the boundary of your relationship, so as to safeguard both parties interest should 'dispute' occurs. <br><br>Developed feelings seemed natural and after 4 months, it seemed like he wants more out of this contract because he probably discovered that fulfilling physical needs are pretty much short term and ain't satisfactory in a longer timeframe. He wants to null the contract and provide new contract with different terms and conditions. <br><br>As you read and decide that what I have said seemed logical, but in fact, all I have said above is a facade employed by both of you to logically structure your 'agreement' in a somewhat acceptable manner, appealing largely only to your rationale sense. Although you mentioned that you will only commit yourself at the age of 25. To me - this is purely a random forecast, almost like rolling dice. I do not know how you arrived at this conclusion, but what I am quite sure is that there seemed to be a rationalized fear about commitment in which both of you subconsciously do not want to directly deal with it.<br><br>Now that the choice card of a relationship is dealt; this deal is almost like skipping the entire courting process by substituting this process with intimacy first. In a classic chase, the chase itself develops the feelings; for your case, it is the intimacy that drives the passion. <br><br>Hence, it's still possible that a relationship from a FB relationship might happen. The only risk is that because your relationship began from a contract - it remains questionable whether this relationship would be able to weather storms without sinking back to previous contract subconsciously or having to run away when shit hits the roof. It is easily to escape in your previous arrangement, but coupled with fear of commitment and an additional burden on the scope of 'responsibility' - it may not be sustainable when you level a FB relationship up.  <br><br>P.S: At the end of the day, these are only the presenting issues - the real problem lies deeper, into your unconscious yearning and fear. If you don’t work on it, it will fester and affect your future relationship in a damaging way. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="icon_idea.gif"><br><br>Cheers</p>
