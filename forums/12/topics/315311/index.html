              <p>In a small town, there lived two brothers. The older brother named Abel and his younger, Adan. Abel and Adan were fishermen. Abel had lost his sight during his early days working in a mine. For at least twenty years, he had finally saved up enough for the purchase of a tiny boardwalk, by the river. He was proud of himself, constantly telling his younger brother, about his miner days and his wonderful acquisition. "This is the best spot! The water is deep and the fishes are plenty!"Abel always saying to Adan. Life was simple. Each morning they would sit by the wooden planks, count their catch, satisfied with all they have. Usually a good day would fetch a basket full. At the end of the day, they would head to the marketplace where they sold for cash.<br><br>One fine morning, Adan and his brother set off to make their daily catch. As they were waiting patiently for their bite, Adan took notice of a new guy. The man, stout looking, was fishing over the opposite bank. Adan has never seen him around before. He saw that the man was busy bringing in his line, each time, full of fishes, tossing them into the baskets he brought. By mid day, he already had two baskets full. Adan and his brother had barely met their halfway mark!<br>As the Sun set, Adan patiently observed as the man leave with three baskets full of trouts when they ended the day with only two third a basket.<br><br>On their way back, Adan thought to himself. "The new fella looked novice. Surely he is not as skilful as him but how was he able to gather so many fishes on the same day? Moreover, Abel already had the best spot available!" He was confused and he began to have doubts about his brother's judgements and if that man, in fact, had occupied a better location.<br><br>So, the following day, Adan continued to observe the new guy as he returned to the same spot on the opposite bank of the river. True enough, he was again making catches after catches. He grew more excited each time the man brought his lines up. Adan eyes were fixed on him the entire day. And by the end of the day, they managed to leave with only a half a basket.<br><br>This strange phenomenon that Adan had thought was happening went on for a week. Adan had wanted very much to give himself a try and switch over to the opposite side to fish, but ended up disposing the idea as he felt doing so would sadden Abel. Abel needed him by his side, at his boardwalk.<br><br>It was the tenth day since the new man came along. As the brothers were packing their lines to leave, Abel said to Adan. "My younger brother. It puzzled me as much as it had puzzled you. Our catch is decreasing each day. This is not normal." Upon hearing this, Adan was glad yet hesistant to speak as Abel, had, broken the silence. Sensing that, Abel tells his younger brother,"You can leave if you wish to. I know you are worried about me. I can cope alone. I will be better alone."<br>Abel's words shocked him. He felt discomfort in his heart. He was disappointed that Abel had misunderstood his intentions."Brother, I do not want to leave you here. What would you do if I had left?"<br><br>Abel calmly said to Adan,"But you have to. If you don't, we will starve. This is a good season but we are bringing in fewer each time. Do you know why, my dear brother?" By this time Adan was about to reveal to his brother about the man he saw when Abel added,"It's been a long time since anyone had fished here apart from the both of us. You know, Adan, I can't convince you that we have and are in the best spot by the river, but I have lived to know that, <strong>with an uncertain heart you have, the same patience we no longer share, the fishes will not bite a distracted line as a bird will never build its nest on a wavering tree. So I say to you, it's better you leave than to stay on this ground and habour thoughts about the greener pasture over the other side. And as each time you do not receive the harvest you desire, you will be reminded. You will not feel justified."</strong></p>
              <p>Sometimes, departure or separation is essential for growth.</p>
              <p>For those in love, if one day your partner choose to leave to seek better pasture, let them go. Only by doing that Love can grow. Holding back will only bring about dissatisfaction for both.</p>
              <p>As the saying goes, "If you love her, you got to set her free. If she comes back, only then you know she's yours to keep"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>God Bless</p>
