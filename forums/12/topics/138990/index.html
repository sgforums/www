            <div class='col-md body'>I feel that wat star says is right.<br><br>Well my advice will be similiar... In a relationship, there is no right or wrong.. is not an exam, this is a relationship where mutual feelings are interlinked with each other. To you, yr tactfulness might be seen as tactless who knoes...<br><br>Do you know that it is not tactful to give in to every quarrel? What your gf might view is that you are a fragile guy, a guy that always give in to her demands. Relect on the issue that both of you quarrel, i believe both of you will have rights and wrongs in some ways. Try to firm and apologise for your wrong doings but not give in totally. Do reason out in a nice way that she does have wrongs in her parts as well. I guess in this way, she will feel a different you instead. A person with security and "tough" one. If yr gf demands you to give in whether she is right or wrong.. maybe i think its time you reflect on your relationship as well. Does she really suit you?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>err tact simply means really NOT saying the wrong thing at ALL times.<br>then there's diplomacy, saying the RIGHT thing at the right time.<br><br>so its really easy to be tactful if you keep quiet when in doubt.<br><br>Can be an overrated virtue though. Honesty is more important than tact when it comes to friends ba.<br><br>If u keep asking and asking and asking and asking people whether you are tactless or not hor.. then actually not tactless one, will in the end become tactless.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Tactless is when you say things straight off the top of your head. when you did not think before hand if what you'll say will hurt the other party....<br><br>Example: A plate of chicken rice is served. you say " hey do you know how much fats is in a plate of chicken rice? and you(looking at her/his tummy) are still eating it?"<br><br>this is not a very good example but is the only one i can think of now.<br><br>by saying that, you friend/gf may pick that up as "don't u think you should watch wat you eat, given your figure now?"<br><br>wherther a not you are tactless is impossible to tell unless we have conversed with you a lot.<br><br>However being tactless may not only affect your gf but your friends too. why do you think your friends are bringing it to your attention? Just try to give what you wanna say a little more thought before you say it.</div>
