              <p>Confront him is useless lah. Confronting now only speeds up the destruction of your family.</p>
              <p>First of all, ask yourself what kind of relationship your mother and your siblings have with your father.</p>
              <p>Is he just a ATM machine to the family ? When was the last time you had a good quality bonding time with your father ?</p>
              <p>I bet you and your siblings don't give two hoots about your father BEFORE you found out about his affair, yes ?</p>
              <p>Well, it's not too late.</p>
              <p>Start spending more time with your father. Let him know that his family loves him more than that woman.</p>
              <p>If your father owns the company, then why arn't you and your siblings spending time helping him out ? If you had been there, the woman wouldn't have her chance in the first place.</p>
              <p>Stop neglecting your father, bring him back. Putting a lasso on him ain't gonna work. Family love and a stronger relationship is the key.</p>
              <p>If you just wanna be angry, disgusted and full of contempt for what he has done. Then best you let him go and live his happy life away from you and the rest of the family.</p>
              <p>Your choice, so choose wisely.</p>

                                1. forgive your father if he ever turns back.
                                
                                2. never forgive your father even if he turns back.
                                                                                      
                                proceed once you are committed. if you find yourself unable to commit to anything, or likely to rescind on your commitment later on, then you sit tight until you decide you can commit. once you are committed, you will find the other considerations either slowing fall into place naturally, or completely redundant as you go along.

              <p>Yes you, your brother and mother need to confront your father about this matter. Make sure you keep evidence ofyour father's sms or else he will deny that he is having an affair. Lets hear out his explanation. He could either be 1) Bullshit 2) Admit the truth.</p>
              <p>Most likely he will tell you 1) and he will fail to convince you all that he is clean.</p>
              <p>These things are hard to proof unless you catch him in the act.</p>
              <p>You can hire a private investigator to follow him around take intimate photographs. Also, is he always missing from home? Always staying somewhere else during the night? You all must make sure he stay at home at all times.</p>
              <p>Sometimes these things may come out badly. Your Father or Mother may ask for divorce. Be prepared for the worse. If however both your parents want to make this work, there will be a lot of problems with "trusting" each other.</p>

              <p><br>Violence does not solve any problems. It will only serve to worsen the situation. It isn't legal for you to force her to leave using violent means no matter what's your cause.</p>
              <p>Your mum has to confront your dad regarding this issue. That's the only way to solve the problem. A direct confrontation. She has to face the problem head on. One important point to take note here though. Do not make it a heated one.</p>
              <p>Things may inevitably get heated when your mum raises this issue with your dad. However, she should try to keep the situation as calm and controlled as possible. Hurtful words which are not helpful to the current situation would only get hurled about if the situation turns ugly.</p>
              <p>How did your mum get to know about his affair?</p>
              <p>How old are your other siblings?</p>
              <p>And yes, a marriage counsellor would help. But that is only after your mum has confronted your dad regarding the issue.</p>
              <p>Before everything, it would help if your mum reflcts on what has been going on in their marriage all these years. What were the problems that your parents had faced?</p>
              <p>What's the cause for his extramarital affair? Is it a fault on your mum's side?</p>
              <p>I'm not trying to say that your mum is the cause for the affair and that your dad is blameless. But rather trying to find out the causes that gradually pushed or did not push your dad towards having an affair.</p>
              <p>The party having the affair is forever at fault. Even if he or she isn't the one who intiate it, he or she is still guilty as charged.</p>

              <p><br>depend on which type of gal, some uses charm and magic to lure man into them, break his family and get his money. For men, especially the middle age one who are going thru crisis of all kind of middle age problem like losing hair, getting older, erectile dyfunction, high blood, these and that problem makes them very depress and certainly loses their manhood, this apply to both rich and poor men. It is therefore, the duty and the foresight of a capable wife to bring back and perhap paid more attention to their middle age husband mid life crisis, otherwise, when a young beauti like me arrive, their hubbies will be gone.</p>
