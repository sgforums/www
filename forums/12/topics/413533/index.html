              <p>Hi, I am a 17 year-old teenager. I'm currently still studying in a local polytechnic. Just recently, my mum discovered that my dad's having an affair. To double confirm it, I went to check his mobile phone and found solid evidence of it, hundreds of disgusting smses between him and the whore. Right noiw, I'm probably in my worst period of my life, just when everything is going smoothly for me, this incident happened.</p>
              <p>My dad still doesn't know about it, "we finding out about him having an affair". Right now, my brother, my mum and I are in a dilemna on what to do. Since the third-party whom my dad is having an affair is his worker, if the worker is sacked, will my dad still carry on with the relationship?</p>
              <p>And? Is it legal for me to threaten the third-party to leave my dad alone? If she doesn't wants to leave, is it legal for me to force her to leave using violent means?</p>
              <p>Thank you for taking the time to read and helping me out.</p>

              <p>I think you need to discuss with your siblings and your mum how to approach your dad about this.</p>
              <p>Do you still love your dad?</p>
              <p>Were you (and your family) willing to forgive your dad if he knows he's wrong?</p>
              <p>Talk to him in a nice way and dont make him in awkward position.</p>
              <p>If he's willing to talk about it, ask him whether he can leave the woman and stay with you and your family?</p>

              <p>That is good if everybody willing to forgive your dad.</p>
              <p>Now the ball is on your dad's court.</p>
              <p>Find a good time to tell your dad about the affairs.</p>
              <p>Ask him can he let go of the woman.</p>
              <p>Tell him that everybody still love him alot.</p>
              <p>If he's willing to, then it will be good.</p>
              <p>You and your family need to talk to him first.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Going to marriage counsellor is for cases like marriage is nearly breakup...very hard to reconcile.</p>
              <p>That will be the last resort.</p>

              <p>I don't think it's ever legal to threaten someone.</p>
              <p>And I think that even if you and your family forgive your dad, you must make sure he understands that if he commits the same mistake again, he'll lose all of you for good.</p>
              <p>Sadly though, a leopard hardly ever (if ever) changes it's spots. So, I'll say that there's a high chance he'll do this again if he thinks that he can get away with it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>PS: Not sure about the marriage counsellor thing but you can try.</p>

              <p>you need to let us know how disgusting were those sms-es. i hope your father is only flirting but again flirting or if the sms-es went overboard then it is not right. nowadays lots of foregn workers out to hook man. does your dad seldom spen time with your mom or the family. if so then this is the telltale signs. oterhwise i think your mom can try to find some time with your dad and mayb spice up their lives a little. go on honey moon again. now sing dollar appreciate can go us mayb. how your parents sex life goinf. believe me sometimes this is the cause if they had poor sex life.</p>
              <p>also check out or try to know a little about this 'whore' his background. since you peoplea re suspecting you can do all these check. hire a PI if you can afford. dn't make any move yet until you got evidence and confirm the act. if that 'slut' has got some backup one you make take note to keep the police involved if you do go for counselling.</p>

              <p>Hmmm I think the kids are old enough le ba.</p>
              <p>And I think if the dad continues with his ways the kids will be even more negatively affected if they're still together lor.</p>
              <p>Hmmm but it's up to TS la, different ppl handle this kinda situation differently. Too many factors involved liaoz.</p>

              <p>Hire a PI to check on TS dad is a good idea to get to know more on what he's actually doing behind Ts back.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But it will be expensive to hire PI. Maybe TS can consider whether TS want to have PI service or not.</p>

              <p>well, I differ a bit.</p>
              <p>what is society is opening up? I think our values are eroding.</p>
              <p>In the past, couples are match-made, but can last time, cause they know they are in it for the long haul and try to work all problems out.</p>
              <p>now, with the westernised influence, divorce/marriage is a trip to vegas' booth or a simple trip to lawyers.</p>
              <p>of course, I am not negating those cases where there are abusive, martial rapes and etc.</p>
              <p>but do be objective, not all guys are disloyal, we all know that some gals are always scaling the walls and hanky panky.</p>
              <p>as for TS, i think the confrontation may be explosive, it would be good to get someone respected in your family, of course a cool-headed one, and have a family meeting. I still think it needs to be worked internally and not a full-blown affair.</p>
              <p>and resorting to violence/intimidation may sometimes backfire.</p>
              <p>just my two cents. no offense, Jan.</p>

              <p>You try to confront him later he ç¿»è„¸ and say stupid things like it's not his fault but your mom or whatnot. Or if your dad kuniang type he maybe cry ask for forgiveness. Main thing here is that once the trust is gone, things will never be the same. You look at his face you only see a cheating dog.</p>
              <p>Don't bother threatening the worker cos she will only alert to your dad, that little bitch sure won't leave.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>TS may not now much details about this 'affair; yet. my suggestion is since the issue has not be fully blown and since father nad others may not know this suspicions aroused yet there is still a chance to work it out right. Saving a marriage is always a couple's first objective, esp when they have kids. unless either oarty is feeling it impossible to live together anymore. TS you may ot had provided or know much details about the whole story. you can suggest to your mother to meet up and seek advice from professionals. they can be volunteers too. divorce and going to court should be the last resort. confrontig your father and her 'whore' at the workplace is not good as most employer's prefer employees to settle their personal affairs outside company premises, esp now the third party is also an employee of the same organization. unless of course its your family business. either way its not the time to make this move yet. mayb TS can provide more details for better more more advice of bptons people here can present.</p></div>

              <p>TS,</p>
              <p>Amazing how the human mind deludes itself. To simply blame the other woman is ridiculous. Cos both are in it.</p>
              <p>Why u want to ''kaypoh'' about the other woman? The one in it is responsible and as long as he does not acknowledge and assume resp. it is going to be chaos! That is where the focus ought to be - his negation of his responsiblities: his role to the family as a husband and as a father. One simply forgets that behind these roles there is a human being crying out to be free. That is something that needs fixing.</p>
              <p>As to what they are - only you and your other family members can decide.</p>
              <p>Imposing what he ought to be is something that will not work. It has to be of his own free will.</p>
              <p>As for legal action - for now utter waste of time and money. The court is not going to interfere and mediation is unhealthy cos it merely boxes one in!</p>
