Couple hanging out with each other is as good as hanging out regularly with a good friend - constantly finding new things to do and new places to explore. Don't get me wrong, its good stuff - however, to have intergrated lifestyle served a more lasting and fulfilling effect on the relationship.<br><br>What do I mean by an intergrated lifestyle?<br><br>I) A common hobby, goal and interest that both of you has AND to enjoy it together. For example, if you two are into music - certain days are definitely burn into the activities.<br><br>II) Intergrated friends - hangs out with each other's cliche, whichever is more comfortable.<br><br>P.S: You need to have your own life as well. A good relationship essentially needs a healthy lifestyle outside the boundary of your relationship.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

Do realise about your current situation. For a start, well, things will never be the same as before after a fight or a "cool down" period as human are emotion being. The hurt or sorrow that both experience will leave a scar, stain or a mark on the mental and emotional front that can never be erased. That is why sometime, something were just so hard to forget.<br><br>Next, talk about getting boring in the r/s. First thing to clarify, half a year or more in a relationship is not considered long time.<br><br>And, you feel that your r/s has reach a plateau as having to go to all the familiar places and doing similar things are like a routine or dread. Well, Singapore isn't very big for a start, but there are still a few places that I believe you have never explore yet. Doing similar things such as dining out or watching movie may seems like a routine, but you can try to ask him for a cycling trip or something like that or maybe simply relaxing at a cozy place to chill out.<br><br>But overall, it really takes TWO hands to clap to keep the relationship going and enjoyful. If you have done your part in keeping the relationship going, try to talk with him about this. If he feel uncomfortable talking, can ask him to try writing or other form of communication. However, if he don't wish to talk, it may be good to leave it be.<br><br>A food for thought here, "There is a limit to what one party can achieve in a relationship that is meant for two." Think about this.<br><br>Wish you all the best.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

In fact... Nowadays, things are much easier... Discover new places... Rediscover old places... New activities you've never tried before...? New shows... Live your days with him just like you would of your own life...<br><br>And ultimately... Remember that it's not about the places you go and things you attend all of the time... But in fact, who you go with... And of course, don't always have to be him.. Can be with friends or even siblings.. Colleagues...?<br><br>Last but not least... In a relationship, don't do things just for the sake of doing them...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
