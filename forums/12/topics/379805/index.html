              <p>Hi Chipperboy,</p>
              <p>If your project work group members are really unwilling to put in effort into your project, perhaps you will like to get the teacher-in-charge to speak to all of you. If that comes to no conclusion, then you will have no choice but to work extra hard on your side. Unfortunately, it is highly unlikely that the teacher-in-charge will entertain a switch in group.</p>
              <p>As for the promotions, do not worry too much about it. I know of students who get DDE for their promotions who ended up having AAB for their "A"-level. The most important thing for you to do now is to put in even more effort, so as to ensure that you will have the results which you desired for your "A"-level.</p>
              <p>Cheers. </p>

              <p><br>If I were you, I would do more for the sake of my project, regardless if it is a group project or not.</p>
              <p>As long as you do your best for your project, people will understand the hard work that you have put into this project and recognise you for your efforts.</p>
              <p>You don't really need to divide and calculate and weigh every single responsibility evenly. Different people have different levels of output when working together in a project, you cannot expect everyone to have the same level of output as you unless you are working together with your own clones.</p>
              <p>The true success of working in a project is not based on the amount of output by each individuals, but rather the cohesiveness of the entire team!</p>
              <p>Can you bring your team member together? Can you work closely together with them? Can you get along well with them? Can you make your team members LIKE you?</p>
              <p>Do that and achieve total cohesiveness and you will find that you have gained a rather useful ability to work greatly with anybody anywhere else in this world.</p>
              <p>Measuring outputs are just childish behaviour ..... please grow up and drink more milk and eat more oranges.</p>
