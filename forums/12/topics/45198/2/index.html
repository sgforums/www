May I know how old are the both of you?<br><br><strong>  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question">  Although my bf and i r not together for a very long period of time (ard 11 months) , i still hope tt i can do what i need to maintain our r/s.</strong><br><br>It's not surprising that both of you can be together for short term. On logical aspect, time might not be on your side for this relationship. The difference in both of your characters would probably become more obvious with time? Are you older than your bf? What are your respective educational levels for now? What kinda job opportunties are the both of you aiming for?<br><br><strong><br>esp the times when we have got very opposite and different views to solve probs together and we dunno how to come to a conclusion or ans.</strong><br><br>Though both of you might have quite opposite and different views from time to time, both of you do have one thing in common... Stubborness... Having opposite and differing views might not be necessarily a bad thing, depending on how you view it...? But the fact that each of you usually insist on your own grounds certainly does not make things any easier... The usual way out of the conflicts would be just forget about everything, kiss and make up... And yes, you're right about something... This is probably not gonna benefit your relationship in time to come as problems begin to accumulate and he starts to change (probably?).... Then would come the TRUE STRUGGLE of your love... What you're experiencing now is probably just the BEGINNING....<br><br><strong><br>Normally what  we will do is  cond to express our views whole heartly , but we cant understand each other needs and views and by doing so , both of us r becoming tired and frustrated at the end of the converstation.</strong><br><br>Each of you probably focused too much on your own stand? And like you've mentioned, both of you have quite differring views... Which certainly don't make understanding each other any easier... The KEY is to REALLY CARE for each other.. And this is quite a 'challenging' task as the situation would probably only work effectively if both of you practise the same....<br><br><strong><br>This always happens and i m sure its hurting  both of us. But most of the time , we really feel at a loss to solve it coz its like "i m trying to explain my concept to him sincerely and hoping he can do it my way or understand me" and hes doing the same to me too. At the end of the day, both of us r not statisfied with our conclusion and solutions to solve probs <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> </strong><br><br>FOCUS on the part of your partner and NOT mainly on expressing your stands and views... Try this different approach... Easy to say, certainly not easy to accomplish in your relationship...<br><br><strong><br>what we normally do is to bury it and forget it.which is not solving the prob coz it keeps on happening for many times , <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  thats why previosuly , i really got enough and i initiated a breakup (which i really didnt want to do tt) </strong><br><br>Try to control your COOL... Another vitual KEY to the survival of this relationship...<br><br><strong><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> * We may be very loving at times coz we share the same stupid jokes and funny topics.but comes to solving problems, he uses a different way of concept from me.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> hes a open minded person and i m a very conservative person. he is sociable and i m more to shy and introvert . He always likes to be in the lime light in front of his friends but not me, i prefer to be the one following the crowd althought i have my own stand sometimes.</strong><br><br>Side track... There's something about you which seems.... Hmm... Do you feel that you're always trying to give in to people and often feel rather repulsive about it...?<br><br><strong><br>Despite of the many clashing character we have got, but i wun give up trying to neturalise our probs untill at the end of all my efforts, when i realise tt we r  not going to work out , only then i would give up. thats why i hope i could have some helpful advice from ppl here.thks <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"><br><br>peacely </strong><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">  I LIKE your SPIRIT....<br></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>although i may be very enthu abt solving our probs and convincing him to speak up more so tt we can knoe more abt each other and compromising each other.but theres a big problem. He is a tough nut to crack , i describe him in this way coz no matter how hard i trys to bring him to be in a serious mood , trying to tell him how i feel or how i wan him to treat me to make both of us feel better, he would jus change the atmosphere to a easy going mood.<br>Its very very obvious to me tt he is not mature enough to handle "me &amp; my probs" esp when he tells me his views tt if he thinks tt if he got any probs , he will solve it in his way and alone. he is more to the individual side. i m not trying to imply tt i am mature but jus tt , i realise tt the way i think abt things r more sensible than him.<br>&amp; i know its a fact tt only when time passes , a person will learn to grow and be mature. (esp for both of us) The approach i use previously like venting my anger or trying to talk things out is useless coz i think hes not mature enough to think of things in my concept. Although we have got times when we got conflicts and no ways to solve them, i realise tt he is always trying his best giving in to me even though i m not statisfied with his ans. and now then i realise tt , i have always been adding "cant cope" stress on him.<br>Right now, i m in a loss coz i seems to find no ans for this problem.<br>But hopefully, i hope tt i can find a solution to solve things out and hopefully using a way tt he is comfortable with.</div>

Well...to a certain extend, yes we can.<br>But most of the people here could help by sharing their experience and knowledge they have gathered for years.<br>Why do i refer to books? Cos people have done researches, spent time to get their degree, PHD or doctorate by studying Human behaviour and Social relations.<br>Though it's theoritical and doesn't seem to help you in your personal problem.<br>I'm sure it will help you understand why and what other possiblities there are that your bf is behaving this way.<br><br>Lastly, maintain a positive mindset and chase all those suspicious, or disturbing thoughts away.<br>And then please go to the libary and get that book.

Woman, being on the more sensitive side - and when the kind of showering of love and concern isn't constant - they will feel it - its not suprising.<br><br>For your bf - its more about how he treat you when you both of you come together as a date - its when love is being shower and hugs &amp; kisses are exchanged - of course, it feels good. But when he is working - his attention and devotion are gone to the work or the surrounding - the thoughts of girlfriend isn't forgotten - it is there, but not expressed it to you that's all.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You extra sensitivity comes from the fact about the relationship that had took placed in the past - which made you feel and concern deeply over little strange weird seemingly treatment you receive. You mentioned that you are expecting too much - the real reason is that you grew thinking too much - which indirectly sparks alot of unneccessary worries.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Advice?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You feel insecure, you have your own right to your own feeling. The next time when the both of you meet, talk to him and say that this insecurity is affecting you - ask him for a morning sms everytime he wake up whenever possible - treat it as if it is a natural action like opening your eyes when you wake up. Then if he don't sms that morning - for every two times he fails to do it - he owes you a day to company you go shopping or something - make relationship interesting, work towards solving problem and probably spend more time together. One stone kill 3 birds. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Cheers</div>
