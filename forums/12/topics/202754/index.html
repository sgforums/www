So long as you've got them under your control using a relatively 'safe' or harmless method... It's just plain deceiving yourself if you only wanna chunk the issues aside or bottle up EVERYTHING... IN FACT, that won't really be quite that possible...<br><br>Alot of things are really about your own mentality and how you look at things... Like I've said.. The BP thing probably won't be such a big issue for now.. At least not as big as if you make it to be... If you're having hypertension, worrying too much over it certainly won't help in most ways... You should be more bother with keeping yourself fit and leading a more healthy lifestyle to prevent other complications to kick in... And at the same time, exercises and controlled diet should do your BP much good too...</div>

If you have to think otherwise, it's either 1. you discuss with your doctor... 2. You get another doctor's opinion 3. You know VERY WELL what you're doing..... Seems to me like you're in none of the categories above...<br><br>Telling you again... The LEAST you can do is not to make your condition WORSE... What follows after you're not taking ALL's advices is gonna be yuor own funeral...<br><br>PS. Consider taking up blog writing if you just wanna tell a story of what you do each day.</div>
