              <p>In life, Always choose the decision that will bring you happiness and not frustrations.</p>
              <p>You always have the right and the power to say "NO" if you know that joining them in their outing will only bring you grieve. But NEVER let anyone know that you do not want to join them because of that girl, cos that won't be correct anyway. You just need some time away to restore and recover your dampen spirits.</p>
              <p>Don't join the fight for attention if you know that you can't win. Instead, take this opportunity to take a step backwards and observe them. In doing so will not only prevents you from feeling worse, it will also makes it easier for you to understand them.</p>
              <p>If you have no choice but have to join them for the sake of your bf, then please make sure you outdress that girl. This is to help you to feel more confident of yourself when you're out with her and your bf.</p>
              <p>You won't lose your bf unless he himself wants out of the relationship with you. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>Lovelypink,</p>
              <p>How does your bf behaves in front of that girl ?</p>
              <p>Does he shows signs that he may actually be attracted to that seductress ?</p>
              <p>If your bf only has his eyes for you.. you should be very happy.</p>
              <p>But if your bf get's motivated by her behavior.. then I tell ya.. your bf is not a keeper.</p>
              <p>Temptations are aplenty in life. And it's not always a bad thing. Helps you see the truth in your partner.</p>
              <p>You don't want to wake up at 50 and have a womanizer sleeping beside you.</p>

              <p>Your bf is not as blur as you think.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just because the girl have a bf does not means she will stop looking for a better deal.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And same goes for your bf too.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There are several cases of BGR where both couples broke off with each other's partner .. to be together. Even though the couples are good friend of each other.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Chances are.. your bf may think he has a chance with that girl, and that girl sees your bf as potential partnership.. a sweeter deal than what she has right now.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'd suggest you keep your options open.. and see what happens.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After you have conveyed your unhappiness.. and your bf still continues with his current behavior.. then you should be mentally and emotionally prepared to lose this guy.. no matter how good you may think he is.</p>

              <p>Your bf is not as blur as you think.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just because the girl have a bf does not means she will stop looking for a better deal.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And same goes for your bf too.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There are several cases of BGR where both couples broke off with each other's partner .. to be together. Even though the couples are good friend of each other.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Chances are.. your bf may think he has a chance with that girl, and that girl sees your bf as potential partnership.. a sweeter deal than what she has right now.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'd suggest you keep your options open.. and see what happens.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After you have conveyed your unhappiness.. and your bf still continues with his current behavior.. then you should be mentally and emotionally prepared to lose this guy.. no matter how good you may think he is.</p>

              <p>Have you even spoken to her yet? Some girls are close to guys as in being their buddies. I am close to a heck lot of guys. I make sure that I have a courtesy to talk to the girlfriends, make them my friends, ask them out when their bf is out with me and reassure them that I am no competition for their guy's attention or affection. Some however have an unsavory intention of pulling your bf away from you under the guise of "friendship".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sit down and talk to her first .</p>
              <p>Make it clear to your bf and her ( talk to one alone at a time) that you are not comfortable with the situation. When I say make it clear , say it out " I don't like her behaviour around you at the moment . I find her etc etc . This is how I feel ". Target the situation and behaviour - not the person.</p>
              <p>If your bf respects your feelings, he will try to compromise or stay off her for abit.</p>
              <p>If the girl is not some slut , she will minimise contact with your boyfriend or at least talk to you first.</p>
              <p> Even younger girls don't want to try snatching my guy from me , I make sure that they know I can be a straight up b*tch who can give them hell on earth and they keep away from my dates or interests.</p>

              <p><br>Don't worry about me and parn.. we are females.. unlike males... we don't have an ego the size of an elephant.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Parn and me can be partners in crime.. we don't always have to agree with each other.. but most important ... is that we can french kiss each other when we need to.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And don't let age fool you. Some women likes younger guys.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Since you are new to the bgr arena.. you havn't learn how to guard your turf yet.</p>
              <p>There will be many more bitches in your long road ahead with a nice guy.. and bitches like her will always want to come piss on your nicely manicured turf... get what I mean ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'm wonderin... since that girl's bf is with you when that girl sms your bf... how come you never say anything to her bf ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ya know.. like " wow.. I didn't know your gf likes to sms other men so much." ...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I mean.. C'mon lor.. any respectable guy will feel insulted when his own gf openly flirt with another guy, somemore with his own friends leh.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Then you can casually ask that girl's bf... like " Eh.. you don't mind your gf frequently sent msg to other guys meh ?"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Then you just sit back and watch the show lor.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Unless this guy is so balless.. then cannot blame lah. But then if this is the case... I'm sure your bf probably seem like a better man than her own bf. Then ofcors she wants to steal your bf. </p>
