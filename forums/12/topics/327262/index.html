              <p>Hi Pinky,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Would suggest that it time to have a good talk with your bf.  Just tell him how you feel. Ask him to put himself in your shoes and tell him to have a tot for your feeling.  If he really love, he shd react.  if not, then forget it....wat for to have a bf dun have a tot 4 u!!!</p>

              i have been talking to him since then i ask him to make up his mind by tml, juz hoping he side track a little but will still turn back to me afterall we hav been tgh for 3 and half years. i am now too dependent on him juz hope everything will be back to normal tml =( you muz jiayou! dun wan u to be in the same position as me.. but i guess is partly my fault to not asuring him i love him... talk to ur bf now tell him how much you care, how u dun wan him to be snatched away. oh and dun scold the gal cuz is a supid thing to do. guys will only think you v immature or wad not annd feel the gal v innocent to be scolded by you. you noe what i mean? jiayou =) i will jiayou too =(

              <p>Yea, there are this type of girls around...sometimes I also dunno how to react with them...</p>
              <p>Like got one, kept asking my hubby to go with her just because she doesn't want to be alone with one of her admirers...I was thinking, what does she take him for? Her personal bodyguard?</p>
              <p>Luckily he never went, otherwise he would not hear the end of it.</p>

              <p>hi TS!</p>
              <p>have you spoken to your BF yet?</p>
              <p>i think you cannot totally prevent him from being asked out by the gal, but can ask him to reject her nicely?</p>
              <p>if he prefer the girl's company, maybe he's not the right guy for you. Worst, he thinks she's better than you?</p>

              <p>Are u n your bf married or even engaged? As long as there's no legal proof of marriage, it's still a free for all game.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="icon_twisted.gif"></p>
              <p>Your bf would realise his mistake soon and if u were better than that gal, probably he'll go out with you more.</p>
