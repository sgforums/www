              <p>when I first come in to work under him.... I found he doesn't like opinion different to him, although he kept saying he would like to hear all opinions. I was inexperienced in my job, but I tried to give him my opinions, write him reports whenever he asked. However, It was useless, wasting my time, I doubt he read my reports, the final decision is always his.</p>
              <p>Worse case....when he got into trouble (not following my suggestion), and then he or someone else worked out a solution, not knowing or forgotten that the issue and the solution were raised and offerred by me long time ago, he would happily tell everybody that this is the correct way and please follow.</p>
              <p>On one occasion, when I saw he clearly was making a fool out of himself. I openly sent out an email to the whole group, telling him that it was a bad idea to do this and that. Soon after that, I got rebuked, he said my "criticism" was not backed by sufficient data, email like that could easily provoke people ("did I provoke him?"), from his experience, he is certain his decision is correct, etc, etc</p>
              <p>Fine, after that, since he dismissed my opinion based on his experience, we did what we have been told. Then all hell broke lose, unknown problems seemed to plague the whole group, we were suffering until one day, he quietly adopted my idea, making no announcement. I had no idea what was on his mind, so I still continued to do what he has previously stipulated for some time.</p>
              <p>Then one day he called me into his office,  told me he collected enough data and saw how my idea actually worked, then started shooting me. "Did you remember what you wrote on the email that day? You were the one who proposed this, but now why you were doing otherwise? Don't you think this is like slapping your own face?"</p>
              <p>I was so frustrated. From that day onward, I never offer him any deep analysis again. I just do what I have been told, then finish task and go home quickly.</p>
              <p>There is an advisor in my group, transferred from a parent company. Boss is like under the advisor, won't object to anything he says. The advisor I would say is smart and have plenty of good ideas, but when coming to making the ideas work, he totally cannot make it, looks like a complete novice. Whoever teams up with this guy sufferred, because he always changes the plan, do what he likes. Since my boss doesn't want his advisor to ruin his plan, he told me to team up with the advisor.</p>
              <p>So I thought the best way to work with such a person, would be to leave all the planning to him, then just do what I am told. Then today, boss called me into office again, asked me "why your team's progress is so poor? you are the main PIC, shouldn't you be seeing into all these problems?"</p>
              <p>Damn him, man! he got rid of a troublemaker, at the expense of me, but still tell me this. I feel like I am being fooled by the boss and advisor. Very sian of going to work now, ever since I joined this company, I didn't think I improved myself much.</p>
              <p>What would you do, if you were me?</p>

              <p>See the part highlighted in red above? this is where you totally broke his ego and make him lose all his face. Things were already bad between you and him, and you still send an e-mail to him and CC everyone in it? good luck.</p>
              <p>a lot of times, in the real world, you need to apply the following rules:</p>
              <p>1) get blamed for mistakes even when you didn't do it</p>
              <p>2) accept the accusations as long as it's not a matter of life-and-death</p>
              <p>3) say sorry even if you're not in the wrong</p>
              <p>4) male bosses generally are more competitives, and super-ego gods. This is why never ever offend your male bosses in ego area. Some female bosses also have ego, but not as much or serious.</p>
              <p>5) you seem to be in a rush to show everyone your abilities. Just take it slow and prove yourself when the time comes. At this point, trying to fight against your boss and claim credit even if the idea is yours.........IS A BIG MISTAKE.</p>
              <p>6) you need to get into your boss's good books first, before any kind of deal can be worked out. Now, you're playing office politics with him everyday.....where got energy and time to focus on your own achievements?</p>
              <p>7) don't take your job too seriously........remember: you're in the company for the farking $$$, not for credit or fame. Can you survive without money and live on fame? No way.Unless the company proves to you that it's a worthy company to lay down your life for (such as the boss is very sincere and good to you), then don't give a fark to the company even if it's on fire.</p>
              <p>CHILL!!!!!!!!!!</p>

I openly sent out an email to the whole group, telling him that it was a bad idea to do this and that. Soon after that, I got rebuked, he said my "criticism" was not backed by sufficient data, email like that could easily provoke people ("did I provoke him?"), from his experience, he is certain his decision is correct, etc, etc</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span><span style="color: #000000;"></span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: blue; ">Ans: even he is making a fool out of himself, don’t ever sent out email openly, this is declaring war to him. Best way is not to take any action.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span></span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span><span style="color: #000000;">Fine, after that, since he dismissed my opinion based on his experience, we did what we have been told. Then all hell broke lose, unknown problems seemed to plague the whole group, we were suffering until one day, he quietly adopted my idea, making no announcement. I had no idea what was on his mind, so I still continued to do what he has previously stipulated for some time.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span><span style="color: #000000;"></span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: blue; ">Ans: after knowing that he quietly adopt your idea, meaning that was a change of plan already. Drop every previous plan u are doing and change to the new plan immediately.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span></span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span><span style="color: #000000;">Then one day he called me into his office,  told me he collected enough data and saw how my idea actually worked, then started shooting me. "Did you remember what you wrote on the email that day? You were the one who proposed this, but now why you were doing otherwise? Don't you think this is like slapping your own face?"</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span><span style="color: #000000;"></span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="color: blue; "><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Ans: reply tactfully, say boss still u r more </span></span><span style="color: blue; font-family: SimSun;   " lang="ZH-CN">è‹±æ˜Žç¥žæ­¦</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: blue;  " lang="ZH-CN"> </span><span style="color: blue;  ">then me.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span></span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span><span style="color: #000000;">I was so frustrated. From that day onward, I never offer him any deep analysis again. I just do what I have been told, then finish task and go home quickly.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span><span style="color: #000000;"></span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: blue; ">Ans: u should do this everyday go take up some courses at night, unless u have some other plan.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span></span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span><span style="color: #000000;">There is an advisor in my group, transferred from a parent company. Boss is like under the advisor, won't object to anything he says. The advisor I would say is smart and have plenty of good ideas, but when coming to making the ideas work, he totally cannot make it, looks like a complete novice. Whoever teams up with this guy sufferred, because he always changes the plan, do what he likes. Since my boss doesn't want his advisor to ruin his plan, he told me to team up with the advisor.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span><span style="color: #000000;"></span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: blue; ">Ans: boss order already, what to do?</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span></span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span><span style="color: #000000;">So I thought the best way to work with such a person, would be to leave all the planning to him, then just do what I am told. Then today, boss called me into office again, asked me "why your team's progress is so poor? you are the main PIC, shouldn't you be seeing into all these problems?"</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span><span style="color: #000000;"></span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: blue; ">Ans: u better take over the planning..</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span></span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span><span style="color: #000000;">Damn him, man! he got rid of a troublemaker, at the expense of me, but still tell me this. I feel like I am being fooled by the boss and advisor. Very sian of going to work now, ever since I joined this company, I didn't think I improved myself much.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span><span style="color: #000000;"></span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="color: blue; "><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Ans: </span></span><span style="color: blue; font-family: SimSun;  ">äºº</span><span style="color: blue; font-family: SimSun;     " lang="EN">åœ¨</span><span style="color: blue; font-family: SimSun;  ">æ±Ÿæ¹–é£˜ï¼Œ</span><span style="color: blue; font-family: SimSun;     " lang="EN">å“ªèƒ½ä¸�æŒ¨åˆ€</span></p>
