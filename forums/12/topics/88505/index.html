            <div class='col-md body'>Most of us do have the struggles that you've mentioned. I did have the struggles of reaching my parents' expectations of my behaivour, grades and stuff. Not to mention, peer pressure on which uni to attend to, and the earnings that we made. But I believe that these could all be reduced by being contented with what I have.<br><br>To my parents, I have been ok to them, so that's pretty much settled. How did I know? My family have family conferences every now and then.<br><br>My friends? If your friend compares his/her pay and disses you about it? Do you consider that a friend? I think a friend is someone who supports you in spiritually and mentally. Someone who is standing next to you no matter what happens.<br><br>In the end, at this point of time, my struggles are greatly minimised. All boils down to mindcept and thinking. The struggles are always difficult, but a phrase that will pass.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
