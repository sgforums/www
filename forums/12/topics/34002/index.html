Sounds very much like an infatuation to me..? Especially after a guy has been in so much effort for someone... And the lady so well taken care of.... This 'blind' sense of belonging would naturally develop usually...? It's just how used to such feelings you are and how you view them which would ultimately make the difference usually...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

He had made the choice to be with his gf - he must go along with that decision and not to look back. The minute he look back, it will be his downfall.<br><br>Candy is wondering whether if she likes him anot since she is doubting and pondering over her actions and to decipher whether she likes him anot. In love - there is only LOVE and DON'T LOVE. Don't have to think so much... if you have to think and ponder so much - it means that the information on hand is not enough - take time to know someone.<br><br>The only know each other for 2 months only - most probably they don't know each other very well in character. It a relation/affair/etc is created from haste - they will regret.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Advice is... take time and let nature take its course. The more either of them wishes and wants to pressurised the arrival of Love, the more it wouldn't come to you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
