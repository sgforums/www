They only like the woman because she is pretty or for whatever reason. And they keep giving in to them. That's what divorce lawyers(who shd be made jobless) are there for..beacuse men marry the wrong women and then after some time, they get divorced.

The 5 girls you dated probably either had no interest in you or they hate men or they had a difficult personality. Girls who reject you are not for you, simple as that. I mean, so what? It's their loss! Goodbye!<br><br>The 5 that you met are probably more interested in something else than you. But dating is just a numbers game. You just go to the next one (which, of course you are interested in). You dun keep harping on the same one and keep asking them out till the end of days and they just tell you to ''keep in touch''. Yeah, right! Goodbye Miss no. 5! Next! You are just closer to the ONE.<br>(which in this case is your wife).<br><br>It's like that are good guys and bad guys. There is Hitler and Franklin Roosevelt. You see my point?<br><br>You are right. There is no point in stereotyping. Just keep dating and your ONE will appear. Most important of all, learn from your failed r/s. Why has it gone wrong? What did you do that has gone wrong? Where is it that's wrong? And you only become sharper.<br><br>Just my 2 cents.<br></div>

And yes, when I finally struck the ball (as in baseball), I did a homerun <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> coz my wife's the 1st and last serious relationship that I have <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>however, everyone falls into self-despair for a certain period of time. It is only how long a person takes to get out of it. Before that, he or she will keep blaming others.<br><br>Probably Mc2 is right. lala is too young to be so pessimistic. Should take his chance and see if it works out. Even if don't work out, at least we learn.</div>
