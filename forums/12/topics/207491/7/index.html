            <div class='col-md body'>To xShevx:<br><br>Read my BOTTOM post in this thread coz I too lazy to type those again. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=206131" rel="nofollow">http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=206131</a><br><br>When a person finds things do not go the way he/she wanted, normally he/she will be quick to judge that some things are not meant to be. This is caused by our refusal to accept "life is not a bed of roses". We desire many things, we wanted the best for ourselves, we would not settle for anything less than "perfect" in everything. Ok, NOT everything...<br><br>If all of us desire what is best for ourselves, how can we give to others? Eg: Two persons, a guy and girl, with the mentality of self-desire "falls" in love, how can they give to each other when all they want is to receive or desire?<br><br>If one is willing to give but the other still has the mentality of self-desire or receive, it will only hurt them both. The giver being the more painful in the short term and the receiver being the more empty and hurt in the long run.<br><br>AND before you decide on anything with relations to boy/gal relationship as in "go steady", why not focus on yourself first? As in focus on your being and character.<br><br>What do I mean? If you can learn to better yourself, not as in education or wealth or what BUT as your own character and core personality, you will find joy in everything.<br><br>How so? Lets say you are impatient. (example har......)<br><br>Being impatient caused you to respond quickly without much deliberation and may have upset people involved directly or indirectly and have made certain things go sour. (See some posts in this topic for examples...)<br><br>HOWEVER, if you learn to curb this impatience you will find things go "differently". Instead of the past when you would react instantly, you paused and ponder. Thinking what makes the person do that or why some things are that way. Think from their point of view or in their shoes, or how some things came into that. Consider all aspects and you will find a more suitable and better way of reacting to situations than when you were impatient. (See some posts in this topic for examples...)<br><br>This is but only ONE of the many virtues you can learn. When you learn more and more and you better yourself as a person, you will find out that there is nothing as devastating as you assumed it to be with regards to everything in your life, even your case in a relationship posted here. You will also find out that there are so many beautiful things in this world that we can appreciate. Be it Singapore, trees, cars, people in general, behaviours, paper, etc, etc.<br><br>Wow... I seem to be shooting alot.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br>I am still learning and trying to better myself so I can be more prepared for future events. So... anyone who read this, dun be offended by what I written coz afterall, I am boastful, crude, ignorant, envious, proud, rude, easily angered, I have ego, I am not that kind, not that patient and most important of all, I am NOT perfect in my eyes or anyone else eyes.</div>

Sure, it works for 1 or 2 months, but after awhile they get sick and tired of you smsing "goodnight i love you" every night.<br><br>And don't treat her like your personal diary, feeding her your every secret, crying in front of her when your dog 'milo' died. Its great to be honest with each other, but only when your relationship has reach a stable and mature level.<br><br>A good example would be kids hanging out in town, those couples wearing the same pink shirts, same shoes, sticking to each other like glue and all that sweet talking. Such relationships decay at a incredible rate, say few months?<br><br>When I told that to my friend a few months back, he chided me for trying to intrude into their perfect relationship. But few months later he was nursing a broken heart.<br><br>So just feel relax, be yourself, do something nice and sweet once in a blue moon. Be a sensitive jerk, and there you have it. It takes a broken heart and failed relationships to sorta get a sense of what im talking bout, but then again its part of growing up.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> </div></blockquote>Very true dude. Women want a MAN, not a boy. Stop treating your gf like Aunt Agony. You are going to turn her off. Once she loses respect for you, she will lose feelings for you. Most guys dun realise that and worse, they pick on the wrong girls. Their heart just get broken in the end.</div>

Both parties need to work it out together. It's best if the both the guy and the girl works together to support the family.<br><br>I get what Olala is trying to say: Guys need to find the correct woman. Most think of the short term only. They only like the woman because she is pretty or for whatever reason. And they keep giving in to them. That's what divorce lawyers(who shd be made jobless) are there for..beacuse men marry the wrong women and then after some time, they get divorced. The worse part of divorce is the huge amount of legal bills to be paid. That's the difference between getting married and just being in a relationship.<br><br></div>
