Naturally you will want to avoid the bad ones.<br><br>You just have to keep looking. It does not mean the bunch of girls you come across right now are the representation of the majority of the girls here. So based on what u said the ''chances of hooking up with the wrong one is so high'', then u shd be happy that when u picked up the right one since it's so rare, correct? It all boils down to the individual person.<br></div>
