            <div class='col-md body'>[quote]Originally posted by Simpleheat:<br>[b]<br><br>LOL... Please don stereotype all sg gal just becos of one of yr bad incident! I sometimes laugh at some sg guy who went pub and disco in search of gf and lifetime partner cos their social circle is small and little chance of contacting opposite sex. They expect to find good gal in that place? Yes...if might be but chances are very LOW!!! If u get to know a ger from pub who is a ah lian,demanding and unresonable. Don't blame all sg gal are bad and why yr r/s turns that!<br><br>As for the thread starter,why in the first place u like a gal like that? Scold u for no reason??? Don't tell me in the first 3 months,she totally never show any sign of immaturity,unreasonableness and she is yr perfect angel who gives in everything to you. Plus a very kind-hearted gal. Suddenly after 3months ,she can just make a 180 degree turn and change into a devil?<br><br>What u like her and make her court her in the first place? Is it just becos she is one of the pretty gal with a hot body? I personally believe what u get is what u sow. She may find her damm pretty and totally forget abt looking carefully abt her character before making the first move on her! This is also one of the fatal mistakes of many sg guy! Who court a gal purely on her look first( cos maybe they can show off her to friends or can be a pure pleasure on bed)<br><br>I believe if you understand enough before making a move on her as yr ger. You will save yr self a lot of painful memory. Btw,if i ever encounter such unreasonable ger in the first place,I will have break with her within a week. Yr failure to have a rationale and sounded minded makes u totally blinded in this r/s until you reach the stage of cannot withstand it before  break off is also a part of yr fault in this painful r/s. Don put the blame entirely on the other side. Do some soul searching and improve on yr next r/s. <span style="font-style: italic;">Open y r Big Big eyes before u plunge in the love river again</span><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br>Love is blind</div>

Please don stereotype all sg gal just becos of one of yr bad incident! I sometimes laugh at some sg guy who went pub and disco in search of gf and lifetime partner cos their social circle is small and little chance of contacting opposite sex. They expect to find good gal in that place? Yes...if might be but chances are very LOW!!! If u get to know a ger from pub who is a ah lian,demanding and unresonable. Don't blame all sg gal are bad and why yr r/s turns that!<br><br>As for the thread starter,why in the first place u like a gal like that? Scold u for no reason??? Don't tell me in the first 3 months,she totally never show any sign of immaturity,unreasonableness and she is yr perfect angel who gives in everything to you. Plus a very kind-hearted gal. Suddenly after 3months ,she can just make a 180 degree turn and change into a devil?<br><br>What u like her and make her court her in the first place? Is it just becos she is one of the pretty gal with a hot body? I personally believe what u get is what u sow. She may find her damm pretty and totally forget abt looking carefully abt her character before making the first move on her! This is also one of the fatal mistakes of many sg guy! Who court a gal purely on her look first( cos maybe they can show off her to friends or can be a pure pleasure on bed)<br><br>I believe if you understand enough before making a move on her as yr ger. You will save yr self a lot of painful memory. Btw,if i ever encounter such unreasonable ger in the first place,I will have break with her within a week. Yr failure to have a rationale and sounded minded makes u totally blinded in this r/s until you reach the stage of cannot withstand it before  break off is also a part of yr fault in this painful r/s. Don put the blame entirely on the other side. Do some soul searching and improve on yr next r/s. <span style="font-style: italic;">Open y r Big Big eyes before u plunge in the love river again</span><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br>Love is blind</div></blockquote>Love is not blinded...if one day yr parnter becos of greed,broke the law or killed someone,will you still consider together with this type of person? For me is ' NO' ,if u continue with this type of person, u r foolish. At the end of the day,kena hurt by her. Don't come here and whip whip and complain. Cos u r stupid!</div>
