He enjoys life and isn't ambitious? Regardless of how much you motivate him? Can you accept it? Be honest with yourself - i am assuming you are expecting a long term relationship.<br><br>I guess the first step you have got to take is to eat the humble pie and tell him how you feel honestly. If he doesn't want to meet you, write him a letter. Ultimately, you can't force him to reciprocate. You can't ASK him to love you , again, - you can only try your best to be someone he can love.<br><br>And after that, give him time to think.  You can't force him either - he needs to have his own reasons for wanting to continue the relationship willingly. And if he can't find it - well... you can only accept it with grace.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>Sometimes that might be for the better.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I suggest you take some time to think of what you want really, because compatibility in thoughts is important. If you prefer someone who has the similar backgroud, wave length as you, then I think you should spend some time to look for this someone instead of running back to someone whom you already know is less compatible with you.<br><br>The fact is, not all relationships will turn out well, the dating process is the discovery process to find out if there are love &amp; compatibility. But do be brave to end relationship once you know it is not going anywhere.<br><br>I have friends who were blind to the problems in the relationships, didn't manage to work them out, nor want to acknowledge them. Finally they ended up divorce after short marriages. So lets not become another statistic.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by smurfsmiff21:</div><div class="quote_body">My exposure is more than him. Our greatest difference is I have more experience in life as i went overseas and live on my own for 2 yrs. He has not travelled much in his life. Both of our circle of friends are different. My friends talks more about reality in life, whereas his friends talks more about leisure. I have no problem blending to his circle, but not the other way round.<br><br>He cares a lot for me and would do almost anything for me. On the other hand, I didnt make him feel importance in many ways. Apart from being compatible in interest, lifestyle, our thinking differs a lot. Maybe it is the prioritizing. He put me as first, but he feels i put him as 2nd. The problems come and cause the drift.<br><br>After we separated, I started to miss him and even revealed my thoughts for him. However, he seems to take a step back now. He doesnt want to tell me anything now.<br></div></blockquote>I support your ex by not going back to you, cos you do not treasure guys like your ex who cares for you so much but in the end was betray by gals like you who thinks so highly of yourself.<br><br>Since you do not know the importanace of accepting the person as he is and chose to keep listerning to your friends. You do not deserve someone gd at all. Sick and tired of gals like you who treat good guys like trash and want to take them back when you feel like it.<br><br>I am waiting to see the day when the person who you care and love so much for dumps you as cos he thinks you are so low class.<br><br>People like you should feel the hurt and pain the good guys suffer in order to know how it is like.<br></div>
