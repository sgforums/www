              <p>But good things between me and her just isnt happening after me kept on trying for so many years now. She is in another relationship (god, i hate that undeserving guy but another story another day.) and day in day out i am just sitting around my room, going to work and practically doing nothing but pinning on her. I hate this life, (its been a year since I last went out 1 on 1 with another girl)</p>
              <p>I have talked to her in the past, several times, we both agreed that we wouldnt be tgt anytime sooner and she treats me as a best friend.</p>
              <p>We work together almost everyday and we have lunch together almost everyday too. Recently for the past 2 months of so, her best friend joined us for lunch too and day after day I get to know her best friend too. Just a month ago,she told me her best friend is recently single and asked me to consider dating her best friend which I shurgged it off but then after she mention it several time and I have this itchy feeling inside me.</p>
              <p>But, date the best friend of the friend you love? It sounds weird to me...I don't know what to do, what's the first step to do if i were to pursue it., I cant ask my best friend to give me her best friend number or email address right? maybe I can but i'm afraid of being embarassed.</p>

              <p>So wat do u want now?  Continue waiting for this best fren of urs or tryin out dating tis new gal.  C'mon, dating is perfectly fine~! The purpose of dating is to let both parties <em>tryin out &amp; testin</em> their chemistry.  If it works, congrats.  At least it may keep ur mind away from ur best fren.  If it's not happening, then back to square one. </p>
              <p>The purpose of ur best fren tryin so hard to "promote" her best fren to u is bcos she doesnt wanna see u being single &amp; keep "waiting" for her.  It's probably stressing her out.  Since she is encouragin u to give it a try, then I see there's nothing wrong with askin her for her best fren's contact.  Or u can simply get her to arrange a group outing &amp; create a situation for u &amp; her best fren, then u can get her contacts urself.</p>

              <p>So wat do u want now?  Continue waiting for this best fren of urs or tryin out dating tis new gal.  C'mon, dating is perfectly fine~! <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">The purpose of dating is to let both parties <em>tryin out &amp; testin</em> their chemistry.  If it works, congrats.</span></strong>  At least it may keep ur mind away from ur best fren.  If it's not happening, then back to square one. </p>
              <p>The purpose of ur best fren tryin so hard to "promote" her best fren to u is bcos she doesnt wanna see u being single &amp; keep "waiting" for her.  It's probably stressing her out.  Since she is encouragin u to give it a try, then I see there's nothing wrong with askin her for her best fren's contact.  Or u can simply get her to arrange a group outing &amp; create a situation for u &amp; her best fren, then u can get her contacts urself.</p>

              <p>i agree with this sentence.</p>
              <p>since your love interest is "promoting" her best friend, it usually means she is okay for you to date her friend... or at least she thinks so. if she turns jealous and wants you instead, congratulations! if you and that friend turns out well, great! if both gals in the end wants you, bonus!</p>
              <p>since you and your best friend's relationship is good, just be frank and ask for the contact. email will be the best for it doesn't sound too "intimidating". start conversing from first; emails, second; sms, third; direct phone calls and then do meet-ups.</p>

              <p>Thx for the inputs peeps, appreciated.</p>
              <p>It is not a trap. Me and my best friend,we cannot be together.</p>
              <p>And yes, today I just got her email address! and I had a good chat with her.</p>
              <p>It was the best chat with a girl I ever had in a long while. I feel so rejuvenated! It is not those "sian1/2" replies which I get from my best friend but real actual conversation.
