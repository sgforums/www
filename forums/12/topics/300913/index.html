            <div class='col-md body'>it was ard dinnertime one evening. GAL was on the way home from school. after alighting from the bus, GAL started walking towards her flat. it had been a long day in school. dressed in a sleeveless blouse n denim skirt along wif a pair of slip-ons, GAL turned into the winding road that led to her block. walking along the pavement, she approached the carpark not knowing what was lying in wait for her...<br><br>meanwhile, 2 men were standing next to a parked van. they watched as GAL approached in their direction. just as GAL walked past the van, the 2 men put on their masks b4 pouncing at her from behind. one of them covered her mouth wif a cloth while the other lifted her legs off the ground. tgr, they carried the struggling GAL into the back compartment of the van. as the van sped off, the 2 men in the back compartment quickly went to work. they pinned the gal facedown n one of them began to tie up her hands behind her back. the other man gagged her mouth wif a piece of cloth. on top of tat, he strapped up her mouth wif muskin tape to ensure it was securely gagged. the 1st man then proceeded to tie up her legs b4 leaving her lying at a corner of the van.<br><br>after abt 15min, the van finally came to a stop. thru out tat time, the gal kept struggling hard to free herself n also tried to shout for help. she even tried to sit up but each time she did tat, the men would forcefully push her down. they even slapped her n warned her not to try to escape. when they reached their destination, the backdoor of the van opened. b4 letting the gal out of the van, 1 of the men pressed a cloth filled wif chlorofoam against her face. after a little struggle, the gal passed out. the men then carried her out of the van.<br><br>whatever happened after tat was realli unimagineable...after goodness knows how long, the gal finally regained consciousness. after regaining her composure, the gal found herself staring at a ceiling. she tried to get up from where she was only to discover to her horror tat she couldnt..it didnt take her long to realise tat the 3 men had bound her to a wooden bed. they had bound her hands n legs to the 4 corners of the bed. on top of tat, her mouth was still gagged wif the cloth n strapped shut wif muskin tape. wad was even more horrifying to her was tat she was TOTALLY NAKED!!! the men had carried her into tis unknown place, stripped all her clothes(including her undergarments) n tied her to the bed. the gal was completely horrified!!! she didnt noe wad to do...<br><br>finally the gal decided tat she couldnt possibly lie there n do nth...hence she began to struggle as hard as she could...she tugged, kicked n pulled at the ropes as hard as she could...she also tried to push the cloth out of her mouth..alas for her, no matter how hard she tried, she could nt get free...all her screams n shouts were reduced to mere muffles...she tried n tried until she had no energy left but to no success...tears began to roll down the gal's eyes...it was alredi very clear wad those men wanted...the gal knew she had to escape somehow or she would suffer in those crazy perverts' hands...yet no matter how hard she tried, she could nt escape...the gal could do nth except to lie there helpless, crying bitterly...<br><br>wad ever happened after tat is a foregone conclusion...the gal had to lie helplessly waiting for the 3 crazy perverts to appear...when they did, they stood ard her, laughing joyfully. looking angry n frightened, the gal muffled n struggled as hard as she could to get free...but again to no success...in the end, the 3 men took turns to 'enjoy' themselves wif her...while they 'enjoyed' themselves, the poor gal struggled n screamed muffledly in pain...this lasted almost 2 hrs!!!<br><br>finally at the end of the 2hrs or so, the men were at a corner toking among themselves. the poor gal who was realli crying bitterly nw...she juz laid there in tears, feeling cold n humiliated. moments later, a chlorofoam-filled cloth was again pressed against the gal's face, causing her to pass out...<br><br>the gal woke up again after sometime...this time she found herself lying on a bench beneath a block of flats near her home...looking ard her, she realised tat nth had been stolen from her...she was wearing her blouse n denim skirt n her slip-ons were on the ground next to her...those 3 men had put her clothes n undergarments back on for her while she was still unconscious b4 driving her to where she currently was...holding on to her lower abdomen which was still hurting, she got up n began to walk away slowly wif tears in her eyes...<br><br>Qn: if u were the gal, wad would u do after u got up n walk away slowly???<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>And she realized the 3 men were actually 3 best friends she had in secondary school, having a sadistic craving for the girl, yet wanted to get rid of those in the way right? Before they raped her they killed her family first right? Then the uncle took away the house and left her homeless right? Then she go stay in her other uncle's house, only to be raped daily right? Then go school kena raped by students and teachers right? Then kena robbed off her ang pow money right?<br><br>Worst Case Scenario! I like to imagine but dunwan it to happen! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

To live on or die.<br>There is no more juicy aftermath of daily raping by uncle and ang pow money stolen - thanks for the comic relief though.<br>All is gone, what you treasure in life. The question is how will she face it?<br><br>___<br><br>What would be more unimaginable?<br><br>Will it be the lost of a part of my body/emotionally or physically or the lost of my loved ones in unnatural deaths?<br><br>I would choose the latter.<br><br>Might be due to the fact that i went to this refugee camp in Thailand. And each refugees either reached Thailand alone or they have at least lost one of their loved ones. All 8500 refugees, about 85% have seen death, killings. 3600 are children.<br>They shared heart-wrenching testimonies. How they witnessed their parents, husbands and wives or even children got killed while they were helpless.<br><br>How they need to release their family members into the river in order to make it alive themselves.<br><br>One of the stories made me realise the reality of death and losing someone important to you. There and there were many of these stories.<br><br>'My brother was killed by the communist military, they continued to shoot at his dead body until it was smashed on the ground. I was unable to retrieve his whole dead body for burial. The military set off a grenade on his dead body.<br>His decomposed body sink on the ground.'<br><br>When you see the video clips of those girls being killed(gunshots) after being raped, you don't have to imagine much because it IS still happening in the jungle of Laos.<br><br>They have faced the unimaginable.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If i were the gal ?<br><br>First of all , i will take my sweet @ss time. I make a police report. I get tested... u know , standard operating procedure. Then i slowly track them down. Using whatever ways.. my body .. since its already been desecrated. N i let the thing die down.. for say.. 6 months to a year. Then i start to hunt them down one by one using ice pick and a chopper as my primary weapon. Give them 2 choices.
