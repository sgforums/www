            <div class='col-md body'>I boarded a bus and was rushing down to meet friends to have our dinner. The bus was a double decker bus and as usual, I took a seat in the above deck.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Then after a couple of stops and reveling in the songs played by my discman - I saw a butch coming up the stairs and walked towards an empty two seater. She stood there for a moment and looking towards the stairs and something tells me she is waiting for her stead - I was right.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>The lady, who was much taller than the butch sat inside and then the butch sat down. Obviously, being the usual me, such sight was common and I din even bother to take notice or even look at them. Although the uncle near them was giving them that kind of disapproving stare.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>It was only when the girl kept looking at the butch with such eyes - the stuff I learning about body language was telling me, in my mind, that these two were very loving as a lesbian couple - lots of theories, concepts and thoughts came up (Ok lar, I am just being myself aka Yunhaier.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> ) Still, things didn't really bother me.<br><br>It was only when the girl arched over the butch and kissed her and i was surprised by her suddenly actions. (I was behind her). I tried to look away and focus on the lyrics of the song I am listening to.<br><br>Things got carried away.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>The girl started nibbling on the butch's neck, more kisses, hugs, cuddling and lovely gazing and made me rather uncomfortable. The girl's eye never even dart anywhere away from the butch - the both of them were lost deeply in the world of their own.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Until when I got down my bus, did I managed to evade successfully.<br><br>I counselled people, friends and you yuan ren whenever the situations arise about BGR, however, when it comes to Gay relationship - I mean don't curse, spit, or mind these relation, but I don't really advice friends on how to maintain them or deal with them.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>I think most religion condemn homosexual relationship. For me, this opposition goes from promiscuity, prostitution, group sex, sexual abuse of children, rape, and any sex that did not have some spiritual basis - Both homosexuals and heterosexuals have been guilty of these acts. So sexual activity between homosexual could be spiritual and not plain lust.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>I know its 5.30 am in the morning and you people might be wondering why the hell am I not sleeping. Well, my aspiration comes at night mah. Could post longer by explaining why homosexual exist in spiritual explaination, but I think many will be skipping this post by then. Ok lar - end my nonsense here.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>P.S: If anyone could quote any religious verse, etc that speaks about Homosexual relations would be welcome here. I would like to know what different religions has to say about this issue.<br><br>Cheers</div>

You mentioned that nobody is born homosexual and God didn't create them either, so must be external factors that shaped them, so I am just saying babies with physical defects ain't part of God's intention too - but neither majority of them are them subjected to external factors.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> There is no definite answer, very subjective.
