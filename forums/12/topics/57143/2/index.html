            <div class='col-md body'>Regardless of whatever choice made - once there is a baby - WHATSOEVER decision one made will be WRONG. So why debate over an issue where no decision is correct? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> People will consider and pick the choice with the least degree of 'wrongness' (subjective and personal preception).<br><br>Say your girlfriend is having your kid and you have to marry her because she chose to keep it... unless you are being a bus-stard, you would. By then again, in reality, how many short gun marriage do actually last? Out of ten, as high as six/seven will fail. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You marry not because at the moment when you propose, you convince and tell yourself that this lady in front of you would be the girl you ever want to spend all your days with. You married because you have no choice. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><strong>Love must be bounded willingly. Liability is NOT an effect of love</strong>. Humans are greatly influenced by moral, values and senses, therefore you are bounded by responsibility, not by cupid's arrow. Yes, you can put in your effort to make sure your kid grows up straight, healthy and useful - but conscious effort may not have equal result to the building of love. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You may think I am deviating from whether to abort or give birth question, however when the girl decide to give birth - you have to marry her, unless you willing chose to be labelled as a jerk-ass irresponsible creep. I am more concern over the aftermath. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>P.S: Recently a friend just got married, shotgun case. Piangz, I see liao... aiya people's business, forget it man. Anyway people, wanna screw please use protection for god sake. Do it for the sake your own karma, if not for your gf. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Options for u to choose:<br>I dunno ur age.. but guess u r still studying....<br><br>1)Abortion - Because u urself is still a liabity... U still survive on ur parents, and u dun have the ability, time and effort to take care of a baby. U may regret it.... u may not... Depends on how u look at it. Yes it mayb an innocent life. But lets face up to reality. U need to feed him.. change the diapers.. milk powder.. toys.. books, education.. all these need money.... Can love give u all these stuff? How? u Sell love for money? Can't right...<br><br>2) Give birth and get married - If this guy already complete his NS matured, really love u &amp; faithful, have a stable income and can take care of u.. great! If u both can afford to buy ur own house, Great! U can live with ur in-laws... but there will be conflicts.. make it worse if ur mother in law is fussy, attention gaining, shrew,... blah blah.. It will eventually lead to quarrels between u and ur hubby and strain ur relationship.. if u r matured and know how to handle... congratz... Or if r Mother in law is a god send, Its a blessing<br><br>3) Give birth and be a unwed mum - Ya.. takes a lot of courage to do that.... No more LIFE for u... ur world revolves around ur child.. noone to share ur burden for u except ur family... (and how r u going to convince them in the first place) Mayb u'll need to quit ur studies and find a job to ease the financial burden... In future,u may find someone u love, and intends to get married. But even if he can accept ur child, will his family accept? YeS? Congratz! No? then how? When ur child grows up, when he/she ask abt his dad? wat r u going to say? cook up a story or the truth? How to say it so that u r not going to hurt the little one?<br><br>4) Give birth and give up for adoption - Give birth after 10 months of labour... Maybe it's good for the baby... but after going through 10over hours of labour pain... and seeing ur flesh and blood taken away... and u'll not know who adopted ur child.. how is he getting on? U'll have to FORGET u had a child... and never to claim it back.. can u bear?<br><br>Thats all..... i have to say.... decision is up to u....<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>not necessary that the mother raise the child, if the mother cannot or don't have the means to raise the child due to financial or other problems, get someone to adopt it. There are couples who are into adopting childs as they either can't give birth or they can't afford to get pregnant due to work or health problems. More often than not, they are more financially capable to provide a better life for the baby but make sure they are those caring types and not those bo-chup type...<br><br>Killing is wrong, no matter how justified it is.</div>
