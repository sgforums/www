You have certain grounds for your doubts, but the main issue is not to overreact for the time being?<br><br>If you do mind about the issue, just talk it over with him in a calm manner... If not just let the matter drops... Try not to resort to too extreme behaviours based on such doubts without a strong ground....<br><br>Regards.</div>

Once I am secured, knowing other people of the opposite gender doesn't matter because I won't run away - (this is merely a thought). But she cannot do that because I am not her, I cannot control her, but I can control myself.</span><br><br>Whether he can succeed in his control doesn't matter.

Usually, during this phrase, I won't emphasise too much on this option because you will likely to trash things without much physical evidence. Not saying you must purposely source for that evidence to dis-credit him and release hell - but paper cannot shield against fire for long - therefore I suggest option II first.<br><br>II) Take time. Taking time isn't taking serious time to handle your possible crisis. A good positive option is to dump in a little more effort on your part, without the the suspicion and keep the relationship going. Trust me, the more suspicious you are, the more defensive he will get. The more natural and 'innocent' you are - the more relax he is, the more mistakes he will commit unknowingly (if something fishy is going on) and you would have see the whole picture.<br><br>Cheers</div>
