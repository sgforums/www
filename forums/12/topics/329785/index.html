              <p>Suggest that you find a new job and leave that company. Same situation here as I'm going to transfer to another dept too, also cause a lot of unhappiness in between.</p>
              <p>However, for me I got no choice but to transfer and I can't quit. Cos my current job is already reach bottel neck and my part-time study starting soon. I need the money in order to support my study. If you are not caught into the situation like what I'm facing now. Better just find another new job and change the environment.</p>
              <p>If you decided to stay on, then try to accept them and try to change the entire situation as to benefit to your end. Very difficult to change people mind set or change their attitude towards you within a short period of time. But It can be done. Just that you will takes a while.</p>
              <p>Before you decide anything, perhaps go for a short relaxing place and think carefully about it. Don't make a wrong decision or else you will regret.</p>
              <p>Good luck to you. ^_^</p>

              <p>Hi</p>
              <p>Perhaps you are giving up to easily to those who eagerly wishes to see you leave the company?</p>
              <p>Basically I feel that if they want to play this type of game with you why not do it back to them? As you are new to the department, definitely those who have been there for sometime will feel weird having someone from another department to be in charge of them. Perhaps you should try to be less formal with them have perhaps take the initiative to get to know your subordinates better.</p>
              <p>Anyway hope you be able to feel better after the weekend.</p>
              <p>Work hard and don't give up easily!</p>

              <p>Perhaps u r like a square peg in a round hole. Ur personality traits do not suit the culture of this dept. Perhaps u uphold certain principles too strongly. Worse of all, u have lost grit and will to continue assimilation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Give it up, change dept or find another job. There's nothing wrong with u, find something that u can adapt to and vice versa. It will be much easier doing something in a happier environment.</p>
