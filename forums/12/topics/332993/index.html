              <p><br>in the 1st place, NEVER SIGN UP ANY THING FOR ANYONE unless there's a black and white between u n the fella b4 that. with that pc of black and white, can bring the fella to court if he deny anything.</p>
              <p>but y she foolish until sign up line for his dad? her signature, her add. if she dun pay, she's gonna keep gettin lawyer's letter and later, blacklisted and alot of things cannot be done if she wants to sign up for other lines.</p>
              <p>she will have to learn this lesson that not everyone (even bf/hubby/bestfrens/family) can be trusted.</p>
              <p>he SAY he no $$$.. SAY nia... u see if u say u got no $$, wad will she do? for herself, she really cant do anything but to terminate the line n after that, do ntng with that jerk.</p>
              <p>for u, as a fren, do stand by her. that's the best u can do now.</p>

              <p>Keep talking to your friend, get her to cut off all contact with him. No reason he should be still getting money from her. Even as friends it's too much to always keep taking money from your friend.</p>
              <p>Like somebody else has said, either use the SIM card or terminate, no point incurring further charges.</p>
              <p>Ultimately, end it and move on. As friends, maybe be around with her so she won't have chance to be lonely and get exploited by that guy agian.</p>
              <p>If it were up to me, I'd and any friends involved would pay for the termination of the both the spare SIM card and her current SIM card, then get her to register a new number.</p>
