This is 2006 already, my dear.  Guys asking girl pals out to cruise with them is No biggie, &amp; it's Not a given that just because they ask to cruise, means that they're interested in the girls!<br><br>Many of my friends are guys, &amp; we go out to dinner, or just cruise, &amp; we're still platonic friends.  Thinking way too much or speculating way too much puts you at risk of spoiling what could be a great friendship.<br><br>People doubt that platonic friendships exist, but perhaps because I don't think so much nor read so much into it, I've managed to keep my friendships platonic &amp; long term  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Don't read too much into things.

From 60 kg in primary school, i jumped to 100 plus post-JC time.<br><br>However, i did meet one guy, a punjabi fellow. Just a quick digression, punjabis are those north indians from punjab (duh), who have naturally colored eyes, are milky fair and are TALL!

It's one thing to be fat, yet pleasant looking and another to be fat AND ugly. Dress to hide your flaws, yet flaunt your plus points. Take care of your hair and skin.

This is 2006 already, my dear.  Guys asking girl pals out to cruise with them is No biggie, &amp; it's Not a given that just because they ask to cruise, means that they're interested in the girls!<br><br>Many of my friends are guys, &amp; we go out to dinner, or just cruise, &amp; we're still platonic friends.  Thinking way too much or speculating way too much puts you at risk of spoiling what could be a great friendship.<br><br>People doubt that platonic friendships exist, but perhaps because I don't think so much nor read so much into it, I've managed to keep my friendships platonic &amp; long term  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Don't read too much into things.  Sometimes, the best way to take things is at surface level.  You dig too deep, you may lose your balance &amp; fall into the hole.<br><br>FeowFeow<br><br></div></blockquote>erm its the way he acts also.  he wouldnt flirt or compliment any other girl in my presense and occasionally complimented on my appearance.  he said im rare species cos he thinks girls like me (meaning my personality) is rare. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  lately hes acting a little flirtatious to me i think, i dunno if im overimagining things though.</div>
