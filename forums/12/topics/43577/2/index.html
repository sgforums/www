You are sensible enough to understand and make your own decision now because your feelings and thoughts are cleared from confusion and filtered from delusion. I don't believe in giving people one more after first and the only chance - chances are, he would still be the same.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Think about this: 'Wah... so now then feel gulity? Then what about the time when he was in the process of fuilfilling his lust? What was he thinking? Does guilt ever run across his mind? Or his mind is being control by his d|ck and lost his so called sense?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You are intelligent lady and mistress of your own fate - you KNOW what to do and how you should handle it THIS TIME ROUND. I won't be naggy this round, because I said enough the previous time and experience had taught you the meaning behind the mask of your ex.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Yunnie's Precautionary words : He will try other ways to make you forgive him, etc - this is only the beginning. Ignore and avoid TO THE END. Tell him this: if he ever camp at your house, wait for you, etc (or any situation where you can't avoid him because he is there and force you to speak with him.)<br><br>"Since that day, the *name of the guy* I know is dead.* AND WALK OFF.

He will definitely let you go, if you scream.)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Cheers</div>

Cos you're still in the midst of nursing your hurt and hatred.<br><br>I have observed from your few topics including the lastest topic you have.

Becos they leave us witha  hurt, we hate them for bringing us the hurt. Forgetting is one of the best way to overcome hatred and also one of the most difficult one. EVeryone has memories, no matter gd or bad. Memories are the hardest to forget.<br><br>I was hurt deeply by my best fren in my sec sch days and then by my ex when i was in army. All these cause me to haf hatred in one way towards them. But believe me, time will heal things and u will learn more things and see more gd ppl. Get new and happy memories to replace old and sad ones.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>For some years now i haf no contact with the 2 person tt hurt me alot. Spend most of my time on finding new frens and helping them  out. Now i haf gd memories of my frens to kick away those bad things. Come to think abt it, i was silly in a way too.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>I am sure u are a sensibel person. So u will do the rite things.
