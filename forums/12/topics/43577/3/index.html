Becos they leave us witha  hurt, we hate them for bringing us the hurt. Forgetting is one of the best way to overcome hatred and also one of the most difficult one. EVeryone has memories, no matter gd or bad. Memories are the hardest to forget.<br><br>I was hurt deeply by my best fren in my sec sch days and then by my ex when i was in army. All these cause me to haf hatred in one way towards them. But believe me, time will heal things and u will learn more things and see more gd ppl. Get new and happy memories to replace old and sad ones.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>For some years now i haf no contact with the 2 person tt hurt me alot. Spend most of my time on finding new frens and helping them  out. Now i haf gd memories of my frens to kick away those bad things.
