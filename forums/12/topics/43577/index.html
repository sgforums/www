            <div class='col-md body'>Hi friends,<br>got second chapter now. i just recieve this email from that bastard ex of mine:<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>I've been wrecked with guilt for the past few days knowing how much I have hurt u by treating u like that. I really believed that u wanted to go to bed with me just for the act alone and not because of other reasons....from the hp msgs to the icq msgs, I was rather sure it was only that. If I had known u were hoping for something else I wouldn't even go over ur place because I know its impossible.<br><br>I most certainly did not see u as a prostitute but as a willing partner in this act......I saw it as though u had needs and I had needs so we agreed to satisfy those needs. I dunno how I can make it up to you for this terrible sin I have committed. I have written this mail with the utmost care not to upset u with any words....but I know the act of sending u the mail is upsetting enough but I need to tell you these feelings I have.<br><br>I really wish to remain friends with you. I beg for your forgiveness. I know it will take u very long before u are able to do so.....but I hope u would drop me a mail or msg when u are willing to talk to me again. I promise never to treat you like that ever again.</strong></blockquote>what does this mean if you are the one that have sent it? is it a sincere apology or another mean of getting my trust so that he can fcuk me again? should i ignore it or be more forgiving (by forgiving it doesn't mean i forget what he did, just that i dun blame him anymore)?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>anyway back to the topic..i suppose both of u are very close to each other in the past..to explain his behaviour pls allow me to use an analogy..<br><br>let's suppose yr ex is a baseball player on the field..he's now in 3rd base..on the verge of reaching the 4th (ie the last stage) he suddenly gets called off the pitch..he'd be pissed and thinking: &amp;%*, so close to the finish and i must get off rite now..well i'd just as well finish the last run n after that call it a day..so he runs to the end and later apologises to his furious manager for his disobedience.<br><br>i guess it's pretty much the same here..he could be thinking that he's missed out a part of the r/s if he din have sex with you. That's prob why he's done all this stuff and is now saying sorry for doing so. Sorta like fufilling his own dream/desire/watever u call that.<br><br>i'm sure u should know what u plan to do..just wanna let u see the other side of his stand.</div>
