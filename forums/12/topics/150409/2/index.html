This is self derived and not imparted knowledge or law passed down from others because my cosmic lesson is definitely different from yours, so the word <span style="font-style: italic;">'particular' </span>is not applicable in this case.<br><br>You may feel that something <span style="font-style: italic;">may </span>be wrong with you... easily falling in love and wondering if what you are feeling is Love. To me, such fleeting emotional moments may not justify the miracles of Love, but of course, only time will let you understand eventually, whether either one of the girls you fell for... would have an everlasting impact in your life or not. (Although most of them will probably turn out to be like anyone else).<br><br>Then, your initial cosmic lesson begins its course and you will gradually form and shape your own definition of Love. Good or bad - you will have some idealogy of love and probably apply them in the future, and at the same time, constantly moulding, evolving and changing them according to what your experience teaches you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>
