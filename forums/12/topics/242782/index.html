            <div class='col-md body'>If Singapore doesnÂ’t give recognition to a straight A* in the<br>sciences and mathematics student, who would?<br><br>True, scholars must be of the crÃ¨me of the crop to qualify themselves, but why is getting a B in the school with no B+ for Language Arts the greatest hurdle for a student to cross? The student has excelled in all areas of sciences and mathematics, and his passion for those subjects are undeniable. So, why is getting a B for Language Arts (in IP schools thereÂ’s no English as a subject) going to hinder him all the way in research programmes, overseas attachments, scholarship applications and even a minor thing such as specialized training for personal skills?<br><br>He, who deserves to be recognized, needs to be recognized. Singapore needs to realize that we need to keep our local talents, well, local, instead of focusing on getting more foreign talents.<br><br>His CCA records are stellar, science and technology activities are aplenty, and so, the only reason for his failure is his grade for Language Arts. Is that truly an accurate measure in giving him opportunities to further his knowledge? Knowledge is driven by passion. Without passion nothing would be done to the best of his capabilities. Is that one grade going to affect his life, one subject that isnÂ’t even remotely linked to science, being so literature-based?<br><br>Yes, absolute scores should be considered, but what use is there if we award prestigious programmes to someone who has the caliber, but has a lack of commitment and passion? Are we not going to waste our nationÂ’s resources?<br>Passion can be cultivated. That is true, but one can never be sure. Is passion with 4A* in Mathematics, Physics, Biology sufficient to secure a scholarship? In Singapore, no. The world is evolving into a knowledge based economy, and if Singapore doesnÂ’t appreciate such talents, other nations would! Why are we so backward in our thinking that results are everything? We need a change, as this would retard SingaporeÂ’s economic growth by increased brain drain.<br><br>Our local talents are clearly better than many other foreign talents. We have a first rate education system, a first rate workfare scheme, so why are our talents going overseas, effectively losing to foreign talents? Does this prove that SingaporeÂ’s education has failed? Our society is not flexible?<br>Preserving our talents is the least the Government can do. Increasing population to 6.5 million, but how many are really born and raised in Singapore? Is that the best way for economic growth, to shun local talents and to attract increasing numbers of foreign talents?<br><br>If Singapore doesnÂ’t realize this mistake, other nations are going to benefit Â– in ways more than economic and social. Why canÂ’t we produce Nobel Laureates? Are Singaporeans inferior?<br><br>We donÂ’t have the environment to cultivate leading Singapore-born researchers. This is crucial, as the mark of the nation is judged by its national R&amp;D efforts. So why canÂ’t we allow people with the passion to flourish? Must we step aside for those with perfect GPAs without a single hint of passion and interest in the fields that we are so deeply passionate about?<br><br>Are we, the second class citizens?<br><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong><span class="large"></span></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Is passion non-existent in scholarship holders?<br><br>There are many JC-level scholarships available to cater for the studentsÂ’ interest; however, most scholarships are through the nomination by the school only. As I understand, the scholarshipÂ’s selection boards are very stringent about the academic results of the scholars. When schools nominate, it is customary for them to choose those who are ranked the first few in standard (due to criteria set by scholarship organization), hence resulting in these students being offered many scholarships, while those who are slightly lower ranked, even with great passion and interest, are ignored. This deprives these students the chance to further their real-world knowledge as scholarships are usually research-based.<br><br>Eventually, the scholars are those who do not have a burning passion for that field of study, while getting the Â“research grantsÂ” of a few thousand over their JC years. Is this a signal that the scholarship recruiting is flawed? TaxpayersÂ’ money is being spent on people who have no clear future in the study that they are offered the scholarship. This is not an optimal way of nurturing talents to assist and replace the current generation. True, it is irrefutable that results is an important factor in scholarship application, as that shows their management skills, their determination for work, responsibility in taking pride for the school work and so on. But isnÂ’t it more true that a future, an illustrious career, in that agency which offers the scholarship more practical? It is ironic that after utilizing the Â“grantsÂ” given to them, the scholars leave that field of study to pursue something else. Not only it is a waste of resources nurturing these scholars, it deprives those with potential the opportunity to succeed in the area of their passion.<br><br>Students, with or without passion for a subject, are judged by results. It is impossible for students to appeal, to voice out their opinions to the school management level since it would make minimal difference. The school would select those with the greatest chance of securing the scholarship and the requirements for nominating potential scholars are based largely on academic results, reasons being that their passion and interest would be judged through interviews. But doesnÂ’t that leave a whole lot who would perform much better in the latter disadvantaged?<br><br>Passion for a particular subject can be more difficult to judge than absolute scores, however, it is probably a more accurate gauge for selecting scholars. They are being given various opportunities to work in world-class institutes, and it defeats the purpose of that if they are only able to perform well academically and nothing else. Judging a student purely through academic grades is like judging a book by its cover, something that we know we shouldnÂ’t be doing in a modern 21st century cosmopolitan society.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>if you think scholarship boards judge students purely based on academic results you are totally wrong. yes perfect grades are a requirement but after potential scholars are selected, they will further assess the person based on his or her passion and other non-academic areas. people with less than perfect a'level grades HAVE gotten the president's scholarship before.<br><br>from the point of view of the scholarship board, it is pointless to award a student with burning passion but whom cannot excel in his studies. so what if he likes science? if he cant do 'basic' a'level or o'level science it only means two things. 1: he is lazy and has a bad attitude towards work 2: he lacks the aptitude for science and will be a useless researcher.<br><br>what if the student is passionate, got straight As for his sciences but a B for english? yes the scholarship boards will choose him IF and ONLY IF there isnt a single other student out there in this world who is passionate, got straight As for sciences AND english, which is quite rare.<br><br>anyway if the student is truly passionate about something, he or she will work as hard as humanly possible to make bloody sure he or she does well or, at least, make sure the school nominates him or her for scholarships.</div>
