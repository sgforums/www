            <div class='col-md body'>This is a very dangerous spot you are putting yourself into. For what? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Whatever it is, it is still your decision on whether you want to keep your distance from that friend of yours or sink deeper and suffer the consequences later on. And mind you, it may not be losing only one friend, you may lose your wife, and perhaps reputation if ever her family side (if any) got to know about this.<br><br>One way to stay closer to your wife is not to concede to the fact that she always watches TV and not care much about you. I'm not sure on how she treats you as you didn't mention it, but, do not always assume that she doesn't care. One way is to have a good serious talk with her. After all, YOU are the man of the house. YOU take the initiative to communicate with your wife.<br><br>Where's the love you once had with your wife when you two were dating? Revive back that feelings you have for each other again by doing something sweet for her - like buying her flowers, bringing her to some romantic places you both had been before, or to the movies.. etc.. It's those little things that will help create some sparks again in the marriage. Also, don't forget to communicate often. The lesser you communicate, the further your relationship with your wife will drift apart.<br><br>Remember, your commitment is to your wife. And ONLY your wife. Learn to love her and cherish her.</div>

If you're afraid both of you might overstep the line one day, set some limitations to things... Like what you should be doing and what are the things both of you should avoid. Set the lines CLEAR. Tone down a bit on the activities you're having with her if need to? But I don't think it's really neceassary to start avoiding her altogether at this point...<br><br>As for your wife... How long have you been married with her? Any kid? Maybe it's time for you to RE-LIVE the relationship you're having with her... It might be true that sometimes a partner might be more interested in some other activities than yourself.. But that certainly doesn't mean you can't take up the initiative to work on your relationship....? A tea that has turned cold on the table, you can heat it up... Don't have to leave it cold and bitter... Leaving things just the way they are and acknowledging little responsibilities to things would only cause the relationship to drift apart with time....?<br><br></div>

Though we are both married, we talk and share a lot.  Can talk anything under the sun. We share our sorrows , happiness and many personal things.  I feels that she cares for me.  When I am down, she will also try to talk to me and give a pat on the shoulder.  Vice versa. To an extend, I realized I talk to her more than talking to my wife.  We also go out quite often (just 2 of us).  I will buy her gifts and meals.  She will buy me tie, watch, makan etc.  Our actions and behavior are just like a any couple.  At times, she will even be upset with me if I dun treat her well.<br><br>When I am overseas, I will email her daily.  During nights and weekends, we will sms one another.  Occassionally, we will go out for a walk or for a meal.  More recently, I feel so attached to her that I feel uncomfortable not seeing her for just one day!<br><br>As for my wfe, we dun talk much.  She is also not sensitive type.  Think she is more interested in her tv programme than talking to me.<br><br>On one hand, I am very fortunate to have such a good friend.  On the other hand, I sensed that I begin to like her.  Dun get me wrong, we did not engaged in sexual related activity.  I dun want to break up her family but I can't control my emotion at times.<br><br>Can someone give me some constructive advice what I should do?<br></div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Do you realise that all these thingy should be channelled to your wife, in which it would probably work towards a fulfilling marriage?<br><br>You are providing excuses to yourself to avoid putting the commitment into your own chosen marriage.
