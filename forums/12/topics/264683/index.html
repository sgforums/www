Your own character will affect whether u accomplish it or not , and the ability to keep it going even with the sh|t pilling down on you. Your passion is what drives u like someone said here. What seperates us from the achievers andthe losers is our passion to make it through.<br><br>No one can totally be in anothers shoes and feel how they feel. But they can try to be in anothers shoes and help based on thier own experience n understanding of the situation. No one can totally 100%  understand how u totally feel. But by not opening up an allowing urself to recieve the good will and comfort of others will prove that u are unable to accept the reality of things and chose to shut yourself in. And in the end , you suffer why everyone looks on.<br><br>I try to help others..  so hopefully..  when karma comes.. and it will... it wont give me too big an @ss whopping..   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
