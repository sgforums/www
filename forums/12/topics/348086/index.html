              <p>You have to first make it clear that you are in no way attempting to get him into trouble for what he's doing and that you'll be understanding and non-disciplinary with what he's doing.</p>
              <p>The most important thing is to educate him on the dangers of unprotected sex and the health consequences of smoking. Speak to him about peer pressure as well as that is usually the cause of such behaviour. The sex isn't really an issue because he's at least using a condom so I'd be more worried about the smoking. Hopefully it's just a phase and won't become an addiction.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ok. If your brother is those very independent type, you should trust he knows what he is doing. My advice will be sit him down, talk to him properly and ask him what is he doing with his life. Smoking and sex isn't really that serious compared to stealing, fighting etc.</div>

              <p>dont get so worked up la.... it's just part and parcel for growing up</p>
              <p>i started smoking when i was 13....that doesnt mean anything. Im pretty much a social smoker.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Instead of trying to force him to quit, why not have some words with him.. tell him that you know he has been smoking.. asks him not to smoke too much.... the more you force him the more he is not willing to quit. Educate him the right way, and not by force or threaten (to send him to boys' home or call the police.. dont be stupid). </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for the condom thing, be glad he is using condoms. Just hope the girl is above 16.. For this, this is much more of a concern to me because what if the girl is pregnant. Do discuss this with him. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>

              <p>There is actually nothing much you can do, except to nag him.</p>
              <p>Be there when he gets into serious trouble. Otherwise, he is on his own. Wish him well.</p>
              <p>He may turn out to be a great guy, or a jailbird. You take care of yourself, so that you may take care of others.</p>
