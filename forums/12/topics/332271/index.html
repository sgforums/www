              <p>Then take situations into your own hands. LEARN to differentiate between the good guys and bad. There are a lot of good books available in the library on dating. I read online stuff too, but upon comparison, I realize the more sensible and workable stuff are in those books. You can check the copyrights to see when the books are published to see if the books are recent. Else generally, the dynamics of attraction does not deviate far.</p>
              <p>Socialize more and think about breaking out of your usual social circle to meet more friends. For example, if you like guys who are helpful and kind, try joining a volunteer group. I do not think it's easy to find good guys in clubs. Note: I do not mean there aren't good guys there, just that it is not easy. So the people whom you mix around with do matter. Of course, the first and main priority must be to make frens larh. If you go there as if you have a motive, people can sense it and will be turned off. There's nothing more than a heavy agenda that turns people off, so just enjoy and have fun. Good guys like to be known for who they are, not as if they are some special candidate for a marriage interview that they did not intend to go to in the first place! Then when sparks occur, it'll be a natural process. Also, it is much safer when you socialize in groups, you get to see how a guy behave among others, how he treats them and how he treats you amg them. These are things a guy would not tell you and even if he did, it would be hard to assess its accuracy because there are chances that a guy might lie. A guy fren once told me, believe only abt 50% of what a guy tells you, take the rest with a pinch of salt until he matches up with his actions consistently over a period of time. That is why it is important to pace oneself and keep in constant contact on and off instead of just plunging right into a relationship while desire blinds you. Women tend to go into their "feel" mode and think that a guy is right for them when he's not. And when women are emotionally invested, they tend to brush away all the little warning signs they have seen, ignore and forget, and help give the guy excuses in their mind. Instead of noting the warning signs, they keep reasoning them away by looking at a guy's good points ONLY. But they fail to remember traits like cheating for example, is enough to overthrow all the other good points unless they are contented to have a cheating boyfriend for their life partner.</p>
              <p>Your case is not unique. There are many modern women now facing this problem. My fortune teller also says the same thing. However, I'm coming to believe that it is easier and easier for fortune teller to dish out the same prediction to women because this is a growing phenomenon amg us women. The only way to go around this? I believe is to get savvy and to give the good guys out there their deserving chance. So pace yourself, give all of them the same amt of time to see if good and bad patterns come out. Sometimes you might be surprise to find the guys you are initially attracted to are jerks and those that don't arouse much interest at first, turns out to be really wonderful and attractive, over time.</p>

              <p>Also, I think pretty girls should all the more focus on their virtues and strength instead of their looks to attract the right guys. Because especially the prettier you are, you're gonna attract the bad guys too, who are in for nothing other than looks, and of course finding ways and means to land you in bed, in the name of "love".</p>
              <p>It might be helpful to examine all the guys you have met and how you meet under what circumstances. And how are the guys generally like in certain groups. I believe then you'll be able to find a pattern and change your method to avoid meeting the wrong guys again.</p>
