              <p>Demon Bane and Aquatic Crystal,</p>
              <p>Thanks mate. I just think that we live in the most wonderful place, the tropical weather is warm all year round, the food is excellent and there are cheap hawker area to hang out, yet we just don't know how to appreciate the opportunities for social life in sg. Everybody is busy with work and family.</p>
              <p>I miss the time when I was in my 20s, when all my peers just graduated and started with their new jobs. Those days, they call me out for yam cha, we play badminton/tennis/futsal/squash during the weekends, friday nights we go clubbing and after sunday church service, we go for lunch. Nowadays, all these friends have migrated overseas, some grown distance away and the rest I lost touch.</p>
              <p>I try to change myself, exercise, buy new and nicer clothes, groom myself and be more gentleman but its still hard to find friends, these days. As I have said, I even took up language classes, diploma courses and get involve in church ministries (of course I am serving and I not expect anything back). Still my social life is a frigid zero.</p>
              <p>Hopefully I find new frens in Oz. There are a migrant community there, a lot of young people who come to work and study. So they are away from their comfort zone, I am hoping that these people will be more inclined to make friends and if fate has its way, I am hoping to find a life partner there.</p>

              <p>You are right, I need to relax, or my "perceived neediness" will chase other people away. However, I also cannot sit back and not do nothing. I need to meet people, motion creates opportunities but also creates frustrations. I need to find a way to meet people and be a Yes Man. Get involve in more activities. It will obviously be more frustrating for me because I know I will witness politics and rejection but its all part and parcel of the learning process. We never stop learning.</p>
              <p>I shouldn't try too hard but relaz, that I agree with you. However, I need to strike the balance, I also must try. I am an ambasaddor for myself, I need to go out there to network or else I will forever become a caveman.</p>

              <p>You don't leave a place to escape, you leave for opportunities. You 
                      have to be clear what lies ahead for you in Australia and what it is 
                      that you are looking for. Most people I know, either move for a career 
                      or for a change in lifestyle.</p>
              <p>A career is usually a man's 
                      priority, that is why I have many friends who emigrated to a foreign 
                      country solely because of career opportunities. It's like where I 
                      work in, our interviews are on a global basis, meaning most of the interview 
                      candidates are flown in from all over the world for the career 
                      opportunity. Many are extremely willing to move across borders or 
                      continents once hired. I was initially amazed at the willingness of so 
                      many people to relocate, especially when most of them are in their 30s 
                      and 40s and have a family and children back home.</p>
              <p>And also, a career isn't simply a job, it is your foothold and path in the 
                      industry you're working in. In a foreign country with a slow moving 
                      economy, it might be difficult for an immigrant to gain a foothold in 
                      the industry unless he is highly skilled in the field. We can also be 
                      contented with a simple job but a lot of problems will come in if we 
                      lose our job one day in the foreign country. Without an established 
                      career, it is very difficult to gain a new employment as a foreigner.</p>
              <p>Perhaps you simply want a change in lifestyle. But you might be 
                      suprised to hear that most of my friends who moved for a change in 
                      lifestyle moved <strong>back</strong> to their country of origin, instead of 
                      emigrating to a foreign country. The reason why it usually doesn't 
                      happen vice verse is because realistically, we do not know what exactly 
                      is a foreign country offering to its inhabitants. If it is just to try 
                      out because we're discontented with what we currently have, we're taking
                       a gamble.</p>
              <p>I'm not discouraging you from moving, in fact I think 
                      it is something you can consider. If it isn't for a career or for 
                      something definite, just take it as an opportunity for a life 
                      experience. Singapore is extremely small and we only have one life ;-) 
                      So we should take the chance to see what's out there. Well, a foreign 
                      country will most probably not going to be a bed of roses or a greener 
                      pasture but the experience is usually amazing. There are many who have 
                      chosen to stay overseas but even if you finally decide to return to 
                      Singapore afterall, the experience is usually worth it.</p>
              <p>Who knows we might learn to appreciate Singapore after understanding how things are like in the other parts of the world.</p>

              <p>Shrodingers Cat,</p>
              <p>I tried. I went to many church ministries, even went for mission trip. Unfortunately, I made few friends there, we're just too busy doing god's work. I do not want to change church, people will start to ask me why I come from this church to another church. Some churches don't like this, they label us as church hoppers. Anyhow, I am close to my cell group leader, he is one of my close friends, I don't want to disappoint him by leaving to another church (he being a nice guy would most likely say its ok but for sure he will feel sad). However, leaving to another country, is entirely another matter: He will understand.</p>

              <p>I have tried and exhausted everything I know in Sg. I attempted to organize class reunions but many didn't turn up. I took up diploma courses in an attempt to meet more people, but instead people were too busy making $$$. I even went for language classes.  </p>

              <p>well if u got yer pr and u have sisters to look after yer parents daily in spore then its ok for u to immigrate.</p>
              <p>however parents are not allowed to immigrate due to their age factor.in australia, u need a master degree to do what is generally classified as spore diploma level jobs in oz.their technology is low grade...some terribly unsafe from my experience.but if are into qantas airlines and have a cert or license that they dont have and they cant get it easily  then it should easy to get $80,000/year salary or a $70k/year salary even as a mere technician .but what i have met are people from india...somehave masters degree in accounting from oz and ended up as taxi drivers in rural towns after being in city melbourne n sydney fer 2 years.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>their jobs are kinda substandard due to no technology transfer in the past from most developed countries so dont be surprised everything is manual labour intensive methods in oz.</p>
              <p>but best thing would be their salary as even their low grad job pay $40k/year at least for those vietnamese 20year old kids who dun speak a single word of english.most of them immigrated over a few years ago with their parents to do those jobs that no oz would do.those vietnamese who immigrated after the vietnam war are either now degree holders,own their own homes and live more comfortably than any rich educated singaporean.</p>
              <p>however the ausies have often been known to torture asians under their employment.i have observed quite a few of them singaporeans or asians seem to exhibit great anger and feelings of being&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;clobbered in the past and now feel angry at the world kinda attitude!</p>
              <p>i have been here like 3 years and i have my own business due to the internet age,,,,if it wasnt for the internet...i would surely be turned to dust a long time ago.</p>
              <p>the temp in oz is 42C in adelaide and 40c in melbourne  yesterday....its way hotter than thailand.the cities are expensive and most claim that they have to pay alot for little expenses which i often get that reply.....it might be expensive and maybe jobs good as rural primitive regions .</p>

              <p>The main issue is actually finding a job. You should try to see if you can get a job first before even moving over there. It is alright to go there on a working pass first before you become a PR. No point in heading over there only to find yourself penniless and jobless. </p>
              <p>About your parents, since they have encouraged you to go ahead, then you should make the move. Try your best not to let them down though, and I must warn you, it may not be as easy for them as you to become PR.

              <p>i think its not possible to move his folks overseas to oz ....many asians thought oz was like usa in the past but they only knew it after 10 years down the road....their policy is different...check with the statistics on old aged parents category in australian immigration website. its like less than 50 persons for many many years ......u may check their quotas again to see of theres any changes..but i doubt thers much changes.</p>

              <p>Demon Bane and Aquatic Crystal,</p>
              <p>Thanks mate. I just think that we live in the most wonderful place, the tropical weather is warm all year round, the food is excellent and there are cheap hawker area to hang out, yet we just don't know how to appreciate the opportunities for social life in sg. Everybody is busy with work and family.</p>
              <p>I miss the time when I was in my 20s, when all my peers just graduated and started with their new jobs. Those days, they call me out for yam cha, we play badminton/tennis/futsal/squash during the weekends, friday nights we go clubbing and after sunday church service, we go for lunch. Nowadays, all these friends have migrated overseas, some grown distance away and the rest I lost touch.</p>
              <p>I try to change myself, exercise, buy new and nicer clothes, groom myself and be more gentleman but its still hard to find friends, these days. As I have said, I even took up language classes, diploma courses and get involve in church ministries (of course I am serving and I not expect anything back). Still my social life is a frigid zero.</p>
              <p>Hopefully I find new frens in Oz. There are a migrant community there, a lot of young people who come to work and study. So they are away from their comfort zone, I am hoping that these people will be more inclined to make friends and if fate has its way, I am hoping to find a life partner there.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>well if u got yer pr and u have sisters to look after yer parents daily in spore then its ok for u to immigrate.</p>
              <p>however parents are not allowed to immigrate due to their age factor.in australia, u need a master degree to do what is generally classified as spore diploma level jobs in oz.their technology is low grade...some terribly unsafe from my experience.but if are into qantas airlines and have a cert or license that they dont have and they cant get it easily  then it should easy to get $80,000/year salary or a $70k/year salary even as a mere technician .but what i have met are people from india...somehave masters degree in accounting from oz and ended up as taxi drivers in rural towns after being in city melbourne n sydney fer 2 years.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>their jobs are kinda substandard due to no technology transfer in the past from most developed countries so dont be surprised everything is manual labour intensive methods in oz.</p>
              <p>but best thing would be their salary as even their low grad job pay $40k/year at least for those vietnamese 20year old kids who dun speak a single word of english.most of them immigrated over a few years ago with their parents to do those jobs that no oz would do.those vietnamese who immigrated after the vietnam war are either now degree holders,own their own homes and live more comfortably than any rich educated singaporean.</p>
              <p>however the ausies have often been known to torture asians under their employment.i have observed quite a few of them singaporeans or asians seem to exhibit great anger and feelings of being&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;clobbered in the past and now feel angry at the world kinda attitude!</p>
              <p>i have been here like 3 years and i have my own business due to the internet age,,,,if it wasnt for the internet...i would surely be turned to dust a long time ago.</p>
              <p>the temp in oz is 42C in adelaide and 40c in melbourne  yesterday....its way hotter than thailand.the cities are expensive and most claim that they have to pay alot for little expenses which i often get that reply.....it might be expensive and maybe jobs good as rural primitive regions .</p>

My migration agent's mother-in-law also migrated there. She now is happily withdrawing her allowance for retirees. I do want my parents to come over. Let say if I work and stay there for 5 years, I decide to naturalise my citizenship to Ozzy citizenship, that way, there is no way teh Ozzies won't want to accept my parents.</p>

              <p>true spore is a shitty place now with no future for any citizen.i dont think the spore army cared a hoot for any of their soldiers who were seen struggling in a real battle in war time or peaxce time....not surprised they would say such stuff as u need to scrifice =yerself for the whole army kinda talk.....</p>
              <p>anyway if yer folks have yer sistersto look after them daily thenu go strike out...but theres not much indsutries as compared to spore because their way and methods the aussies used in the past are labour intensive and kind of backward as in england n nz.the only advanced companies are usually the japanese or americans which are quite rare in asutralia.</p>

              <p>You are questioning about the meaning of life. It looks like a floating ship in the midst of the ocean without a shipdock. I am awared that you have at least 3 years of valuable working experience in your line clocked if not by your contributions to the ex-company, at least it is by your hardwork. </p>
              <p>It is fortunate that you are granted an Australia PR. However, do you at least have relatives or friends in down under? Beside being brand as a second class citizens, you also need to depend on yourself to expand the social circle over there. Likewise in Singapore. Are you a diploma? Technical, lab. analysts jobs are plentiful if you have the right experience. The salary structure is gradual so you can expect to earn a substantial lifestyle with a small car and a roof over your head.</p>
              <p>That pretty left to your own social skills to tackle. Shape yourself.</p>

              <p>Hitman,</p>
              <p>You are right to say that even S'pore has classes and discrimination. People discriminate by what credit card we hold, gold or platinium? People distinguish us by what kind of place we stay, HBD or townhouse? what expensive clothes we wear? What phone we use? Education qualification.</p>
              <p>I am not so concern about cars because I know cars there are dirt cheap and they don't have restrictions.</p>
              <p>Hitman, I believe your situation is different from mine, from what you have said to me. Of course, I am not expecting to get the kind of MNC exposure S'pore has, there are a lot of cos in Oz, I probably never heard before. Hitman, do you stay in the Big Cities? or in Smaller Town? Not one of the big 6 cities in Oz? If you stay in small town, I believe the job opportunities are less, and if you stay in a town that concentrates on tourism, hotel or wool industry, then the kind of enginnering jobs you seek, maybe lacking. It could be a lot more different if you're looking for a job in Sydney. As Oz is a bigger country, its industry specifications in each city is more spreadout, unlike smaller Sg where things are more concentrated.</p>
              <p>I want to check out the status of my parents ability to go there. My mother do want to see Oz, she always dreamt of staying there. Also, I recently visited my 80 year old grandma, and recently she feel senile, she cannot even remember who I am, and she start to imagine things. I fear one day my parents will be like that, I want to be always around them, so they won't forget me and vice versa.</p>

              <p>One wants to be rid of the'' frustration'' but one never wants to drop expecting. It is fine to plan and futurize and what-not but if one does not understand that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">frustration is always a by-product of expectation</span>(s) one would always feel fearful, anxious.  one may even get to ''do'' or ''have'''... - but the ''psychological bugbear'' if not understood, acknowledged n  transcended it will always haunt one! Beware the stance of sweeping it under the carpet or supressing ... it will surface</p>
              <p>It is easy to change jobs, change places but the fact that what <span style="text-decoration: underline;">one carries within (eg ideas of love, ideas of success, the bigotry, the prejudices  n</span> ....( add on) is what gives meaning to oneself and etc. The mistake is to assume that meaning can be found in what one does or has. Imagine this: when the doing ends or the having ends, one is perceived or one considers onself to be failing or  .... fearful and anxious of losing it. Change is always easy n never lasts (the mere icing on the cake ie superficial) transformation is permanent (the real cake, - encompasses all) cos it is arrived thru understanding oneself. With understanding, with synthesis of both polarities of the same energy one does not have to reject any and yet be ''OK".  This is being integrated from within as opposed to look for something external and hoping to be integrated.</p>
              <p>The mistake of today's living is being ''blind'' to the societal programming, the conditioning and worse still is the parental, religious and political. One lives but one is suffers not cos of what one does or has but cos one is being driven by these ''brainwashing"' which is the undoing of one!</p>
              <p>It would stand in good stead to know that one came alone and would eventually go alone. Between this gap one can live for others, please others and be stuck in mediocrity or compromise to be accepted or be approved of by ... OR one can simply live and be (as long as it does not encroach on another).</p>
              <p>The essence of living is not what one does or has but living with understanding that all meaning <span style="text-decoration: underline;">remains within and the reactions or responses always emanates from within oneself.</span></p>

              <p>One wants to be rid of the'' frustration'' but one never wants to drop expecting. It is fine to plan and futurize and what-not but if one does not understand that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">frustration is always a by-product of expectation</span>(s) one would always feel fearful, anxious.  one may even get to ''do'' or ''have'''... - but the ''psychological bugbear'' if not understood, acknowledged n  transcended it will always haunt one! Beware the stance of sweeping it under the carpet or supressing ... it will surface</p>
              <p>It is easy to change jobs, change places but the fact that what <span style="text-decoration: underline;">one carries within (eg ideas of love, ideas of success, the bigotry, the prejudices  n</span> ....( add on) is what gives meaning to oneself and etc. The mistake is to assume that meaning can be found in what one does or has. Imagine this: when the doing ends or the having ends, one is perceived or one considers onself to be failing or  .... fearful and anxious of losing it. Change is always easy n never lasts (the mere icing on the cake ie superficial) transformation is permanent (the real cake, - encompasses all) cos it is arrived thru understanding oneself. With understanding, with synthesis of both polarities of the same energy one does not have to reject any and yet be ''OK".  This is being integrated from within as opposed to look for something external and hoping to be integrated.</p>
              <p>The mistake of today's living is being ''blind'' to the societal programming, the conditioning and worse still is the parental, religious and political. One lives but one is suffers not cos of what one does or has but cos one is being driven by these ''brainwashing"' which is the undoing of one!</p>
              <p>It would stand in good stead to know that one came alone and would eventually go alone. Between this gap one can live for others, please others and be stuck in mediocrity or compromise to be accepted or be approved of by ... OR one can simply live and be (as long as it does not encroach on another).</p>
              <p>The essence of living is not what one does or has but living with understanding that all meaning <span style="text-decoration: underline;">remains within and the reactions or responses always emanates from within oneself.</span></p>
