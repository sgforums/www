              <p>After reading this is what I conclude.</p>
              <p>1) Your gf run off for another rich guy. you just let the rich guy get her / them because you think you will not win.</p>
              <p>2) you jobs sucks and you think other people's job's cool. everyone job's sucks, they just suffer the shit and clear the shit themselve. nobody will clear it.</p>
              <p>3)you got no friend and turn to church and hope you can get some from there? friend don't come naturally and it depend on yourself to get them. I wonder how you got your gf at the first place. they mustta find out that their eyes stick stamps and make you their bf so they wake up and run off, and you accus them of choosing rich guy then you.</p>
              <p>4)you said u low salary but how low is low and what's your highest education level?</p>
              <p>5)boss's words also you believe ah? you must be naive like a kid</p>
              <p>6)going australia to work is a choice and this choice is on yourself. there's bounced to be bad aussie who look down at black haired human being and give u alot of shit to eat. so you don't like singapore go australia and work lo. since the chance's here. u no gf, no like the work enviroment, so go lo</p>
              <p>7) BUT you haven't get a job there yet correct? just the PR only. u studied in australia before or what?  get a job there first lo then decide.</p>
              <p>You might end up with nothing. jobless, no gf, no friend, no money... nothing....</p>

              <p>1) She didn't run off with a rich guy, she thought she got someone better. Anyway even if I wanted to chase her back, I wouldn't have succeeded because she made her choice.</p>
              <p>2) All jobs suck. But maybe one job does not suck as much as the other. I am not going there for jobs, Aust is not known for dream job. Understand?</p>
              <p>3) Again she didn't run off with a rich guy, don't jump to conclusion. And church are not dating centres. Church is where we serve and believe in something we do.</p>
              <p>4) Again you never read, I am a degreeholder but this does not count much as Aust won't consider your Asian work experience. Then again, jobs are not what I am looking for. If I want a high level job with career prospects I would rather go to UK or USA instead but they both are now not welcoming foreigners due to high unemployment.</p>
              <p>5) Of course, especially during interview. Naive? You think you so filled with wisdom? Some things in life we don't expect to happen.</p>
              <p>7) True but everything has to start from somewhere. Better than nothing. Like my uncle who sneak into UK many years ago for dish washer job. Now he is a citizen.</p>
              <p>You are so so wrong. Another negative feedback. Why you people are so pessimistic? It is a good thing I decide to leave, I am also tired of listening to all the negative, ranting about PAP and a giving up attitude. Nobody here is optimistic.</p>
              <p>Life is about taking risk. I can still stay here and end up nothing. Life is about making choices. I can still go there and end up nothing. As I said, at the end of the day, at least I am moving forward, making decisions that may or many not change my life. If our forefathers were as afraid and negative as you to stay back in China and not take risk, we would not have been born today.</p>
              <p>Or I could end up with something...more than you will ever know...who knows? Motion creates opportunities.</p>

              <p>TS, ur problem is not Singapore nor Australia. Its you. </p>
              <p>You have an inferiority complex just because you are single, 32 and have earn less.  You detest the notion of comparing salaries, and yet, you accept it and feel inferior when others do that.  If you have friends that just like "compare" against you for their own ego boost, you can basically tell them "Up Yours" and bid them farewell.</p>
              <p>Single life at 32 isn't horrible. Use your freedom to do things you like instead of "church ministry" in hopes of a divinely appointed girlfriend that will drop on your lap from the heavens.  It don't work that way. </p>
              <p>When you start orienting  your lifestyle to something that is healthy and enjoyable, you will find a social circle who perhaps share the same hobbies, interests and activities.  There you will find people you are comfortable with, and maybe a life partner.</p>
              <p>BUT - being attached to a girlfriend / wife does not mean happiness and success.  An extra person in your life, will mean an extra voice, opinion and someone who you will get upset with, and will upset you as well.  You *WILL* move from a quiet life of singlehood where you decide what you want to do and do, to a life of lover's quarrels in deciding even the most mundane things.  So know what you are getting into.</p>
              <p>Start giving yourself a fresh outlook now.  Else, you will detect *FAMILIAR* patterns even after you move to Australia.  Btw, if you are hell bent on going to Australia, please do check out the income tax levels, and find out how much you will likely be paid.  Do your math or you will be in for another ride.</p>

              <p>I am doing my homework, that is why I am not leaving immediately.</p>
              <p>I do not have a self esteem problem, thank you. And FAMILIAR patterns is not going to stop me from going. If I don't take initiative, I won't create opportunities for myself. If I stay, I am not going to improve because my parents will spoil me. I want to be independent and learn how to live with myself. You talk of not repeating your problems, well I say, the only way of changing yourself is to get yourself out of your COMFORT ZONE. Of course repeating factors will come back but if I want to be a better person, I got to do something to improve myself.</p>
              <p>I know having a partner gives you more headach but I don't like to live by myself. I have life alone long enough to decide I want to start a family. Having a family is not about having a dream fantasy, it is about the joy of ups and downs. Celibacy is a life choice. I don't think human is meant to live solitarily. We are made to have relationships. I want to relate to somebody and share my life with somebody. I know I am not made to live in a celibate way, so why must I choose to be single? I choose to find someone I like and can get along with.</p>

              <p>Hey Tcell, some people love to abuse the power of anonymity, just ignore them.</p>
              <p>Anyway I think it takes great courage and lots of reasons to leave for a person to leave his country for good, not saying you can't come back for holiday but saying building a new life in a new place. It's something that I have thought of but never have the courage nor enough reasons to do it.</p>
              <p>If you have decided, then I wish you all the best, but if you have not, then I want you to know that there are still nice people here.</p>
