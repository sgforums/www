              <p>Back to greener pastures, The colour green looks nice from afar. Go near and the green does not look good.</p>
              <p>Leaves, grass looks splendid from a distance, go near and you see the colours are dull, dusty, blemished. Thats is why the grass is greener on the other side.</p>
              <p>Those countries look good from here, be in it and reality kicks in.</p>

              its the person.if person does not blend physically into enviroment like having indo european features like an indian to blend in an otherwise white european enviroment then be back in spore in a few years.
              
              or if u dont have any work connections overseas then prepared to come back.
              
              or if u dont have any ability to design and mass produce things n have great passion for international business then come back to spore in a few years after overseas tour.
              
              it depends on the person itself.if one samurai goes into an ancient samurai battle armed with the  poorly made samurai blades and defective bad equipment needed to fight.high chance he end up at home after the battle in crutches.
              
              if samurai has well made sword and equipment he will prosper in battle as long as he is the only one there making the rules !
              
               its what u have on u that matters...the grass and others will follow u and come naturally onto u unless u are surrounded by strange rules and laws that makes it poor pickings for everyone .

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>I am a guy who is in his 30s. My life here has come to a grinding halt. I haven't felt that I am growing here and experience anything new. I only son and have my parents to be glad of.</p>
              <p>Last time when I was 26, I was planning to go overseas to work and experience new things. But I miss my mom and dad, so being filial son I decided to stay and give myself another 4 more years here.</p>
              <p>However, my life have not improve. Why?</p>
              <p>1) No social life. My old friends and peers look down on me because I am not married and my salary is low, my position is low also. I ask a lot of old friend to come out but they all rudely tell me they not interested to come out. Very hard to make new friends and network. Office a lot fo politics. I go to church and help out in the ministry. I made few close friends but not enough. I even attended church camp but I find hard to mix with people there because they got their own cliques.</p>
              <p>I try the church ministry but the church is very strict, they don't allow me to socialise and speak to other members during our church work. So when the church volunteer ministry finally over, everybody too tired and decided to go home. No social.</p>
              <p>2) No life partner. I got dumped twice by ex gf who left me for richer guys. I haven't been able to even hit first base and find a date. So hard to find a girl to go out with.</p>
              <p>3) Work sucks. I join the company 3 years ago. But my boss renege on his promise to pass me the job I was suppose to do. I felt shortchanged. And the company I work for is horrible, nobody want to cooperate, all play tai chi. Everybody engage in job protection, don't want to share knowledge, cause me to struggle to learn.</p>
              <p>So I try to apply for PR. I try for fun. But I got shock half a year ago when Australia granted me the PR.</p>
              <p>So I am tempted whether if I want to try the PR. I am not getting any younger, to stay in this comfort zone of dry desert of opportunities, means to rot here. My parents are my only friends, but I realise they are not going to be here for me foreover. So, I decided: Why not? I want to try a new life. If I fail, at least I say I tried and can come back. But if I stay on here and fail: Even worse, because it means i never try at all.</p>
              <p>My parents are happy for me and have given me their approval for me to migrate. I will try to bring them over to Australia when I am there as dependents.</p>
              <p>But I am worry. Because I heard a lot of story of racism there. Also, I cannot stand the cold weather. Working style maybe different. I am also afraid that I may have to take substandard jobs. My savings is not much, I am not sure if I can pay for the high rental there. And making new friends and networking will be a challenge too.</p>
              <p>But I have to try because I already got green light. Not to try would be a travesty. I have lost almost all my friends here and my relatives look down on me because I have been let go in my job before and I am the only grandchild in his 30s not married. What have I got to lose? I will bring my parents there when I settle down and support them. I also hope to meet somebody special there. I long dream of finding a life partner, I hope I can meet a migrant community of open minded people where I can find my life partner. Over here so difficult. I always get rejected and laugh at when I ask some girl out for a date. I always fail to hit first base. Also my ex gf laugh at me, dump me and say I am a failure. I must find a new life in greenier pastures. I already mandated to stay here for another 4 years to try and it all failed. So, I have try already. Time to try something new before i become too old.</p>

              <p>Dear tcell , i see alot of 'complaint' in your post.and you are always unhappy with others.If you have this mentality of perfect job need perfect lifestyle ,let me tell you u cant find any job in the world is like that</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>u can have a relaxed job but low pay and a perfect high paying job with lots of hardwork .</p>
              <p>I suggest since you look down on job .be a tutor in australia .it will be better since u not forcing yourself to deal with bad boss ..</p>

              <p>At 30 you want to look for Greener what? And what if the pasture over yonder taste and feels the same then you sit down cry for a while and come back? I think the real problem lies within you so once you  can solve that then everything is Greener than green.</p>
