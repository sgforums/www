              <h2>The Retirement (Subclass 410) visa</h2>
              <p>From 1 July 2009 Retirement visa holders are able to apply for a visa which is valid for 10 years and is not subject to a condition limiting the amount of work (paid and unpaid) that they are able to undertake.</p>
              <p>Holders of a Retirement visa valid for four years should note that their visas will not be automatically adjusted.  Visa holders should renew their current visa just prior to expiry in order to be granted a visa which is valid for 10 years and has unlimited work rights.</p>
              <p>For those visa holders who wish to undertake more than 20 hours paid work per week transitional arrangements have been put in place to allow them to obtain unlimited work rights free of charge.<br><strong>See:</strong> <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/visitors/retirement/_pdf/410-visa-enhancements.pdf"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Retirement (subclass 410) visa enhancements</span></span></a> ( 43KB PDF file)</p>

              <p><br class="clear"></p>
              <p>Below are the requirements you must meet to be eligible for an Investor Retirement visa.</p>
              <h2><a id="a" name="a"></a>Age</h2>
              <p>You must be 55 years of age or older. Your partner (if any) can be any age.</p>
              <h2><a id="b" name="b"></a>Sponsorship</h2>
              <p>You must be sponsored by an Australian state or territory government agency (other than the Australian Capital Territory).</p>
              <h2><a id="c" name="c"></a>Family</h2>
              <p>You must have no dependent children or other dependent family members other than a partner.</p>
              <p>If you are married or in a de facto relationship, your partner must have no dependent children or other dependent family members.</p>
              <h2><a id="d" name="d"></a>Assets</h2>
              <p>You must have assets valued at least AUD750 000. These assets will enable you (or you and your partner) to meet initial settlement and ongoing costs of living in Australia.</p>
              <p>The assets must be:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>legally owned and lawfully acquired by you (or you and your partner) </li>
              <li>capable of and available for, transfer to Australia. </li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>Exception: </strong>If you intend to live in regional Australia you must have assets valued at least AUD500 000.<br><strong>See:</strong> <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/skilled/general-skilled-migration/regional-growth.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Regional Australia/Low Population Growth Metropolitan Areas</span></span></a></p>
              <p><strong>Note:</strong> You must have held all of the assets listed above for 2 years prior to you lodging your application, unless the assets are related to superannuation and/or inheritance. If you are intending to sell assets in relation to your move to Australia, the department recommends that you wait until after your visa is approved. If you need to sell assets to meet the requirements of this visa you should carefully consider whether you will be able to finance your ongoing stay in Australia, particularly in the longer term. The assets are in addition to the funds required to make the designated investment.</p>
              <h2><a id="e" name="e"></a>Income</h2>
              <p>You (or you and your partner combined) must have access to a minimum net income of AUD65 000 (for example, pension rights).</p>
              <p><strong>Exception:</strong> If you intend to live in regional Australia you must have access to a minimum income of AUD50 000.</p>
              <h2><a id="f" name="f"></a>Designated Investment</h2>
              <p>You must be able to make a designated investment of AUD750 000 in your name (or your name and your partner's name), in the state or territory in which you have been sponsored.</p>
              <p><strong>Exception:</strong> If you intend to live in regional Australia you must make a designated investment of AUD500 000.</p>
              <p><strong>Note:</strong> The funds used to make the designated investment are in addition to the assets requirement.</p>
              <h2><a id="g" name="g"></a>Health insurance</h2>
              <p>You must have evidence that you, and your partner (if any), hold an adequate health insurance package for the period of your intended stay in Australia.</p>
              <p>For health insurance to be considered adequate, it must:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>be fully comprehensive<br>or </li>
              <li>provide coverage that is at least equivalent to Medicare (including coverage of 85 per cent of costs for hospital, emergency, and general practitioner services)<br>and </li>
              <li>provide coverage for pharmaceuticals. </li>
              </ul>
              <p>It is preferable that the health insurance be with an Australian insurer, however alternative arrangements that meet the above requirements can be accepted. Alternative arrangements with an overseas insurer will require individual detailed examination of the insurance policy and may result in processing delays.</p>
              <p>If you do not maintain adequate health insurance it may result in the refusal of future visa applications.</p>
              <h2><a id="h" name="h"></a>Working in Australia</h2>
              <p>You must have no intention of working full-time in Australia (you, and your partner if applicable, will only be allowed to work up to 20 hours per week while in Australia.)</p>
              <h2><a id="i" name="i"></a>Health examination</h2>
              <p>You and your family must meet health requirements for you to enter Australia. You will require an examination from a doctor, a chest x-ray and possibly further medical tests.<br><strong>See:</strong> <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/allforms/pdf/1163i.pdf"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Information form 1163i</span></span></a> <em>Health requirement for temporary entry to Australia</em> ( 54KB PDF file)</p>
              <h2><a id="j" name="j"></a>Character</h2>
              <p>You and your family must be of good character for you to enter Australia.<br><strong>See:</strong> <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/allforms/character-requirements/index.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Character Requirement</span></span></a></p>
              <h2><a id="k" name="k"></a>Applying for a further Investor Retirement visa</h2>
              <p>You may apply for one or more further Investor Retirement visas if you meet the following requirements.</p>
              <ul>
              <li>You hold or the last visa you held was an Investor Retirement visa. </li>
              <li>You must be sponsored by an authorised Australian state or territory government agency (not available in the ACT). </li>
              <li>You or your partner must have no dependent children or other dependent family members other than a partner. </li>
              <li>You need to have a minimum net income stream (for example, a pension) that can be accessed for yourself or yourself and your partner. If you intend to live in a metropolitan area the minimum is AUD65 000 or if you intend to live in a regional area, the minimum is AUD50 000. </li>
              <li>You are able to make or maintain a designated investment in your name or your name and your partner's name, in the state or territory in which you have been sponsored. If you intend to live in a metropolitan area you need to invest a minimum of AUD500 000, and if you intend to live in a regional area you need to invest a minimum of AUD250 000. </li>
              <li>You have evidence that you and your partner, if applicable, have held and continue to hold adequate health insurance. </li>
              <li>You and your partner, if applicable, will only be able to work up to 20 hours per week while in Australia. </li>
              <li>You and your partner are of good health. You and your partner will not be required to undergo further health screening unless you have either: 
              <ul>
              <li>travelled for three months or more to a country where tuberculosis is a medium or high risk, <br>or </li>
              <li>had exposure to other public health risk conditions even if you have not travelled outside Australia. </li>
              </ul>
              </li>
              </ul>
              <p>If tuberculosis or a public health risk condition is identified, medical treatment rather than visa refusal will be the likely outcome.</p>
              <ul>
              <li>You and your partner are of good character. You must be of good character to enter Australia. Investor Retirement visa renewal applicants will be required to lodge an up to date Australian Federal Police clearance. They are also required to lodge a renewed Overseas Police clearance from each country where applicants have spent for a cumulative period of 12 months or more in the last 10 years. </li>
              <li>You have maintained the Designated Investment associated with your previous Investor Retirement visa for the period of that investment. </li>
              </ul>
              <h2><a id="z" name="z"></a>Australian Values Statement</h2>
              <p>If you are aged 18 years or over, you must declare that you will respect Australian values and obey the laws of Australia. For this visa, the values statement is included in the general declaration section of the application form. When you sign the application form it means you will also be signing the values statement. You will not be required to have read the <em>Life in Australia</em> book, but may do so if you wish.</p>
              <p>You are also encouraged to gain an understanding of Australia, its people and their way of life, before applying for this visa.<br><strong>See:</strong> <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/living-in-australia/values/index.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Australian Values - Overview</span></span></a></p>

              <p>a $750,000 asset is in australian dollars or more than $800,000.</p>
              <p>they will check  thoroughly when u apply for the visa.make sure the property is worth that amont in oz of AU$750,000 invested value.</p>
              <p>u may build a sing$800,000 if u are a civil engineer with vast working expertise as a career.but then the builders may be lazy or not very cooperative..some might be gangsters n thugs too.u might need to build 2 houses in that case.but then its easier to go build elsewhere using interpreters with lawyers contract signed as  interpreted correctly.</p>
              <p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>however if u intend to buy a bungalow make sure its close to AU$500,000 in farmland /shire/rural regional towns or AU$750,000 in the city n civilised areas.they will check and confirm the amount before issusing u with visa.</p>

              <p>canada is naturally the better than australia as oz has way too many violent people......self explainable from their origins.why the other day i saw on tv some dancing variety competition in oz . they had this tall  strong guy who looks like lee hsien yang and some big blonde australian spring chicken .so they pictured the chinese guy standing with his legs wide apart forming a bridge so that his big ang mo dancer gal friend who looks like nicole kidman can tap dance in high heels on his thighs...i mean she was standing there in dancing shoes n dancing on his thighs...1.75metres tall n she looked like 75kg dancing on the poor guys thigh....</p>
              <p>he could very well have damaged his arteries on his leg with that big ang mo bimbo tap dancin on his thighs!she was virtually tap dancing on his thighs!!!!</p>
              <p>maybe they dun have such nasty looking gals like these in oz.how come they dun do these stuff on ang mo men instaed.....??cuz the ang mo men would have beaten them up with a blackk eye..thats why!</p>
