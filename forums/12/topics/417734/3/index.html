              ippt affects my research and development after working hours
                                ippt remedial training also affects my shift work timing and quality of my life.people actually lose their jobs due to ippt remedial trainings.
                                progress reports on my own research and development projects is also halted and progress of any wiped out due to ippt rt.
                                
                                so in summary ippt and ippt rt affects my work in my work shift hours and my after working time researcgh and developement from materials tesrting,design research,development etc etc....my job and future isnt a modern day coolie....it uses intelligence and high technology that most sporeans have not much exposure.
              
              i have made considerable progress more than i have done in spore.

              dont now about most people but no thanks to ippt n rt.they have made life worse off foer me in spore.over here at least i can prepare my own company factory and build my life and riches  in 1 year.in spore,no such thing, as ippt n rt hinders my progress n growth.if u are nort connected to some minister..prepare to be a modern day coolie where u dun need to design,build and progress every week or so!
                                
                                as the stuff i do has always been design and searching out the world for new materials,making unknown materials from scratch  and applying them....i find the army ippt n rt retards my progress movement every week.and thats on off days...on my working days its equally intense too in engineering production......so im not goin to be some modern day coolie not using thinking caps n find myself n future in hands of boss who wants yunger cheaper n better.i wanna be the boss!nothing but the best!

              it takes 10 years to be a success in oz after immigration by werkin fer someone.so who are these narrow n shallow minded folks in sgforum???angel7030 could be one...the other is unknown fella.....
              
              creative industries founder had to immigrate outa spore to usa in oder just to make n design his sound card for computers.took him 10 years before he could see the results.
              
              bill gates took 5 years before developing his software for first windows operating platform.
              
              even singapore took like around 25 years to build to  a recognised  country status with mrt and decent living standards.
              
              so who are these narrow n shallow minded folks who are quick to judge folks by a mere 3 years overseas???angel7030 is one....!these narrow minded n shallow skanks expect you to be a millionaire success equivalent in 1 year in a country with not enough jobs for their own folks.thats why i just setup my company as a faster alternative to making more $$$$.im not consumed away by army ippt athelete remedial trainings....the engineering materials is easily availiable here in oz as compared to singapore.so i would or have already progressed quite a lot over the year or so.
              
              im lucky im not in spore,as the material i want to get is hard to obtain.perhaps their manner in which they sell engineering materials are made simpler to obtain i wuld setup a hq in spore.and the spore army isnt helping things either with their army athelete remedial trainings!unless spore bucks up with narrow minded n shallow principles i forsee no progress in spore except the rubbish bin.u cant make a brick house with straws....singapore has straws which i cant use to make my brick house scenario.
              
              so its not my fault really.its singapores fault!its got nothing but angel7030 selling drinks and  slave drivers who simply clobber u n curse u if they dont like u.in which case u would be better off in oz if folks are taken care of.

              <p>2. No guts to face the real his/her own nation laws and requirement, like..uncle..:WRONG                                                                      </p>
              <p>ans:see above</p>
              <p>3. Unable to make a living here due to incompetency or simply, lazy....WRONG</p>
              <p>ans:if lazy or incompetent then i wldnt be engineer.i would be werking in a pub or some place that smells like crap.</p>
              <p>4. Committed a serious offence and run to other country to hide, can be cheat others,rape, evade army, etc etc........WRONG</p>
              <p>ans:Australia checks criminal records so no way they let in people wirth records.</p>
              <p>5. Unable to compete with people of the same skill and qualification...WRONG</p>
              <p>ans:i compete with them and excel same as them.together we werk and life is easier at production lines for everyone.furthermore i upgrade myself in spore with own time n $$ so u dun need to mention bout skill n qualification.and oz also check skill and qualifications and if u are low in them....they will tell u  do not enter our country n farms.</p>
              <p>6. Unable to take the sight of too much foreigners......so so.</p>

              <p>7. A fix mentality of hatre toward govt......CORRECT</p>

              <p>8. A mental illness that alway believe own motherland is like shit and other are good.....depends</p>
              <p>ans:if singapore food like pork is $10/kgand oz pork is $7.50/kg......and if cars is $7k for starters for 2004 model toyota and spore is $10k for a coe paper and car is $30k not including insurance n road tax........the country thats shit like would be spore sadly.and if spore fixed xdeposit only offer 1.9%/year interests rates and oz gives 7%/year interest rates for fixed deposit.....it sounds even more shittier!in fact its damn it at bank counter!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>9. Unable to meet up with own motherland standard of living cost: so so</p>
              <p>ans:see  all of above</p>
              <p>10. Wanted to earn more money elsewhere thereby betrayed motherland and be slave for other country.....wrong</p>
              <p>ans:slave?u can say no if they dont pay u or feel like they are short changing u in singapore.in fact a kfc worker at colonel sanders earn more wiping tables than an engineer working in singapore production lines.why do u think theres so much japanese,koreans and taiwanese working in oz now?because they are paid more money in motherland pushing supermarket trolleys than even an engineer in singapore.in fact many degree holderes from south korea end up becoming cleaners in oz as a vacation job even. then with money saved up they can already do their masters degree and buy a car too in south korea when they get home!</p>
              <p> </p>
