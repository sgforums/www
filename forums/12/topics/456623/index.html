              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Have u already admit to her you realized what a shitty boyfriend u were before?</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">All you have to do is tell her how sorry you are for being a big ass jerk , will change and be good from now onwards. But please walk the talk.</p>

              <p>Dude, you are talking like a very insecure man. A man afraid os losing control.</p>
              <p>A relationship is not about power struggle. Not about who gets to control who.</p>
              <p>A relationship is about finding the balance for two very different person to be happy with each other, the point of harmony between giving and receiving.</p>
              <p>He can either change and be a better person for this girl or live the regret and be a better person for another. It's his choice who he wants to spend his life with.</p>
              <p>Sll he needs to do is admit his mistakes, s<span style="-webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.292969);  ">how remorse and change his ways...if he can't do that, then she don't want him either.</span></p>

              <p>Actually its not really i mistreated her or wadever. It just that my logical thoughts never came to be as i am hurting her. Its only after the breakup, i consulted many different opinions and advises then i came to my senses..  :(</p>
              <p>Example, i told her "we drifting apart.." hoping to work on it.

              <p>Dude, you are talking like a very insecure man. A man afraid os
                                  losing control.</p>
              <p>A relationship is not about power struggle. Not about who gets
                                  to control who.</p>
              <p>A relationship is about finding the balance for two very
                                  different person to be happy with each other, the point of harmony
                                  between giving and receiving.</p>
              <p>He can either change and be a better person for this girl or
                                  live the regret and be a better person for another. It's his choice
                                  who he wants to spend his life with.</p>
              <p>Sll he needs to do is admit his mistakes, s<span>how
                                  remorse and change his ways...if he can't do that, then she don't
                                  want him either.</span></p>
              <p>It's that simple.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When a person hurt us, but ask for second chance, we need to
                                  know he/she will not do it again. </p>
              </div>

              <p>ASSUMING both parties want to reconcile then yes I would agree with 
                                  you. In this case the TS is the only one trying and it seems like the 
                                  girl does not want him back. Why live your life for someone who does not want you back? Live for yourself...</p>
              <p>But the girl DID try to accept the TS. She tried to communicate her wants to the TS DURING the relationship. The TS wasn't listening was he?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Infact the TS himself already admittedly why the relationship broke. Selfishness, lack of commitment, insecurity just to name a few.</p>
              <p>Is the TS now making promises out of desperation rather then genuinely wanting 
                                  to change himself for the better AFTER the relationship has ended?? Could his be a case of emotional attachment rather then real love??</p>
              <p>People do not change themselves overnight. People do not change themselves just because they SAID so. They need to show it..no amount of begging will convince her at this moment.</p>
              <p>Sadly we do not live in some Korean drama where the female lead will forgive the male lead after a few saranghaeyos....welcome to the real world<span class="st"><em></em></span></p>

              <p>She's avoiding you, its confirmed.</p>
              <p>So maybe in another 3 weeks time, she most likely text you again to ask you how are you. Thats probably to get her off her guilt for hurting you. So please don't misunderstand it as her giving you an opportunity to pursue her.</p>
              <p>Just ignore her. Move on.</p>
              <p>She would probably get married and find someone. But so do you. So don't just stand there and cry over spilled milk. Go out there and find other fishes in the sea.</p>
              <p>I know it ain't easy getting over your first break-up. But after sometime, its just a sting. You will realise its nothing.</p>

              <p>Well, sista, love can also change a woman, but rather in a minor way. When we fall in Love, the color is alway pink in our mind, for guys, it is like traffic lights, change here and there, sometime even green arrow also come out, that is the time, they go flirt around.</p>
              <p>The truth is that all married or attached men tends to flirt more than a bachelor, because to them, it is so secretive that it enhance excitement in their homos, more so that they can compare it with their wife or gf.</p>
