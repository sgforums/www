              <p>Hi, after some thoughts and attempt, i decided to move on.  My last straw is when i asked her for 10min of her time to chat, and she get irritated and accused me for distrusting her that she really had no time even 10min to chat. And she can posted on her fb, chilling out and clubbing.</p>
              <p>Sighz.. i still love her deeply, i guess it really no point for me to hang on if she become irritated and her indifferent attitude toward me.</p>
              <p>Thank guys.  I been recently reading up this book "The 5 love languages" I picked up a few notes from this book. There are 5 different type of ways to be love or being feel loved.  1.Act of services, 2.Words of affirmations, 3.Quality time, 4.Touchs, 5 gifts.</p>
              <p>Each of us have a primary love language which might be different. From this book, i came to realise, i am a "act of service" person, I alway thought doing things for her, driving her from work and help her with her work is love and care for her. But i think all she wants is "Quality time" and words of affirmation which i fail to realise.</p>
              <p>=) i guess i learn from this mistake and trying to read more on the differences. Guys are from Mars afterall. We think logic, but i think next time I have to settle the lady's emotionals feeling before i fill up with my logic. Quarrels could just be avoided.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

              <p>Well let's face it dude.</p>
              <p>No matter who she chosen, as long as you are not the guy, theres gonna be something u won't like about it.</p>
              <p>If her new bf is better looking than u, you 'd say she shallow.</p>
              <p>If he has more assets than u, you'd say she materialistic.</p>
              <p>If he better looking and has assets, you'd call her a slut. Yes?</p>
              <p>The problem is you think too highly of yourself. </p>
              <p>You can claim to be mr nice guy, tall dark and handsome, but u did treat her like shit.</p>
              <p>So honestly, you pretty much deserved being kicked to the curb by your ex.</p>
              <p>A girl just wanna be treated well by her guy, good looks and money are just extra bonuses.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Told ya so. Some women are bitches. They just lure you to after her...then she release the whopper on you. Maybe she got some unfinish score to settle..with you.</p>
              <p>Fb is garbage. i cut off my fb account. You should do the same for yours.</p>
              <p>They jsut showing pics of them together, but in real life who knows? Maybe the new bf, is a sadist, always tie her up and whip her and drop candle wax on her body. Ya think, he would post this in his fb?</p>
              <p>Just unfriend both of them. Spare yourself the pain.</p>

              <p>Hi, after some thoughts and attempt, i decided to move on.  My last straw is when i asked her for 10min of her time to chat, and she get irritated and accused me for distrusting her that she really had no time even 10min to chat. And she can posted on her fb, chilling out and clubbing.</p>
              <p>Sighz.. i still love her deeply, i guess it really no point for me to hang on if she become irritated and her indifferent attitude toward me.</p>
              <p>Thank guys.  I been recently reading up this book "The 5 love languages" I picked up a few notes from this book. There are 5 different type of ways to be love or being feel loved.  1.Act of services, 2.Words of affirmations, 3.Quality time, 4.Touchs, 5 gifts.</p>
              <p>Each of us have a primary love language which might be different. From this book, i came to realise, i am a "act of service" person, I alway thought doing things for her, driving her from work and help her with her work is love and care for her. But i think all she wants is "Quality time" and words of affirmation which i fail to realise.</p>
              <p>=) i guess i learn from this mistake and trying to read more on the differences. Guys are from Mars afterall. We think logic, but i think next time I have to settle the lady's emotionals feeling before i fill up with my logic. Quarrels could just be avoided.</p>
