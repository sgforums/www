              <p>You just have to be someone whom she falls for initially when you guys 
                          started being together. Be a gentleman, initiate contact with her first.
                           If you made her angry or have done something wrong that caused the 
                          break up, apologies and show and sincerity. I personally believe that 
                          when a woman loves, the love never die down, so show that you still care
                           for her, she'll reciprocate your love if she still has you in her

              <p>It seems you have some serious communication problems with girls.</p>
              <p>First if you really like a girl you show her respect and you do not wait for her to leave you to let her know you loved her, but then I am not even sure you love her... maybe you just got hurt because she left you and your ego did not like it too much!!</p>
              <p>You said she has no reason to leave you... yes she had! You just wrote you pushed a few dates yourself, then got impatient with her and then told things that made her feel insecure. Hey man, when you love a woman you have to show her and you didn't for sure... It seems she's a nice girl since she called you after 3 weeks to check how you were but sorry to say she does not seem to be in love with you, I think she just called you as she felt sympathy...</p>
              <p>Try to work on your behaviour/communication issues and next time be nice to the girl, maybe she will not leave you then!</p>

              <p><strong>Background.<br></strong>-Ex kinda wooed me and made me
              fell for her.<br> -Very sweet and patient to me but i have my reserves and i did push
              our dates off a few times.<br> -Once I got impatient with her over silly matters but
              I promise to work out.</p>
              <p>-I always said the wrong things which lead her feel
              insecure.<br> -She initated break for no reasons, that when i started to miss her
              and really want her back.<br> <br> <strong>I have tried</strong><br> <strong><em>-</em></strong> beg, plead, text, email and do sweet
              gifts and video to apologise for 1st 2 weeks.<br> - Applied no contact for next 3 weeks. (she texted me to ask how i
              am on the 3rd week)<br> - Asked her out after that, she agreed but put aeroplanes for 4
              times.<br> (Excuses like she was sick, the others due to work, cant meet up
              last min.) To be honest, i trusted her but if she is being sincere,
              she should at least suggest another date if she postpone
              right?)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do i still hv a chance?  these few weeks, I been working
              hard on those she told me. (go gym, study for a paper and get a new
              job). How i wish i hv a chance to tell her i cherish her, and she
              really motivated me with all these...  argh. But she nv give
              me a chance and text me as if i was a stranger now.. Weird..</p>

              <p>Guys come up to me very often for advice on a particular girl. I always tell them this:</p>
              <p>If you have to ask how to fix a problem with a girl, it's already too late.</p>
              <p>Unless both parties (i.e., marriage counselling) are willing to work on it. If it's one guy asking for advice on how to get a girl, you've already lost the frame from the start. The only way is to climb out, instead of digging deeper.</p>
