Not really selfish... More like natural...? But note that when ya talk about loving someone and expecting that someone to love you back that's PROVIDED that you're both already in a relationship.... I presume you're not talking about one which you're already in a BGR with... In this case, the girl has VERY RIGHT to reject you not to mention if she's not willing to contribute any love to you... Just IMAGINE, 5-6 guys going after a girl and expecting the SAME back in return... VERY BUSY huh...? Especially if she have got no interest in them...? Is it a NECCESSITY to entertain them? Doing that just for the sake of doing it...?<br><br><strong><br>jealousy....if you care too much ...ur partner will say u r possesive but in actual fact u just love them too much to lose them....</strong><br><br>Different people have different ways of defining what's 'caring' and what's 'too much'... In a relationship, it's about TWO PEOPLE... (For normal BGR) The union don't work only under YOUR DEFINITIONS.....<br></blockquote></div>
