I have no idea why he is so afraid of rumors. He used to spend with me and now he is avoiding me and when I asked him why, he hinted it is because people are talking. So I said...let them talk lor. Then he said cannot, must find a way to stop this gossip. I think people must have found out about our date the other day, and basically now everyone we know suddenly seem to know about us going out, even though it is only once. I dunno what to think about this. Grr<br><br>i.c.y</div></blockquote>guys oso like dat arh. dunnoe, ive been gossiped by everyone from young so.. no feeling le.</div>
