I have no idea why he is so afraid of rumors. He used to spend with me and now he is avoiding me and when I asked him why, he hinted it is because people are talking. So I said...let them talk lor. Then he said cannot, must find a way to stop this gossip. I think people must have found out about our date the other day, and basically now everyone we know suddenly seem to know about us going out, even though it is only once. I dunno what to think about this.

            <div class='col-md body'>Why is he so worry about gossip? What could be so bad about two of you having a relatinship? Go out together is not allowed is it? I also got a lot of people gossiping about me in my company about my r/s with a Indian girl(in case any 1 wondering, I'm a Chinese) what. But so what, I still talking to her in the company and even asking her out once. Spend a whole afternoon at orchard cafe chatting. Granted we did not admit we are a couple but its obvious theres someting going on. I also a very shy person who blushes easily when tease by girls. But I realize that if you really like someone strong enough, views of others really not matters much.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  Although I do hate some of the terms(slightly racist) people use to describe her  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"></div>
