            <div class='col-md body'>it need not necessary be a bad decision. i can give u an example. those who had graduated from local poly ard the year of 97-00 and went straight for a 2-4 yrs degree might feel this. after getting their degree, this grp of pple are badly hit by the economy slump and sky high unemployment rate. fresh uni grads found themselves having great difficulties landing a job that match their educational status, or none at all. on the other hand, their poly counterparts who joined the workforce after graduating from poly are mostly holding stable jobs and have clocked a few years of work experience when the economy slump occured. employers are also more keen to employ experienced poly grads, rather than fresh uni grads.<br><br>thus as you can see, you are not really at a disadvantage. with many viruses spreading ard, you'll never know when the dark days will come again. so, secure yourself with a job first to lighten the burden of your mum. stay for 2-3 yrs to get the experience (and savings). after that, like what others have suggested, u can get a part time degree, or full time degree but work part time. at least after u have gotten your degree, u still have some working exp. this will give u a competitive advantage.<br><br>dun stress yourself too much ok? best wishes.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A suggestion,<br><br>If you do get accepted into the uni(meaning your results qualify), study full time take a loan to pay for uni fees. Work part time if you need to support yourself. Partime work more fexlible and less stress and commitment.</div>

Work 1st. Can always go for a relevant degree when you feel that the economy is picking up and U-graduates are in demand. From there, you can then decide if you still wanna further your studies? Either opt for a part-time studies or even drop your job to go full-time studies if you want to? If luck is really on your side, you might even get your company to subsidise or contract you to support your studies... Options would always be available then. I personally find that it's more practical to tackle a realistic problem on hand (financial) then to opt for a better future... Provided that you can even have one if things don't go really work during your full time studies if you opt for it now... Still, future is unpredictable. It's your call. I can only advise you based on probability and options which are available to you... The way I see it? To add. Having a few years of working experience for now is never really a bad thing? May it be that you decide to continue working with just your dip in the future or further your studies...<br><br>Regards.</div>
