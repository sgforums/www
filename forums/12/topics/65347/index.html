            <div class='col-md body'>It's already quite obvious. She's trying to distance herself away from you because she don't want u to entertain false hopes. It's quite common. I guess she just wanna stay as friends.<br><br>However...........it doesn't mean that bcos of the above, she will never accept u. Remember, perceptions of a person can change. Nothing is impossible in this world.<br><br>Before you decide whether to continue pursuing her, ask yourself:<br><br># Do u really love her to the extent that even if being rejected many times, u still won't give up?<br><br># How much do you know her and what's her ideal type of boyfriend?<br><br># Do you think she is worth your love for her?<br><br># Will you purposely change certain triaits of your character to accommodate her?<br><br>Personally, I feel that sincerity is the best way forward. Show her your sincerity. However, you do not need to purposely change your character to accomodate her as this will seem very 'artificial' (unless of cos, bad habits). Be your natural. Projects a sense of confidence and warmth. Most importantly, don't force her to make a decision.<br><br>The process will be long and often demoralising. It really depends how much you want her to be your gf and love her. However, there must also be a stage whereby you must give up if all things failed. Nothing is impossible...but it's always advantageous to know when to stop..<br></div>

Everyone should belong to either one of these - either you are hunting or you are being hunted. Before you go into details with any of these, you have to recongise the Theory of Personal Space.<br><br>Everyone has their own personal space. Different people requires different distance. Personal space distance (PSD) in physical form refers to the distance she could allow for others in reality. E.g. when you enter the MRT train, your automatic thoughts would be to chose a seat with a considerable distance with the next passager (if its pretty empty) and you wouldn't chose a seat directly next to a passenger when the seats opposite you is totally empty. If someone does that: you will feel 'invaded &amp; intruded'.  However, it would be different if you see a good friend, he/she will be 'invaded &amp; intruded' at first instinct, but when he/she recongise you as a good friend, he/she lowers her PSD and you are accepted together in her comfort zone.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Its important to realise why things are happening BEFORE you come to a conclusion that you have to abandon the chase. Of course, <strong>in every chase, there is a risk</strong> - nobody says you will definitely succeed knowing why, but certainly it raise your chance of getting.<br><br>To handle your case, I would suggest the Progressive Line Extension (PLE). In simple: you have to recongise the Land Mines where you shouldn't reach and touch yet. In war, there are battle plans. In love, there are plans as well. People say 'Take it slow,' but seriously: HOW SLOW IS SLOW? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>This is the crucial part where guys never knew. I suggest go down to the nearest bookstore and zoom in for a book on Body Language. Your objective for (Lets give it a name) Phrase A, is to lower her PSD and to be accepted in her comfort zone. SHE HAS TO FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH YOU and NOT just you with her. Reading body language is your only way of realising if you have reach Phrase A. (Difficult for me to explain here ler, anyway, you should be able to learn with time and experience).<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Even if she is comfortable with you doesn't mean anything as well. Especially if she is a Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn. PLE has to go then. Imagine your objective in Phrase A is reached, hang around there until the next obvious signal is given and the Line Mine is moved further from its original position. Then move again and stop before you hit the mines. Hang around until the next obvious signal is given and the Mines are shifted again before you advance again. You know you have reached the end when:<br><br>I) She is comfortable to go on a 1v1 date with you<br><br>II) She talks to you totally without stress and tension.

Everyone should belong to either one of these - either you are hunting or you are being hunted. Before you go into details with any of these, you have to recongise the Theory of Personal Space.<br><br>Everyone has their own personal space. Different people requires different distance. Personal space distance (PSD) in physical form refers to the distance she could allow for others in reality. E.g. when you enter the MRT train, your automatic thoughts would be to chose a seat with a considerable distance with the next passager (if its pretty empty) and you wouldn't chose a seat directly next to a passenger when the seats opposite you is totally empty. If someone does that: you will feel 'invaded &amp; intruded'.  However, it would be different if you see a good friend, he/she will be 'invaded &amp; intruded' at first instinct, but when he/she recongise you as a good friend, he/she lowers her PSD and you are accepted together in her comfort zone.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Its important to realise why things are happening BEFORE you come to a conclusion that you have to abandon the chase. Of course, [b]in every chase, there is a risk</strong> - nobody says you will definitely succeed knowing why, but certainly it raise your chance of getting.<br><br>To handle your case, I would suggest the Progressive Line Extension (PLE). In simple: you have to recongise the Land Mines where you shouldn't reach and touch yet. In war, there are battle plans. In love, there are plans as well. People say 'Take it slow,' but seriously: HOW SLOW IS SLOW? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>This is the crucial part where guys never knew. I suggest go down to the nearest bookstore and zoom in for a book on Body Language. Your objective for (Lets give it a name) Phrase A, is to lower her PSD and to be accepted in her comfort zone. SHE HAS TO FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH YOU and NOT just you with her. Reading body language is your only way of realising if you have reach Phrase A. (Difficult for me to explain here ler, anyway, you should be able to learn with time and experience).<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Even if she is comfortable with you doesn't mean anything as well. Especially if she is a Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn. PLE has to go then. Imagine your objective in Phrase A is reached, hang around there until the next obvious signal is given and the Line Mine is moved further from its original position. Then move again and stop before you hit the mines. Hang around until the next obvious signal is given and the Mines are shifted again before you advance again. You know you have reached the end when:<br><br>I) She is comfortable to go on a 1v1 date with you<br><br>II) She talks to you totally without stress and tension.
