Boss will not be so mean, unless he really hates you to core. But that shldnt be, if not he wouldnt have hired you...<br><br>For your gf, have a good heart-to heart talk with her. Dont keep thinking of breaking up, because it is not healthy for a r/s. Unless you really wan to give up this r/s, or else, tell her what you think, what you expect, and AT THE SAME TIME, ask what she thinks and what she expects...<br><br>so u 2 can try n see wats the prob, hand-in-hand solve the problems in your r/s...</div>
