When a woman is in love, she does not terminate intimate relations with her partner and tell him that she needs him to just be her friend! I have this experience before, i tot i still have some hope but in the end its all over... She juz wanna be ur friends. Full Stop.<br></div>

Somehow like Yun has suggested, she could be in a 'drift stage'. Romance and bread.<br><br>Most women would love the 'romantic' kinda love which they probably so furiously engaged in at their much younger days...<br><br>She's somehow at a 'cross-over' age form mentality...<br><br>You can try Yun's suggestions of 'conquering' her, but chances are she've got an upperhand of the relationship. You can try... But it might or might not work, depending on her nature...<br><br>She's melted by your 'honey treatment', that's why she's with you.. The 'romance'. Partially like what Yun has suggested, she choose to remain in 'honeymoon' period... At least for now?<br><br>She probably have this 'Vision of Change'... An 'insight' that you would change one day... Much like other of her Ex did... She's enjoying the moments... But partially waiting for that day to come...<br><br>Like Yun and MC have suggested, she don't see the 'bread' side of you... And she thought it's quite unlikely that she'll be seeing it, and she should be quite right... Logically, you're like 'honey' - soft, sweet, caring... If you define the masculine factors, then her expecting of you to 'change' would have been realised... It could put her to much defence.<br><br>For a cross-over from a 'honeymoon' (temp?) relationship to a proper relationship, you'll need to establish to an extent the factors Yun have suggested... The 2 key factors would be... 1. How she can accept it (Her mentality?) 2. How you bring across that 'change'...<br><br>Advice would be to bring it across at a slower pace. Much not to her immediate attention and awareness. It's also important for you to maintain your 'original qualities' (honey) as you bring about the additional changes... As she would probably be 'reviewing' them later...<br><br>If you can't do the cross-over from 'pure romance' to the 'bread' thing... You should just be enjoying your moments with her... (anyway, the above mentioned is really easier said than done...) She would probably go for another when...<br><br>1. She thinks that you've changed and failed her criteria.<br>2. Her mentality has switched over to 'bread' and you still haven't meet her 'bread' requirements.<br>3. A better option comes along. (This would depends on her nature and mentality again as to if she would opt for such.)</div>
