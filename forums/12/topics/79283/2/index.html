Cos my understanding of english is not that strong... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  Anyway. i think what u 2 said is quite right abt the bread part.. I will be going into NTU soon, and she is currently jobless and trying very hard to look for job. As u all know, gals.. getting marry let's say b4 the age of 30..<br>i think i will try to go through what both have said and try to understand them and see what i can do... Actually what Yun said has never cross my mind at all. it's actually a whole new kind of thoughts which all my friends never said abt it b4 too... It's like what i felt abt her too, she has somehow or rather a kind of barrier in her and i just can't figure it out what the wall is...</div>

Somehow like Yun has suggested, she could be in a 'drift stage'. Romance and bread.<br><br>Most women would love the 'romantic' kinda love which they probably so furiously engaged in at their much younger days...<br><br>She's somehow at a 'cross-over' age form mentality...<br><br>You can try Yun's suggestions of <span style="color: red;">'conquering' her</span>, but chances are she've got an upperhand of the relationship. You can try... But it might or might not work, depending on her nature...<br><br>She's melted by your 'honey treatment', that's why she's with you.. The 'romance'. Partially like what Yun has suggested, she choose to remain in 'honeymoon' period... At least for now?<br><br>She probably have this 'Vision of Change'... An 'insight' that you would change one day... Much like other of her Ex did... She's enjoying the moments... But partially waiting for that day to come...<br><br>Like Yun and MC have suggested, she don't see the <span style="color: darkred;">'bread'</span> side of you... And she thought it's quite unlikely that she'll be seeing it, and she should be quite right... Logically, you're like 'honey' - soft, sweet, caring... If you <span style="color: brown;">define the masculine factors</span>, then her expecting of you to 'change' would have been realised... It could put her to much defence.<br><br>For a cross-over from a 'honeymoon' (temp?) relationship to a proper relationship, you'll need to establish to an extent the factors Yun have suggested... The 2 key factors would be... 1. How she can accept it (Her mentality?) 2. How you bring across that 'change'...<br><br>Advice would be to bring it across at a slower pace. Much not to her immediate attention and awareness. It's also important for you to maintain your 'original qualities' (honey) as you bring about the additional changes... As she would probably be 'reviewing' them later...<br><br>If you can't do the <span style="color: red;">cross-over from 'pure romance' to the 'bread' thing</span>... You should just be enjoying your moments with her... (anyway, the above mentioned is really easier said than done...) She would probably go for another when...<br><br>1. She thinks that you've changed and failed her criteria.<br>2. Her mentality has switched over to 'bread' and you still haven't meet her 'bread' requirements.<br>3. A better option comes along. (This would depends on her nature and mentality again as to if she would opt for such.)</div></blockquote>1st - what u mean by conquering her??<br>2nd -  Abt the bread thing? does it means $$$.if it's so.. hard lo.. mi going to NTU soon..<br>3rd - what u mean by "define the masculine factors" don't really understand.. show her i can be there for her to all her problems...?<br>4th -  what is your cross over thing??</div>

Meaning you more or less move along with her and her decision(s)... By 'conquering', I refer to being the more dominating party or at least strike an equal stand with her...<br><br>It's quite unlikely that she can see you as someone who can provide for her and take care of her when she's so much of a dominance... Though such cases may exist, but quite unlikely for this one...<br><br><strong><br>2nd -  Abt the bread thing? does it means $$$.if it's so.. hard lo.. mi going to NTU soon..</strong><br><br>Yes.. It's about money... It's also in career-stability... As you've posted out yourself, usually women of around 30 or so would be slowly drifting for that...<br><br>There are cases where the male might be 'poor' but still look upon as a 'bread' winner... That is when he can assure the other party that he has quite a bright future to come... Or at least a standard which can meet up to the requirement of the female in a reasonable time frame to come... It's about like an 'investment'... (though 'investment' might not be everything about in a love relationship) Alot would depends on the mentality of individuals...<br><br><strong><br>3rd - what u mean by "define the masculine factors" don't really understand.. show her i can be there for her to all her problems...?</strong><br><br>Not exactly... Refer to this... Courtesy of Yunhaier...<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by Yunhaier:<br><strong><br>She is a perfect victim for counter-seduction for she display much sign of weaknesses. I can't teach you on how to do that - but you can start by trying to take over the masculine role from her and make her listen to you psychologically. Don't always appear to give in and get emotionally over this thingy; learn to grasp her current thoughts and feelings quickly and plan according to it. </strong></blockquote></div></blockquote><strong>At the same time, you might wanna refer back to my 1st reply portion to you in this post regarding 'dominance'....<br><br><strong><br>4th -  what is your cross over thing??</strong><br><br>Age cross-over... Actually... Age can be quite 'transparent' at times for some individuals... So it's more of a 'mentality switch' of a female... Expecting different qualities from their partner at different points of their life...<br><br>In simple, it's just like how you like toys when you're young, then you start to make friends... And go for babes.... etc.<br></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I mean maybe i rather to have a no strings attachment with her than commit myself... if commit, i will only get myself hurt..<br><br>Anyway, she call mi last night, around 4 am.. she was drunk...ask mi to meet her at her place..I was like very strange then, cos after so long, this is the fist time she call mi after her chiong.. and ask mi go meet her.. Guys.. is there something on her mind?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> could she have a change of thoughts? But anyway, we were in the car for abt 10 mins, we didn't talk abt anything though... then i sent her upstairs back home..<br><br>When i was abt to go back, from a distance, she ask mi to go back to her house agin... holding her hands only... i wanted to kiss her. but in the end i didn't..asking her to back to sleep.. close the door then i go back home.. Maybe i should just give her a little peck, and get things romantic a bit <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br></div>
