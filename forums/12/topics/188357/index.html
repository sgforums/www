            <div class='col-md body'>Personally i feel that as long as a couple is not married, the words 'cheating' and 'third party' should not even come into the picture. After all, either party has absolutely no obligation towards each other as far as 'fidelity' is concerned.<br><br>What's the purpose of chaining someone up when the couple is not even married? You'll just make him an unhappy man for the rest of his life. There may be someone out there who is much more suited to be his lifelong partner. If you really love him, you should set him free and wish him happiness... and not be selfish and put people down as 'unfaithful', 'third party' etc etc<br></div>

Then might as well don't say 'bf,gf'. Attach means nothing,no obligation! She is yr gf but next moment can hug and kiss another guy? It is not abt chaining up someone but the word 'commitment'! U have already give a verbal promise, a promise in a mature r/s is not child play! LIke what u say,married liao can also having a divorce  like eating a sweet easily? An oligation not easily broken and not given up easily! Both needs effort to make things work. A r/s purely works on love is very dangerous..</div>

What happens when you two meet up with problems (what relationships have no problems?) and someone else starts wooing her? will you be able to trust her/him not to run off?<br><br>cornyfish2000: I agree that as long as they are not married, anybody is free to woo her/him. but as the party that's attached, I believe there's a mutual understanding between me and my bf. as long as we are attached, we will not date, or get involved with anyone else. If I really want out of the relationship, I'll break up first before even considering another relationship</div>
