B, who knows tat i like A, ask me to sent A home...but i was very tired then and i was afraid tat if i really going to send A home... i wont be able think of anything to talk with her, maybe just take train with her and walk her to her hse... so i didnt send her home afterall, meaning tat i go home with B...<br><br>So guys and gals...wat do u all think... didnt i make the right decision not to send her home as i might make her feel board and i think then it will be very awkward for me and her, just walking together and not talking cause i very tired then...and also i worry tat she get the wrong idea tat i like B...<br><br>so gals...how do u all feel if someone was to send u home but not talking to u and also look very lifeless all the way? would u rather go home alone?<br><br>and guys... do u all send your love one home even when u are really tired?<br><br>just for your information...i use to send A home most of the time we went out , in group or a date...</div></blockquote>Tiredness and unable to think of anything to begin a conversation are all EXCUSES. Imagine if you're with Fiona Xie or some other babelicious girls, even if you didn't sleep for 3 days 2 nights...you will still be motivated to fire away all the cheesy craps+nonsense...if you have to send them home. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You know all along that you did wrong already, and I think you did wrong in not sending her home when you used to do so. She won't get the wrong idea that you like B, but she will think that you're insincere towards her by breaking out of the loop and did you even let her know that you're not going to accompany her home on that day? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>Remember, there is not right or wrong things to do in a relationship. It's really the thoughts that count. If you really cared about her and due to some reasons that you are unable to send her home for that particular one time, it's sweet to let her know your reasons.<br><br>I'm sure A knows that you live in Punggol and by sending her home to Tampines, so to her...it is a sweet thing that you do for her. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>How much do you actually like her by thinking of EXCUSES for yourself in here? Maybe she is just an excuse to you afterall...guess she will feels that she deserves to consider someone who is willing to show her that he likes her more than you. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>What are you waiting for? Still don't know what to do?</div>
