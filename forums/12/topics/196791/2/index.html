            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: green;">Even if the walk home is a quiet one, at least you sent her home and if she doesn't appreciate that, she is not worth the effort. </span><span style="color: red;">And I ask you, what would the reasons be if you were to send a girl home? Find the answer deep in your heart. Is it a law? Is it a rule in relationships that guys must send girls home? Upholding all rules of the "game" = love? Sending a girl home must ultimately be something which you sincerely want to. Not just to uphold some stupid "rule". </span><br><span style="color: indigo;">I send my GF home everytime for the past years be it at night or day, be it I'm super tired or sick or even when I'm angry at her. Why? For the simple reason, I love her so much and ultimately I want her to be safe and sound reaching her doorstep or at least I see with my very own eyes that she has reached home safely. She doesn't demand it, I do it on my own accord. And unlike some guys who do it just to "impress" others that they have uphold such "laws" in the relationship. </span><br><span style="color: orange;">Dear threadstarter, I'm saying this not because I'm braggin about my realtionship, but I just want to show you and help you understand that when you like and care for someone, how much are you willing to go the extra mile for that person? You know what, even if you are really so tired to even send her home its understandable, but at least did you like call her up and ask if she have reached home safely or something? So my say, answer to your question is probably you made the wrong decision but it's ok there's still opportunities for you so good luck yah?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> </span></div>
