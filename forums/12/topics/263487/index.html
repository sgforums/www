            <div class='col-md body'>Love is something very...unpredicatable, even if someone managed to do a detailed analysis on the subject based on his experience and knowledge, things may happen very differently.<br><br>Things are always different with love because it involves people of different personality so one must not assume, only except taking the stand of being optimistic or being pessimistic.<br><br>My ex, well, she wanted a break up because we had a serious quarrel and she treated me like dirt when i tried to do something to salvage the relationship, i thought it was the end but however, a perculiar thing happen, when we started to talk again like after 3 months, she dropped hints that she still like me and wanted to be together again. Therefore if you want to court your ex back ( win is not a good word ), decide whether if you still love her.<br><br>If yes, go do what you need to do, if everything fails, just leave it, don't cling on to failures. Things you do now can really affect you in the future so try to reduce regrets.<br><br>I believed that being optimistic is a good thing but overly optimistic is bad so exercise some thoughts before doing. Always expect the unexpected!<br><br>be a man, do the right thing. I'm sure no one want to have regrets so do what you need to do and leave before any harm is done, be truthful to yourself.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>u want to be with her ??? There are two ways...<br><br>1) U wait for her to come back n find u... She wait for u to come back n find her... Then, like waiting for toto to strike or like korea drama, both of u coincidently met each other in the public place ---&gt; Provided she dont purposely hide from u when she saw u ... &gt;&lt; ... think I no need to tell u wat to do lah... if u dont noe, go and watch korean drama &gt;&lt;<br><br>2) Either the girl or the boy take the initiative. When a couple break up ,their mind will subconsciously cast a protective shield to prevent theirself from another emotion upset. And thus, they will be protective especially to their ex... If u want to have yr ex back, u need to strip their protective layer one by one without alarming yr ex... And thus u need to :<br><br>i) U must have a lvl of understanding on yr ex<br>ii) U cannot rush things or scare yr ex while trying to strip the protective layer...<br>And many many things to do ... Might as well find a new girl better...<br><br>Anyway, it is a bad idea to date yr ex on her birthday... U will scare her...<br><br></div>
