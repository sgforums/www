Even if I am with child I would not think I am entitled to have a seat.<br>Don't use this sh!t lah. Don't be stupid ans say unintelligent things.<br>When a woman is in the 3rd trimester, she would be fairly large and if she really treasure her kid, during the 3rd trimester, take the cab. So she is being irresponsible towards herself and her kid. Are the normal commuters at fault of a preggie is stupid to squeeze with the peak hour crowd?<br><br>In MRT, there are so many so many seats and so many so many people.  How some when an old person or a preggie comes in, no one ever gives up their seat?  Why should I always be the one. Why do people always assume they are more tired from work or have more right to take a seat than others. On MRT, usually only a few gets the seat. So most of the time I don't get to seat and I do not even fight with these Entitlement-Attitude people for these seats. So why are you always judging me about my attitude. Is it your BUSINESS??<br><br>Really, I find you guys very stupid and judgemental. I live by my own code of conduct and if you had to live by mine, I am sure you will not survive a day. Let me put it across this way, similar to Devil and MC. I do not see every woman, child and old person out there and think they need a seat more than myself. I do give my seat on a judgement basis. And many a times I feel faint and felt horrible pains and had squatted or took actions to alleviate my discomfort. NOT one, NOT ever, NO ONE ever Ever come and offer a seat. ALL the people in their comfortable seats turn their HEADs away and close their EYEs pretending that nothing happen. MOST of all, young TEEN boys will sit there with their Ipods blasting and shaking their heads will look on as if I am a freak. Even In the instance I gave up my seat, I find People STARE at me as IF I am a freak to give up my seat.<br>So the morons out there, please save your judgement to YOURSELF. You want to know discipline, come live my life.<br><br>Tell you what is entitlement. I had this ex-colleague. She thinks she is preggie and so she decided not to work herself. She then assigns her work to office colleagues and we ran around her like mad doing her job and trying to do our own. She was very thankless and stated to us her baby is more important than any of us. Hence we must (Note the key word here: MUST) help her do all the manual work. Actually, she confessed she just like to boss people around and so many people just give way to her and serve her hand and foot, so she took the opportunity to leech the other people's kindness. This is a real case and I've know many preggies who done that and got away cause they know they can.<br><br>So some healthy old people also caught on this idea as well and are really rude. Some old man asked my BF for money. When my BF say he's fairly healthy and well fed, my bf rejected. Then the old man started Yelling at the top of his voice cussing away. My BF then confronted him. Now tell me, when in this world did we owe this person a living that when we reject giving our money that we should get cussed at?<br><br>Do not be mistaken. I like to help people. Generosity and Charity is part of my general make-up however, I do not take kindly when people take me for a fool.<br></div>
