            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by mistyblue:</div><div class="quote_body">Excuse me lah. Even if I am with child I would not think I am entitled to have a seat.<br>Don't use this sh!t lah. Don't be stupid ans say unintelligent things.<br>When a woman is in the 3rd trimester, she would be fairly large and if she really treasure her kid, during the 3rd trimester, take the cab. So she is being irresponsible towards herself and her kid. Are the normal commuters at fault of a preggie is stupid to squeeze with the peak hour crowd?<br><br>In MRT, there are so many so many seats and so many so many people.  How some when an old person or a preggie comes in, no one ever gives up their seat?  Why should I always be the one. Why do people always assume they are more tired from work or have more right to take a seat than others. On MRT, usually only a few gets the seat. So most of the time I don't get to seat and I do not even fight with these Entitlement-Attitude people for these seats. So why are you always judging me about my attitude. Is it your BUSINESS??<br><br>Really, I find you guys very stupid and judgemental. I live by my own code of conduct and if you had to live by mine, I am sure you will not survive a day. Let me put it across this way, similar to Devil and MC. I do not see every woman, child and old person out there and think they need a seat more than myself. I do give my seat on a judgement basis. And many a times I feel faint and felt horrible pains and had squatted or took actions to alleviate my discomfort. NOT one, NOT ever, NO ONE ever Ever come and offer a seat. ALL the people in their comfortable seats turn their HEADs away and close their EYEs pretending that nothing happen. MOST of all, young TEEN boys will sit there with their Ipods blasting and shaking their heads will look on as if I am a freak. Even In the instance I gave up my seat, I find People STARE at me as IF I am a freak to give up my seat.<br>So the morons out there, please save your judgement to YOURSELF. You want to know discipline, come live my life.<br><br>Tell you what is entitlement. I had this ex-colleague. She thinks she is preggie and so she decided not to work herself. She then assigns her work to office colleagues and we ran around her like mad doing her job and trying to do our own. She was very thankless and stated to us her baby is more important than any of us. Hence we must (Note the key word here: MUST) help her do all the manual work. Actually, she confessed she just like to boss people around and so many people just give way to her and serve her hand and foot, so she took the opportunity to leech the other people's kindness. This is a real case and I've know many preggies who done that and got away cause they know they can.<br><br>So some healthy old people also caught on this idea as well and are really rude. Some old man asked my BF for money. When my BF say he's fairly healthy and well fed, my bf rejected. Then the old man started Yelling at the top of his voice cussing away. My BF then confronted him. Now tell me, when in this world did we owe this person a living that when we reject giving our money that we should get cussed at?<br><br>Do not be mistaken. I like to help people. Generosity and Charity is part of my general make-up however, I do not take kindly when people take me for a fool.<br></div></blockquote>it is easy to say this when u r not pregrant, the needle is not pricking u thus u can always say until the sky turn green.<br>furthermore not everyone is rich enough to afford a cab!! don't assume that!!<br>Every person has their reason, if she is facing financial problems, would u know???<br>Did i judge yr attitude in the first place??<br>I am just stating my belief, I never say that u r wrong as u r behaving as how u r brought up.<br>u r the one who think we r judging u n u r judging others by yr words.<br>In the end, u r only judge by yrself n no one else.<br><br></div>

No doubt, you said there are lots of stupid people doing stupid things. I second that, and I'll add 'stupid people who say stupid things'.<br><br>And your replies are senseless. Did someone died and made me God ? How the  hell does that happen ?<br><br>Emotional blackmail ? I'm one of them telling you how to think ? Then can the same be said about yourself with your childish remarks to people who just want to make life better for others ? If it stings your butt to get up and offer that damn seat of yours, go buy some cream and look at the community billboards for lessons on 'How to make people hate me less'.<br><br>You should be totally like totally be ashamed of yourself.</div></blockquote>Excuse me!<br>It is an alternative to public transport.

Its not the commutors fault that this person is finacially strapped and therefore needs to take the public transport. No one spent her money for her. As a soon to be mother, she can and should plan her day carefully as much as she can so as to reduce her risks. If she's really tired, she can selective use the different modes of transport. She does not need to take cab every day. ITs call Selective! She cannot spend a $20 trip just once when the Preggie is tired meh? She lost her brains when she pregnant? PPl got money to donate to NKF/Huang Na and etc but no money to take a cab ride when its really needed? Don't assume too much and don't assume that just cause a person is pregnant, others have to become responsible for her and her baby.<br>Don't give the sh!t that I am not a pregrant and therefore I do not know.<br><br>You are assuming that I do not empathize with these people. Is that not a judgement about me as if you know me and all my actions?<br><br>Of course I judge myself the most. Cause I have very high expectations and very high moral standards that I EXPECT myself to live by. No one is harder on myself that me. It really people like you and  jerks around here who keep point at other people making assumptions and appling one's idea of right and wrong on others. The actual fact is that what I say in forums is not what I do in reality and I give up my seats till I am sian and even pushed myself to do good things when I am not feeling so good and the sad thing is I KNOW NO other SG person who do so for that Poor person.<br><br>I am saying that not giving up seats is JUST a choice and nothing personal.  Ppl/Old/Young/Preggie Should not have that entitlement attitude because I see so many with that sort of attitude and even bother to write to the newspaper about it. I think these people should be shamed.<br></div>

I don't believe in expecting anyhting from my fellow country men/women and its a reflection of my perception of my fellow people.  My beliefs  had been tainted long ago by careless acts that endanger my life and the entitlement attitudes being dished out as if I owe everyone a living. However, I am fully and well above awareness that I should never apply it across the board and I am even more fully aware of my thoughts.  So do not worry for me that I do not give way or give my seat up. Most of the time I don't get any to give any away in the first place. Education does nothing for anyone except make them better workers in the office or at the factory and now it does not even guarantee a job. So don't put all that expectation into education. Besides, there is no prove that being more educated means these people can better empathize. Its a long held wrong assumption with no prove and correlation.  In fact, my observation is always that the higher the person is educated, the less the person have empathy for others. Just take a look at the big gaping hole between the top scholars running the country and the people at the ground.<br><br>Therefore, the one who is most unhappy is not the students but the person who created that feeling of expectation &amp; assumptions on others.  To me, no one is responsible for another person's comfort. If they want, they should ask. If they see the situation on that bus is that bad, don't blame the student/education.  They themselves can put on their thinking brains and find another way to get to NUS. Its not the first day that the bus to NUS is always packed. It had been this way since years already. Only the first time where a person with such indignation wrote such a kind of low class letter to the national papers.<br><br>I feel that if the person is really in need of a seat and its not possible on the two modes of public transport, then what's a little cash layout vs the health of the person and in some cases unborn child. Cab fare is maxed at  $25 - is one's health not worth $25? There are poor people but there are many more with misplaced priorities.<br><br></div>
