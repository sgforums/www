YES, it is very important that a person have the qualification.  You may argue with (one of, or a few) ur frd' current career that he/she is earning 10k/mth, but i CAN argue u with lots and lots of example of my frds who are only holding diploma(but very well-performed) still are crawling slowly. They are very good, in fact, some of them are better than degree, but sad to say, they think that paper qualification are not important, which makes the company think likewise: they are not important to the company as well. (though they perform well)<br><br>2) i feel they are a few types of people who feel paper qualification are not important..<br>1- people who are rich, and he/she don't bother to care abt money, cuz they are born with lots of it, they just need to reach out their hands to ask for money to set up business.. fail? nvm, ask for more money to fail again.. (failure is the mother of success, i think that's wad they believe)<br>2- people who are easily satisfied, don't mind crawling in their career and self-sufficient<br>3- people who are really very good, but if you are very good, i guess it wont hurts to get a degree? at least as a "show-off" also better than nothing..<br>4- people who think they are very good/smart/clever, BUT have not expose himself/herself to the reality, meaning, you might not even have entered the workforce yet..<br>5- people who work on sales, marketing (MLM, Insurance, broker?..etc) you need to talk well for that can liao..<br><br>there may be more types, but i feel these 5 types fits most of the people who feel paper are not important..<br><br>as for people who can succeed without a proper paper(and with no backing, not white horse), i salute them, either they are very fantastic or either they are very heng.<br>if you think you falls in the above range, i salute you too..<br>go without a paper then <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div></blockquote>Don't you know content is happiness?

            <div class='col-md body'>If I may make an observation, lonestar, one of the key things that's going to keep you from achieving any of your ambitions is yourself.<br><br>Read through your responses to other people here, and you can see that the emerging pattern is one of you finding problems with people's suggestions before you've taken the time to explore all options.<br><br>If you are going to achieve anything worthwhile, it's probably not going to happen quickly, much less immediately.  The least successful people I have ever come across all have one common characteristic - impatience.  This impatience leads them to do one of two things:<br><br>1) they either dismiss ideas without careful thought and examination (as you have done here), or<br>2) they keep changing their plans before the last one has had time to produce results, wasting their time, effort and money in the dropped plan<br><br>Do yourself a favour and get out of that dismissive habit.  Go out, do your homework and carefully study what's worked for other people.

Why i say not so important is maybe becos i have been lucky? I quitted school at sec 3 due 2 playfulness. Played and lazed for a few years then started work. I would say almost all jobs (include those i really work and also those i did not accept) range were minimum basic 1.6k to even 2k+. No i dun mean with comm,juz basic. B4 u guys start thinkin i got those those jobs those other ways like sleep with the boss (I am female), relative introduce..No, i got in using normal procedures. I feel strange when i hear grads saying cannot find job etc. Usually out of 10 interviews i attend i get accepted by 8.The reason i am attending course is juz to challenge myself get more knowledge .
