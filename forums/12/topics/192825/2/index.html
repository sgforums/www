Since you have a job, consider yourself lucky. You are still young now, and what you are doing now is just to gain experience. The pay is secondary.<br><br>What you are going to do after 2 years of NS depends on the diploma and other factors. You definitely will have a lot to catch up after 2 years of NS. Industries changes and you will need to read up if you intend to have a job that's related to your diploma. If you don't want, you can consider a career with SPF, SCDF, Prison Service, etc. If you want to go university, you definitely have to read to revise and recap.<br><br>What you are going to acheive in 10 years' time, depends on you. While education will help to a certain extent, the rest depends on you. You have to take the initiative and cannot wait for others to tell you what to do. You also have to be aware of changes around, be flexible and adapt to the changes. If you are not willing to change, what you acheived now will be the same as 10 years later.<br><br>You have to ask yourself what you are interested in to know your ambition. Your ambition can be your job, or it may not be. Some people's hobbies are their jobs, and they love it.<br><br>Your future is in your own hands.

You can always upgrade yourself.<br><br>If your diploma is about information technology, you have rather good prospects. Work for a few years, gain experience and go for certification exams. They can be vendor-sponsored, for example, by Microsoft, Cisco and Oracle. It can also be a vendor-neutral certification. A famous organization would be CompTIA. With the certifications, it proves that you have certain standard and therefore able to handle some tasks.
