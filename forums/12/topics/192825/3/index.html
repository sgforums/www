YES, it is very important that a person have the qualification.  You may argue with (one of, or a few) ur frd' current career that he/she is earning 10k/mth, but i CAN argue u with lots and lots of example of my frds who are only holding diploma(but very well-performed) still are crawling slowly. They are very good, in fact, some of them are better than degree, but sad to say, they think that paper qualification are not important, which makes the company think likewise: they are not important to the company as well. (though they perform well)<br><br>2) i feel they are a few types of people who feel paper qualification are not important..<br>1- people who are rich, and he/she don't bother to care abt money, cuz they are born with lots of it, they just need to reach out their hands to ask for money to set up business.. fail? nvm, ask for more money to fail again.. (failure is the mother of success, i think that's wad they believe)<br>2- people who are easily satisfied, don't mind crawling in their career and self-sufficient<br>3- people who are really very good, but if you are very good, i guess it wont hurts to get a degree? at least as a "show-off" also better than nothing..<br>4- people who think they are very good/smart/clever, BUT have not expose himself/herself to the reality, meaning, you might not even have entered the workforce yet..<br>5- people who work on sales, marketing (MLM, Insurance, broker?..etc) you need to talk well for that can liao..<br><br>there may be more types, but i feel these 5 types fits most of the people who feel paper are not important..<br><br>as for people who can succeed without a proper paper(and with no backing, not white horse), i salute them, either they are very fantastic or either they are very heng.<br>if you think you falls in the above range, i salute you too..<br>go without a paper then <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>
