Thanks.</div></blockquote>hey girl, u should try to relax urself more often, instead of stressing urself and anyhow think this and that, u should go for a holiday. Maybe go Sentosa? Go East Coast cycle with some friends or relatives? Go sit on the beach and listen to the waves, it'll help u think better... and relax better...<br><br>so abt later on, u can read up news papers every morning, understand whats happening around the world and market. And plan what u wanna do... an example will be, no point studying marketing and business as now the market are so bad, economy crashing and such... study what u like most, and useful in future... ok?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by raingal:</div><div class="quote_body">I had change jobs many time. Never work long in any company, all about 2 to 8 mths. Always bcos of colleagues problems. And I had to resign instead of staying to face the problem, due to health affected (too much stress).<br><br>I don't mean to always end up being unpopular at workplace and had to resign at the end. I know the problem is in me. I am immature, don't like to mix around, I scream a lot (due to stress), I am too sensitive, I am not assertive, I don't like to please anybody.<br><br>I was a cheerful, helpful, friendly and confident girl when I was in school last time. But now - poor self-esteem, quiet, withdrawn, negative and depressing lady. Now when I am stress a bit, I'll just can't sleep and eat well.<br><br>I've seek psychiatric help but they can only help me that much... (don't want to tok abt this).<br><br>A failure I am, I am out of job again. But this time, I only spend 2 mths to recover. Consider an improvement cos last time I spent about 6 mths. But no, I am still not ready to look for another job now, thinking of upgrading myself instead.<br><br>I used to like studying v.much (study until poly) and despite getting mostly Cs, I am already satisfied. Now I feel v.much wanted to study another Diploma course, but I can't make up my mind, whether to study Secretary, Biz Admin or Marketing. Either one is also helpful in my career. Just that, I don't know whether I'll have problems with my studies or not. Cos last time, I did enrol for a Certificate Part-Time Course, and I failed the exam, which I had never failed any exams during my early school days.<br><br>I finally have the courage to write my problem here cos I need advises badly... advises on how to overcome my colleagues problems. Thanks.</div></blockquote>Nobody's a failure, u r brave to admit u r immature, not everyone admits their mistake.  Think the most impt thing now for u to do is to upgrade yourself, go for the course, who knows u may get to know many gd frdz there.  U r not the only one studying, if others can pass, why can't u, giv yourself some confidence, mayb u shd try talking to someone instead of just posing a topic here, it's better to pour out your troubles to someone, u will feel better, but till now, just try to control your temper lor...<br><br>------------------<br>Hope to b your frd forever, Mike signing off</div>
