            <div class='col-md body'>Must keep in mind: Women are driven by emotions.<br><br>But in this case, men are vulnerable too. Some might call it a "crush". Some gals might get very interested in a guy and stick to him everyday. Then one day, for some reason, she wakes up from the crush and cut him off entirely.<br><br>Shit happens. Next time when u make new female frens, dun get emotionally attached so easily. Beware of their intentions. Even if they show all the good signs, dun get ur hopes up. Wait to see if they are still showing good signs after say 6 mths. And try to know a lot more abt their private lives/character.<br><br>I had friends who dated gals for weeks before finding out they are attached all this while!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>*same advice for gals too when dealing with guys.</div>

Then one day, for some reason, she wakes up from the crush and cut him off entirely.<br><br>Shit happens. Next time when u make new female frens, dun get emotionally attached so easily. Beware of their intentions. Even if they show all the good signs, dun get ur hopes up. Wait to see if they are still showing good signs after say 6 mths. And try to know a lot more abt their private lives/character.<br><br>I had friends who dated gals for weeks before finding out they are attached all this while!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>*same advice for gals too when dealing with guys.</div></blockquote>truez..<br><br>relationships are complex..</div>
