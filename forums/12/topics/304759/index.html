I tried to ignore him and was looking out into the windows<br><br>Then, as the bus got more packed, his body started to press against mine, and i felt a series of brushing movements. I tried to escape his pressing body, but the tight bus, gave me little room to do so.<br><br>I tried to endure till my stop, and made a quick rush to the exit and as i was down the steps, I felt my right #@$@ being squeezed and when i alighted, i noticed there was some sticky fluid on my skirt.... omg omg omg.... dun even know what that is.... think is his saliva or something..... its super disgusting and smelly<br><br>to all the fellow gals, please be aware, of this person if you are board bus 7</div>
