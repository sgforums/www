I was a customer then and found her very cute, but i was shy so my friend helped me got her number instead. She was 1 year older than me and it was august 5 we met.<br><br>we soon went out, and realised that we used 2 be so near each other. She used 2 stay at the opposite block, knew my kindergarden buddy, and we used 2 study at the same tuition centre, just that whenever she finished her lessons from 10-11, it would be my turn at 11-12. To think we always walk past each other.<br><br>September 15, we got together. however, 2 weeks later, she told me that her ex-bf of 7 years had approached her, and they had began talking. I didn't see anything wrong back then with ex's talking 2 each other so i didn't bother. However, 3 months later, a few days before christmas, she told me that her ex had asked for a patch-back. I told her that i trusted her to make the correct choice, and asked her to spend xmas with me. 2003 Xmas, I spend it alone, while she was in his company.<br><br>2004 January, i told her to make a choice btw me and him, she chose him and we broke up. just 2 months later, she told me she is not happy being with him, and went back with me. this time, we lasted only 1 more month before she told me her ex-bf needs her more than me.<br><br>2005 May, I attended their wedding dinner. Although I wasn't the bridegroom, i wished them happiness.<br></div></blockquote><span style="color: indigo;">pat pat*</span></div>
