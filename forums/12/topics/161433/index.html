            <div class='col-md body'>Just a little story of mine abt fate i had with a girl...<br><br>Fate has let me and J meet only until now... 17yrs later by an accident... 17yrs staying in the same blk... We nv met each other... Not even once... Neither in the lift, neither around the void deck, neither in the minimart behind our house where we use to buy snacks nor the playground we haf been playing since young... Not even once...<br><br>During our sec sch days... We both walked different path to home... She walked from the left carkpark of our home from the LRT station... I walked from the right carpark back home from the LRT station... Even though we haf the same destination... But still we have not met...<br><br>Since young we haf pass by each other so often... But nv get to meet nor know each other... I still remanber there was once she told me something which left me speechless... I told her i noe her cousins that were living in the same blk as us becos we used to take art lessons together that time... She asked "Was it in the community centre??... A male teacher??... Sat nite class??"... I was kinda suprise that how she knew... And she told me : "I was there as well... Taking the very same lesson"...<br><br>It left me speechless... I dunno what to say... Neither do i noe how to react... It just left me tinking... Tinking back abt the memories during that time... Somehow i feel as if i had heard her name b4 when the teacher was marking our attendence... "J" was what he said... But i nv looked up and look around for that person from my seat... Was it a mistake??... Or was it just fated to be so??... I was in that class for nearly 1 yr bah... For 1 yr... Our path had crossed in an unusual way... It intertwinded... But nv met... I noe everyone and everybody around her... She noe everyone and everybody around me... But we nv noe each other's exsistance... Till 17 yrs later... Till now... When we were still together... She was lying in my arms and asked : "Why couldn't we haf met ealier??"...<br><br>Now she had left me... Becos when we were together she was still attached... After deciding... She feel that she couldn't leave her bf behind for he was there for her during her darkest time in the hospital... I did not know her that time... So she went back to him... A sense of commitment??... I dunno... Im struggling to get back up again now...<br><br>What if i noe her ealier?? Would things turn out better??... Fate... Simple yet complicated isnt it??...

            <div class='col-md body'>A friend of mine told me how she was helping to tidy up her mother-in-law's home when she came across some photos of her husband when he was young. To her surprise, she saw a picture of her husband and her brother when they were both kids. Only then she realised her husband used to come over to her kampong to play with her brother regularly and she even 'remembered' him but didn't connect that little boy with her husband.<br><br>Fate works in weird ways....you never know how your paths might cross again <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>my own little story..<br><br>I got to know my ex ex gf when she was working at Taka's one of the shop. I was a customer then and found her very cute, but i was shy so my friend helped me got her number instead. She was 1 year older than me and it was august 5 we met.<br><br>we soon went out, and realised that we used 2 be so near each other. She used 2 stay at the opposite block, knew my kindergarden buddy, and we used 2 study at the same tuition centre, just that whenever she finished her lessons from 10-11, it would be my turn at 11-12. To think we always walk past each other.<br><br>September 15, we got together. however, 2 weeks later, she told me that her ex-bf of 7 years had approached her, and they had began talking. I didn't see anything wrong back then with ex's talking 2 each other so i didn't bother. However, 3 months later, a few days before christmas, she told me that her ex had asked for a patch-back. I told her that i trusted her to make the correct choice, and asked her to spend xmas with me. 2003 Xmas, I spend it alone, while she was in his company.<br><br>2004 January, i told her to make a choice btw me and him, she chose him and we broke up. just 2 months later, she told me she is not happy being with him, and went back with me. this time, we lasted only 1 more month before she told me her ex-bf needs her more than me.<br><br>2005 May, I attended their wedding dinner. Although I wasn't the bridegroom, i wished them happiness.<br></div>
