              Hi there,
               
              I am currently working in a co. and there is only the boss and me in the co. Basically, I 'do everything' in the co., including simple accounting.
               
              Ok, but that is not the point.
               
              Now, my boss has been borrowing money to supplement our co.'s finance. My salary has begun to be paid late and my co. owe me 4 months of CPF contributions, starting from Dec 2012 up to now. 
              
              If I were to tender, I have to give 2 months notice. I sent out a few resumes but was thinking, who would want to wait for me for 2 months? I am not holding any professional qualification or doing any senior professional position, so why would any co. want to wait for 2 months for a small fry like me? 
              
              I know maybe oneday if I were lucky, a co. is willing to let me have the job vacancy after 2 months but what are the chances?
               
              I do not want to get stuck in a co. that do not pay me on time and owe me the compulsory CPF contribution. I also need to pay my HDB instalment.
               
              What should I do now? Should I quit without a job? Start tender my resignation now?

              <p>dont resign first. go to cpf board or online ith your account and report late or no contribution of cpf. its your money have to take back. and also report your salary owed to authorities to take action. you work you get paid. ask your boss whether he also get paid or not.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>dont join this type fo small small company lah. unless youa re housewife retiress okay, get paid pass days. young challenging people who want to build their resume should join comapny of bigger scale, ISO certified or mncs.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>once you settle your payments tender resignation. dont wait anymore. like i wrote if you need to build your career and CV its justyourmmind hindering you to go. its all in the mind.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>like me, i do freelance photography, who wanna join pr partner with those freelances of small company? cases like this tends to happen. in my pass employments all i work full time for big comapnies, pay will be on time never late. you work you get paid. ppl wnat you to work for thm they have to pay. experience freelances or photographers with portfolios who wannto work for those photography comapnies? register to be boos of your own company one year how much only? buy licens for song to be used in video making how much only?</p>

              Just an update. Thanks for all the inputs. I really appreciate the advices. I was on MC last Tuesday. And I sms my boss, telling him to settle my CPF issue which he told me on Monday he would do so on Tuesday. When I was back on Thursday (Wednesday was a Labour Day holiday), as expected, he failed to keep his promise again. Anyway, I have on Tuesday decided to tender my resignation.  When I went to his room to submit my resignation letter, I casually told him to settle my unpaid monies. He briefly told me when the fund came in, he would pay me my CPF and salary.
              
              When I knocked off for the day, as I was having my dinner, I was feeling uneasy about my boss's attitude as I had 'caught' him looking at his mobile phone most of the time and there was no indication that he was trying anything to settle my issues.
              
              My uneasiness prompted me to send another sms to him asking when exactly the fund is coming in and when exactly I can get my April salary. Lastly, I told him I am not working for free.
              
              Next day, when I went back to work, he passed me the cash and told me to go CPF Board to do the necessary. 
              
              If I had not pushed him to pay me, I think he would have taken his own sweet time to pay me as and when he feel he can afford.
