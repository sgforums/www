I lied for no reasons at all... I just find it 'fun' and 'challenging'.... Until one day I got pretty tired of it.... Ever since then I hardly tell lies (not that I don't...)....<br><br>I think males and females alike... Sometimes you just need to lie... Be it BGR or any other form of relationship... Maybe it for a selfish reason or a truly noble one... Like already mentioned by others... It's all a matter of your perception of things... Seeing 'lies' as a form of act, its rights and wrongs are equally subjective... Cloudy... Sometimes to question the 'true intention' of it is like to rip a person's heart apart and question his/ her innermost conviction.... And even then you would only be able to see a throbbing heart?<br><br>For your questions... Yes. I do lie to my gfs.<br><br>About suggestion to your problem. I didn't suggest anything before because I think some of the forumites who posted before me gave quite sensible suggestions?<br><br>It could simply be some misunderstandings. Or no ill-intentions but fear of unnecessary arguement(s) form of lie? I don't know. Because I don't know him at all and I know little about your relationship with him to give much comments. He could also be lying for some 'evil intentions'... Something deep down in his roots?<br><br>But like most have already suggested, communication is important. Know the source of things though sometimes it's easier said than done? And alot of time it's purely up to your own judgement... And the depth of your love and trust for each other?<br><br>I just added. It's nice of you to still cool but do not keep things at the bottom of your heart for too long without attending to them or things may erupt too suddenly even for him to react... May it be misunderstanding or not....<br><br>All the best?</div>

Until one day I got pretty tired of it.... Ever since then I hardly tell lies (not that I don't...)....<br><br>I think males and females alike... Sometimes you just need to lie... Be it BGR or any other form of relationship... Maybe it for a selfish reason or a truly noble one... Like already mentioned by others... It's all a matter of your perception of things... Seeing 'lies' as a form of act, its rights and wrongs are equally subjective... Cloudy... Sometimes to question the 'true intention' of it is like to rip a person's heart apart and question his/ her innermost conviction.... And even then you would only be able to see a throbbing heart?<br><br>For your questions... Yes. I do lie to my gfs.<br><br>About suggestion to your problem. I didn't suggest anything before because I think some of the forumites who posted before me gave quite sensible suggestions?<br><br><strong>It could simply be some misunderstandings. Or no ill-intentions but fear of unnecessary arguement(s) form of lie? I don't know. Because I don't know him at all and I know little about your relationship with him to give much comments. He could also be lying for some 'evil intentions'... Something deep down in his roots?<br><br>But like most have already suggested, communication is important. Know the source of things though sometimes it's easier said than done? And alot of time it's purely up to your own judgement... And the depth of your love and trust for each other?</strong><br><br>I just added. It's nice of you to still cool but do not keep things at the bottom of your heart for too long without attending to them or things may erupt too suddenly even for him to react... May it be misunderstanding or not....<br><br>All the best?[/b]</blockquote>well said, i totally agree.. we not sure the intention of ur bf and we duno him. its juz base on wad we see on the forum and suggestion for u to heed or drop it.<br><br>gd luck.</div>
