One must keep an open mind, be tactful and convey not only the events that are happening, but the thoughts and feeling as well. Even when you know that he is lying, allow him a chance to explain from his view as well - sometimes, he could be innocent. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Discuss it as if you are problem-solving - you will discover that gradually, he will be more forth-coming with his honesty.
