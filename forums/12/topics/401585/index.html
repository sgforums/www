              <p>Hi bros and sis, im new to this forum so I sincerely appreciate any advice given.</p>
              <p>I got to know this girl in the office for only a few days. Then she left after 3 days and I took over her job fully. During the time, she was very helpful and im grateful to her for that as she has her own work to do too. I asked for her msn and fb, but I forgot to ask her contact number from her, so I got her contact number from her friend. I tried to ask her out for dinner as she was a nice young lady. Ok so we meetup for a simple meal and the day ended nicely after that. By being a gentleman, I send her an sms saying that do let me know when you reach home safely. Afterwhich, she did reply saying that she has reached home safely. I chit chat with her a bit thru sms and I wished her goodnight and tot I had ended the day. Then, 4 days passed and I have not contacted her.  Then on the fith day, I sms her Ive got smthg to give her are you free tml? But she didnt reply. I tot she didnt receive my msg and and so at nightI sent her a msg asking her if she had received my sms in the afternoon. No reply from her also. Then I conclude that she is trying to avoid me. Should I call her becos my fren say I should as there might be some mis 
              communication. Some frens say that I might have scared her with my 
              actions. I am very puzzled by this. I need some advice as to what should I do next.</p>

              <p><br>Yes, you might have scared her... Continue to msn and chat with her to a comfortable level first. Make her feel you are a friend first and not just an ex colleague. She only know you for few days  and you already wanted to specially ask her out and give her a gift?  Too fast and furious since you mention she is a nice lady.</p>
              <p>Nice lady cannot take such fast action.</p>

              <p>Sounds like u have been a superb gentleman.</p>
              <p>It could be that after your date, when u chatted with her on the phone, she might have felt that since you've chatted so much on the date, why chat more instead of letting me wash up and go to sleep.</p>
              <p>I find that talking to a person too long spoils the magic. Normally when I am on the phone, and the conversation starts to get dull, I will say</p>
              <p>'OK, I got to go. I hear mom calling me. Speak to u tomoro'.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, it could be OTHER REASONS. Don't torture yourself and SECOND GUESS the reason. Just call her.</p>
              <p>If she picks up, say u sent 2 sms' to her and was concerned something happened to her. But now you know she's safe, you feel relieved.  THEN HANG UP.  As her out a fornight later, NOT now.</p>

              <p>she is going to australia for 1 year to further her studies somewhere in early july. But prior to asking her out again, i may need to clarify myself over what thing I want to give her becos i did not state in my sms i am going to give her a self made tiramisu. But now if i give her, i think it would make the matter more complicated becos she would think very far as to why would i make a tiramisu for her specially.</p>

              <p>This date was just a casual dinner between office colleagues. Just like u having dinner with your male buddies.</p>
              <p>You
              cannot force her (lets say Jasmine) to love u. But finding out her
              thoughts wouldn't hurt. And being manupulative (WITHOUT EVER TELLING
              HER) might worl to your advtg.</p>
              <p>U: Hi Jasmine, I brought a gift for u but I would also like to speak to u privately, is that ok?</p>
              <p>HER: Sure, lets go to a private corner.</p>
              <p>U: I made this tiramisu for your going away party, I hope u like it</p>
              <p>HER: O my God, the tiramisu looks lovely. U are such a wonderful ex-colleague.</p>
              <p>U: Yeh, to be frank, my mother helped me to make it. People also tell me i have butter fingers</p>
              <p>HER: I think that is the most touching thing someone has ever done to me.</p>
              <p>U:
              O comon. I'm sure your parents have touched your hear so many times.
              BUT KNOW THAT U MENTON IT, there is a 2nd thing I like to talk to you
              about.</p>
              <p>HER: What's that?</p>
              <p>U: I wouldn't mind keeping in
              touch with u when u are overseas. I know u have a lot of friends. But
              do u have the time to answer my e-mails. My reaso is that I usually
              have many issues and complications in the office and I would like your
              opinion (because u seem to be proficient in solving office politics).</p>
              <p>HER: Of course, sure. Write to me anytime. I'll email u my oz no in case u need to call me.</p>
              <p>U: Really appreciate it.</p>
              <p>Comment: What u are aiming at is communication. And communication is on a regular basis. U call her n u tell her your office problems.
              She consoles u. But u must also ask her how everything is at oz.  If
              she says she has problems settling in, offer a solution. Google b4 u
              call her to find out solution in settling in a foreign country. They
              give a lot of tips. Then use those tips to console her.</p>
              <p>Comment:
              U must be realistic that if she spends 1 year in oz, she might meet a
              guy whom she likes. So NEVER have any expectations, since u are not
              committed to her, and the relationship is casual. But if the phone
              calls keep coming in, u know she's becoming comfortable with u. So in 9
              months time u say</p>
              <p>U: 'Can I be frank. Over this period I've seem
              to become quite attached to u. I don't know why. It seems I connect
              better with u more than any friends I have. Our previous phone
              conversations so resonated with your character.I wonder if we can try
              going out after u return. I would like that very much. IT'S OK TO SAY
              NO. I am not the type of person to fporce someone to out if she doesn't
              want to.</p>
              <p>SHE: Uh, well...I am curently seeing an Australian man right now, so I don't know if it would complicate matters.</p>
              <p>U:
              But we are just PLATONIC FRIENDS. U enjoy my friendship and I enjoy
              yours. It would just be a casual dinner between u and I. Nothing to
              worry about.</p>
              <p>She: (open minded after being in a white country): Alright then.</p>
              <p>In the meantime while u r eating with her, I'll bash up that white bas#$#d to a pulp.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'm very good at this eh?</p>

              <p>thank you bhw that was interesting haha...but Im only a temp staff and my contracts ending soon Im still studying. she was a temp also. That's why I replaced her.Actually, besides the tiramisu, I want to lend her a book also which I think it might come in handy to her when she is in Australia (the book is from my sis as she is an ex student in Australia).  I tot that she would ask what am I going to give her then I would tell 
              her but I didnt expect this. I called her today but no one answered. I then dropped her a msg saying that I need to pass her the book which might be useful to her. That time she mention that she has problems finding accomodation in Australia online.</p>

              <p>a trick with courtship is about positioning....thats the first thing u need to establish...how could one position in someone else's mind in few days (rarely...). But continuous assurances is important to make yourself visible....</p>
              <p>now she is going o Australia and has set on a plan .... u should do the same and keep an open mind...think further as she may be back with a degree...and what about u? if u keep being poetic without doing anything towards a successful career...i strongly believe your love is going to fail u....she is sure to come back and if u bump onto each other....i m sure she will first want to know what is your job...CONFIRMED....</p>
              <p>BRO,....wish her well...and keep in touch as fren and socialize to know more gals,...BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY...GET AHEAD BEFORE SHE DOES...MAN IS MEASURED BY HIS CAREER (THOUGH YOU CAN BE THE NICEST AND MOST POETIC GUY)</p>

              <p>Tell her you have won Toto and you would like to give her $50k cash to thank her for whatever blah blah and you need to pass it to her close to her home cos you are afraid she would be robbed on her way home.</p>
