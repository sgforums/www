              <p>Hi bros and sis, im new to this forum so I sincerely appreciate any advice given.</p>
              <p>I got to know this girl in the office for only a few days. Then she left after 3 days and I took over her job fully. During the time, she was very helpful and im grateful to her for that as she has her own work to do too. I asked for her msn and fb, but I forgot to ask her contact number from her, so I got her contact number from her friend. I tried to ask her out for dinner as she was a nice young lady. Ok so we meetup for a simple meal and the day ended nicely after that. By being a gentleman, I send her an sms saying that do let me know when you reach home safely. Afterwhich, she did reply saying that she has reached home safely. I chit chat with her a bit thru sms and I wished her goodnight and tot I had ended the day. Then, 4 days passed and I have not contacted her.  Then on the fith day, I sms her Ive got smthg to give her are you free tml? But she didnt reply. I tot she didnt receive my msg and and so at nightI sent her a msg asking her if she had received my sms in the afternoon. No reply from her also. Then I conclude that she is trying to avoid me. Should I call her becos my fren say I should as there might be some mis communication. Some frens say that I might have scared her with my actions. I am very puzzled by this. I need some advice as to what should I do next.</p>

              <p>When you say tiramisu, *chuckle* i thought you were going to "bake" something in the toilet for her. Haha !</p>
              <p>Move on lar buddy. You tried everything to woo her, she is just not receptive. You are right, she is a nice girl. Some girls even they don't like you, they play hard to get. But you are fortunate that she is good girl but shy to let you know how she feels about you.</p>
              <p>Tiramisu and books are just too much for her to handle. You should have moved slowly. From that lunch date, to movies or another meal, perhaps? If you can't progress more than that, than forget it.</p>

              <p>I'm just a very poor girl in real-life with no earning income at all. Please do not bully me with all your awesome wealth. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>Anyway, I am aware that you do not have good intentions towards your predecessor so I had to write all those in order to expose your real intentions.</p>
              <p>But not to worry, because you can still return in a form as another new and innocent forumer. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
