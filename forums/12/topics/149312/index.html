            <div class='col-md body'>haiz... its v terrible... here goes the story...<br>(by the way, im currently a o lvl student)<br><br>some time last yr, around this period of the yr, i told my feelings to this gal tht i like. then she told mi tht she did have some feelings for mi, but she juz ended a relationship with another guy and need some time to settle down b4 she can accept another relationship. okay, so i accepted the reply and she asked mi to maintain the feelings.<br><br>then, some time in the beginning of oct, she told mi tht she had alot of stuff to concentrate on because she was the president of the student council and chairman of the chinese orchestra. moreover, she had to cope with studies at the same time as she wasnt doing well at tht time. yup, i have to understand tht and i contunue to wait. until the end of last yr, she told mi tht it will be better to be frens and didnt really give mi a reason(she said tht theres no reason, gan qing this kind of thing its hard to explain).<br><br>after tht pt of time, i was giving up alr becoz i believe tht theres no pt in pursuading a relationship if she doesnt like u anymore, am i rite? then the beginning of this yr... the first few months... i felt tht she kept coming close to me and i can sense tht she was trying to regain tht relationship. then i decided to ask her wht she intended to do. she said tht she wanted to start with me after the o's. okay... since i still had feelings for her.<br><br>then after tht, we had been going out to study, and she also toks to me abt alot of things abt her. and it was recently tht this terrible thing happened! tht sat we were supposed to go out and she told mi tht she couldnt go out anymore le. then on sunday, she didnt reply my msg and i got fed up abt it and was telling her abt it. then she came online and once again told mi tht it will be best tht we be frens and not to start any relationships.  again, she didnt give a proper explaination abt it and dun you guys think its v immature way to handling such stuff? its like small kids having puppet love then break up for the sake of breaking up? okay, then its ok. no matter wht i still have to accpet it. then it comes to the most terrible part. she told mi tht she was actually with another guy now and they had juz started! WAH! i really felt cheated at tht time. she didnt even bothered to explain the whole thing to me. i was the one who called her to ask her to explain things properly. its ridiculous. i didnt expected tht she would have start with another guy and i got to noe tht they went out on tht sat when we are supposed to go out. i really could not agree with her way to handling of relationship. she was like running away from facts and didnt want to explain things properly.<br><br>she told me she started liking tht other guy since 1 month ago and didnt noe how to tell mi as she scare it will affect my o's which is ard the corner liao. she kept saying its her fault and shes sorry abt it. but the way she say it, its seems to mi tht she wasnt sincere at all. she was juz trying to make mi like a fool. i couldnt stand it and our conversation tht night was a heated discussion. i simply could not control my anger and u noe, men's hormones are uncontrolable. then in some ways and i duno how, she said tht i hurt her with my words and i backstab her which i cant believe i did tht! dun u guys think its v funny? and now shes the one angry instead of mi and says tht we are impossible to be frens anymore. but i think if i really say things tht hurt her, its my responsibility to settle it and whts more, she my classmate. it wont be nice to be enemies.<br><br>so, wanna ask u guys, wht do u think of the whole situation? wht u guys think i should do? im really in a dilemma.<br><br>NB: take note tht this is my brother's prob. preparing for o lvl, hope u guys can help him one way or another thnx <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> as a elder brother, really cant bear to see him feeling so bad everyday and i think this is considered to be his first love.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>firstly i will say the gal is very fickle minded about the types of guys she wants. And is she worth your effort to wait for her?? and even so, will she come back to u?? And you did try once.. but once again, she choose another guy instead of u.. So i guess that her feeling for u is not as strong as urs.. So why bother waiting for her the second time? Your first time waiting for her is right.. As she could have feelings for you.. But yet again...... So is best that you forget about her and find a new love.. As she does not deserve you waiting for her..<br><br>And Smap, she did tell her that " she said tht she wanted to start with me after the o's. okay... since i still had feelings for her. " isn't it a commitment on her part to start with him?? then later on, she turned to another guy... So she is not sure what she want..</div>
