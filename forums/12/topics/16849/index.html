            <div class='col-md body'>Seven years ago when I went steady with my girlfriend, there was no love between us.  We like each other because we like each other company.<br><br>As I recall clearly after a year of going steady with her (till then I still do not know what is love yet) I went for an overseas trip for some work assignments.<br><br>Before I left Singapore, my girlfriend cried so much till it broke and touch my heart that very day.  Only then we both knew we love each other so much.  I really miss her so much that I made up my mind then to finish my work in less than two weeks which is supposed to be for five weeks.<br><br>I came back to Singapore and there she is greeted me with the most warmest loveable hug.  She began to cry and I knew the love that she has for me was real and all this was too much for me and of course a drop of tears began to roll on my cheek too.<br><br>Now then I call this is love.<br><br>----------------------------------------<br><br>That is why only when something bad comes along then we will know what is good.  Only when separation comes along then we will know what to cherish.<br><br>------------------<br>Relax and have a cup of kopi</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To say that love is a feeling is so dangerous. Feelings change, thus they are not dependable.<br><br>Love is a decision. And in love, there are different stages ~ a couple late in their marriage may feel so different for each other as compared to their courting days, however, their kind of love is stronger, like a glowing coal... unlike love in the youth, where it is like an uncontrollable raging fire.<br><br>Both have to make the decision to love one another from that moment onwards, and give each other the security that no matter what happens, neither will pack their bags and leave, but will stay and support the other party through it all.<br><br>To arrive at this stage, definitely we cannot (anyhow anyhow) make this promise to anyone. Personally, my man should one whom I will choose to be my best friend, if he were a girl.<br><br>Nevertheless, through the tenacity of the friendship over the years (initial lust would most likely wear out by then...) and the commitment to communicate and connect with each other is what holds the friendship steady. Knowing that both of us are not perfect and will never be, yet both of us continue to run the race, holding each other hands, at the same time cheering each other on to be better persons and to complete the journey together.<br><br>I think it's so wonderful to know when you're in your loved one's arms, you take refuge from the harshness and the cruelty of this world. And that security to know that even if you were to do the most disgusting things in front of your partner, he or she will still love you nevertheless.<br>You are each other's refuge away from the world.<br><br>And most importantly, the relationship should not be a constant source of stress, but a regular stress reliever. (The relationship, not the sex.)<br><br>Saying all this, I must be able to do the same, or else it is unfair to ask this of another person.<br><br>That, to me, is love.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To me, true love is there when both of u experience it. It doesnt matter whether now or future and whether the whole relationship will last. To me, whether a relationship will last or not depends more on communication and other factors. What it matters in a relationship is now and how u are managing it now. If everything goes well now, won't it be ok oso in the future?? Thus to me true love is being trueful to yr partner regardless of the future.<br><br>------------------<br>Love has its own time, its own seasons and its own reason for coming and going.<br><br>You cannot bribe it or coerce it, or reason it into staying.<br><br>You can only embrace it when it arrives and give it away when it comes to you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You know when you find true love :<br>1)When he or she will feel the same way as you do, and you can understand the person and devote yourself to the r/s which you start<br>2)When u don't ask for her hand, and she will automatically grab yours. Same goes for guys...<br>3)When the person is always there for you regardless whether you love him or not. Unrequited love is noble but yet very few people have ever appreciated.<br>4)When you know that you could feel happy and be relieved from whatever pain and suffering which you are feeling so much to give away.<br>5)When u can tell yourself that you are a complete person and can drive yourself to greater heights. A good life is one which is inspired by love and guided by knowledge.<br><br>If you believe there exists true love, then you have to wait..... I am still waiting, what about you?<br><br>yours,<br>prodigal</div>
