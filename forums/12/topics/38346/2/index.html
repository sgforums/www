You tends to think too much? Many of your suspicions won't be so easily answered... If you CHOOSE to trust your bf for now, you should stand by him and ACCEPT whatever consequences that might follow.... Like always said, nothing venture nothing gain.... Probably only time can give you the answers to your questions now.... If you DON'T trust him at all and find that there really isn't much point to give him a 2nd chance, you should be able to easily leave him without regrets....<br><br>2nd point. From the way you've described the way you visualise things.... I'll urge you to seek professional psychologist or psychiatist's counciling if you can...? Else, give yourself much more REST (don't think too much...).... Whether your bf's gonna be with you for good or he might go to other girl (or the same china girl) now is NOT the main issue... It's kinda OBVIOUS as to what the China girl is trying to do to you...? It's an indirect mental torture for you.... You scrumble to this, you LOSE IT BIG.....<br><br>3rd point. PERSONAL OPINION. I SENSED that your bf might be really trying hard to have you back with him... But whether you forgive him or not is an issue which lies between the 2 of you... I can't guarantee as to what kinda bf is he gonna be for you in the future, but chances are he COULD be genuine for now...? The FACt that the China girl is trying to DRILL into your head for 'revenge' (?) indirectly shows that she's not getting her ways with your bf.... Having any difficulty getting over things? Talk it out with him.... (if you've decided to accept him as your bf...) Afterall, he's the one who started it all? He should be eager enough to help you out of it if he's GENUINE and CONCERNED enough...? And if it's really the relationship that you wanna save (which I certainly hope so?), try NOT to keep bringing up the PAST and BLAMES on him (since you've decided to forgive him?) and allow him to work out the relationship into the BETTER for BOTH of you...?<br><br>Not to add additional pressure on you but adding on 'unneccessary' pressure and blames on him would only further push him OFF the track for the RECOVERY of your relationship.... In NO WAY would this be of advantage to either of you....<br><br>THINK of what I've just said...?<br><br>By the way... What's your star sign girl...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Virgos seems to have a common problem of thinking too much  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> I think that's what Loneryu00 meant by corrupted.<br><br>&lt;-------Virgo<br><br>Though if you are particular about star signs you might be comforted to know that Virgos and Taurus make excellent partners.<br>Both are materialistic, practical, admire efficiency, and are homebodies.<br><br>As a Virgo i understand your problem when the little demon in your mind start reminding you of bad memories. My solution is either to pack up my stuff and just go out and take a good long walk alone or find something occupying to do(Jogging, a good book..etc). Once you've spent the time working off that excess energy you will<br>realise it is better to believe in yourself than in what your little demon tells you. Virgos tend to get obsessive in their thoughts too easily but you should always have a stop switch in your mind that tells you to think of something else when bad memories pop up.<br><br>Of course i'm a guy so my solution might not work as well since guys are well knowned to be dense and gals to be more emotional.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"></div>

There's no exact numbers on it.<br><br>But to the question on Taurus.:<br><br>I won't deceive you - he's no one's idea of a tempestuous lover. Patient but forceful would be a better description. He will take his time deciding what he wants But he will never give up until he gets it<br><br>His passions are slow to focus, but when he finally has you clearly in view - look out! You may have to scramble if you want to get out of the way. You'll probably prefer to stay there and enjoy it.<br><br>Don't waste coquetry on him. He'll know you're just being coy. The more you try to con him, the more obstinate he becomes.<br><br>If you've know your man for any time, you know he is stubborn. This is in fact the more stubborn sign of the zodiac. Don't lock horns with him, because he is not going to yield. He may try to use persuasion if he has an intellectual turn of mind, but if neccessary he will finally command. If he is the physical type and you are being difficult, he will communicate his needs even more forcefully. The taurus male IS physical. This is part of his attraction, He is earthly, lusty and sensual.<br><br>Well there's a lot more. I'm copying off a book.<br><br>If you like toss me an email and i'd type up the rest in an email.<br><br>outcast9@singnet.com.sg<br><br></div>
