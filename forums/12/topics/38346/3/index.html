The other factors are QUITE 'time degradable'....<br><br>The CHANGE in him should quite rapidly take place especially if he've chosen to start a business... That period and after you'll probably see quite a different man.... I think you did mentioned that you've been with for for quite a while (3 years or so?).... Well... I'll make a DARING ASSUMPTION here? You have both either just beginning to explore and know each other during that period of time or simply engaged in quite a ROUTINE or 'LUXURIOUS life style' of dining and enjoyment of such....? I'll place a higher bet on the latter.... And SEX is probably of utmost importance between you and him.... And that could be HIGHLY the important FACTOR that have been keeping the 2 of you together... (of course I'm not saying that both of you are together just for the sake of that, but that it's sort of like an ESSENTIAL on both parties' mind...)<br><br>And other negative factors might lie in you which I shall not go into details for now as they're no longer of much importance here...<br><br>If you're just looking for a short-term or non-commitment relationship just to enjoy each other's company as time permits, I'll say just go ahead....
