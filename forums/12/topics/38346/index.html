Thanks..</div></blockquote>Dear GaL<br><br>Scars will always remain, the question is regarding whether the feelings is still there, inclusive of the scar. Have that incident remove that kind of chemistry and love? Its an issue to ponder. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>5 years is a long time you have been with your bf, therefore it would take equally long to settle your 'betrayed' feelings. You have realise that your bf isn't that guy he seemed to be - therefore you trust for him is minimum - until when time has passed long enough for recuperation to take place.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Your self confidence is affected because you wonder why on Earth would he do that in the first place - Joho's saying comes to your mind? 'A perfectly satisfied man will never look for another woman.' But well, if he does - it is an issue to ponder and reflect isn't it?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>All of your behavior are normal behavior that people undergo - moodswing, no trust, etc, but well, you wanted to give it another chance for it to grow eh?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>I) First and foremost, settle your inner fury quick to an extend where you know it will never burst out like volcano again, which is regarding the trust thing. Tell yourself, this is the first and the last time you are giving him this chance, anything after this is a gonner.<br><br>II) Secondly, solve issues regarding this issue of two timing. If you people were to continue to go on the relationship without understanding why in the first place things happen, its may be the begining of another wrong move. Understand and speak about why things are happening in such a way.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>E.g. Questions like 'When the moment you went with her, what going on in your mind, as in does my image ever come to your mind?' 'Is it something wrong with this relation that causes you split of love? etc, etc, etc.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Remember, once you settle this two issues, make a pact that this will be forever behind as a memory served to build this relationship stronger. You have to let him know that regardless of quarrels, since this is already settled and concluded, it shall NEVER come into the picture ever. Stop commenting things like 'She is much better aye?' kind of thing - you are simply not giving him chance (Noticed: you did said you wanted to work out for this relation eh? Not I say must - you made the choice yourself). Make sure you truely settle and concluded the feelings, thoughts and rationale behind I &amp; II before claiming this point.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>P.S: Everyone deserved a second chance, but never more than that. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>

I can try to do an 'analysis' for you if you want me to, but note that such are only PREDICTIONs and should on no level match with the REALITY....<br><br>Skipping some of your more difficult questions...<br><br>If you've decided to stay with him then you should very well LEARN to TRUST and FORGIVE him... If your mentality don't change, dragging on to this relationship would probably ONLY proves to be a TORMENT for BOTH of you....<br><br>If you feel that there's NO WAY that you can bury the past... Then I'll just urge you to let things go... Apologise to him if you want to and just let him understand that you can't do it....?<br><br>There's a <strong>3rd option</strong>... But it's NOT a very good option... Buys you CHANCE but probably TORMENT at the same time.... I shall not mention it for now as it probably won't be a very good choice for now...?</div>

But since we've already been together for so long, I knew tat i can't live without him..so i somehow managed to endure through abt 7mths of this ordeal....<br><br>She also talked about the problems she has on her studies here...how this triangle relationship is affecting her studies..that she knows she's just a passing rain and tat the guy will be back to me soon..etc..and to think that I actually at some point believed her and sincerely went around looking for tuition centres for her!! Even before she boarded her plane for a holiday back to china, she called me and say tat she' leaving but my bf doesn't know...I actually asked her to give him a call cause I dun want both parties to hav regrets...she kept acting noble and say no, but in the end also called...<br><br>Though she's already back in singapore currently, but Im very sure tat my bf did not contact her these time...even so, it's a really hard thing to forgive and forget...sigh...</div>
