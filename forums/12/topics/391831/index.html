              <p>We are in different schools currently but we still hang out as a group.</p>
              <p>I confessed to her 2 years ago in which i got rejected. </p>

              <p>but i do not know if she noticed it, since she is very friendly with everyone.</p>
              <p>Currently, I am thinking about confessing to her again.</p>
              <p>I bought something for her but just do not know how to give it to her.</p>
              <p>So i have some questions which i hope you all men/ladies can advise/help me on.</p>
              <p>1. Do the gift seems like a bribery? I don't want her to have that thinking.</p>

              <p>Congrats if you succeed. I also have not heard of anybody successfully chasing a gal a second time - when the first time she rejected him. Oh yeah, actually i have ! The person was Nicholas Cage. He married his first wife but she at first rejected him. But when he came over to her for second time - she accepted him. But they ended up in divorce.</p>
              <p>But seriously why her? There are millions of single Singaporean girls - and you want her??? Just move on. I once knew a friend in your similar position - he chased the girl third time but no success from age 19 to age 27. That's like 8 years.</p>

              <p>Hi JustaNick,</p>
              <p>I will suggest that you give the gift along with some flowers. That way, your friend will get the idea and hence will not ask about your reason for buying her a gift.</p>
              <p>Anyway, since you have decided to try again, then put your very best into it - Be honest but not to the point where it seems like a confrontation. That way, you will not regret that you tried even if she rejects you once again. All the best to you.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>This is my suggestion in a step by step way:</p>
              <p>1) Do not give her any gifts at all. Period. This is just lowering your value in front of her. Never put any girl on a pedestal.</p>
              <p>2) Get over this girl ASAP. The more you start to think about her and try to "confess" your feelings for her, the worse it will be for you.</p>
              <p>3) Realise that you have been put into the "Lets just be friends" zone and that it is very hard and not worth your time to try to get out of this situation. What you need to do is completely ignore her, find other girls who are way hotter and more receptive to you and go out with them instead. If she tries to contact you, ignore her messages, emails, phone calls, facebook pokes etc...etc...</p>
              <p>4) Hang out with other girls who are way hotter and more receptive to you. You will then realise to yourself that there is nothing special about this previous girl. And you will be a much happier guy.</p>
              <p>Trust me on this. I've been through this situation before and it is not worth your time. I have had guy friends who tried to kill themselves just because a girl rejected them and they all had this warp mindset that there is no one else available for them. Total utter garbage. Social conditioning is telling guys that we must treat women with complete special attention and have that one true love always in our minds. Never believe that. It will only lead to your prolong suffering.</p>
              <p>So take my advice, stop seeing this girl, and instead, learn from guys who are naturally good with women on how to attract them into your life and begin exciting, sexual and powerful relationships with them.</p>
              <p>Peace and piece.</p>

              <p><br>I once pursued a girl for 3 years with no success. The worst thing was that when I confessed to her, she did not say "no", nor "yes", but "maybe in the future".</p>
              <p>But well, on hindsight, sometimes its a good experience. It helps a guy to grow up. I was like a little puppy in the past.</p>

              <p>Good advice there by laido77.</p>
              <p>When you reach the highest levels of courtship, you do not need to care whether she likes you. You just need to know you love her without expecting anything in return. You have to realise that not every girl is going to like you.  Somehow guys who court women have this mindset that "she's not going to like me... Im doomed to have a sexless/loveless life" </p>
              <p>Well, if you think that way, you shall become that way. If you think there are so many girls to choose from and live a happy abundant life, you will feel that the situation is not as bad as you think it is.</p>

              <p>anyway....since u bought it...dun waste it...take courage and give her...surely the gift is for her returned love and nothing else...to think it idealistically that u hope nothing in return is lying to oneself...because you give her as you love her as much as you want her to return that same feeling you give...</p>
              <p>never apologize for your gift...tell her you give it to her because you want to give it to her badly...if she sees yr gift as cheap...thats the answer to your great intensity of feelings for her...move on </p>
