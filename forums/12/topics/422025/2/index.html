              <p>Dont hesitate and dont feel guilty........if you dont feel an emotional connection with that person......it is ok to separate........obviously emotional connection is very important.</p>
              <p>Dont feel guilty about it......its still early and you guys are just dating......breakup is normal....and its good to breakup now early, rather than getting married later and then have unhappy life forever, right ?</p>
              <p>Just say you prefer to be friends.....good friends...</p>
              <p>Money, dont return.</p>
              <p>It is more awkward and cruel if you return any money and gifts.</p>
              <p>But maybe for you yourself, you can try to put aside some of his things so you dont see them, so that you can move on easier.</p>
              <p>Well, dont worry, this is a good learning experience. Now you can understand yourself better and can understand what you seek in a relationship.</p>
              <p>Ok good luck.</p>

              <p>Oh? Who u talking about? Why u refer urself as a dog wif pig brain. I know u lonely grandma wif false teeth, very jeolous of single guy like me - so wanted in public. Dun go and put urself down n call urself a rabid dog barking to be put asleep. I know u in high school used to wear heavy metal braces and get rejected a lot by guys like me. Go to IMH lah, mebbe u can find a lot of dates wif ur own kind - Bonker kind.  </p>
              <p>I contribute a lot of help to the forum ok. I help a lot of people here.</p>

              <p>I'm not sure whether I should even be serious with this forum. I
              shall just try my luck here and see what I can get.</p>
              <p>I've broke up with my ex of 5 years. It's been 10 months. And
              feelings of guilt never really left me. Sometimes when I come
              across stuffs that he gave me, memories of us will start to come by
              and I'll start to tear.. Sometimes I really wonder the reason
              behind why I'm tearing. Was it because I'm starting to miss this
              person or was I feeling guilty? That after all these years of him
              treating me so well, I just have to leave him.</p>
              <p>He was actually a very nice person to me. He paid attention to
              my needs. He took really good care of me. He bought presents for
              me, things that I couldn't really afford since I was then a
              student. He wasn't some rich kid either. His pay was meager,
              probably sufficient for his living expenses. Savings were just
              barely much. But he just wanted the best for me, he would get me
              gifts cause he knew that the gift would make me happy, no matter
              how much it costs. These only showed he's not a person who just
              showers you with presents, but also with whatever he can afford,
              he'll give the best to you. That's how nice he is. He treats his
              parents and friends well too. He's a filial son. His nature of
              work requires him to work long hours with little
              pay. Whichever job he chooses, he just wished that he could
              fork out the time to spend time with me after work. </p>
              <p>But I still felt something's lacking between us.. Something
              called chemistry and the kind of emotional communication and
              engagement through verbal words. What's lacking between us is like
              we tend to attend to our physical needs but our emotional side of
              it seemed to have been neglected. Some of my emotional problems
              where how much I wished I could pour it to him, somehow weren't
              really well-received. I've tried to pour the kind of what I term as
              my emotional communication to him, but the responses I get from him
              could only be this much. I just wanted him to understand me more,
              understand how I'm feeling inside more. Why did it seem to be so
              hard? Maybe people might say that some people are just not good at
              words. I totally agree with it. But I really think communication
              between a couple is really important to sustain the relationship
              for the rest of our journey. This is something that was really
              lacking in that relationship and I really felt very terrible
              carrying on, with thoughts that I really wouldn't want to be
              someone who doesn't really understand me in my heart. My emotional
              needs. I did try telling him the kind of emotional needs that I
              wanted.. But 5 years.. I just still didn't seem to get it from the
              relationship that I decided to end it. I really want to start my
              pursuit of my so called happyness.</p>
              <p>Can someone tell me if I was wrong? I mean there's no turning
              back. I just want to clear what I'm really feeling inside.</p>
              <p>Some of the money that I used to owe him, should I return it
              back to him? Or should I just let go and forget about it? Money to
              him is pointless already..? I don't know.</p>

              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"> It seemed that you have come a long way before you call it quit. To execute such a decision wouldn't be easy for anyone in your shoes and it must have been a struggle internally. </p>
              <p>You said he attended to your needs - but somehow I sense slight discrepancy in your post: perhaps in reality, what he has fulfilled are merely 'less qualitative' needs that may be important, but not essentially critical. It seemed to me that you have a deeper need that remained unsettled and he doesn't appear to understand how to go about addressing it.</p>
              <p>Since you have already moved along, here are some questions for you to ponder over:</p>
              <p>i) What exactly constitute your emotional needs? Would you be able to describe what exactly are you looking for, instead of lumping everything under the category of 'emotional needs'?</p>
              <p>ii) You pinpointed the singular cause of the failed attempt to understand your emotional needs to the lack of mutually communication. What exactly caused this lack of communication? Was the relationship like that when you first started out?</p>
              <p>iii) What is the symbolic representation in the act of returning him money? What does the act mean to you? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="icon_idea.gif"></p>
