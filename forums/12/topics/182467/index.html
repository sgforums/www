How? This was what I said.<br>"Ok, look guys. I need to ask you all to please don't control my life. This is <span style="font-style: italic;">my</span> life. Not yours. I can do whatever I want with it. Please respect my freedom and my decision. I can hang out with whoever I want and you all just keep your mouth <strong>shut</strong> and lemme do what I want! You people are not the friends that I want! Why? Because the fact that you all are <strong>unloyal.</strong> See what you done to Amanda. She is now left there alone crying her hearts out while you all just sit there talking to each other like nothing had happen. I don't understand you guys! Why can't we all be in perfect harmony? Oh wait. I uttering complete rubbish. The word harmony has the word harm. Oh, and please, I am NOT in your clique. I am just a friend. I am not your best friends! Not until you all respect ME for WHO I AM AND WHAT I AM. You have been messing around with me for too long. Way too long. I am not your punching bag to punch with, ok? Why can't I hang out with my real true BEST friends? WHY? Every single thing I do, you find some fault in it and say it. What kind of friends are you? Friends who pretend to be the forever-friends type? Well, sorry, but I am not AN IDIOTIC STUPID GIRL. So bye bye and please do think this over!"<br><br>I actually shouted this and the everybody there heard it. And tears sprung up in my eyes. REAL tears of sadness. And then...applaud. From MY class. Then the boys are started saying, "Well-said!" and the teachers came to me and said, "Well, we have a young mature lady here!" and those friends of mine was quiet.<br>Then one of them stood up and said, "Sorry." and walked off. So did the others.<br>This happened during recess and I must say, it was one of the best experience ever!</div>
