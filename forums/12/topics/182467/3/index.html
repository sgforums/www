Well, if you really don't want to give up, then don't.<br><br>I never gave up on trying to revive a particular friendship (which was almost completely destroyed because my friend somehow found <strong>my private blog where I'd written about my more-than-platonic feelings for her</strong>) because I didn't want to lose it... and probably because I just can't give up la huh.<br><br>After about nearly a year of her avoiding me and not replying to the dozens (maybe hundreds) of SMSes I sent her, she somehow forgave and forgot, and we went back to being good friends, perhaps better ones than before.<br><br>So I guess it's really up to you as to whether you think her friendship will be worth all the effort you put in... But seeing that you've already put in a lot of effort, I'm not sure... Try giving you and your friend a break. I hope you gave her and yourself a break during the school holidays!<br><br>No matter what decision you make, good luck to you (:</blockquote>Yup...ppl has said dat i should give up on dis friend...but to me...like u...i dun wish to give up...luckily...she did not find out my blog as well...with all my feelings bout her...erm wads platonic btw?

Until now I still don't know if she's just a very very special friend or anything more than that, but anyway...<br><br>I don't know if you've already done it before, but try writing her a letter? I think you need to communicate to her the idea that you really cherished the friendship and want the both of you to be friends again. Tell her to try and think independently of what her other friends are saying about you, and remind her about the times when you were good friends? I mean, she must have liked you as a friend for some reason so just try and remind her of that?<br><br>But I don't get why she would hate you? Maybe its her friends fanning the flames and all, but still? Hate is a bit too extreme and wanting to forget you like throwing all your stuff away is a bit too much too, in my opinion...<br><br>Maybe you should just let her cool down first, really. And to be honest? Two weeks without interaction is actually quite a short time... I went through months of not communicating with my friend, except for "official" or school matters like having to hand in work or whatever because she was the history rep. Otherwise she practically ran away whenever I was around, and we never talked to each other at all, even when we were talking to our other friends in the same group. My class was small so basically everyone just talks to everyone.<br><br>I guess it's a lot harder for your case cos of those two "friends" of her adding fuel to the flames but there's really nothing much you can do if you really want to save the friendship. You just have to grit your teeth and keep trying no matter what.<br><br>And oh, if you're blogging about all this... Stop. Really. She might be reading the blog and thinking things like "Why is she so hung up over this?" so if you really need to, write it down in a journal. Don't publish it on the internet AT ALL. I learnt that the hard way.<br><br>And what I did was to act normal, actually. I didn't ask her to forgive me or anything (also because I wasn't sure as to why she was ignoring me... I didn't know or realise until a few months later) but just acted like nothing was happening. You might want to try to be as normal as you can. Hang out with your other friends to show that you CAN live without her, it's just that you really want the friendship back. I know it'll be hard because it feels like you can't go on with life properly around her, but just keep with it.<br><br>And lastly, if it really is too painful, just forget about it. You'll definitely make a lot more new friends in life. You're still young and have many places and years to go. Don't deprive yourself of other friends just because of this one friendship, as much as you really cherish and want it.</div>
