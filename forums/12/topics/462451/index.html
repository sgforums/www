              <p>In 2008, when she told him she was getting married, he says he abruptly disappeared from her life in a dramatic fashion, like a complete disappearance without saying bye. I think he was really crushed. It seems like she did marry the following year and still is married.</p>

He confirmed that she had married but from what I knew he couldn't really tear himself away and was in a limbo, exchanging weekly pleasantries with her until mid 2011. I thought he had finally moved on when it stopped, but I found out that he masked his cell number and called her at the start of 2012 to hear her say Hello, and hung up.</p>
              <p>I believed that he finally moved on early this year (2012), but I discovered that he had looked at her profile daily all through October and stopped himself only after Halloween. He discovered that she had moved cities with her husband.</p>

              <p>You sure you want a creep like him ? really ?</p>
              <p>I mean this guy will stalk someone else's wife. Call her in the
              middle of the night with a private number and hung up when she says
              hello... one word " <strong>Psychos</strong>"</p>
              <p>Does her husband knows about him ? He'd be hanging an axe near
              his door when he finds out.</p>
              <p>If he is my ex, I'd immediately cut off contacts with him and
              wipe my digital footprints off the internet immediately.</p>
              <p>Is it possible for someone having sneaky feelings for 10 years..
              yes it's possible of cors..but only creeps do that.</p>
              <p>Do yourself a favor girl, go find someone "NORMAL". </p>
              <p>You think he won't do that to you too ? Get a clue. You'll be
              his next victim.</p>

              <p>Well, he just wanted to hear her voice and he only called once, not say called repeatedly and not at night. </p>
              <p>Her husband doesn't know about him. She loved him as well, but fate was against them, according to him. And my friend isn't stalking her. It's just one call and looking at FB photos for 1 month. How can it be considered stalking?</p>
              <p>If he'd do that to me, that would be what I want. </p>
              <p>What I don't understand is, he cut her off and does not want to talk to her once she got married. How can a man not want to talk to a woman he loves, but still want to check on her and hear her voice every 6 months? Seems to me its a contradiction. That's why initially I thought he's over her. </p>
              <p>Maybe men can't be JUST friends with a person they love.</p>
