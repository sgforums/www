            <div class='col-md body'>Hey guys... I gotta admit something b4 I asked for any help here...<br><br>...I'm an arse....<br><br>OK, as some of u might remember, I fell out of love a few months back. Well, I just got into another relationship like a few weeks back. I guessed I kinda rushed into the relationship. We hardly knew each other, and we got together. I didn't force her into it, we were both willing parties.<br><br>We have been together for like 3 weeks now. She's a really sweet and young girl. She's 7 years my junior. She really cares for me and from what I feel is she has fallen in love with me.<br><br>This is where the problem comes in. She loves me a lot, but sadly I can't say the same for myself. I find myself still thinking abt my ex. I still can't really let go of my previous relationship. Maybe the reason why I got into this relationship is just to keep myself occupied. Maybe I needed company. That's why I'm call myself an arse.<br><br>Somehow, I feel that I'm being unfair to her. I do not want to waste her time. She surely deserves someone whom is so much more worthy of her love. I feel that I should end this relationship ASAP cos I think if I drag any further, it would only cause her more hurt.<br><br>Can anyone advice this arse what to do? This is my 1st time being the bad guy.  I've never dumped anyone before. I'm the one getting dumped in all previous relationship... lol. I do not know how to tell her w/o causing a huge impact on her. I do not wish to cause her major hurt. I was hoping to end things in a peaceful way and maybe still maintain as friend if possible. I know it's kinda hard to remain friend, but I really do not wish to lose a friend.<br><br>ps: call me what u want... i do not mind the names u call me or whatever. I know I'm in the wrong. but pls.. help me out a bit here...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>
