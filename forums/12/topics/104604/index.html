According to FHM, Men's Health and other publications, many studies has indicate that the best signal for a guy to approach a girl is by eye signal.<br><br>If a girl and a guy lock their eyes to each others, numerously, it will be a signal that the guy can approach the girl to introduce himself.  Of course, girls can reject if they are not comfortable.<br><br>Than again, in your case, the guy may be interested to get to know you. Afterall, you are in the same class.  No harm done to know another friend.  You DON"T have to provide him any of your numbers and so on if you don't like to.  If at later stage, he kept asking you out.. well, you can reject if you do not want to accept him.<br><br>Don't think too much over it.  Keep it simple, keep it natural.  Let fate do the work.</div>
