            <div class='col-md body'>Every person will need to find four people in their lives. The First person is you. The Second person is the one you love most. The Third person is the one who love you most. And the Fourth is the one you spend the rest of your life with.<br><br>In life, firstly you will meet with the one you love most, and learn how love feels. Because you know how love feels, so you can find the person who loves you most. When you have experienced the feeling of loving others and being loved, you will then know what it is you need most. Then you will find the person who is most suitable for you, to be able to spend the rest of your life with.<br><br>Sadly, in real life, these three people are usually not the same person. The one you love most doesn't love you. The one, who loves you most, is never the one you love most. And the one you spend your life with, is never the one you love most or the one who loves you most. He is just the person who happens to be at the right place at the right time. Which person are you in other people's life?<br><br>No person will purposely have a change of heart. At the point in time when he loves you, he really loves you. But when he doesn't love you anymore, he really doesn't love you anymore. When he loves you, he can't pretend that he doesn't. Same goes, when he loves you no more, there's no way he can pretend he loves you.<br><br>When a person doesn't love you and wants to leave you. You must ask yourself if you still love him, If you also don't love him anymore, do not keep him just to save your pride. If you still love him, you should wish him happiness, and hope that he will be with the one he loves most, not stop him from it. If you stop him from finding true happiness with the one he loves, it shows you already don't love him, And if you don't love him, what rights do you have to blame him for a change of heart?<br><br>Love is not possessive, if you like the moon, you can't just take it down and put it in your basin. But the moonlight still shines upon you. In other words, when you love a person, you can use another method of possessing the person. Let him become a permanent memory in your life. If you really love a person, you must love him for what he is. Love him for his good points, and the bad. You can't wish for him to become like what you like him to be just because you love him. If he can't change to become what you like him to be, you don't love him anymore. When you really love a person, you cannot find a reason why you love him, you only know that no matter when and where, good mood or bad mood, you will wish to have this person be with you.<br><br>Real love is when two people can go through the toughest problems without asking for promises or listing criteria. In a relationship, you have to put in effort and give in at times, and not always be on the receiving end. Being away from each other is a type of test. If the relationship isn't strong, then you can only admit defeat. Real love will never become hate.<br></div>

The one you love most doesn't love you. The one, who loves you most, is never the one you love most. And the one you spend your life with, is never the one you love most or the one who loves you most. He is just the person who happens to be at the right place at the right time. Which person are you in other people's life?<br><br>No person will purposely have a change of heart. At the point in time when he loves you, he really loves you. But when he doesn't love you anymore, he really doesn't love you anymore. When he loves you, he can't pretend that he doesn't. Same goes, when he loves you no more, there's no way he can pretend he loves you.<br><br>When a person doesn't love you and wants to leave you. You must ask yourself if you still love him, If you also don't love him anymore, do not keep him just to save your pride. If you still love him, you should wish him happiness, and hope that he will be with the one he loves most, not stop him from it. If you stop him from finding true happiness with the one he loves, it shows you already don't love him, And if you don't love him, what rights do you have to blame him for a change of heart?<br><br>Love is not possessive, if you like the moon, you can't just take it down and put it in your basin. But the moonlight still shines upon you. In other words, when you love a person, you can use another method of possessing the person. Let him become a permanent memory in your life. If you really love a person, you must love him for what he is. Love him for his good points, and the bad. You can't wish for him to become like what you like him to be just because you love him. If he can't change to become what you like him to be, you don't love him anymore. When you really love a person, you cannot find a reason why you love him, you only know that no matter when and where, good mood or bad mood, you will wish to have this person be with you.<br><br>Real love is when two people can go through the toughest problems without asking for promises or listing criteria. In a relationship, you have to put in effort and give in at times, and not always be on the receiving end. Being away from each other is a type of test. If the relationship isn't strong, then you can only admit defeat. Real love will never become hate.<br></div></blockquote></div>
