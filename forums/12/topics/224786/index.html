            <div class='col-md body'>People can't help who they end up liking. This is true. I've come across 6 guys in my life and 4 out of 6 turned out to be not what I would call "good boyfriend material." Till this day I think about it and wonder how I ever liked them.  Not good looking, not too rich, and didnt posess a nice guy personality. Biggest regrets of my life if you ask me. But I realised they all had something in common. They smoked, maybe taken drugs, treated potential girl friends like trophys more than anything else, sweet talked a lot and were pretty fickle minded.<br><br>So I've come up with this theory. Because this is what I think made me end up liking those "guys".<br><br>Girls like going out with bad boys. Even if bad boys smoke, drink, take drugs, or treat their girlfriends like crap. Girls like to think that they have the power to make him fall in love with them and somehow "change for the better." That if no one else could do it, they could manage it. Changing a bad boy into a good one is somewhat of an accomplishment, something to boast about, something to feel good about. Dramas potray the typical story line. Ordinary girl meets bad boy. She feels inclined to "change" him. He snubs her off again and again. Bad boy is actually a "nice" guy inside. They get together. The end. Happy Happy. I'm sorry to say life is not a movie. Be realistic, a guy will not change who he is, what he does, his habits, his personality for anyone. Even if he does so, it is only "temporary." After the break up, he will go back to who he was before. Because that is who he truly is.<br><br>A smoker will remain a smoker. A drinker will remain a drinker. A druggie will remain a druggie. A guy who treats his girlfriend like crap will continue to do so.<br></div>

Once they change, you will find that these guys are no longer attractive.<br><br>I think that's why some girls keep getting hurt if they do not realise that part of the problem to the equation is with the type of guys they "thought" they like. This is another reason why most guys don't get it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
