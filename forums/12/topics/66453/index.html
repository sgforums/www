Sigh~</div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Seriously, I kinda hate this kind of situation, but sometimes, Cupid loved to put people in such plight, just to see how you get out of that pit-hole.<br><br><strong>She comment that she rather back out so that her friend could stand a chance.</strong> - her attraction is not strong enough for her to do something drastic like to follow her heart. Her friends likes you and she rather give up her choice than to be branded as someone who 'steals' guys.<br><br>Its real silly how woman thinks (doesn't mean she back out definitely you would go with that girl or doesn't mean you would like her right?).<br><br>Then how? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>I) Employ pressure to stop people from 'playing cupid.' Cease people from cracking jokes between you and that girl whom you don't fancy. Cease everything from suaning to plain humor relating to the both of you. <strong>Make</strong> people stop. Employ strong body language and don't accept their matching as a joke.<br><br>II) Steel yourself and firmly answer to these 'cupid people' that that girl whom you don't fancy isn't the kind of girl you are looking for. Not your style, neither someone you would see as a girlfriend. If people ask, just speak off your mind. If one day she were to express her liking - be tactful, but say what you ought to say.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Nobody can force you to be a relationship that you don't want.<br><br>About the girl whom you like - I can only say Passive Advances. In simple go passive advances from getting to know her better to even better and so on. The decision lies within her. You can't put pressure on her for you can only allow her to make her own choice through your chase as the catalysis for that to happen. Both of you understood each other feelings - the main problem is about her. If you did what was right to trigger her liking into love - she could forgo society norms and mental barrier to be with you. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Keyword: Make her fall gradually.<br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>IMHO, the girl you liked backed out is simply becoz that will break the rules of the cupid game if she becomes your gf. yeah, it will sour the friendship between her and her friend.<br><br>unless, the 'cupid-girl' had officially refused to play the game...the game ends and you stand a higher chance of being with who you want.<br><br>in matters of heart, such goodwill things will also happen even when the 2nd girl is really keen...but she will stick to her principles and bite the bullet. these kind of girls are rare...just imagine the scenario changes to...being a 3rd party to a couple...some girls will snatch other bfs away, some dont....they rather wait.<br><br>maybe u can try any chance to clarify what the cupid-girl is thinking. if she said she doesnt like you for real (she must not regret) ...ok go ahead and pursue your real love.<br><br>i think most girls now still prefered to be pursued. in my view, even i am 'paired' with a guy by all those teasings...i will wait for the guy to confirm his feelings for me. if not, he has the freedom to love someone he truly do.</div>
