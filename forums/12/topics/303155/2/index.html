            <div class='col-md body'>ok. so lemme ask, is it really true that the TS is giving in all the time?<br><br>perhaps yes ONLY DURING an arguement. how about the times when TS made small mistakes and were accumulated to become big enough to spark a quarrel? that is why the gf wants TS to give in during a quarrel probaly because she has been putting up with his nonsense before the quarrel started.<br><br>TS sometimes you got to reflect. sometimes you might REALLY be in the wrong though you think that you're not at times. sometimes this occurs to me too because i can't understand my girl as well. (well not surprising huh) no doubt that you give in at times when you think you're supposed to be in the right. your girl knows that too. trust me. she probaly feels bad inside for making you eat in her faults.<br><br>anyway TS i know life isn't going to go on if you're going to give in all the time. let me cite you a <strong>fact</strong>. your girl will eventually start taking this 'giving in' thingy for granted and starts to take advantage of the situation everytime. everytime a quarrel sparks she will expect to be in the right. in chinese its called "de chun jing chi" (taking advantage when one is being nice to you)<br><br>anyway TS, treat yourself like you're in a video game. you have a life bar. each time both of you quarrel, your life bar decreases each time you give in. not saying that you should not give in but not all the time. eventually your life bar will deminish and you'll die. how long your life bar is, you decide.<br><br>try to have a good talk with her over this matter. before your life bar drains you out that is. try to talk to her during the night when things are quiet. face to face not over the phone or worse still MSN. good luck  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
