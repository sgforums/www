The thing is now, although he is with the other girl, I told him I will wait for him.<br><br>Right now he says he doesn't know why we broke up, he knows he still loves me but he cannot and will not choose between me and the girl until his financial problems have been solved.<br><br>Our relationship right now is, like we see each other and sms occasionally. Will still hug and stuffs if we see each other.<br><br>The reason why he 'diverted' his love to the girl was that she was able to provide him comfort during his troubled time while i couldn't, hence he started to like her yada yada..<br><br>So we have officially broken up but it's not totally over between us. I know it is quite stupid to still be hanging on to this guy but I just wanna look for suggestion as to how can i cope with this emotional duress every single day as well as what i could do to show that i am more 'understanding' towards him, ignoring the stupidity part.<br><br>Emotional duress in that, everyday I just wonder how all these happened and how the focus of his life has been switched to that girl and everytime I passed by places that we have been to, I will subconsciously wonder if he brought her there and if they were as happy as we were.<br><br>It's just hard to concentrate on other things.. I cannot 'complain' or bring any of these to his attention because he will get pissed off/irritated by me and he will 'threaten' to end it between us once and for all.<br><br>Welcome any helpful suggestions but please don't say how stupid this is and all.
