The thing is now, although he is with the other girl, I told him I will wait for him.<br><br>Right now he says he doesn't know why we broke up, he knows he still loves me but he cannot and will not choose between me and the girl until his financial problems have been solved.<br><br>Our relationship right now is, like we see each other and sms occasionally. Will still hug and stuffs if we see each other.<br><br>The reason why he 'diverted' his love to the girl was that she was able to provide him comfort during his troubled time while i couldn't, hence he started to like her yada yada..<br><br>So we have officially broken up but it's not totally over between us. I know it is quite stupid to still be hanging on to this guy but I just wanna look for suggestion as to how can i cope with this emotional duress every single day as well as what i could do to show that i am more 'understanding' towards him, ignoring the stupidity part.<br><br>Emotional duress in that, everyday I just wonder how all these happened and how the focus of his life has been switched to that girl and everytime I passed by places that we have been to, I will subconsciously wonder if he brought her there and if they were as happy as we were.<br><br>It's just hard to concentrate on other things.. I cannot 'complain' or bring any of these to his attention because he will get pissed off/irritated by me and he will 'threaten' to end it between us once and for all.<br><br>Welcome any helpful suggestions but please don't say how stupid this is and all. This is my decision for the time being.. </div></blockquote>He doesn't know why u 2 break up? He "divert" his love to the other girl because she can provide him with comfort, and u can't?<br><br>These 2 problems alone is more than summarise ur relationship with him. For a guy who can fall in love easily for that type of excuse, u sure have lots of patience in wanting to wait for him. You can wait all u want, but so what even if u 2 got back together? You 2 don't solve the problem now, and instead rather wanna wait until he solve his financial problem then face the problem together. Sorry if I sound cynical, but i highly doubt u 2 will last long should u 2 get back together again.<br><br>You may have told him u will wait, but there is no indication as to how long u would have 2 wait. A person's youth is limited. You cannot wait forever. Get on with life, indulge urself in ur fave activities and get to know more people.</div>

Be away from such person who has full of evil plans and thought. It is not abt being petty and u can't accept the breakup to the extend of not remaining basic ocntact with each others. In the first place,It is abt whether he accept the break up and admit his own mistake!<br>Repent is abt admiting own mistake and making an effort not to do it again,ridding of its evil thought.<br><br>Just like people telling u to be gracious and hire and ex convict but if he no way corrected his past and intend to commit crimes again.
