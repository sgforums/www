               ST reported another  maid an Indonesian 23 years old plunging ot her death  from 30 storeys at Telok Blangah heights!  This is the 3rd case so far this year- and it is only March! The maid works for a family of 5 for about two years . The family  DECLINED COMMENT on the incident!
                              The neighbour said that the maid 's employer would tell her not to open the metal window grilles when she was cleaning the wndows. BUT  SHE STILL DID SO  AS SHE WAS UNABLE TO CLEAN THE WINDOWS WITHOUT OPENING THEM! NOW surely the employer KNOWS jolly well that without opening the window grilles  it is IMPOSSIBLE for the maid to clean the windows- why did they still want the maid to  to clean those damn windows??? It is time to put a hefty fine (like S$25,000/-) for any employer whose maid plunge to their death because of window cleaning! Of the 25,000 fine, 20,000 dollars should go to the maids's family and dependants as compensation! Afterwhich, the employer wil be barred from employing a maid for a minimum of 5 years! 
                  HDB  must also redesign the  flats in such a way that  there are aluminium  parallel  clothing rods  so that clothing can be hung insided the wash area before being slided mechanically out in the open to be sun dried. and slided back in mechanically  for cloths to be collected.  Expecting kampong maids who are generally weak and short to try to balance  bamboo poles of heavy clothes, holding on to only ONE end of the pole  and inserting them into those pole holders is ridiculous! Those  HDB bamboo pole holders are suicidal devise for maids to lose their balance and plunge down to their death! Bamboo pole holders at the edge of the kitchen or wash area in HDB flats should be banned!

                  Your flats  at 30 storey  are walk -ups ? Surely you must be practical and understand that  your little red dot does not have land for bungalows for everyone, except your tycoons and elites  who can afford it?

                      Cleaning the """outside glass panes of the windows""" of a 30 storey block is definitely not  safe regardless the maids being trained. Such activities should be done by professional window cleaners who goes up and down the whole building  in a gondola! As for putting out heavy clothing on bamboo poles  holding on by on end, anyone with knowledge of simple physics will understand that  if the maid who normally weighs between 35 to 45 kg with heights normally between 1.4m to 1.55m does that and with the wind blowing  - there is a big risk she can lose her balance and in attempting to hold on to the bamboo pole fall down together with the pole! HDB should do away with this bamboo pole into the pole holder nonsense and have aluminium sliding racks installed so that clothing can be hung inside and then slided out to dry and then slided back in again for the clothes to be collected. Life is precious! A maid working here is someone's child, sister, mother  or wife!

              <p>There are short maids around that height you mentioned, they have no problem at all to hang clothings.    </p>

                      <p>Well there are always safe ways of cleaning the outside windows.
                        Lies with the gadget use to do it.   Not sure what she
                      used.    I suppose she can tell the employer she does not
                      know how to do it the safe way and let employer find the solution
                      to it.  </p>
                      <p>There are short maids around that height you mentioned, they
                      have no problem at all to hang clothings.    </p>
                      <p>Best is you tell those employers don't employ maids , tell them
                      do all housework themselves then all you will have no worry for the
                      maids.</p>
                      <p> </p>
                      <p> </p>

                      Indeed, we must understand  that many of these maids come from kampongs in far off areas. They do not live in high rise and may even feel giddy at first, looking out of a high rise. Even locals have fallen before. Indeed employers know it is diffcult to manoevre the bamboo pole with heavy WET  clothes  sometimes even bedsheets and blankets at one end into the pole holder. And especially so  if a strong wind is blowing. It is definitely unsafe and HDB can improve on this by installing RETRACTABLE aluminium sliding clothes drying  rackings for all flats they build!  Life is precious regardless whether it is  a local's or a maid's !

                      YOU said:"Why so agitated???   Your gf a maid???     What I stated are suggestions to avoid any mishap.  You not happy then I can do nothing.    there is no need for you to bring up my family.  Do you even know me personally to quote my family?&gt;  Damn lol."
                      Fact is I didn't "quote your family"  as you so claimed. What did your  family say that I quoted???   From the way you wrote  you seem to be frivilous about the issue , even adding LOL ! So if you can't express yourself clearly , don't take offence when you are taken for being condescendingly callous! And now that you have started calling me "idiot" may I say it takes a greater idiot like you  to call me "idiot" !  And what do you mean by saying " No need to sound so noble when you are not." Who are you to judge the extent of my "nobleness"?
