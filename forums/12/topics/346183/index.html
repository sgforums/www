              <p>Have you checked to see whether he can scrapped together some instalments to you, or he is living the high life using your money?</p>
              <p>Chances are, you cannot expect the money to get back to you.</p>
              <p>If it does, either later or in installments.  The good for both of you.</p>
              <p>If he doesnt, running off with your money.  You need to spend more money with a lawyer to write him some decent letter of demands and maybe bankrupt the fella. </p>
              <p>Then garnish his properties, his belongings, his bank accounts &amp; possibly his future earnings.</p>
              <p>But take note, all these work maybe bring you back 60 percent of your total loan, cos the other 40 percent is those you cannot get back, or that the lawyer charges for the fees.</p>

              <p>You're that rich to loan such a huge amount of money to a friend and still survive?</p>
              <p>as long you're not into any debts or suffering from any financial difficulties, i would suggest you place the matter one side.</p>
              <p>Insisting on the payment may cause the relationship to sour.</p>
              <p>I would suggest you continue to go out with him.. Talk to him more about his business rather than the loan. Be nice to him. Whenever he talks about borrowing more money, change the topic. Sometimes, all he needs is a guilt trip. Constantly being nice to him without money involved is a more powerful reminder than asking him to repay back the loan.</p>
              <p>Since this year is into recession. Don't expect a full lump sum of payment back to you. You could always compromise with him. Instead of paying the whole payment, which he absolutely cannot, ask him to pay in installments instead.. For starters, $500 per month for about 20 months.. He most probably can afford it, since he has a business. And since you're his friend, you won't insist on the interest. Thats your part of the bargain.</p>
              <p>Let me summarise this option again.</p>
              <p>His side of the compromise, agreement to pay back the sum in installments of $500 per month for 20 months. Your side of the compromise, because of friendship, you will not charge him the usual bank interest rate of 1.5%(some random figure) per month. And will not go to the police to settle it.</p>
              <p>Whichever advice or option you take, i wish you all the best. Good luck bro.</p>

              <p><br>Assuming your "written note" comes in the form of a IOU, you're better off trying your luck with debt collectors (the legal ones).</p>
              <p>Forget about the legal route unless that document comes in the form of a contract - the opportunity and transaction costs involved for you to go down this route over an IOU for the amount in question is simply not worth the hassle (especially if your "friend" belongs to the category who would most probably deny ever having borrowed the money or challenge the authenticity of the note, which only you would know since you're his "friend").</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Lesson learn - before lending, you need to have him present to you a proper feasible plan of repayment, you should have review what his business is, and what type of profit it can generate - to see if he can even generate the profit to repay you.</p>

              <p><br>But is he avoiding you? If he isn't, it's rather unfair for you to brand him a cheater isnt it? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="icon_neutral.gif"></p>
              <p>Have a good chat with him regarding the loan. In view of the current econmic climate, it would be hard for him to return the money to you as a lump sum. Try to work out the repaying of the loan possibly through installments with him.</p>

              Looks like you lost $10,000 and a friend.
              If never lend, you still have the $10,000 but lost the friend.
              Which one is better?
