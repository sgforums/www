              <p>He may be my dear old Dad, but he's the very reason why I continue to suffer every single day of my life. It's because of him and him only that I should have to live as someone I'm not, and further surpress my emotions just so I can get through every damn day.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Background Information: If you don't already know, I'm transsexual. Sadly, I still live my daily life as a guy despite undergoing hormone replacement therapy for over 2½ years. Initially I had planned to cross the gender line 3 months ago, and start living my life as a girl after finally graduating from Secondary School, but obviously I haven't yet because my (stupid) Dad stopped me.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Blah blah blah....as the master of this house I order you to cut your hair short, if not you don't ever step back into thise house again."<br>I complied, only because I'm f*cked for life without a proper education. Still it was very emotionally painful to do this for him, because having a guyish haircut is the only reason that people still take me for a guy. Just a few days prior to cutting my hair, all my new classmates from my JC were telling me how they honestly thought that I'm a girl.</p>
              <p><br>*sigh* <br>To summarise it, my Dad isn't at all supportive of what I'm doing. He's doing anything he can to stop me, but he doesn't realize that what he's doing only ends up hurting me, and screwing up my life even more. I've tried everything to convince him that my condition is genuine, but it all falls on deaf years. He refuses to believe any of it... (denial) Every morning when I wake up, I feel nothing but pain because my father can't accept the truth, and I'm forced to continue living in a body I hate. He's afraid of losing a son, but if he keeps this up, he may just lose an entire child.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If only he weren't around, I'd be free to finally live my life... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="icon_cry.gif"></p>

(though she is still trying to get the daughter to 'change' but we believe this is only because the mother doesnt want her friends to know etc etc)<br>i dunno about your dad. but if i were you, i'd not listen to him and see if he REALLY will throw you out. will he have the heart to?? at the end of the day, you are his child.....as for education....you can always go back to it later...or something....</p></div>

              <p>yeah so ultimately parents just want to have best interests for their kids though. maybe ur dad do not know how to express out though. actually i also dun knoe how to advise you or anything because i cannot understand what you are going through though. but i do believe these experiences happens for a reason though, to build up ur character perhaps, to prepare you for a more cruel world outside perhaps. hmm.. hang in there.</p>

              <p>i second the bear's thoughts.</p>
              <p>to add on some of my own, you are not fucked for life when you're only 18. no one in singapore is fucked for life when they are only 18 unless they are born deformed, suffer from down's syndrome, lose a brain, hand or leg, or lose their lives over some dramatic accident.</p>
              <p>i can quote you at least 5 examples of local transgenders who made successful transitions (albeit grueling) both physically and emotionally in our society. the difference lies in how you fight.</p>
              <p>wake up your idea about thinking you're fucked. we're in the 21st millenium, it's only a taboo if you think it is one.</p>
              <p>so get a grip because no one is going to give you added sympathy just because you're not 'one of the normal ones.'</p>
              <p>growing up is tough for everybody.</p>
              <p>---</p>
              <p>by the way, the day your dad accepts you for who you truly are, is the one fine day you prove to him you have the ability to keep your chin up. when you are able to live an independent life with pride (i know i sound like a freaking horoscope here) and when you treat yourself well, he may not be proud of you but he'll accept you for who you are.</p>
              <p>when the day comes and he still don't, well who cares right?</p>
