              Ts,
              Give up your ''somebodiness'' and you will have guys to relate to , but the nice part is that even if there is no one around, you would still feel ok.

              <p>He is doing those nice gestures for a reason. What the reasons are will depend on his character.</p>
              <p>You only need to say thank you, and nothing else. Don't think too much into it.</p>
              <p>If he is a naturally caring guy, he will spread his caring around to others. You would be just one of them.</p>
              <p>If he just targets you, then he is after you.</p>
              <p>From here, we can't tell what is the reason.</p>
              <p>But I would advise caution, and don't let this get you into a swoon.</p>

              <p>How should i start my topic ?</p>
              <p>Ok.. i am a late 20s lady who has been in and out of relationship, and somehow stop seeing any man for the past few years.  Recently in my workplace there is a colleague who join us half a year ago, and we hit it off quite well sharing the same hobbies (blading).<br>We would meet up on every weekend together with other colleagues. <br>I am a newbie in blading thus during the learning period he was very attentive towards me meaning from holding my hand / arms.  And there are time whereby he would actually carry and bring my slippers, water bottle to me.</p>
              <p>At times when my laces are loose he would bend down and tie my laces etc..<br>I am very much appreciating his caring towards me.  On the other hands i am guess his thought and action is he interested in me or is he just plain caring type of person or seeing me as a younger sister ?  </p>
              <p>I had been in and out of relationship thus i had more of less lost confidence in myself.<br>I am lost. is there any guys there who can help me to analsye his gesture ? Am i thinking too much ?  Do guys gentlemenly do all these for all gals.</p>

Guys are like this one lah, during the chasing period, promise you heavens and roses, do what also can, even can buy sanitary pad for you, after managed to get you and you fall for it already, it could be a total different picture, that time you may find yourself carrying a baby while he enjoys his life elsewhere.

              <p><br>This is what is inside my mind, i am afraid he is seeing me as a younger sister.<br>But during the outing their is a even younger girl beside me, but i didn't see him attending to her as far as i have notice from this few outing.  And he doesn't know much about my past failed relationship as i did not disclose.  I don't want to disclose too much to someone whom i am not that close to as of now.</p>
              <p>Kinda agree a female who lost a relationship will be at her weakness point in life and the more i need 3rd party to analyse this issue for me.  To prevent myself from misunderstood his intention.</p>

              <p>Well, you are old enough to think for yourself and since you had a few relationships before, you should be experienced enough to know what constitutes a hint and what does not.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What is the need of disclosing your past relationships anyway? Unless he is wooing you already and you are willing to tell him, there is no requirement or obligation of you to tell him.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Treating one girl nicer than another doesnt necessarily relate to age nor does it really mean any romantic. I can treat one classmate, one female friend or colleague better than another merely because i feel i am more at ease, and comfortable with her, thats all. You could be thinking too much.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>How well do you know this guy anyway? Is he even attached? I guess these are some things you have to make sure of before you even think of anything else.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Besides, you are a girl, you should know to drop hints to a guy. Like ask him out for a date or a meal. This is already 2011. Its nothing wrong with a girl making the first move these days. Dont sit there and wait for things to happen. Things wont just drop from the sky if you dont do anything.</p>
