            <div class='col-md body'>we had the same problem when our kids were young. my wife had wanted to give up her job to look after the kids. To give up her job would means halfing our income. we had a huge home loan, the standard of living etc.<br><br>fortunately, i had my sister-in-law who was a housewife (their children big liao) who offer to help us. We employed a maid to help up in all the chores while she help to look after the children. This put us at ease and we were able to concentrate on our work.<br><br>We had to travel everyday to her house with the kids and maid in toll and to bring them back home every night. Do spend time with the children if possible. For me, every evening, i will alway bring my children out for a walk. We will admire the little flowers or grass along the road or walk to the aquarium to look at fishes.<br><br>Every night, if possibe, we will read with them or tell them stories (sometime cook up stories). or sometime sleeping with them in their room.<br><br>If you ask me, it's very tiring after work and spend time with your children. but looking back, i have never regretted it.<br><br>So, if you can have someone trustworthy to help you, it may help</div>
