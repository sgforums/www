This way you will be able to figure out if you really do need the double income ornot. Look at where the money goes to every month.<br>Is it possible to downsize? Is it possible to cut some expenses here and there ?<br><br>It is not impossible for a family of 3 to survive on one income.<br><br>For children their most important part of their life is in their formative years.<br>Once you missed this period, it will be gone forever.<br><br>As a mother, it is in your maternal instinct to want to care for and put your daughter your priority and make sure she fluorish into a successful adult.<br><br>But bear in mind that being a full time housewife can have pros and cons.<br>Your sense of self is very important.

While dinner, ask about her schoolwork while you are working. Get a home tutor for her in the afternoon is also good, so that she has someone to talk to. Accompany her to shopping during wkend. For me, I dont think I will take the course bcos it seems more time consming, do some 1-2 days baking course can already then from there do own home baking.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>actually i don't know what is going to happening there (at shatec or sunrice ) if i am thinking of joining the course, what attrract me is the diploma course like i get to learn more knowledge. i don't know is it worth it, like maybe there they teach more on home business, or business kind of thing, don't know lah, i am confuse.,the course look very interesting, like i will be taught alot on kitchen, baking kind of th ings, i thought lerning knowledge is good like i hope to feel better of myself. the problem is all is full time course, i am thiniking if i should take the risk, and just go for it. wht do u mean by time consuming maybe 2yrs on the course after the course finish i guess i will be free then, maybe can do my own business. but is it relevant? if relevant i don't mind to go for it, if not what is it for then,</div>

Firstly, right now you wanted to quit your job to spend time with your child. However, if you were to take up the diploma course (which lasts about 2 years, full time), it is coming back to square one again(ie. not much time to spend with your daughter). Worse, you are not earning any income and yet have to pay alot of money for the course.<br><br>While 2 years is not a long time for a course, however, by the time the course ends, your daughter will be 10 or 11 years old. Imo, you might consider taking up the course in future when your daughter is older. If you are talking about a home business of selling cakes and cookies to people from home, you won't need a cert for it. Those Shatec cert is imo, more for ppl who are going to work in restaurants or hotel F &amp; B industry. As for opening a small cafe, well there are alot of overheads to consider. Rental in Singapore is not cheap. On top of that, you will have to hire 1-2 ppl for cashiering/waitressing to assist you in looking after the shop if you do not want to be the whole time it is open for business. From what I see, cafes most peak period time is normally from afternoon until late at night(you have to at least be operating during this time to earn more money from cust). Again, this won't leave you much time to spend with your child. I understand that this is your dream, but ultimately, you need to decide where your priority lays in. You can always pursue it when your child is older.<br><br>As for quiting your current job to look after your child, it will have to be a decision between you and your husband. You will need your husband's support in this. Even if you continue working, I believe you can spare some time for your child no matter how tired you are. Especially during the weekends, I believe your whole family can go out to places like a nearby park etc for walks. Either way, some sacrifices have to be made.<br><br></div>

I think maybe the issue is the job is not suitable for you. Try to find a 5 days week job that works between 8.30 to 5.30pm and can go home on time. Preferably somewhere near your house so you won't waste so much time on transport. Salary might be lower but at least you are earning a salary and won't be too tired and stress later to spend time with your child.</div>

Hence, whenever you reach home, you are in no mood to entertain your daughter and that caused you to feel guilty.<br><br>There are many working mums who manage to juggle career and childcare. The key point is to give your child QUALITY time as being with her 24/7 does not equate to being a good mother. It's not like she's a baby and thus require you to be around her all the time.<br><br>As your daughter is schooling, why not take on a part-time job? Work when she's in school, be home when she's back. Your income will be halved but as you'll be her personal tutor in her studies, you save on tuition fees.<br><br>As for taking up a course in baking, you must know that if you continue with your day-time job, the course will eat up your valuable evening hours that are meant to be for your daughter. Furthermore, setting up a small business will still require you to work long hours to kickstart your shop and it will take 2 to 3 years to establish your business. Cake shops are everywhere and you must be able to come up with some unique recipes that your competition does not have. You will still be stressed with the manual toil of baking for hours and even more stressed if you cannot generate enough profits to cover your overhead expenses.</div>
