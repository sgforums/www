            <div class='col-md body'>you have to impress on her the importance of honesty and intergrity.. or else when she grows up she might be amenable to "grab" any loose change that she could get away with, and 1 day she'll get caught and its very hard to regain other people's trust again. stealing is 1 of the worse things u can do to your close ones. people can forgive but will never forget. when similar cases come up she'll be the first one to be suspected, and then whether its actually her fault or not she'll must likely be the one who gets blamed. It really isnt neccessary to scold her.. just have a long and serious talk with her to impress on her the seriousness of this, impress on her the importance of not stealing.. you could do all these even without directly accusing her of stealing</div>
