It really depends on whether you both offically broke up or not. If you didn't then it wouldn't be right to go and look for another relationship. There was once when my girl and i didn't mention anything to each other just totally stop meeting, smsing and calling each other but we never got into another relationship. I remember that it was 4 months before we started meeting and all. Usually, it depends on the person's personal point of view.</div>

That's why I said its pretty rare for patching to happen in this way (although it would probably be the best for long term sake) and this must applies to both parties. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Quote from steph`-: If it was worth patching, in the first place, why break?
