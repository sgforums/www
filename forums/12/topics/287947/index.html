I believe people in there ready do their work in a freestyling way, they are not lazy or incompetence, they are damn smart, it is the culture of the office that bring glory and richness to the boss, why should the boss complain further. Accept the culture, work smartly, be like them, and you can be sure you work long, but if you cannot fit in, then resign lor.</div>
