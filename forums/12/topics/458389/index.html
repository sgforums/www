              <p>Please do not flame and read my whole story, I am only writing this to obtain genuine advice on my current situation. It is a long story but my life is really in a mess that is beyond imagination.</p>
              <p>My wife ran away with my son and my only family member, my nephew left my house and severed all ties with me, now I am all alone but left with a few important decisions to make to remedy this situation.</p>
              <p>I fell in love with a beautiful woman A some years ago, she is my ideal type and we dated for almost 2 years. She is rich, extremely pretty and had everything I wished for a wife. However, due to my unfaithfulness, I had a one-night-stand with another woman B at a bar. Unfortunately, I pregnated her and we were forced to get married by her parents. B isn't too bad and we had a healthy marriage life but I do not love her. Instead, my heart still belongs to A. Needless to say, A was infuriated because at that time we broke up, we had plans to get married.</p>
              <p>I have been living with my nephew for many years since his parents passed away. Ever since my brother and his wife passed away when their son was still schooling, my nephew 35, and me, 40 lived together with our son. We lived a very modest life and I had regretted my affair which turned out into an unwanted marriage and family. I could have lived much better if I had married A in the first place. </p>
              <p>However, due to very unbelievable coincidence, my nephew met A in his company and they became very close friends and dated. It was only last year during CNY that he brought her to our small reunion. My wife B recognised A and immediately disapproved of their relationship. When A met me, I was sure that she still had feelings for me like I did for her, however she married my nephew. After our meetup, we had sex on a few occasions without my wife's knowledge.</p>
              <p>Last month, A discovered that she was pregnant despite desperately trying many times with my nephew. My nephew was so happy that his wife got pregnant but I was quite sure that the child belongs to me. I then brought A to have a medical checkup and they said there was nothing wrong with her. That means my nephew was infertile all along and the child is indeed mine. </p>
              <p>When all of us met for a diner a few days ago, my wife B became suspicious of us because I showed too much care for her unborn baby. After the dinner, I met up privately with my nephew and told him that A was carrying my child. He told my wife about it and she ran away from home with our son. My nephew is also on the verge of divorce with A because of her affair with me. After A knew about this, she blamed herself and tried to commit suicide. I brought her to my house and she had been living here for the past 2 days.</p>
              <p>I know I am a bad person but I want to try to save our family and thought of these options:</p>
              <p>1. Divorce B, marry A and start a new life with her. But if I do that, I lose my wife and child, also my nephew.</p>
              <p>2. Lie to my nephew and tell him I was drunk and blurted out nonsence that night. Hope that life will be back to normal again while still being able to see A for the rest of my life as a niece in-law. If A keeps this secret well, our family will be in peace for the time being.</p>
              <p>3. Relocate to another country with my wife and child and forget about A completely. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think 2 is the best option but it will be very hard for me to do. Are there any other ways I can get over this?</p>

              <p>A has confessed to me that she married my nephew because she wanted to be close to me. I was already a married man and she had no choice. Both she and myself are the worst kind of people and we have done very bad things. Although our love is genuine, we can't show it due to our circumstances. </p>
              <p>If I choose option 1, I may like it at first but feel guilty for the rest of my life. </p>
              <p>If I choose option 2, I have to spin up lies after lies to cover up our dark history and my new child with A. If A doesn't cooperate, all three of them might leave me in the future and I would be in an even more difficult situation. I also have to be very careful when my wife B or my nephew is around. Both A and myself had commited unforgivable sins.</p>
              <p>If I choose option 3, I will most likely regret for the rest of my life and maybe become even more depressed than I already am. </p>

All said that in the eyes of law I am a married man and my relationship with A is just an affair regardless of our past. But I can't bear to leave her or to call my lover as my niece in law.

External hurt can be cure by white blood cells and clotting, but inner hurt is more serious, and most will not go away just like you think, once hurt, life will not be the same again, no matter how much you want people to be happy, it just not the same anymore.</p>

My nephew is also on the verge of divorce with A because of her affair with me. After A knew about this, she blamed herself and tried to commit suicide. I brought her to my house and she had been living here for the past 2 days.</p>
              <p>I know I am a bad person but I want to try to save our family and thought of these options:</p>
              <p>1. Divorce B, marry A and start a new life with her. But if I do that, I lose my wife and child, also my nephew.</p>
              <p>2. Lie to my nephew and tell him I was drunk and blurted out nonsence that night. Hope that life will be back to normal again while still being able to see A for the rest of my life as a niece in-law. If A keeps this secret well, our family will be in peace for the time being.</p>
              <p>3. Relocate to another country with my wife and child and forget about A completely. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think 2 is the best option but it will be very hard for me to do. Are there any other ways I can get over this?</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>I absolutely won't commit crimes such as murder or rape. I hope people here are not taking my life as a joke by telling me to kill myself. If I were to have sex with A, she would throw herself at me and be willing. Will that be considered rape? We already did it many times this year even after she is married to my nephew. She stays in my house now and wants me to settle this problem.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I feel very bad for my wife especially. To be painfully frank, she earns much more than me and with my salary, I can't afford to give her allowance if we ended up with a divorce. Much of the money, if she insists would be from A who happens to be very wealthy. I'm sure A will agree to it but my wife will not accept if she knows the money comes from A. If it is possible, I hope that my wife can live with my nephew while I live with A and our new baby. This will be extremely awkward and both parties will never agree to it.</div>
