              You seem like you aren't sure what you want in your life. If you think being a father and husband is important you should have informed yourself that the consequences of your action could destroy you and those people who love you.
                     
              I really not sure what to say here but I'm seeing the facts here.
                      
              1. Your wife will not forgive you and you need to prepare yourself for divorce petition from your wife plus she would want to keep your kid.
                      
              2. Your nephew is not going to make up with his wife after what he found out about the baby his wife is carrying is not his but yours. So I see here that your nephew will go with the divorce decision.
                      
              3. A is your last choice now that she is not really wanting to abort your baby with her would mean she wants you to be with her.....right.
                      
              Conclusion, if A is agreeable to the divorce with your nephew then she is willing to take that chance with you. And when you and your wife are going to the lawyer for divorce proceeding, it would be her points that would actually make the judge to decide that she has the right to dishonour you as her husband for good. So you on the losing end. And I think A will not regret should she lose your nephew. On the other end, you will lose your son with B. That I think would best for you. You have take it man because your action has destroyed two marriages and you cannot deny it. So take it like a man. Hope this helps you to think straight from now onward.

              <p>I feel very bad for my wife especially. To be painfully frank, she earns much more than me and with my salary, I can’t afford to give her allowance if we ended up with a divorce. Much of the money, if she insists would be from A who happens to be very wealthy. I’m sure A will agree to it but my wife will not accept if she knows the money comes from A. If it is possible, I hope that my wife can live with my nephew while I live with A and our new baby. This will be extremely awkward and both parties will never agree to it.</p>

              <p>Decisions to make ? You must be kidding. A beggar has no right to choose, much less make any decision for anyone.</p>
              <p>Now, you are at the absolute mercy of the people you have betrayed. In your story, pretty much everyone who trusted you.</p>
              <p>One day A will dump you, when a new meat comes along who is better than you.</p>
              <p>Your ex wife B will ignore you and find herself a real man. Yes she will still take A money, heck why not.</p>
              <p>Your nephew will move on in his life and be happier without you.</p>
              <p>Your children from A and B will look at you with much disdain. A loser father deserves no respect.</p>
              <p>You are nothing but a loser.</p>
              <p>Your only decision to make now.. is to find yourself a good old folks home which is not going to abuse you ( hopefully).. and die a lonely death.</p>
              <p>Frankly your story is quite unbelievable except for the betrayal part.</p>
              <p>Now, why should your nephew still live with you under that crowded roof ? His wife so rich surely they coulda went and bought themselves a private landed or condo elsewhere..</p>
              <p>The house belong to your nephew or you ? If his, then you lose.. if yours, you also lose.</p>
              <p>Why you so sure the child is not your nepehws ? Unless he went and check , there's no certainty. Are you going to help raise his kid if DNA proved the child is not yours? Or send the child and A back to your nephew after you've destroyed their marriage ?</p>
              <p>Full of shit lah.. another novel wannabe... written by a male chauvanistic asshole putting his wet dream in ink.</p>
              <p>Yah right, women really really want you, so badly, even tho you are already married and a father.......e so desperate to carry your child....chances are, they just wanna use you.   You are assuming women are stupid enough for you to twirl them round your pinkie finger because none of em have a brain.</p>
              <p> Hey Aneslayer, what else are you gonna come up with ? What happen to your betrayed vietnamese prostitute wife and 5 kids, that rich pretty friend of your wife who really wants to be F by you? Lets just stick to that one. OK ? Good.</p>
              <p>Seriously...</p>
              <p> Yah yah.. we get it.. sex sells, betrayal sells, married man with kids, stupid wife, stupid but rich, and pretty lover girl who really wants to get F and who really wants the married man to spend her life with... .. but average loser joe with low income, no.</p>
              <p>No matter how you wanna spin it.. the story line is getting stale...really.. unless your dick is a miracle wand that can cure all disease and turn dirt into gold.. sure.. every vagina out there really wants your dick in their hole.. so dream on ...</p>

              <p>So your story goes.. that you took your nephew's home, cheat on your then girlfriend, made another girl pregnant and cheated on her with your ex, betrayed your nephew,  sleep with his wife and made him a father of your child ? And you have the gall to claim he is close like brothers...wow..</p>
              <p>Really...talk about self destruction...</p>
              <p>Well.. good thing you are acting out your fantasy online , bet you have no guts to do it in real life anyway. Cuz in reality, you'd still lose your house and your wife and everything you have because you can't understand moral obligation.. which the "counselors" are trying to drill into your head..</p>
              <p>Like I said, the loser is you. Didn't matter who owns the house you live in now.. your wife is gonna kick you to the curb. When A is done with you.. she'll do the same because you need her, more than she needs you.</p>
              <p>Good try nevertheless, good try... not very convincing but quite entertaining.. that's all. Now please go to SGsex forum.. Aunt Agony is the wrong place to live your fantasy.</p>
              <p>See man like you give other good guys a bad name. So please go frolick with your own kind.</p>

              <p>Then your nephew met that old hag at work yes ? And she is a strong successful bussiness woman yes ? And she decided to marry your nephew who is much younger than you.. that means that old hag married a much younger guy yes ?</p>
              <p>So your nephew insist on staying at "your" place leaving his marital home empty ? Is he sleeping with your wife ? How strange.</p>
              <p>And that A who is a strong successful woman slept with you.. where ? her place or yours ?</p>
              <p>And you are a lowly income average guy with a golden dick that even a strong successful businesswoman would marrry the nephew just to sleep with you yes ?</p>

              It is true that rich women with successful background will never look at an uninteresting old chap like me. But in this case, I knew A when we were young and because of destiny, it pulled us back together and our love remained strong. Back then, I had many suitors and dashing good looks. both of us just started our career on an equal note. Only difference was that she had a huge inheritance and family backing which I don't have. 
              
              During the times I slept with A, we did it at various locations such as luxury hotels, her condo, her office building and sometimes my humble hdb flat. People might feel that I think A's child is mine on groundless claims but I am very certain because my nephew, alike me are very sexually active people. He had countless gf's in the past and none of them got pregnant. According to him, before A's pregnancy, he told me that they had tried to have a baby but fail. That is why I'm so certain that he is infertile.

Ever since my brother and his wife passed away when their son was still schooling, my nephew 35, and me, 40 lived together with our son. We lived a very modest life and I had regretted my affair which turned out into an unwanted marriage and family. I could have lived much better if I had married A in the first place. "</span></p>
              <p>Your nephew only 5 years younger than u. </p>
              <p>When his parents died he was already more than 21 years old. Is he retarded or something ?</p>
              <p>Do you really think we readers are as retarded as you?</p>
              <p>And A , as wonderful as you made her out to be, seriously.. Within 12 years after she dumped you, no man ever mounted her until she married your nephew ? LoL... Lemme guess, you are gonna claim, you are her one and only love... If she can't have you, she'll have no one else?   Hahaahahahh ! Right. The delusion!</p>
              <p>Story ending to all cheaters out there...you betrayed everyone in your life, you'll die a lonely death... The end. </p>
              <p>But ok, say, assuming you did a DNA test on A baby after birth, turns out that child is neither yours nor your nephews... Then what har? What will the story be like ? </p>
              <p>You raised an adult nephew.. I'm sure u can cuckold yourself further and raise a stranger's child yes?</p>
              <p>Um, actually, you could have lived much better if you had kept your little prick inside your pants. </p>
              <p>How about you stop sleeping around like a sex maniac who is incapable of being faithful to anybody. </p>
              <p>If A is real, chances are, she is having her revenge on you. And the child is really someone else's lil bastard which she is trying to make you the cuckold. </p>
              <p>When you incur a woman's wrath, sooner or later, you'll pay.. Very dearly.</p>

              <p>Please do not flame and read my whole story, I am only writing
              this to obtain genuine advice on my current situation. It is a long
              story but my life is really in a mess that is beyond
              imagination.</p>
              <p>My wife ran away with my son and my only family member, my
              nephew left my house and severed all ties with me, now I am all
              alone but left with a few important decisions to make to remedy
              this situation.</p>
              <p>I fell in love with a beautiful woman A some years ago, she is
              my ideal type and we dated for almost 2 years. She is rich,
              extremely pretty and had everything I wished for a wife. However,
              due to my unfaithfulness, I had a one-night-stand with another
              woman B at a bar. Unfortunately, I pregnated her and we were forced
              to get married by her parents. B isn't too bad and we had a healthy
              marriage life but I do not love her. Instead, my heart still
              belongs to A. Needless to say, A was infuriated because at that
              time we broke up, we had plans to get married.</p>
              <p>I have been living with my nephew for many years since his
              parents passed away. Ever since my brother and his wife passed away
              when their son was still schooling, my nephew 35, and me, 40 lived
              together with our son. We lived a very modest life and I had
              regretted my affair which turned out into an unwanted marriage and
              family. I could have lived much better if I had married A in the
              first place. </p>
              <p>However, due to very unbelievable coincidence, my nephew met A
              in his company and they became very close friends and dated. It was
              only last year during CNY that he brought her to our small reunion.
              My wife B recognised A and immediately disapproved of their
              relationship. When A met me, I was sure that she still had feelings
              for me like I did for her, however she married my nephew. After our
              meetup, we had sex on a few occasions without my wife's
              knowledge.</p>
              <p>Last month, A discovered that she was pregnant despite
              desperately trying many times with my nephew. My nephew was so
              happy that his wife got pregnant but I was quite sure that the
              child belongs to me. I then brought A to have a medical checkup and
              they said there was nothing wrong with her. That means my nephew
              was infertile all along and the child is indeed mine. </p>
              <p>When all of us met for a diner a few days ago, my wife B became
              suspicious of us because I showed too much care for her unborn
              baby. After the dinner, I met up privately with my nephew and told
              him that A was carrying my child. He told my wife about it and she
              ran away from home with our son. My nephew is also on the verge of
              divorce with A because of her affair with me. After A knew about
              this, she blamed herself and tried to commit suicide. I brought her
              to my house and she had been living here for the past 2 days.</p>
              <p>I know I am a bad person but I want to try to save our family
              and thought of these options:</p>
              <p>1. Divorce B, marry A and start a new life with her. But if I do
              that, I lose my wife and child, also my nephew.</p>
              <p>2. Lie to my nephew and tell him I was drunk and blurted out
              nonsence that night. Hope that life will be back to normal again
              while still being able to see A for the rest of my life as a niece
              in-law. If A keeps this secret well, our family will be in peace
              for the time being.</p>
              <p>3. Relocate to another country with my wife and child and forget
              about A completely. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think 2 is the best option but it will be very hard for me to
              do. Are there any other ways I can get over this?</p>

              <p>You could go on making 
              choices to fill in the void caused by some unwise decision/s made at 
              that point of time. However, it will just snowball into a huge 
              conflagration, in which you will find it harder and harder to 
              extinguish. Life is full of 'what ifs' - surely things would be 
              different if you had married A. However, the truth is that the 'what if'
               never actually took place. We could go on forever on how those 
              possibilities could play out, but then again, it is not possible to go 
              back in time to find out for sure. </p>
              <p>It is based on what you felt 
              was a wrong choice, while ignoring other factors that would have 
              naturally develop along the way to neutralize the value of 'wrongness'. </p>
              <p>When you have a sexual affair with your nephew's wife - it is a 
              clear indication that you are willing to risk your marriage (which 
              includes your wife and son) to pursue what you felt was a choice left 
              behind by an unfortunate circumstances. However, I just want to 
              highlight something: 'no choice' is still a choice. You might have been 
              'coerced' by her parents and/or your conscience on moral grounds to 
              marry your wife - still, it is a choice that you have decided to commit 
              eventually, even though there wasn't any love. I truly doubt her parents
               actually point the gun barrel at you to say 'I do' - I think you get my
               drift.</p>
              <p>Until the point we take responsibility for all our
               choices made, it is hard to get out of your situation effectively 
              because your chosen behaviour often revolves around avoiding, minor 
              (ineffective) patching and/or delaying the consequences of an unwise 
              decision. Notice that your preferred course of action is (2), which 
              still another attempt to do one or more of the above.</p>
              <p>Your 
              options are mutually exclusive; keeping your family intact would means 
              that A would have to go, while choosing A would means that your wife, 
              son and nephew will need to go. Coexistent in this case is impossible 
              and unrealistic to pursue. </p>
              <p>P.S: You have to decide what you want 
              before you commit any further decision. If you are lost: stop for a 
              moment and glance at your map. You don't keep walking because chances 
              are, you will walk further away from your original destination and that 
              will just make you feel miserable once the truth slams you hard - on how
               far away you are from where you want to want. <img title="Idea" src="http://sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea"> </p>
