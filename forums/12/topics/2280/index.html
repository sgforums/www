            <div class='col-md body'>not fair lehz.. stereotyping lehz.... I do admit that all guys do share some of the characteristics, but each is unique mahz.. maybe got A, B and C but not necessary D &amp; E right???<br><br>But we have to agree that we do have similar things to say about girls, however, we all know that girls do not fit into everyone...<br><br>Just like it's unfair to say that mentally-slow people are liabilities to the society... We can see for ourselves, they are trying to make a name for themselves, that they are hardworking people, by working laborously in fastfood outlets.<br><br>For people who even criticize them as cheap labor doing simple chores. Without them, you think you will have clean tables when you visit these outlets?? If you have notice, they maybe slow, but they are very dedicated to their work... they really clean every inch of the table, which I think many of us will not, due to laziness, and have the 'just anything is okiez' mentality.<br><br>Oopz think I travel too far off topic liaoz..
