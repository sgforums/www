Do you see an image of a playful person tinkering with gadgets?<br><br>In the real world, invention is a lawyer's game.

I'll just respond to society like a zombie.<br><br>Making a difference is near impossible.

Everything is meaningless.</div></blockquote>Weird to see someone feeling the same way as I do.<br><br>It's like, the more you know, the more you realise how little you can actually do.

Then, you see the real world for the first time. Then, slowly, you start to doubt yourself. Be a lawyer? I need to have good grades in English, need to study for very long. Be a police? Might die anytime; and what's the point of catching the bad guys anyway? Be a teacher? Alamak, the students nowadays are so troublesome. No thanks!<br><br>Then slowly, you start to lose track of yourself, start to feel that the world is too dark.<br><br>You just need to see the world from another perpective. Light cannot exist without darkness.

Start making a change to their life.

Feel disillusioned and sad that the world is so corrupted.<br>2. Work harder, and seek to make improvements, even if you're far away from it now.<br><br>Would you choose the first, or the second?</div>
