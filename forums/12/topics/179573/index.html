As long as humans can make decisions, it will never be fair. Being too nice doesnt always pay. Not asking you to be bad but be firm. Whats there to be nervous? just think, mistakes r common, learn from mistakes or at least take 3 deep breaths before doing anything important.<br>Learn to differentiate between wats important and wats urgent. Wats important is not necessary urgent but wat is urgent is usually important.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br>Trust me, u owe nothing to nobody and they too dun owe u. We just owe our parents and the people who loved and care for us.<br>So take care of your self well and whatever u do answer to yourself!<br>Be brave be strong be compassionate be happy! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br>Cheers!!</div>

Although I can consider an 'old bird' in my unit since I was posted to this particular unit 1 year ago, I can't get along well with most of the people in my unit as I just can't mingle well with him. Some of you might think that I am not the type who likes to mingle around and yes I have this problem when I just started my BMT and my technican course in OETI but slowly I get along well with my platoon mates and course mate. However when I come to this unit maybe due to differences in character I just can't get along well with many of them.<br><br>I think that I am a very timid person as I gets very nervous when somethings get wrong and some of my fellow NSFs and my regular superior would take the advantage of this and make fun of me, teasing me as they likes to see the way I was being nervous.<br><br>I do admit that I am a little bit slow in learning new things but my fellow NSFs thinks that I have attitude problems and don't want to do things. This results me being aimed everytime to do saigang and fatigue work even though I didn't offends any of the fellow NSFs (in fact they came and take advantage of me)<br><br>Also I did receive unfair treatments in my unit, like other people in my branch slept in their bunk during office hour my superiors closed one eye while when I did that they gave me extras duties. Yes I am in the wrong of sleeping in bunk during office hours but why other people aren't punished when they did the same thing?<br><br>I am not that kind of person who want to holds somebody balls in order to climb higher and I just want to ORD peacefully. </div></blockquote>Haha i was from OETI also leh,i think your unit i aga aga know where liao lah<br>There should be quite politics leh if what i guess is correct lah.<br>Aiya in the army sure got kena aim.You think your superior treat u unfair,then unfair loh,the world is unfair regardless whether army or outside,just do whatever u are being told to do loh.Since u are going to ord ,i will advice u just maintain a low profile.<br>Usually BMT friends is more close than units one lah,just bear with it.</div>
