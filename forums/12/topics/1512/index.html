Girls maybe, but I would say most guys just say that so that they can retain back the relationship..<br><br>Furthermore you in Sg, not too many males will attempt suicide. And besides most will just cut their wrist which is so pathetic, coz when you do that you're also making an excuse to delay your death only... Romantic arhz?? big deal manz.. if really willing to die, at least should really do something big, and really show it out...<br><br>Not encouraging people to commit suicide, but just coming to a point that commiting suicide is usually used by guys to get their gf back. but not necessary if he says that means he will love you too, coz chances is that it can be said to other girls too.

Like MOST others have said, chances of him committing suicide is SLIM though not impossible. Other factors to take into consideration would be whether he's experiencing other sources of stress in his life and how your relationship with him is (only the two of you know the better)....<br><br>From the SURFACE of the way you described him he seems to have a flirty nature?<br><br>From your point of view, you also mentioned that you can't let go of the relationship? So you have doubts in him.... Give chances to him... Still love him...<br><br>Think you're uncertain of his true intention? You can just avoid some things and see how things go like MOST couples would do...? Or if you want a more confrontational one, you might want to ask him HOW is he going to resolve the matters revolving around the 2 above mentioned ladies? And perhaps you might also want some form of assurance from him? This, I don't know...? Depends on how FAR in this relationship would you wanna go...?<br><br>Oh well... Good luck?</div>

Sacrifice not saying that you commit suicide lahz.. that is stupidity. Sacrifice is to be willing to risk your everything including life just to for a worthwhile cause, like making sure the person you love will be alive. Just like why would most parents go all out ensure the safety and the future of their children. It may seem like a hassle when they scold you or nag at you, but it's because they are seeing the money that they earn go to waste if you just waste your life away, and not appreciating their sacrifice.<br><br>------------------<br>()""()     ************************<br>( 'o' )     Barely Bearing Berry Belly Bear<br>(,) (,)   =======================<br>(.)_(.)
