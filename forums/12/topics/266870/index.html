            <div class='col-md body'>I have posted a thread about my date with my ex female colleague before...<br><br>Ok, i will get to the point. I confess to this friend of mine whom didn't quite rejected me. She said she wants to be my friend first, try to know each other deeper before we embarked anywhere further. However, things changed after that. I message her, she didn't reply and i have to ask her on msn, then she just reply with a few words. I tried to know her better by organising outing but she said her days are filled, no time for me. Now, the problem is i try to know her better but she doesn't give me the chance. By far, i only send 2 sms and an email to her, so i dun think i pester her in anyway. So does it means that she doesn't intend to give me any chance to be her other half? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"></div>

Actually, i did ask her to meet up with me for 5 min and she agrees. But before i ask this, i ask her out for a bball session and she rejected me cos she have a very busy week with her friend.</div>

After that, you are rejected again? Come on bro, she's not worth your time any more.<br><br>Take note she has rejected you so many times before so it doesn't mean anything even if she says she wants to know you better. Think about it: if she really wants to get to know you better, why is she rejecting all your invitations, smses and emails?<br><br>What I suggest is don't waste your time hanging around on a girl whose heart is not with you.

Actually i want to meet her up once before she is enlisted. As she has to go to tekong (which is notorious for ghost and spirit) for training, i ask her to meet me up for just 5 min so that i can pass something to her. The thing is the amulet i use in tekong the last time and it has proven to be quite effective. Since i cannot be by her side during the training, i thought the amulet can at least help me protect her. However, she rejected me as she claimed it to be a very "personal" item. Then, i ask her i am willing to borrow her, will she takes it? Then she reply me NO. then i am kinda sad... thinking that she dun give me any chance at all... As for the sms i send earlier, she dun reply. I am expecting it since it is already like that before i confessed. Haiz....</div>

Wouldn't she think that you may be trying to cast some love spell over her instead of being able to "help"?<br><br>And...<br><br>you will definitely meet greener pastures.</div>
