            <div class='col-md body'>you shouldnt be living in regrets. instead you should be learning from them . it's never easy to get over someone . but its been 5 years . any wounds should have been healed already . know more female friends . guy friends can do as well . go out with them and have fun . no matter what caused the breakup, who inititated it, how did you break up , its all in the past already . no point going through these memories over and over again . it just makes you relive the past over again . this way you can never move on . just wish the best for your ex , although you cant contact her , but you can still secretly wish the best for her . well i dont think she would want you to be living in such agony either . if she were to know of your state now i think she wouldnt be happy either . so just try to let go . make more friends to fill the gap in you , to at least take your mind off those memories . jiayou (:</div>
