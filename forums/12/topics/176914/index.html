The problem is thats not where he usually sit. what is he thinking? My gf and I quarrelled 1 or 2 times cuz of him.<br><br>This guy, i saw him on bus. I greet him. Guess what? He did not even greet back or look at me, but he smile to himself. Crazy ass. In class he will be looking at me like i snatch away his gf.<br><br>And every now and then, his group of friends will say, "eh go play soccer leh.... Bring your gf along too..." I was like WTF?<br><br>And yesterday they ask, "eh want to watch movie? Bring ur gf along too leh..." I replied "don't want leh, for wat?"

            <div class='col-md body'>if you do not trust them just use some excuse to turn them down lar.<br><br>1) "my gf not free cos she got homework or housework to do."<br><br>2) "how come you all never bring your gf?"<br><br>3) " My gf do not know how to play soccer leh later she complain and complain how?"<br><br>4) " later my gf laugh at you for having such a poor skill then how?"<br><br>How to handle the guy hehe<br><br>Thats the fun part.<br><br>He is trying to make you angry thus in turn you will get jealous then anger set in and you will quarrel with your gf.<br><br>Smart move on his part.<br><br>how to counter.<br><br>1) tell your gf that the guy is acting very funny and you are jealous of his actions, then your gf will usually say haiz "u hor think so much for what". Tell her that u love her so much and kiss her. ;p<br><br>2) he smile at himself rite? look at him and laugh out loud. Repeat this everytime you see him but remember to stop when he comes near.</div>

But sometimes i will joke with them or play soccer with them. 1 of the guy happens to fall in love with my gf. Once in the canteen, when i am not around, he purposely sit infront of my gf. The problem is thats not where he usually sit. what is he thinking? My gf and I quarrelled 1 or 2 times cuz of him.<br><br>This guy, i saw him on bus. I greet him. Guess what? He did not even greet back or look at me, but he smile to himself. Crazy ass. In class he will be looking at me like i snatch away his gf.<br><br>And every now and then, his group of friends will say, "eh go play soccer leh.... Bring your gf along too..." I was like WTF?<br><br>And yesterday they ask, "eh want to watch movie? Bring ur gf along too leh..." I replied "don't want leh, for wat?" And they say "wah you steady lor..."<br><br>What is this group of people thinking? Helping that guy?<br>How am i suppose to deal with them? Are they playing mind games?</div></blockquote>His friends right? Just IGNORE them lah... It could be some sort of mind game if you PLAY ALONG with them... So no point.</div>
