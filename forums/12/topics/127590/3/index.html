Pretty amazing.<br><br>Anyway, since he'd successfully got ur attention, now itz time to for u to get his. Show more concern, not to the point of trying too hard to impress, just be casual... well a little more concern for him, if u catch my drift. Then slowly open urself... please, not ur legs, yet....  I meant ur heart, to him. Tell him about ur troubles, ur inner thoughts, is a good way to let him know tat u have "opened up" to him. In another words, com-mu-ni-cat-ion, babe.<br><br>Since itz his first time, go slow, dun rush it. But not too slow until he lost interest though. Do wat u gals do best, those little little gestures loh, playing of ur hair, holding ur mouth at the transparent glass and looking at him with a sexy, sensal, seductive look which says,"I wan u tonite, baby" ... oooohhh damnn....  wat am I saying!?!?

He definitely was hurted by his ex girlfriend. he love himself more than anyone means he is a selfish person but who knows when you fall in love with someone because i know how strong the love can be. it can change a person and some people treat love is like everything *That was ME :-) * If you really interested in him, you must willing to love his weakness. Try to get more informations , do something to boost up his confidence. for example , hint him that you are waiting for him..
