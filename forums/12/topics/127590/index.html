If you suspect this guy to be so, then you'd have to take the initiative (eg. hold his face with your hands, bore directly into his eyes, etc), but then there is also the risk of scaring the prey away back to his momma.<br><br>However, when he said he "wasn't ready for [a] relationship" because he never had a girlfriend before <span style="font-style: italic;">and</span> that he loved himself too much, then it does not seem to bode well. Unless in a twisted sense he wanted to appear so very "hum jee" that your interest would be piqued, it does not make sense for a guy to tell a girl he is interested in that he loves himself too much (also hinting that he does not have any love left for anybody else, including her).<br><br>A suggestion would be to continue being normal friends with him, chat nonchalantly on MSN, and let things go on their natural course. Perhaps when you get to know him more, you'd have a better idea where you stand in his eyes. Don't rush him -- if you make him wet his pants in front of you, he's never coming back.</div>
