            <div class='col-md body'>actually, if you all tell the truth or want to pursue further , both your dad and brother maybe charged as they engaged each other with weapons.<br>and you being subjected to grevious hurt.<br><br>domestic issues, police officers are trained to make sure it never gets further than outside the house. Even if it does goes to station, it will still be treated like domestic violence where counselling and mediate is alternatives.<br>same as husband and wife fighting.<br><br>unlike outside cases.<br><br>i know how you feel, its bad and you cannot really do anything about it and every day have to face this.<br><br>suggest you strenghtened your mind and thoughts to best diffused situations in case it happens again.  try to avoid brother and also ask your father to avoid him and never apply authoritive control over him.  its to avoid any flaring of tempers.<br><br>from his attitude, the outside society will teach him how to respect others.<br></div>

Except your mum who tries to tolerate..? Hmm...<br><br>At the age of 16 and depending on the kinda company he's with, it's quite likely for him to be more 'hot'... Especially since he has been always sided by your mum?<br><br>At 18... It might be difficult for you... Especially when your brother's so... But if you really DO wanna CARE about your brother, try to speak nicely to him... Don't push him too much but just 'nag' appropriately would do..? Afterall, if he don't heed advices, he's gonna be the one to ultimately pay for it...? And from experience, it'll be DIFFICULT to CHANGE him just like that unless his age goes much older or SOMETHING SERIOUS HAPPENS... Don't give the latter a chance...<br><br>Talk nicely but let him understand that no matter what, no weapon should be used. Ask him... Does he really wanna hurt his dad? How would everyone else feel if he did? How would he feel...? If he don't, why pick up a weapon?<br><br>Try to cool your dad down a bit at the same time... Everybody really should keep their COOL at this point... I know it'll be DIFFICULT for you after how he've treated you, but changes often don't just happen so easily... Unless you're wishing for something drastic to happen...?<br><br>And I'm also adding this part... If you don't care about what would happen to your brother, then pls just REPORT him for what he've done to the POLICE. You'll probably have him 'under your control', but only so for him to be RUINED and HATE you...? And from the sound of your postings, you certainly DO CARE for him?<br><br>GO SLOW... Just try to put some things in the proper places and RIGHT direction 1st.... ALOT would have to depend on himself...? And you guys probably can't be helping him much if you just go on 'force'?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hey guys... thanks. i really really appreciate all the responses...<br><br>here r some updates <span style="text-decoration: underline;">for now</span>: for the past two days, my brother hasnt touched the computer and he has been studying in his room all day.. and he doesnt shout at my mom anymore too. i guess he got pretty scared when the police came that day.<br><br>whenever he sees me, he'll look down and try not to look at me.. so now, i feel very bad also.. but at the same time, when i recall that he punched me that night... i'll get angry.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>my dad is still very very mad with my brother. he refuses to talk to him, doesnt give two hoots. he told me dat he give up totally on my brother already.<br><br>this morning, when my mom wasnt at home, my dad bought breakfast for me but none for my brother. i asked my brother whether he wanted my share coz he had tuition class later until very late, but he said he dont want. then he had to go with an empty stomache... sigh. quite poor thing ?<br><br>i think my dad will forgive my brother only if he apologises sincerely. but i feel that its hard for my brother to apologise for now becos every guy has his pride and ego to carry, i guess.<br><br>well its has only been a mere two days.. so its quite hard to see whether he has changed for the better but anyway i do hope that he has learnt his lesson well this time.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>HiHi.. hope i'm not to late in offering some opinions. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>I'm a 16m myself. And at this age, guys are under a tremendous amount of change be it physically or mentally.<br>Your brother would probably feel very stressed up now, bcos of O's n stuff.<br>I usually quarrel with my parents, but I would always try to cool things down by avoiding a heated up conflict. Whenever i sense that my parents are gonna explode, I would either go to my room and try to sleep or blast the music..<br>I would certainly not beat up anyone in my household... And of course not even my sister.. Its So Wrong to hit a gal..<br><br>Have you tried to understand him better?<br><br>There may be problems troubling him at school or away from home.<br>BGR, School work, Friendship problems..<br>Perhaps he has problems outside of the house..<br><br>I can understand you because I'm also the elder sibling. Whenever ur younger brother does something wrong, you know that he should be punished but when he gets wad he deserves from our parents, you will always feel heartache.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>However, i think that you should leave things as it is now.. Hopefully he learns his lessons in time and he will change to be a better person.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

And the bridge that has broken up between him and your brother is important for now... Nobody can guarantee what would happen in the future, but for the family to be UNITED to OVERCOME whatever should come is an important aspect....</div>
