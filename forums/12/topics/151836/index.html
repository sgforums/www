            <div class='col-md body'>I think it's that phase of life where friends seem to be "more concerned" than parents. I think each of us have been there and done that before. Once your brother gets past this phase, I hope he'll be able to see the light. For me, I detest my parents' nagging a lot when I was at that age. Now, at 25, I looked back and said, that was really silly of me 'coz friends come and go but parents/siblings are for life.<br><br>Good luck for your As. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
