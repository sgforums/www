I had bad impression of his mom on the first time I met her. I bought her tonic wine and bird's nest. She took the bird's nest and return me the wine claiming I am trying to make her family alcoholics.<br><br>I keep my distance from her. I thought staying together, I do not interfere into her affairs, should be ok. But she keep barging into ours and making her lots of negative comments. I caught her a couple of weeks ago making a big complain to my husband because she did not know I was home. The story is that I visit my mom every saturday. I didn't know she cook my share for what but I still ate before I go to visit my mom and still eat there so as not to upset both sides. My FIL comes how eat tills 1 mouth full of everything is left, fish head is left. my MIL bad mood and next day I got hit. She claim I waste her food (in any given week, she waste more food than I do in a year - I eat all left overs the whole family do not touch). She even complain to my mom about this. Then in the evening I came home to hear her shouting loudly about the left over food and what a bad daughter-in-law and etc and etc and I waste food and etc. I just listen to all her big fat lies and I know I should never want to be close to this woman. She's rotten to the core.  Couple of days later, I told my husband that I was scolded for asting food but I also said I ate before I left. I didn't know it was kept for me. But he seem like he didn't believe.  You see, my MIL can make a big drama over left over food, what can she not make a drama of.<br><br></div>

My wife always threaten divorce whenever we quarrel. Both of us are bad-tempered, and a small tiff can escalate into a big fight. But I love her and separation is never on my mind.

She can explode, even into streaks of violence, but is quick to forgive and forget. I am calm, argue rationally, but difficult to forget fights. Perhaps it's me, but I've noticed that I have not gone on a full week without her finding fault and starting an argument with me.<br><br>Latest saga now is: -<br>I complain mildly that she controls over me too strictly, and asks too many questions.<br>She denies it.<br>I quote a few examples and she flares up.<br>She said if I have reported everything, then she wouldn't need to ask.<br>I told her if she were more supportive, then I would have shared everything with her.<br>She threaten divorce after exploding...again.<br>Feeling I may be too frank, I apologise.<br>She never calm down.<br><br>Now we are still not talking.

I intend to voice my request. Eventually I will ask my mom if I can move back to my brother's place to stay. Then I might rent a place somewhere. Wait and see.  Anyways, he had said if I make the request to break, he will not fight or try, he will follow through. He twisted it in such a way that I am totally responsible for the break up. He had never admitted his part in our quarrel until recently, he thinks he's part of the trouble but still he believe I cause everything.<br><br>Well he never apologise for the hurtful things he said but expect immediate apology from me if I say or do something wrong.

            <div class='col-md body'>Another long post from me again! Please take time and read it through, (NOT) Frustrated_guy...<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by Frustrated_guy:<br><strong>Everyone, thanks for your reply.<br><br>We woke up and everything seemed better. I made the 1st move and apologise to her. She smiled a bit and the situation became less tense. Then she started to nag on how being my wife, she has the right to know EVERYTHING. I just kept quiet until the 'noise' dissipated. Then unexpectedly, her mood turned for the worse and she became aggitated again. I checked my HP for a sms, and she did not ask me this time! She always never fails to ask me who is it, what they want, what I going to do.<br><br>She started going into her frenzy mode again and threaten divorce once more. She knows I hate the word, maybe she did it to irritate me?! I really don't know what to do. I must be a very ignorant husband. I feel like my PC just exploded in front of me and I'm clueless to how it happen and how to repair it!!<br><br>Anyway, I left her house. She's with her parents and I'm back in my house. The word, divorce, is still ringing in my head and she is like the persistent salesman. I'm like the fish who is tempted to take the bait, but I don't want! There are like an angel and devil to my thoughts. One is tempting me to where there is extreme freedom, the other telling me we should work hard for this relationship. Arrgghh....<br><br>Sianz!!!</strong>[/b]</blockquote>I think it will take a little more time for this conflict to slowly die down. It is a good call from you to be at peace with her...<br><br>It will really need time for the relationship to cool down... Tolerating your 'berserk' partner is crucial, and do keep your cool and do not start provoking her...<br><br>For now, she is still a little bit insecure... And only you can give her the assurance, remain true to your wife and get closer to her. Try not to spend too much time after work outside, instead... go home to your wife... (even though she may be very temperamental!) Let her know that she is the only person in your life that is the most important to you!<br><br>If possible, help her out in some household chores during the weekends or sometimes during the weekdays when you are free... doing this will help ease her stress of housework and it shows her that you care for her and do not want her to overwork and become too 'mad' at you...<br><br>Maybe if she screams the word 'divorce' again, tell her that you love her and not to mention that word again, try to sit down and talk it out with her on the issues that she thinks is pulling this relationship apart...<br><span style="color: red;"><strong><br><span style="font-style: italic;">A few tips on how to ask her and when is the right time to do so:</span><br><br>- The next time she screams, it is a good time to ask her!<br><br>- Get her to sit down, don't shout at her though! Ask her nicely to sit with you on the sofa or by the dining table and explain to her that you really want a resolution to this relationship instead of having this war between both of you each and every day. Tell her that you really mean it and you really like her to participate in this one-to-one dialogue session.<br><br>- Talk to her nicely, remember your tone of speech! Do not use a tone that provokes her into thinking that you are trying to start another arguement or fight.<br><br>- Tell her firstly to share with you what are your bad points that contribute to such a relationship, do not get angry with her during the process! But jot down whatever she says and reflect on it later during the day... do take time to reflect and think about it and determine yourself to make that change for your wife and for the sake of this relationship!<br><br>- Next, prepare her to hear what you have got to say about her - her bad points. Tell her not to receive it in a bitter note, but to receive and reflect it through again later that day. After you prepared her to face what you have got to say to her (Ask her to try and keep her cool - like how you kept yours when she voiced out her displeasures about you.) Do share your thoughts about her that you think contributes to such a nasty relationship and tell her nicely how she can make that change in order to save this relationship, do encourage her along the way in later days...<br><br>- Ask about what she feels or thinks about this relationship, and how it can be better. (Share this after all the bad points about one another has been spilled out... Let her explain her points first before you explains yours. Like what the saying goes: "Ladies first!".)<br><br>- Share with her what you feel and think about the relationship too and share with her your point of view on how you and her can save this relationship together. (e.g. Tell her that you really would not want the relationship to continue going on 'hard rocks', and that in order to reach a resolution to the matter, tell her that both of you will need to cooperate and help one another instead of shouting and arguing when any of you makes a mistake.)<br><br>- After the dialogue session is done, tell her that you want to take time to reflect on what she has previously said, and assure her that you will try your best to make that change for her in order to salvage this relationship. Encourage her to do so as well... (I'll suggest you and her to go somewhere that is quiet and peaceful, something that allows your mind to concentrate on only reflecting the bad points and start correcting yourselves.)<br><br>(The next point that I am going to share is own-time-own-target, only when you feel that it is the right time to do it, then carry on...)<br><br>- Later that day or on the next day - depending on whether both of you have finished reflecting... Meet up with one another (The best place is at home, where it is private.) and show her the points that you crafted out while reflecting that will help you make that change on what she has voiced out earlier. (The best way to prove to her that you will make that change for her is to show her beforehand what are the points that you have decided to make a change in, let her be the referee who sees that you don't stick to your bad points anymore and let her be the coach who will want to see you make that change and will encourage you and groom you along the way...)<br><br>- Let her show you her points that she is determining in herself to make that change also... so that you will be her referee and coach... like what I have earlier said.<br><br>- <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Encourage and groom one another</span> into the person both of you desires to be. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Continue to</span> treat each other with due <span style="text-decoration: underline;">respect and love</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">avoid quarrels and arguments</span>, and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">be nice and kind to one another.</span><br></strong></span><br><br>Remember to keep your cool, do not let her influence her with her bad temper and mood! However, start to influence her with your lovingkindness and tenderness... so that she will change for the better too! Help one another - basic principle of keeping a relationship strong! Good luck!<br><br>Trying my best to help you as well! Do message me the results... I wish you the best to you and your partner in your love life with one another forever!<br><br>IMPORTANT NOTE: Do not let the word 'divorce' continue to ring in your head! The outcome of your relationship really depends on what you decide to set your mind on... (Do you want to set your mind on positive thoughts and achieve positive results or do you want to dwell in negative thoughts and gain negative results? It is all up to you...) It really depends on your thought-life, because your mind governs your system (body). My suggestion for you is to replace the word 'divorce' with the word 'reconciliation'... so whenever you think about it, think about reconciling with her! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
