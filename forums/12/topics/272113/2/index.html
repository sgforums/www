You have to sit down and talk to your wife ,communicate with her often and see what is really bothering her.Is it because she is afraid of losing you for some reasons like not being able to bear a child or she feels that you no longer finds her attrative,too much work at the office....I dont know,you have to find that out soon.Divorce is a taboo word for all married couple so do not use this word just to get back at each other or someday both of you are really going to end up hurt.Everybody has temper and so you both need moments  to cool down.When she is about to blow over the top all she has to do is say the word 'TIME OUT'' and like wise with you.In time outs dont say anything ,not even nice things just keep your mouth shut until she is back to herself again.I think your marriage would get back on track if you both start to throw all the bad ingredients that is spoiling it and keep only what is good and those which made you two want to spend the rest of your life with.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Frustrated_guy, please take time and read below what I got to say to you regarding the saving of your relationship now... Hopefully I can bring you to that clear realisation of how to save this relationship before it is too late!<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Fatum:</div><div class="quote_body">try post quarrel sex ...<br><br>no, I'm serious ! .... turn the furry into passion ... grab her and hurry her to bed ...<br></div></blockquote>In my opinion, sex does not solve the problem... You have to no matter what, rid the problem at its root, and not for a moment look for something to ease the pain caused by the problem. Dear Fatum, you are really making sex like some pain-killer drug when it is not even one... It does not work like what you see in the movies... Sex is not meant for enjoyment purposes! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"> I totally disagree with what you have just said.<br><br>Even after doing it, the root of the problem is still not being addressed - then what is the point of having it in the first place? You will end up quarreling with her again soon enough! I would rather you sort things out with her and try not to anger one another anymore.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Omniknight:</div><div class="quote_body">I am NEVER going to marry.</div></blockquote>To Omniknight, are you sure you will not marry in your entire lifetime? Woah... you do not know what you will be missing out in having a family! Believe me... family life is very rewarding... you will be missing out the benefits of having a family... How do you know you will fall into such problems when you don't even want to try to start a family and try to take your hand and solve them?<br><br>As long as both of you (husband and wife) are able to cohabit together and help one another solve the problems encountered, share the burden each of them may face during lfe as a family and no matter what, love each other despite what has become of your partner... then can a relationship start to grow stronger...<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by laoda99:</div><div class="quote_body">If u still want to save ur marriage, dun ever think of divorce, coz u will really do it.<br><br>If u have kids, it will be worse. The kids will end up bringing problems to you, school and society.<br><br>Since u know ur weak points, i think the only way is to avoid arguments.<br><br>I tend to think that there are underlying issues between u and ur wife. U have to think of what these issues are and sort them out.<br><br></div></blockquote>These underlying issues are dangerous and is already causing your relationship with your wife to enter dangerous boundaries. Make right whatever is wrong in you before you make right whatever that is in your wife! Reconcilation can only come when one corrects his mistakes before he starts correcting the mistakes of his partner.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Frustrated_guy:</div><div class="quote_body">Latest saga now is: -<br>I complain mildly that she controls over me too strictly, and asks too many questions.<br>She denies it.<br>I quote a few examples and she flares up.<br>She said if I have reported everything, then she wouldn't need to ask.<br>I told her if she were more supportive, then I would have shared everything with her.<br>She threaten divorce after exploding...again.<br>Feeling I may be too frank, I apologise.<br>She never calm down.<br></div></blockquote>You will really need to try your best not to complain and spark another heated argument with her again... The reason why she is controling you so strictly is because she feels very insecure in this relationship, you will need to start assuring her your love and show a greater degree of care and concern to her... Show her you still love her... Do not quote examples and provoke her! You are just causing her to explode and get mad with you again!<br><br>Forgive her for what she has done and forget whatever things that she has done against you, because all these thoughts will continue to haunt you until you get a divorce with her! If you really want to save this relationship, please try your best to forgive and forget and start anew and afresh with your wife, and make it up to her once again! Please do not call her 'unsupportive' (she will certainly blow because you fail to consider her position in this matter! She is trying to tie ends together yet you are somewhat scolding her for doing so...), the reason why she seems 'unsupportive' to you now is because you in the first place did not make yourself 'transparent' to her! I don't want to scold you brother, but I want to show you the problems between both of you and wish that you will sincerely address the issues as soon as possible!<br><br>I sense that she is also feeling very terrible inside her, as she does not feel secure in this relationship and having to flare up to someone she loves... She is mentioning things like divorcing with you is more of a threat that she hopes will shock you into a clear realisation of the matter, but if you really agree to the divorce... I think you will really break her heart even more! I am not saying that she does not mean what she says... she just wants you to come clean and save this relationship, save it before she really starts preparing to leave this relationship with you...<br><br>My suggestion to you now, is to pay more attention to your wife, despite how 'unlovely' she might be now whenever she argues or gives you that look that your dislike... The problem now is the security in the relationship, you as her husband, must address this issue before such insecurity and tensions tear you both apart.<br><br>Before I end the post, I would like to share with you (Frustrated_guy)my views and tips on how you can secure and keep your relationship with your wife afloat... Please read through them and consider...<br><span style="color: red;"><strong>Key ingredients to a successful relationship:</strong><br><br>- Faithfulness (Stay faithful to your beloved forever...)<br><br>- Care and Concern (Show your partner your care and concern for her... Let your partner know that she can always first come to you for help because she knows that you will always be there to help her out...)<br><br>- Tolerance (Tolerate your partner despite times of struggle... Show her you still love and care for her, and not quarrel over trivial issues with her that hurts the relationship... do not provoke her and jeopardize the relationship!)<br><br>- Honesty and Transparency (Do not lie or cover up anything from your partner from knowing... If you do so, your partner may feel a little shaky in her relationship with you... I am sure you too will feel shaky if your wife does something behind your back, not letting you know anything about it... Being transparent to your partner is important, it plays a part in assuring your love for her...)<br><br>- Assurance (Your partner needs that guarantee from you that you will not abandon her for another woman... Give her the assurance that you will be by her side forevermore... Note: Reading of FHM/Maxim/Playboy Magazines or seeing Pornography betrays this assurance! If you are engagaed in any of the two or both of the mentioned activities, please end it for the sake of your relationship and salvage all the good relations you have with your wife before it is too late!)<br><br>- Uprightness (Be upright in all that you do and stay true to your wife, do not cheat on her feelings by doing things that spoil the entire relationship...)<br><br>- Cooperation (Cooperate with one another and help solve any unsolved problems that may threaten your relationship with your wife.)<br><br>- Love and Patience (These two areas come together to form the most lasting form of love - which is 'Agape' love (a type of love that is unconditional, stands strong admist the passing of time, the love that secures a relationship... the purest form of love...) Love and Patience cannot be separated from one another if you really want a lasting relationship with your partner... Learn to love her more and show your affection and adoration for her...</span><br><br>Hopefully what I have said can help you save your relationship with your wife...

The humid weather, dressing up is sweaty and uncomfortable. We are easily agitated. Therefore the slightest thing invokes a harse response.<br>2. There are a few lose ends to tie up before leaving. Like leaving food for the cat, making phone calls,  switching off the electric kettle etc., touching up makeup, what to bring, and what not,  and she expect me to be automatic, instead of just waiting at the door, fuming. Trouble is I am not telepathic, and cannot read her mind. And therefore I get some rebuke. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br>3. This is a pattern of behaviour.<br><br>Acknowledge it, and bring it out into the open. And watch out for it. I will say, "See, when we are going out, we will always quarrel."

Why do girls expect us to read their minds? Worse case is I'm routine based, whereas she is random based.

Quote an example to her:<br><br>If today we don't communicate with our parents, how do we expect our children in future to comminicate with us?
