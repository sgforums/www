This could be due to dissatisfaction with the current situation. Accusing someone with self assumptions or simply from  self  imagination of situation is harmful. One must know that accusation and possessiveness are not love. Proving one's assumption needs one's capability than simply assuming.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey TS,<br><br>I think you really need to settle your wife down for a talk.  Preferably, find a moment in your life when you are not quarreling, and are level headed.  Perhaps, after a good meal, or something good.  Find a good premise to begin with.<br><br>Tell her how you feel.  That despite the friction and quarrels, divorce is something that you would refuse to consider in the first place.  And try to talk to her and find out why she's always "proposing" a divorce whenever you quarrel.<br><br>This talk is not a confrontation, a real heart to heart talk.  Avoid using words like "You always say", "Threaten", "Anyhow."  Be thoughtful about the words you use.  Women are sensitive creatures.<br><br>There could be many reasons why she reacts in such a manner.  Perhaps she's feeling insecure.  Perhaps you're not spending enough time with her.  Or maybe she thinks you're having an affair ( I hope not).<br><br>Quarrels are unavoidable, and neither are they the source of your problems.  Be committed to have "good" fights with her, where both of you don't threaten to walk out, and are resolute in working things out together.<br><br>Cheers mate!</div>

PRONTO.<br><br>Destroying her marriage is not destroying TS's life ??? Hello ?<br><br>Abuse comes in many forms, not just physical. It can be emotional, verbal, financial etc.<br>Spousal abuse does not ALWAYS means the woman is the victims.<br>Women DO abuse their husbands too. Unfortunately, most men will chose to remain silent because they don't want to be a laughing stock to others.<br><br>If his wife does appreciate him so much, she wouldn't treat him this way.<br>Perhaps TS is such a lousy husband, she don't give much shite credit that's why this marriage is so explosive.<br><br>Hope is always the factor why abused spouses and partner remains in a abusive relationship.<br><br>Not everyone is suitable to be a marriage partner. This is the hard fact.<br><br></div>
