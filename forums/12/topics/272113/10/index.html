I do not care about being a laughing stock and stuff. In fact, what people say seldom bother me. The fact that you mention "not happy, then quit" is the kind of brain wash that Disney and television has done to us.<br><br>Remember, we all choose our own spouse. Nobody forced a gun on our head and told us to marry. Don't forget the marriage vows that couple take together,[b]"share riches and in poverty....share happiness and in sadness". </strong>If love does not exist, I would have called it quits. Anyway, I posted here to seek help, not criticism. This is the 1st time I've shared so much with anybody. If I do not let it all out and bottle it up, I fear the consequences could be worse.[/b]</blockquote>Yes, basically one chooses. Except for marriage, everything else is easy to resolve when our choice doesn't turn out as expected or satisfactory. I may like a car and bought it. If it turns out to be a lemon, I sell it. Love? Not exactly. For marriage, there are more complicated issues. People have feelings and attachments. Car doesn't have feeling for you nor does it get attached to you.<br>Love is the usual excuse to get married but every counselor will tell you that it takes more then love to make the marriage work. And it takes both parties, not one!<br>So, how you want to resolve your frustrations is up tp you. No one here is going to force you.<br>But don't you think you are whinning here?</div>

However when I bring up past actions he done, he claims I am digging up the past or when I correct him about his immediate behaviour, he gets defensive and start pointing out all my faults.

I am not a person who will revent my decision when I move ahead. I don't care and do not think back and I don't have regret because its really the past. I will walk out and never go back. And I will make sure he paid me every singe cent I spend. All through my dating days, to marriage to the house I paid half and bought him many gifts and he hardly ever buy me anything. Holidays we go on, I also paid up. I even paid for a couple of long distance trips and he didn't even have to spend a single cent.  To tell you the truth, he does not intend to improve or study to even achieve his 'O' levels cert or take up any training to improve himself. But I let him be and respect him. But when I keep having to pay for everything when his big mouth keep saying he can support me, I laff in my heart and never believe a single word. He can barely support his spendthrif lifestyle.<br><br>I can survive better on my own - never needed him and he does not provide me anything or support emotionally or otherwise.

However, I am unwilling to stay unhappy anymore.  I rather choose to be happy be it single or otherwise.<br>I do not want kids until I can be sure and settled down because I do not want to bring more trouble to myself and the child. If the adults cannot live correctly and properly, having the kid will just make things worse.<br><br>Just push me one more time and I will really move out and I will accept his request to divorce. I am not a person who will revent my decision when I move ahead. I don't care and do not think back and I don't have regret because its really the past. I will walk out and never go back. And I will make sure he paid me every singe cent I spend. All through my dating days, to marriage to the house I paid half and bought him many gifts and he hardly ever buy me anything. Holidays we go on, I also paid up. I even paid for a couple of long distance trips and he didn't even have to spend a single cent.  To tell you the truth, he does not intend to improve or study to even achieve his 'O' levels cert or take up any training to improve himself. But I let him be and respect him. But when I keep having to pay for everything when his big mouth keep saying he can support me, I laff in my heart and never believe a single word. He can barely support his spendthrif lifestyle.<br><br>I can survive better on my own - never needed him and he does not provide me anything or support emotionally or otherwise. So really I do not feel I gained anything with marriage but just a lot of debts, extra work for the house and his parents to please.<br></div></blockquote>Hi Misty,<br><br>I am sorry for your predicament. Yeah, I can't be sure if I want kids anymore 'cause we always fight and she'll always suggest divorce. She's those type that will run away with kid one day and leave me alone. She has threatened this before(even before we have kids) and it scared me. Unfortunately, I bear grudges as well, but I've learnt not to, and most importantly, never bring any old accounts up when we argue. Same thoughts; if we adults cannot co-exist properly, we are just bringing harm to the kid if we seperate.<br><br>We do not have financial issues and seldom quarrel about it. In fact, when she moody, I will try to brighten her up by buying gifts to her. Yes, I did bring her to holiday as well. It doesn't matter 'cause I dote on her out of my free will.<br><br>Latest update is that we just had an sms fight. Of course, she suggested we separate again. This time, she said she is not threatening and avoid using the word divorce. I suspect she may have read this forum. My mind is in a mess right now. I sms her to see a marriage counsellor together, but she did not reply. I fear the end may be near for me as well  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

I guess the tips I shared with you are not really helping for now - probably because the relationship has move to a stage that is beyond your control and intervention - it is best to look for a counsellor to patch up and restore ties between you and your wife.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>For now, please still continue to stay at your best form and not agitate her further... Frankly speaking, the fury that she blows whenever she is agitated can seriously damage her health and yours too. Stay at peace with her, no point getting angry along with her, also don't try shut her up... just let her thrash...<br><br>Perhaps you are feeling rather sick and tired of her whinning, her anger and all her unhappy points... try to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">hang in there</span> for a little while more until you look for a counsellor...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>Depending on the situation, sometimes it is best for both of you to have some time of separation to soothe issues and after a few weeks or months later, return back to one another and determine whether are you or is she happier without either party or feel lost without either party. <strong>This temporary separation</strong>... although it <strong>may be rather drastic</strong> for some partners, but it is <strong>the only way </strong>for both parties <strong>to determine whether divorce is really the key </strong>or not and to <strong>allow both parties to have a moment with themselves and reflect</strong> on what they have done and what they could have done to make things better. <strong><span style="color: red;">(This is just what some counsellors might suggest, but please still look for one for help - he/she may have other better advices and suggestions to give to both of you.)</span></strong><br><br>By the way, I am unsure of the faith you are believing in... could you message me to my Mailbox the details regarding which faith do you believe in?

That's agape love - unconditional love, to give love unconditionally, with no strings attached. But do bear in mind that in a relationship there must always be a two-way flow of giving between the two partners. One can give love all the time, but in order for the relationship to work out... a response from the other party is needed!<br><br>It something like responding to your partner... Let's take for example, I give you a present - that's the giving part... and you accept it and say thanks - that's the response part...<br><br>That response is needed or else the person who is giving will feel appreciated and happy that he is able to give. If there is no response or probably a bad response was given by the other party, what is the use of giving in the first place? In the end, you will be all stressed out because the other party failed to appreciate the 'gifts of love' that you might have given unconditionally all this while...<br><br>By the way, the love you have for your handphone, computer, etc. cannot be applied to a relationship... it's way different!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks guys for the advice.<br><br>Last Friday, after I received no sms from her, I returned home. Then she pulled a luggage bag to my house to collect all her stuff. It was very bad. She was prepared to end it all. We had a really big fight, but finally got her to sit down and lay out all the cards!!!<br><br>I scolded her, but at the same time reasoned with her. Surprisingly, she was able to hear what I said. I manage to pin-point what went wrong with her and also admitted how I might not have paid her enough attention. Me, being more positive and strong, I told her how she was heading the wrong way, being so irrational and wilful all the time.<br><br>She calmed down and began to realise that I had made sense. Hey, my wife was not that crazy after all. She told me she needed more support from me. Anyway, long story short, I believe our problems were due to lack of proper communications. I do not like confrontations, but I am not a bad debater as well. So when I showed how she done wrong and told her not to be like this, she just agreed.<br><br>I hope this is not some temporary peace. I think I need to work on it more to maintain a healthy relationship. Anyway, thanks again for all the advice.</div>
