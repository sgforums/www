Yes, they do have marital problems but they try to work it out.  Some couples have been married 12 years, some 6 years and etc, they are still working on their marriages.  There is no perfect couple, who are completely compatible.  To have a long lasting happy marriage, you need to work hard on it.<br><br>If you are looking for the perfect marriage where there is no differences among the couple, first instance of red flag and you are going to abandon your partner, i feel sorry for your partner (or maybe partners) too.  my advice to you is, dont get married.  i really dunno how many marriages you will have to go through to realise that there is no perfect couple or happy marriage without hard work.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I may not agree with a lot of Jojo's posting but this time she hit the nail on the head.<br><br>Yes, marriage is never a bed of roses. There are the thorns and the weeds to take into consideration and to work it out BUT if the marriage is an abusive one especially on one partner and when the partner refuse to go for counselling then the other party has to really consider if the marriage is worth working as it is here only one party is really working on the relationship and not two as expected.<br><br>TS marriage is only a year old and the wife is already exhibiting this kind of unacceptable behavior. How long do you think TS can last? How many times can he take this kind of abuse?Two years, 5 years? One of this day he might hit the point of no return and throw in the towel and then the situation might be worse than now as they probably might have kids already. Now who will suffer more here?<br><br>Take it from a man who has 18 happy blissful years of marriage under his belt with a fantabulous wife. We have our ups and downs but never even once did either of us mention that word 'divorce' when we have our disagreements or quarrels. Frankly that word is a taboo.<br></div>

There are the thorns and the weeds to take into consideration and to work it out BUT if the marriage is an abusive one especially on one partner and when the partner refuse to go for counselling then the other party has to really consider if the marriage is worth working as it is here only one party is really working on the relationship and not two as expected.<br><br>TS marriage is only a year old and the wife is already exhibiting this kind of unacceptable behavior. How long do you think TS can last? How many times can he take this kind of abuse?Two years, 5 years? One of this day he might hit the point of no return and throw in the towel and then the situation might be worse than now as they probably might have kids already. Now who will suffer more here?<br><br>Take it from a man who has 18 years of happy blissful years of marriage under his belt with a fantabulous wife. We have our ups and downs but never even once did either of us mention that word 'divorce' when we have our disagreements or quarrels. Frankly that word is a taboo.<br></div></blockquote>you are married for 18 years, how many children do you have?<br><br>how old were you when your wife gave birth to them, and how old was she then?</div>
