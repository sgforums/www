That's agape love - unconditional love, to give love unconditionally, with no strings attached.

Let's take for example, I give you a present - that's the giving part... and you accept it and say thanks - that's the response part...<br><br>That response is needed or else the person who is giving will feel appreciated and happy that he is able to give. If there is no response or probably a bad response was given by the other party, what is the use of giving in the first place? In the end, you will be all stressed out because the other party failed to appreciate the 'gifts of love' that you might have given unconditionally all this while...<br><br>By the way, the love you have for your handphone, computer, etc. cannot be applied to a relationship... it's way different!</div></blockquote>I try to love without expecting anything back. But it won't work if I try alone, right? Yes, I tried to participate as best as I can in this marriage, but at the same time got tired of hearing the word 'divorce'.<br><br>For now, it is peaceful.

I had already asked her to see a psychologist, but she'll rather choose divorce/separation than counselling. If it were to really end, it'll end badly.

I asked her to see psychologist or counsellor, she rejected both.<br>-------------<br>Hello guy, well first thing's first.. did you just thought that something wrong with your wife?<br>And are you sure, she's the one who thought of divorce things? Not you? coz however angry woman, i dont think she will say the divorce stuff.. (Just like me, however i'm angry to my husband, how big we fight, i never ever thought or just think, or even say want to divorce, but i dont knot about guys! LOL) but not if She's really have a strong feeling, that you're cheated on her.<br>Now, ask your self, "Why she think that you're cheat on her?"<br>-------------<br>2) Our communication seems lacking. Whatever she did, she did not tell me what's on her mind. I had to tell her that I not telepathic.<br>-------------<br>Here we go, sometimes when woman say she's okay, just let it OKAY, maybe  she dont want to talk about it. Dont worry in the moment she can't handle what she think or feel she will share with you the thing that bother her.<br>But, if you really know her you should know what she think and feel lor.. It's not about telepathic things anyway!<br>-------------<br>3) She is not as controlled of her feelings as I am. If she gets angry, she will go all out to destroy whatever is in her path, even to the extent of hurting herself. When I argue with her, at the same time, I feel worried for her.<br>----------------<br>If you know that you're not controlling your self... then control your self guy, come on, you're a guy you should be and ACT like a MAN.<br>Try to learn how to be a good husband in HOLY MARRIAGE by JESUS.<br>I'm not saying for just you, for your wife too.<br>Hurting herSelf? How?<br>-----------------<br>4) She underestimated my capacity for divorce. She said the reason I do not want a divorce is (because I scared I lose face and I have not found my fling yet(no backup)). She REALLY knows how to make it worse. I told her I can't even handle 1 crazy girl, much less handle 2, and the reason if we divorce need not be I have a mistress, it will ultimately be because I crave for freedom more than anything else.<br>-----------------<br>Haha... so you think your wife is crazy guy? GUYS!<br>let me ask you.. So if you dont have a face, and you had a fling or BACKUP GIRL? you will divorce her? This is totally wrong guy! You've gone too far.. ~bai duo~ if you really love her, you should try your best and do whatever you can to let her stay be with you..<br>Now im confuse leh.. You are the one who tot' of divorce or your wife?<br>--------------------------<br>I told her not to be "so naughty"(couple talk) and take a mental step back and review her own actions. She eventually saw my points and we made up. Yup, being the man of the house, sometimes I have to flare up too. </div></blockquote></div>

She tracks my movement. And no, I do not believe in flings or mistress whatsoever. Lastly, good for you if you do not theaten divorce, your husband will not get frustrated like I am and post it here.<br><br>2) When things bother my wife, it will bother me. Even when she says itz OK, obviously any guy will know it's not. If she does not share, then I will get more worried. Because it can easily lead to depression, it would be better if I help share the burden.<br><br>3) I am trying to learn how to be a good husband. If I were to ACT LIKE A MAN like you suggested, I would act with all my pride and ego and end this marriage. What you are suggesting is totally harmful. Don't you know that long periods of depression might lead to suicide? So, even if I argue with her, I would worry if she do something irrational.<br><br>4) Read carefully. It's her who accused me of all this. I did not think of all this.<br><br></div>
