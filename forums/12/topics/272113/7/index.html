Maybe they will regret, some may not. Like the type of man Misty describe about her husband, such obstinate and self-deluded people may just think that you are the one at fault.  The fault is never theirs and never will be.</div>

How come so similar? Is the wife a lost twin sister of my wife?<br><br>Frankly, for your friend and myself, point no.3 and 4 contradict each other. If the wife wants out of this marriage, why have kids in the 1st place? If the kid come out liao, then both still cannot live in peace, then separate, the kid will suffer! Both my wife and I love kids, but I do not want my kid(if anyway) to suffer if we cannot get along. I can imagine if my kid like me next time grow up liao, surely disobey my wife one.<br><br>Anyway, I earn more than my wife, but I always undervalue my financial status. We do not own a car, so nothing to grumble about. As for scared of her, it actually hurts more than scared. If I were to agree to the divorce, it will break her heart. Somehow, I suspect it could be a wilful irresponsible statement to spite me, but she's real good at doing this  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>
