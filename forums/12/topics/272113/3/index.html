            <div class='col-md body'>Friend, I seriously would not advise u to choose the option unless it's the last option.<br><br>1st: Marriage is not like boyfren and galfren relationship. Once both have decided to get married..then in comes the word 'responsibility'. Marriage in itself is a committment to make the relationship last till the end of each other's life. If you or her are not prepared to make this commitment, then better remain as boyfren and galfren in the first place.<br><br>It's just a year of marriage. Both of u shd really sit down and voice out your grievances. I know inside your mind now...you have many grievances..like why she dun understand u..why she unreasonable etc etc. However, maybe your wife has another picture in her mind? Maybe there are certain things that she is keeping inside her which u did not realise? Communication is vital here. Let me remind u. It's just a year of marriage. Give it more chance. Maybe on her part...she is 'overwhelmed' by the sudden marriage commitment...maybe she is feeling insecure etc. We can carry on speculate....but let me tell u....a woman will not suddenly 'change' from a loving galfriend to a horrid wife in just a matter of a year. I believe there are more to it than meets the eye. Thus, a sincere communication between both of u is vital. No use speculating. There are many family experts who may act as mediator....dont' feel ashamed to seek their assistance....sometimes....through them.....you or your wife can communicate better...<br><br>2nd: If both of u reached the irreversible situation, then it's time to realise the aftermath of a divorce. Please note that Singapore law give more 'protection' to women..in the form of Women's Charter. Guys will most of the time lose out and they will have to continue providing for their ex-wives until she re-marries. If you have children and they are given custody to her, be prepared to pay more. Of cos not all cases will result in guys having to support their ex-wives. But most of the time, it's the guys who will have to fork out.<br><br>3rd: Have u ever thought of the consequences of divorce? Yes. you may be tempted at times. But consequences? What if u regret after the divorce?<br><br>Do yourself and your wife a favour. Seek a mediator. Communicate. Do not paint a picture that your wife is at fault. Or you are at fault. Thrash it out amiably and decide later.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Chrysalis_Guy,<br><br>Thanks for your advice. I think she also don't want divorce, but she said it mainly to spite me 'cause I don't like to hear it. Spouses really know how to hurt each other when they quarrel.<br><br>Anyway, I back with her liao. Atmosphere is better. I said she's such a berserker. She said yeah, she's the master berserker. HAHA! I hope this peace can last a week or more.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To begin with, you have to first understand the motivation for your wife's anger and retort. I think it is clear that she is extremely insecure - her defense is always her worst fear because she thinks by bringing it out to the open as a 'weapon' it's her best protection because she 'said it first'. In many ways, it is how any animal would attack if it had been wounded - recklessly without considering how it would hurt itself.<br><br>And that's really what insecurity is about - an open wound that is always smarting and hurting with the smallest amount of agitation. The question is - why is she insecure? I think when both of you are calm, you should ask her - what do you need to do so that she feels secure?<br><br>The deeper issue though is that if a person has gone off tangent in her pursuit for security - which is what I think your wife has , obsessive about privacy so much that she resents any other competition for your attention - then I think what she demands from you will never be enough, its already an obsession.<br><br>Someone needs to put matters back into perspective for her. How to have a healthy relationship where trust and security exist as support for love, not chains. Perhaps you can try to share how much you care about the marriage, though I think you might consider marriage counselling eventually.<br><br>But for the time being, I think you need to realise she is not doing what she is doing to hurt you - that everytime she says things ilke this, she carves a deeper hurt and wound into herself that makes it harder for her to be recover.<br><br></div>

It is sort of a motherly instinct. Some couples think that having baby can solve matrimonial rift. Some couples felt that it is time to have baby as they are more financially stable or they began to feel that baby can bring them more joys.<br><br>However, a relationship got to be strong, cooperative before a couple is to have baby, as baby requires lots of work, monies, attention and most importantly love.
