One can't help but wonder.<br><br>As a future father. It is best you consider what kind of mother you will be getting for your child.<br><br>True, you cannot simply send your child back for a refund.<br>That is why you must be careful if both of you decide to create one.<br><br>True, you cannot abandon your child if he/she frustrates you.<br>But do not compare a  child and a adult.<br>Children are never rational creatures, they are free spirits.<br>They do not manipulate another human being like an adult does.<br><br>So you see, there are reason why you should accept a child's behavior, and why you shouldn't accept unreasonable/destructive behaviour from a adult as old as yourself.<br>Now, is your wife a child ?<br><br>Today, she uses divorces against you, few years down the road, she will use the child against you. What will you do then ?<br><br>Will you be putting your child up to live a life of turmoil or disharmony ?<br>A broken family or a family of anger and in-fighting ?<br><br>Today, you can put up with your wife's unreasonable behavior, can your child take it as well ?<br>Children are fragile little things, their emotional well being is not as hardened as the adults.<br><br>Your love may pull through... but for how long ?<br><br>Love is irrational. Right now it is only between the two of you.<br><br>When a child comes along, it will mean an innocent party gets involved.<br>Think twice. As a father, you must do what is best for your kid.<br><br>Not only must you provide for your child, you must also ensure the mother is emotionally stable and mentally sound to properly care for your child and teach him/her the right values.<br><br>You can choose your wife, your child cannot choose his/her mother.<br>From what you have posted so far, I highly doubt the marriage will survive pregnancy and child rearing.<br><br>Unless, you decide never to have kids with this woman, then yes, love will suffice.<br><br></div>
