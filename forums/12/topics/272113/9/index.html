Every time you apologise so that you guys can patch up signals to her that she still has the upper hand and her strategy is still working. Bad mistake...... Stand your ground.

God,.. that was bad, my wife and mother disagreeing. I stood my ground and listened to neither. Did what I feel was right every time there was a disagreement and made it clear that I do not appreciate any one of them bad mouthing the other or wanting to control my life....It was tough initially as neither believed me and accused me of siding with the other party. Well, we are still one big family living together,...<br><br>Misty_blue, will you or your hb be able to get an overseas job posting? that will be a good excuse to get away from your in-laws.<br><br>On the stress from the workplace. My advice is never bring your work woes home. The company only pays you for that many hours a day. Do not enslave yourself and get married to a job. If the stress is due to bad colleagues or boss, the more you shouldn't lose sleep over it. Just think of it this way, imagine how happy they would feel if they know that they have succeeded in causing you such great unhappiness. That should stop you from wanting to get stressed/depressed and destroy your family time.<br><br>There are always solutions, do not lose heart!</div>

Writing a email?<br><br>My wife had a bad temper as well, and ahem,,... so did I. But we soon got tired of quareling as it zapped us both and the precious weekend was wasted through fighting a silent war. Communication is the key. Now we have been married for 11 years and we both learn to agree to disagree.<br><br>My parents live with me from the day we got married as I'm the only son. God,.. that was bad, my wife and mother disagreeing. I stood my ground and listened to neither. Did what I feel was right every time there was a disagreement and made it clear that I do not appreciate any one of them bad mouthing the other or wanting to control my life....It was tough initially as neither believed me and accused me of siding with the other party. Well, we are still one big family living together,...<br><br>Misty_blue, will you or your hb be able to get an overseas job posting? that will be a good excuse to get away from your in-laws.<br><br>On the stress from the workplace. My advice is never bring your work woes home. The company only pays you for that many hours a day. Do not enslave yourself and get married to a job. If the stress is due to bad colleagues or boss, the more you shouldn't lose sleep over it. Just think of it this way, imagine how happy they would feel if they know that they have succeeded in causing you such great unhappiness. That should stop you from wanting to get stressed/depressed and destroy your family time.<br><br>There are always solutions, do not lose heart!</strong><br><br>that sounded like me. thus the best time of my life now is away on business trip. clear away from domestic chaos!!<br><br>my wife like to make comment like divorce sometimes when we argue. i hate it and feel betray as that words is so hurting. but i am numb to that as well. i just walk away and not talk. i never mention the word : divorce " in any circumstances of arguement. i guess the same when i say it, i will do it.<br><br>mistyblue, i pity your plight and i guess are you courageous to do what you already decided. afterall, you dont have kids, the choice is easier.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, for the record, my wife mentioned divorce again on Wednesday night.<br><br>I suspect now she is under some form of stress or depression. I tried to talk to her, but whenever I offer solutions to her problems, she would accuse me of trying to end the conversation early and get it over with. She has withdrawn herself almost completely, and we exchanged less than 50 words yesterday. Sleep and communication is getting to be a problem for both of us.<br><br>Anyway, thanks everybody, who tried to help. I is trying to gambatte and not giving up. But I have also formed some sort of resolution not to take these kind of 'divorce' nonsense anymore.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by TheGoodEarth:</div><div class="quote_body">Hmmm ... this thread has gone a long way. It must be very frustrating. I got frustrated by all these nimbo jambo wubo.<br>If a person keeps mouthing divorce, it is already in the person's sub-conscious. If not, it must be schizophrenia.<br>If you are not insane, lay down the cards on the table and find a solution. Your nimbo state is truly in limbo. Is breaking up hard to do or won't do?<br>All these mambo jambo talks are not going to be helpful. Decide whether you want to remain sane or go to IMH one day.<br>Remember this: love is blind, marriage is an eye-opener. Also, only living together will you get to know a person, even this may take years!<br>If you project that the marriage is not going to work, better to call it quits before too many attachments come along.<br><span style="color: red;">Our problems is: we dare not make a move because we don't want to be a laughing stock. Perhaps, there are too many vested interests and issues. Divorce is seen as a failure and a social stigma. So, people remain stuck just so the face can look pretty! But they are in a state of denial - denying reality and the chance to a happier life. Why settle down to the mundane, the mindless, the unhappiness, the frustrations?</span><br></div></blockquote>I have no issue being a divorcee and stuff. I do not care about being a laughing stock and stuff. In fact, what people say seldom bother me. The fact that you mention "not happy, then quit" is the kind of brain wash that Disney and television has done to us.<br><br>Remember, we all choose our own spouse. Nobody forced a gun on our head and told us to marry. Don't forget the marriage vows that couple take together,<strong>"share riches and in poverty....share happiness and in sadness". </strong>If love does not exist, I would have called it quits. Anyway, I posted here to seek help, not criticism. This is the 1st time I've shared so much with anybody. If I do not let it all out and bottle it up, I fear the consequences could be worse.</div>

But "every house got their own difficult to read de bible", so perhaps for some reason your friend is not retaliating. Anyway, if my wife were to scold me in front of anybody, I would scold her back with double the amount. Both our temper are equally bad.</div>
