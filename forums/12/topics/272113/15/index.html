It's actually my 1st time that I shared so much as well. I am OK with our argument and petty squabbles, but screaming divorce is starting to get on my nerves and is like a bomb inside me, unfortunately. But I'll keep trying until it works.

I think the remarks may be too judgmental. A wife isn't like an object, tool or pet. Having a marriage means the 2 of us, and a wife is the other person in the relationship to maintain. I mean next time, if I have a child and the child frustrates me, can I say this child cannot keep too?<br><br>I do get very frustrated when my wife mentions divorce whenever we argue. I have told her many times as well. If she were to persist, of course I will give the necessary counter-actions when I can't tahan. But I can't blame everything on her, this I know. Anyway, if you have truly loved someone before, you'll know that feeling where both of you will live until a ripe old age together, no matter what.<br><br>It has been a week, and I have gotten my wife back without any argument or quarrel. She bought me gifts and wrote me a love letter, saying it wasn't her intention to mention divorce over and over again. And that she understood how I put up with her and the most important thing, she still loves me! I would say that after a hard battle, my love did pull through!</div></blockquote>Dear TS aka Fustrated_Guy<br>I am SO HAPPY for u!! U made it with the help of ur love for ur wife as well as ur persistence!! YEahh~!!

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear TS,<br>I am feeling happy for you and I admire your great love for your wife, your persistence, your humility to admit your own mistakes and the amount of effort you put in to work on your marriage.<br><br>Like many have said, marriage is not always a bed of roses.  There is always going to have its ups and downs.  If you could persevere all the "downs" till the end in the marriage, it can only make the marriage stronger.<br><br>Very often, we get comfortable in a relationship that we completely forget how to show appreciation to our partner/spouse.  Especially nowadays we tend to work longer hours and have less quality time to spend with each other and communicate with each other.<br><br>I wish you well and I am positive that everything you have done for your wife will be paid off one day.<br><br>I will close this thread now (to prevent it from becoming a "warzone" ), just as TS closed off this old chapter of his life to begin a new chapter with his wife.<br><br>Please feel free to open a new thread when you want to give us more updates.
