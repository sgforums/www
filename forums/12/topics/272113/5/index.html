I have no outlet. When I look sad, my husband disallow me to feel sad in front of him or show any unhappiness in front of his family. But his bad tempers and attitude issues, he dish it out to me like I deserve it.  Seriously, I live with a dictator with who I cannot freely express myself and I have no rights to feel anything. I cannot even feel stress and I am told that I must be mentally unstable because everyone is so happy in the house.

Just be yourself, express yourself  -when you are sad, just be sad,  mad when he is not around. The more you care about other's opinion, and behave as what they want, the more unhappy you will become. As long as you did not harm him physically, is alright to be yourself.<br></div></blockquote>Yeah, when I was in my thoughts thinking of things. He comes around and tell me to stop thinking. I need to think about what I should do with my job as I need to make a firm decision. I just started thinking a little while and organizing my thoughts and my stuff in my head. He literally told me to stop. Then I felt my work life is not smooth and I needed to do something, he told me to go think about what I want to do - so its all BS from him.  Really he's a dictator and he is really a bad husband, totally unsupportive and flippant where everything is manipulated to his advantage. I cannot be myself around him and his family because his poor mommy is always around the house. His mommy reports me to him and he will give me a hard time after that. I cannot close my room door cause poor mommy need someone to download her troubles and b!tch about something.<br><br></div>

Blaming him will not solve anything.<br><br>Don't you have any other friends/colleagues/family besides your husband?</div></blockquote>Because talking about the rainy day constitute a negative conversation.<br>His mental state cannot accept any negative things from me because his mommy filled is with her negative things and negative stories about what I did not do around the house and that I never massage her or give her money and poor mommy is badly treated because the wife never kowtow and be a dumb maid. His mommy ever insinuated when I come home late from work, it was because I was having a affair outside. How can this kind of things be said? This is the kind of woman I deal with. Then in front of her son, she acts innocent and puts up a show telling him how she treat me good and how I had been nasty to her. He's a mommy boy. He believes her and often times, when I just pass massage from my MIL to him, he told me that I am creating issue for him. But I told him not to kill the messenger.<br><br>Blame him? He always blame me for everything every time he starts an argument, he blames me.  All these did not arise in 1 day. All these arise because like our TS, I had given way and spoilt him beyond saving. He's like TS's wife - temperamental and always want her way.<br><br>You know we go shopping, we always end up buying only his clothes. I ask to go say, G2000 for work clothes. He would say, OH, I am not office worker and I don't need any of those. It has never occured to him that I want to get some of my clothes. 100 times shopping, 100 times, buys his things. 99 time I pay for it. 100 times I give way.<br><br>My friend's advice - leave him.<br>My family - grin and bear it even if it cost your life.<br>Seriously, you think talking to friends or colleagues is advisble?<br>Are you stupid?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by mistyblue:</div><div class="quote_body">1. For amazing race - not everyone gets in. My Husband wanted to join the deal or no deal. But I told him please do not ask me to be on stage with him cause I propably freak out... Anyways, he did not take action. You can ask why she did not want to join? Perhaps it because she saw that couple broke up and all the ugly side of things come out in the race and she's fearful. Because she also knows her temper and propably cause ugly things she never wish for the world to see... even for a lot of money.  Perhaps you can suggest you join with your guy friends ??? Then she can enjoy watching you and your friends...<br><br>2.  MSN can block, MSN can also hide status.  Privacy? Let me tell you, my husband and I got intimate and my MIL burst in on us - no mood liao. When the nieces and nephews or everyone is around, my husband totally neglects me - and that makes up 90% of the time. I live with my in-laws - I cannot decorate my house, I cannot keep plants, I cannot this, I cannot that because my MIL do not like. The in-laws tell me that, they are senior and therefore own the house even when I pay for everything. Your wife need to take things into perspective. But why does she feel that they are invading the privacy? Are there actions or things that can be done to let her feel better or is she just insecure?  Perhaps you can state some time is private time with her and no one should invade. And if she cannot accept, she have a problem with her expectations.<br><br>3. You buy shares - no big deal. MY FIL gamble away his previous house. And he still gambles and buys horses. Why did she think you are gambling or she has seen how people became broke due to aggressive shares trading. I've seen it myself with my friends in futures but he too made a tidy bundle once in a while that he can afford rolex and private house. Perhaps, next time you can tell her that you only set aside XXX amount to play shares. You will not touch beyond that amount. If you need to spend more than XXX, then you need to speak to her and let her know the risks and agree on the YYY amount to spend. If it is not doing well, there must be a back out plan and accept the ZZZ amount of losses.<br><br>Things can be better managed and at least I feel your wife is in a better situation than me. However, with all things said, its a one sided story I've heard so far so I cannot comment further. R/S need a lot of work between 2 person. She is lucky to not have a MIL to insinuate a lot of things like yesterday she said I only massage my husband. I know she thinks I am slave and should massage her as well. She treats me like a maid all the past years I've known her and she bosses me around because I do not like to be sharp tongue and make things bad but she's pushed me too far.<br><br>All in all, I feel your wife is insecure and unsure of you. And you had spoilt her in the past and given way to her.  Next is that she need to join wife clubs and know people like me to know how fortunate her situation is. If she hears of my situation, she might have realised how much you might have tried. She need to learn how to treasure the r/s. Too many negative things will rip the r/s apart.<br><br></div></blockquote>1. I suggest joining amazing with my guy friend, not with her. And she also don't allow. Of course I noe itz not easy to get in, but the idea of submitting any application already turned down by her. I was an active traveller before I got married, now felt like I grounded. Never mind, since she said no, I respect her decision.<br><br>2. Both of us play computer games. She does not want my parents to have PC 'cause she scared my parents MSN her and we lose our privacy. Next time then they will learn and then play games with us. I hear liao, don't know wanna laugh or cry. No need to make decision, the moment she hear of me setting up PC, she ran away to her own house. Clear-cut NO WAY decision. Sigh.<br><br>3. Between the 2 of us, I am the financially-smarter one, I guess. She did not really object to me, but she commented isn't it like gambling? I don't know what to say. Only when I make money, then she begin to see my point. Oh, and she must have forgotten what comment she made 'cause she did not apologise.<br><br>Let's try to make a pattern here.<br><br>Husband: Do you tin I can join the amazing race?<br>Wife: No, because.....(the rest no heart hear liao)<br><br>2nd time<br><br>Husband: Can I set up a computer for my folks?<br>Wife: No, because....(I din hear liao, *argument*, then she ran away)<br><br>3rd time<br><br>Husband: Can I....(imagine "NO" from wife again)<br><br>Resolution beginning to form: "Wait, why am I asking her when I know I will get rejected? Just do it 1st, if she find out later, then too late to change anything." HAHA!<br><br>So being unsupportive doesn't really help, but on the other hand, hiding from wife also won't help much. So when I were to grumble or complain with VALID reasons, a fight ensue. Sigh.</div>

I suggest joining amazing with my guy friend, not with her. And she also don't allow. Of course I noe itz not easy to get in, but the idea of submitting any application already turned down by her. I was an active traveller before I got married, now felt like I grounded. Never mind, since she said no, I respect her decision.<br><br>2. Both of us play computer games. She does not want my parents to have PC 'cause she scared my parents MSN her and we lose our privacy. Next time then they will learn and then play games with us. I hear liao, don't know wanna laugh or cry. No need to make decision, the moment she hear of me setting up PC, she ran away to her own house. Clear-cut NO WAY decision. Sigh.<br><br>3. Between the 2 of us, I am the financially-smarter one, I guess. She did not really object to me, but she commented isn't it like gambling? I don't know what to say. Only when I make money, then she begin to see my point. Oh, and she must have forgotten what comment she made 'cause she did not apologise.<br><br>Let's try to make a pattern here.<br><br>Husband: Do you tin I can join the amazing race?<br>Wife: No, because.....(the rest no heart hear liao)<br><br>2nd time<br><br>Husband: Can I set up a computer for my folks?<br>Wife: No, because....(I din hear liao, *argument*, then she ran away)<br><br>3rd time<br><br>Husband: Can I....(imagine "NO" from wife again)<br><br>Resolution beginning to form: "Wait, why am I asking her when I know I will get rejected? Just do it 1st, if she find out later, then too late to change anything." HAHA!<br><br>So being unsupportive doesn't really help, but on the other hand, hiding from wife also won't help much. So when I were to grumble or complain with VALID reasons, a fight ensue. Sigh.</div></blockquote>Quite LPPL situation.  She seems possessive and clingy...<br><br>1. Amazing race : I will only ask how will you keep communicating with me if you were to go. And if you try and join and is away for a period, you will have to make it up to me when you get back.  Perhaps you can suggest this to her during a nice talk over perhaps a nice coffee etc.<br><br>2. She has a lot of fears.  Tell her that Singnet monitors everyone. Hahaha. She can opt to play PSP.  But I think too much gaming is not healthy.  Anyways, your folks propably use it for come email and other activity. Who wants to monitor her. Unless she thinks she's playing too much games and does not want anyone to know... I don't know. Does it matter? Its just a PC? Just as I think setting up some feng shui things in my house to try to improve harmony does not kill anyone. Its a flat NO from my husband because he know his mommy will kick up a fuss and I have to undo everything. I ask my MIL about feng shui and she claims I am superstitious and made more claims that I am trying to do damaging things.<br><br>3. If she did not apologize, just let her know that her statement hurt you. She might have forgotten but you did not. Its part of communication.<br><br>You have to act on some of the things otherwise, I doubt you will put up with this for long. I didn't lay my foundations with my husband and let him step all over me. Now I regret because I am not in a fair relationship.</div>
