Yes, I agree that it is hard to remove once the word is mentioned once, no matter how vaguely. Anyway, like you, I am prepared to go counselling if things get real bad, but not my wife.<br><br>I read your posts and first of all, a guy to be caught in between a mother and wife is very very stressful. Unexpectedly, I found myself caught in between these situations a few times myself and wished I were dead instead of facing it. I do not know how to term a Mommy's boy, but there may be reasons why after marriage, the attachment to one's mother is still there.<br><br>For my wife and myself, since we are both bad-tempered, both sides of parents do not stand a chance if we decide things. If I were to decide stuff, and my mum stop me, I will retaliate. Of course, if I realise I am in the wrong, I will apologise.<br><br>Moving out is the best option so far that I can think of. He may claim he will go back to see his family, but having a distance now will make a difference. Whether there is tension between mother and wife or not, staying together with either side of parents is still not considered "a family." I know you are stressed out, but think of it this way; mums may be there, but eventually they will get old and pass away 1st(not that I'm badmouthing them), eventually, you and your husband will still live together for the rest of your life. 1 man in between 2 ladies, both meant well, but neither will accept the "loss" of their treasured beloved.<br><br>I really hope you do not consider divorce. Exhaust all means to save it, e.g, see counsellor. Like one of the forumers suggest, if 1 party refuse, then the other one go see alone 1st. A 3rd party view usually sees things clearer.</div>

Probably another thing which you mentioned is correct too; too much television. We were brought up in rather western environment that "if we love each other, we marry, if not we divorce".<br><br>Marriage takes a lot of effort to maintain. Sometimes, pride and ego are the worst characteristics that can get in the way.

The years in marriage does not reflect if massive issue happens or not. A decade in marriage can result in failure just as easily.<br><br>Probably, what most did not consider is the pressure from society, money issues, customs and procedure, or even superstition. If both did not work together to resolve these issues, it would be a very challenging time ahead.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Frustrated_guy:</div><div class="quote_body">Hi Mistyblue,<br><br>The tot of divorce is not in my head at all, but my wife will deliberately mention it whenever we argue. Yes, I agree that it is hard to remove once the word is mentioned once, no matter how vaguely. Anyway, like you, I am prepared to go counselling if things get real bad, but not my wife.<br><br>I read your posts and first of all, a guy to be caught in between a mother and wife is very very stressful. Unexpectedly, I found myself caught in between these situations a few times myself and wished I were dead instead of facing it. I do not know how to term a Mommy's boy, but there may be reasons why after marriage, the attachment to one's mother is still there.<br><br>For my wife and myself, since we are both bad-tempered, both sides of parents do not stand a chance if we decide things. If I were to decide stuff, and my mum stop me, I will retaliate. Of course, if I realise I am in the wrong, I will apologise.<br><br>Moving out is the best option so far that I can think of. He may claim he will go back to see his family, but having a distance now will make a difference. Whether there is tension between mother and wife or not, staying together with either side of parents is still not considered "a family." I know you are stressed out, but think of it this way; mums may be there, but eventually they will get old and pass away 1st(not that I'm badmouthing them), eventually, you and your husband will still live together for the rest of your life. 1 man in between 2 ladies, both meant well, but neither will accept the "loss" of their treasured beloved.<br><br>I really hope you do not consider divorce. Exhaust all means to save it, e.g, see counsellor. Like one of the forumers suggest, if 1 party refuse, then the other one go see alone 1st. A 3rd party view usually sees things clearer.</div></blockquote>I thought about divorce and the way things are handled for many months. I told him seriously that he had deliberately made a decision to make his own life difficult and expect me to give in all the time. Then it is unfair. I am a push over most times and I try very hard not to make things difficult for him. However, his idea of starting a family is that his own parent's will be the head and command officers and he is the general, I am the slave with no voice.<br><br>My in-laws are only in their 50s and I can tell you my MIL drink bird's nest and take tonic to ensure she has a long and strong life. Trust me when I tell you she propably will live beyond me.<br><br>He had been the one to suggest divorce and I told him perhaps I move out will be better but then he regretted his word. But I can tell you that its too late. It planted a seed in me that I cannot forget this event that his mother created this divorce because of her need to be the center of his attention and made a drama for him to see. Then on another occasion, he asked me to move out because I folded a photo. I did it the day he scream divorce at me.<br><br>As long as he does not understand the idea of a new family, as long as he keep believing that his parents are king and I have to give way to make his day easy. There will not be a next day with me. I want out. I wanted out the day I got married because I saw the kind of things and word my MIL say to instigate and incite my husband. But to my husband, she is an angel and he had demonized me.<br><br></div>

For amazing race - not everyone gets in. My Husband wanted to join the deal or no deal. But I told him please do not ask me to be on stage with him cause I propably freak out... Anyways, he did not take action. You can ask why she did not want to join? Perhaps it because she saw that couple broke up and all the ugly side of things come out in the race and she's fearful. Because she also knows her temper and propably cause ugly things she never wish for the world to see... even for a lot of money.  Perhaps you can suggest you join with your guy friends ??? Then she can enjoy watching you and your friends...<br><br>2.  MSN can block, MSN can also hide status.  Privacy? Let me tell you, my husband and I got intimate and my MIL burst in on us - no mood liao. When the nieces and nephews or everyone is around, my husband totally neglects me - and that makes up 90% of the time. I live with my in-laws - I cannot decorate my house, I cannot keep plants, I cannot this, I cannot that because my MIL do not like. The in-laws tell me that, they are senior and therefore own the house even when I pay for everything. Your wife need to take things into perspective. But why does she feel that they are invading the privacy? Are there actions or things that can be done to let her feel better or is she just insecure?  Perhaps you can state some time is private time with her and no one should invade. And if she cannot accept, she have a problem with her expectations.<br><br>3. You buy shares - no big deal. MY FIL gamble away his previous house. And he still gambles and buys horses. Why did she think you are gambling or she has seen how people became broke due to aggressive shares trading. I've seen it myself with my friends in futures but he too made a tidy bundle once in a while that he can afford rolex and private house. Perhaps, next time you can tell her that you only set aside XXX amount to play shares. You will not touch beyond that amount. If you need to spend more than XXX, then you need to speak to her and let her know the risks and agree on the YYY amount to spend. If it is not doing well, there must be a back out plan and accept the ZZZ amount of losses.<br><br>Things can be better managed and at least I feel your wife is in a better situation than me. However, with all things said, its a one sided story I've heard so far so I cannot comment further. R/S need a lot of work between 2 person. She is lucky to not have a MIL to insinuate a lot of things like yesterday she said I only massage my husband. I know she thinks I am slave and should massage her as well. She treats me like a maid all the past years I've known her and she bosses me around because I do not like to be sharp tongue and make things bad but she's pushed me too far.<br><br>All in all, I feel your wife is insecure and unsure of you. And you had spoilt her in the past and given way to her.  Next is that she need to join wife clubs and know people like me to know how fortunate her situation is. If she hears of my situation, she might have realised how much you might have tried. She need to learn how to treasure the r/s. Too many negative things will rip the r/s apart.<br><br></div>
