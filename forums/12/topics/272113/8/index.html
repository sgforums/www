It must be very frustrating. I got frustrated by all these nimbo jambo wubo.<br>If a person keeps mouthing divorce, it is already in the person's sub-conscious. If not, it must be schizophrenia.<br>If you are not insane, lay down the cards on the table and find a solution. Your nimbo state is truly in limbo. Is breaking up hard to do or won't do?<br>All these mambo jambo talks are not going to be helpful. Decide whether you want to remain sane or go to IMH one day.<br>Remember this: love is blind, marriage is an eye-opener. Also, only living together will you get to know a person, even this may take years!<br>If you project that the marriage is not going to work, better to call it quits before too many attachments come along.<br>Our problems is: we dare not make a move because we don't want to be a laughing stock. Perhaps, there are too many vested interests and issues. Divorce is seen as a failure and a social stigma. So, people remain stuck just so the face can look pretty! But they are in a state of denial - denying reality and the chance to a happier life. Why settle down to the mundane, the mindless, the unhappiness, the frustrations?<br></div></blockquote>Yes! top class posting, i can use it in my sociology paper, Yeah!<br>I also feel that keep bringing out the term divorce is real childish and nonsensical, as husband and wife, both should be able to sit down and talk it over, if divorce, so be it, better for everyone, if love still exist within both of them, then they should be mature enough to find a solution.<br><br>Tho I am a gal, I really cannot tarhan a wife keep mentioning divorce here n there, so be it, record it down, show it as a prove that she is the one who  mentioned it, get in those hungry divorce attorney and settle it once and for all, then go look for other gals like me still single and waiting for LOVE.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>One bright, beautiful Sunday morning, everyone in tiny Anytown got up early and went to the local church. Before the service started, the townspeople were sitting in their pews and talking about their lives, their families, and so on.<br><br>Suddenly, Satan appeared at the front of the church.<br><br>Everyone started screaming and running for the front entrance, trampling each other in a frantic effort to get away from evil incarnate. Soon everyone had left the church except for an elderly gentleman who sat calmly in his pew, not moving, seemingly oblivious to the fact that God's ultimate enemy was in his presence.<br><br>Now, this confused Satan a bit, so he walked up to the man and said, "Hey! Don't you know who I am?"<br><br>The man replied, "Yep, sure do."<br><br>Satan asked, "Aren't you afraid of me?"<br><br>"Nope, sure ain't," said the man.<br><br>Satan was a little perturbed at this and queried, "Why aren't you afraid of me?"<br><br>The man calmly replied, "I've been married to your sister for 25 years."</div>

If you treat people nice, people will step all over you. Thats life. They will give you lots of excues to cover it up but in fact they know the truth.<br>For your friend, no point talking about divorce to him cos he is too weak to listern. If you day he comes to you and say he want to divorce then help him or else is a waste of time, listern to a weak and useless guy crap so much and still do not do anything about it.</div>
