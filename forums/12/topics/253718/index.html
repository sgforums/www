Last night he request to meet me for breakfast, as his house is somewhere near my work place.<br>We met and has our makan, and proceed to work place.<br><br>Afternoon we were chatting, and i told him the story of the man shopping for shoe.<br>And he given a statement of :<br><br><span style="color: red;">"He feel that its better to wait till the impulsive feeling is past before buying the shoe. If the interest is still there after that impulsive feeling is gone, normally i will feel safer buying the shoe"<br><br>And he commented : At times he is more used to be barefooted, end of it may not buy the shoe too.<br><br>He like the style of the shoe, but wondering about the durability of it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> </span><br><br><span style="color: brown;">But that is reservation of the shoe, if he like he will buy.  If not end of the day, he may not come for it.  so i am stuck, i wanna quit this whole thing.  Humh...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  </span></div></blockquote>seems like he's trying to test this relationship . If it wasn't feasible for him , he will ignore this r/s ..<br><br>IMO, he dont seem worthwhile to be waited . If i were you, i might just change target and forget abt this guy, becuz he is one who cant make up his mind . Who knows i might have to wait for a long time before he came up with a decision . And who knows? I might have been better off with another guy . <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>Ofcuz this is just my point of view . <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
