My responsibilities include organising training for my classmates for inter-class competitions and choosing the team members. Although I am the hockey captain, I have to report to the sports rep (my classmate). He keeps overruling my decisions and I also LL can't do anything because he's my superior. He changes team members as and when he likes.

Tell him to respect you. Tell him the reason behind your decision. Then if you all are still unable to see eye to eye then you quit.<br><br>Have a meeting and tell your members what u expect them to do. Tell them why its important to do as you say. Tell them that they choose you as their captain so there is a need to obey you. Most importantly stress that you are out to win if they are reluctant to do what you say chances of winning will be low, might as well redraw from the competition. Then use your last trump card: threaten to quit. THis is all on the assumption that you are best to lead them and them have some respect for you as they chose you.</div>

Try to work on your management... Do they want to play for the team...?<br><br>From what I see, going out with friends and forgetting PE shirts are pretty lousy excuses...<br><br>Take the initiative to REMIND them (especially those who always forget) a day before training day...<br><br>Try to plan the schedules way before time, and if possible... On a more routine basis... Ask them to decide for themselves which is more important... Training for the team or going out with friends..? Make a CLEAR SIMPLE statement... How well they value the team (trainings) would be how well the team would value them later...<br><br>Try to separate out (blacklist?) the insincere ones from the sincere ones...<br><br>Take attendance... Use them as backup for your decision of playing team members selection later... If your sports rep try to override you, try to bring to higher authority if you think your decision is valid... If the playing team members combination is way beyond your 'idea'... Make clear to the class or whoever is blaming you before the games that this is NOT your decision but more of an INSIST TAKE of your SPORTS REP...<br><br>Last but not least... Try to better your relationship with your sports rep...?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think it's more important you get along well with your classmates and maintain a happy working relationship with them.  Because 1 year later / when you graduate, all this sports affairs will fade into insignificance.  What remains are the friends from school.  So really just try your best with whatever you can and don't be too angry about things you can't change, don't quarrel with your classmates over their lack of enthusiasm too - not everyone is into hockey or sports <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">.  If your sports rep wants to take charge, let him lah.</div>
