            <div class='col-md body'>mal_colm1979, I can understand your problem. I also have this problem.It's not easy to let go.But it may consume your life like how it did in my case.<br>U got to seek help  from counselling. in the end it's all in your own mind.<br>Whenever u think of the person, try to keep yourself busy, go out of the house or meet up with a close friend u can confide in.Or u can listen to fast music like pop songs ect.<br><br>If all the above methods fail,  think that the person is just beside u and hope that one day u would bump into her. Think that it had been a valuable experience in life and that there are many souls around you with the same problem. Try to mingle with those with similar problems and form a suppport group. It might help</div>
