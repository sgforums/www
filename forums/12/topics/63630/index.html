            <div class='col-md body'>agree with the earlier post.. besides, it's only 2 weeks that you guys get to know each other.. no doubt I don't deny the fact that there's such things as love at first sight etc etc, but for a commitment to go on, there's still lots of things to iron out. The culture differences, the communication, the interests and the mentality are just some of the things that would need to be resolved.<br><br>Personally, I'm undergoing something similar, though I met her in person, but because of cultural differences, mentality thinking, and communication barriers, there will need to have a lot of work to do before can really settle down/</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This look like those in irc where people can flirt ard cause it's impossible to meet the other party. I played online game too but i think they care for u just as a friend and might sometime call u dear or something. Try to keep mind open abt it lor and dont get too serious or u might just get hurt in the end.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I mean my gf now is a girl who's of a different culture, but we met each other in the uni over here in the U.S.. We're facing a problem in a year's time too, when we graduate.. She may be going back, while I want to stay longer to pursue a higher education.<br><br>It's really the how much trust and faith both of you have in the r/s, and want to be with each other. For my case, for months at a time we don't see each other due to the semester breaks. For you, it's going to be a lot of work, especially a lot of obstacles like handling sch work and NS, whereby you don't have the time to go online to meet her all the time.<br><br>On the other hand neither of you are knows about what each other is really doing.. But one thing that's working for you is that both of you are new to each other, so there's a lot of interesting stuff to find out about each other that you guys can work your ways out.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by bladez87:</div><div class="quote_body">we have not met...n we known each other for 1mth + its impossible for us to meet now... 1 is 16 other is 17. might b possible next yr or when i 18 if we still last tat long...<br>bear care to tell me your story?</div></blockquote></div>

Relationships need presence which modern technology simply cannot provide; unless you fly there every 7 hours ha!<br><br>Furthermore, both of you are of different cultures, she is dutch and you are local Singaporeans. The races and the blood simply does not mix mate, not without repurcussions/consequences/loud noise. So I wouldn't hope too much<br><br>Lastly, you claimed you fell in love, do you even know what love is? From what you describe, meeting someone from an online computer game? 2 weeks only? That is not love, that is infetuation. I believe in fellowship and friendship in online stuff, I do not believe in love, perhaps some romantic fantasy, but definitely NOT SERIOUS LOVE. You don't even know her, what she looks like, what she is like, or even if she is a she. Neither does she know you.<br><br>Just forget about it. Don't be too serious.</div>
