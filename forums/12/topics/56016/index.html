Well, after the second mail - probably there are reasons why he didn't wish to reply you. One good solution is to wait and don't bother too much.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Broke about one year ago? Of course, its isn't easy to move on without pinning onto some past eh? Sure you could try again - but it has to start from friendship scratch again. Many things could happen in a year and the <strong>'new' him may not be the 'old' him that you once loved</strong>. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>
