            <div class='col-md body'>I can see your problem... the sad thing about singaporeans is, they can be a bloody unkind bunch when it comes to this, even when the person is innocent.<br><br>I mean the neighbours will probably shun the poor person, despite of the fact if he is guilty of not, "just to be safe". Singaporean style.<br><br>Two years ago... the memory of the incident is certainly hazy, even if it was a tramatic experience. And if you look generally like the perp, or remind her of him, then you win liao. This has happened countless times before and will contuine to happen. Sadly, I can say little to you but to grit your teeth and go through this time with a guts and glory approach.</div>
