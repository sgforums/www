            <div class='col-md body'>Heys...<br><br>U have the same scenario as me, man...I had a crush on my sec sch classmate back in 1998..she was very special, friendly and the kind whom u like to be with..we always talk over the phone..then in 2002, when in poly, I confessed to her n she said it was alrite, can be frens..but as years passed, our contact became minimal. She`s now attached. She`s in my frenster list. She moved house and nvr told me her new no..I wana give her bday present last Nov, she just kept quiet..I suggest a meetup with old mates, also she kept quiet. But u know what the weird thing is? When I msg her thru frenster asking how she is and all,she would reply..talking abt other casual stuff, she would reply also..but come to meetup n give bday gift, she keep quiet. Strange huh?<br><br>Up till now, I still think of her..I really cannot get my mind off her. I swear if I ever bump into her on the streets, I`ll be brought down to my knees. But I duno if she is still friends with me..there was one time, I think I got a bit crazy, telling her that if she finds me irritating, she should just delete me off her frenster list. And nope, she did not delete me. I dun even dare to click on her profile n I`ll have to turn off the pics option to send a msg to her..its been 9 years but the feeling is still there..and who could have guessed tat my 1st crush would be a non-Malay?<br><br>So bro, to get over it, like me, I`ll have to keep myself busy...I`m a musician and I play my guitar a lot plus go jamming with mates...but honestly, the sudden thought of her would always have me drifting in some other place.<br><br>I wish for the both of us to meet our suitable soulmates in the future..:p<br><br>All the best.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My story started out fairly similarly .. n ended up in regrets .<br><br>I met this gal in jc after 3mths , initially it was my fren whom got to know her. Hwever after 3mths , he was posted out to other jc , thus losing contact. For me , i didnt got to the jc in the 1st 3mths n onli got to know her later.<br><br>I started out as a "spy" to help my fren jio her . Strangely enough , me n the gal hit it off so well tat i cant nv had the same feeling with any other gals ever<br>again.<br><br>We would talk everything under the sun over the phone everyday , even during exam periods. My feelings for her grew deeper n deeper , but i had no intention to betray my fren , whom was secretly liking her even in other jc.<br><br>But this gal is too popular , she had many suitors n even a stalker. There r fond memories of hw she called me n me rushing down to orchard rd to save her from a date she had nv agreed, OR hw i fend her off the stalker in the mrt all replay in my mind occassionally .<br><br>But all she took is 1wk to got attached with this guy . Deep inside i was shattered n sad. If it was my fren i would hav jus brushed it off .. but it was another guy , a total stranger who invaded .<br><br>Then once in a routine chat in irc , she suddenly confessed to me , saying she had liked me b4 , n on the other hand i confessed too . IN conclusion we called it brotherly -sisterly love .<br><br>Very much up to nw , years hav passed , she had jus gotten into her 2nd rslp in uni , whilist i hav to serve ns . The fond memories lingers , leaving sweetness n bitterness . I managed to keep in contact with her , but i dont know hw much can this rslp last .<br><br>Our paths in life may nt cross anymore <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>

Do you still think about what might have been if only you had gotten it right then? Do you still get angry with yourself at blowing a chance?<br><br>It's been years for me already, this friend of mine from school last time. She was a nice girl, popular, friendly, pretty. Most of all, she seemed comfortable around me. We had some common friends, so it was quite easy to meet her and we attended a lot of lectures together.<br><br>My friends and her friends were actually trying to match make us, and even people who didn't know us well expected us to be a couple.

I could spend my entire days just looking at her lovely face.<br><br>But alas, I lost myself and started acting uncharecteristically. She got scared I guess and before I knew it, she was with someone else. There were even friends who after knewing she was attached, asked out loud,"What about him?" Which was referring to me.<br><br>She's changed boyfriends since then, and I can see she's really found joy with her current boyfriend. I'm really happy for her and I'm glad the guy can look after her welll, and I would think better than me.<br><br>But till today, I still wonder to myself on late nights about what could have been. I still think about the things I should have done and the things I shouldn't or rather should have said.<br><br>We stayed friends even after I confessed to her and I really thank her for that.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all, thanks for listening to my whiny little story, and I appreciate all the advise and all those who have told me I should move on, give myself a chance with somebody else. I'm really thankful for the advice and I agree it's what should be done.<br><br>But after what I say next, some of you might either consider me even more beyond hope. Or, you might even despise me and look down on me.<br><br>After she had rejected me, I did try to move on and like some have said, give myself a chance to be with someone else. I've been into two relationships since then and up till now, I still kind of feel more for her.<br><br>I never used either of the two as replacements and I treated and respected them on their own. But during the course of these two relationships, I still feel different around this girl who rejected me and I found myself still doing things for her that I wouldn't for my other female friends (but she was a close friend afterall).<br><br>I know some might call me a b@stard or whatever, but I want to say that not once was I ever unfair to my ex-gfs. The relationships did not fail because of any past feelings I had for Miss J. I gave my all into both relationships. Maybe it's because they failed that I know think that I may have gotten it right with her all the way. I'll never know if that is true.<br><br>But she's happy now and I doubt even if I were to barge back into her life would I stand a chance. Friends we will be for sure.<br><br>And now when I'm alone, instead of thinking about my two past relationships, I think about her. I know I should have gotten over her by now and I know I should move on with my life. I make the effort to do so.<br><br>But on nights like this when my mind floats, I can't help but think about her and wish that things had turned out differently.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I've come to accept that maybe these feelings for her will never go away. And maybe like an ex-gf, in my heart she can never just be another girl. In fact, she is more so than my ex-gfs.<br><br>I will still love the next person that comes along, I will still give her my all. I will still respect her, honour her and cherish her. Whoever that new girl may be.<br><br>But like I said, Miss J will never just be another girl in my past.<br><br>This will forever be my own personal secret, and will still weigh on my heart.
