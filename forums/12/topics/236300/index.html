Do you still think about what might have been if only you had gotten it right then?

We had some common friends, so it was quite easy to meet her and we attended a lot of lectures together.<br><br>My friends and her friends were actually trying to match make us, and even people who didn't know us well expected us to be a couple.

I still think about the things I should have done and the things I shouldn't or rather should have said.<br><br>We stayed friends even after I confessed to her and I really thank her for that. Close friends even and I was really glad because I thought I'd lost a dear friend. But we've drifted apart since then and she has her own life now and I have mine.

            <div class='col-md body'>There was this one gal in secondary school. I have liked her since the very begining. Having total no confidence in myself, I never approached her. Not just that, my shyness is to a new level. I avoided her and her group of friends. I am very active type of guy. Doing pretty well both in academic, sports and scouts. So not talking to their group really seems as if I dislike them. But the truth is, I really like one of them just that I too shy to start a conversation or anything.<br><br>Years passed. Leave school went to Uni and grad. During my Uni time, I wrote letters to her, but never once have the courage to post it. I have no news of her as well. But constantly think of her. It still continues till today.<br><br>What I try to say is this. As I had briefing introduce just now, I never get to know her cause I am too shy that time. Thus, I never know if this gal is suitable for me. Just that the feeling for her is very strong. And the fact that I never know her, the mystery of this gal just enhance the feeling. And that feeling convert to "regret" for what I never did when I had the chance.<br><br>Telling her now means nothing. Cause I never know the her back then and I am not sure the her now will be the one for me. The lesson I learnt from the whole deal.... not to have any more "regret" in life. There are things that must be done while you are at that stage. Grasp the moment, life the moment, cherish the moment....<br><br>Easier said than done, still trying my hardest...</div>

Through my personal position, I met a woman very frequently. We talked and chatted very, very much - job, carreer, study etc. She was extremely interested in me (up to today, I still don't know why she was so attracted to me).<br><br>The more she shown interest in me, the more I got scared. I was scared because I was working full-time and studying part-time then. I don't want a committed relationship at that point. I wanted to go slow but she wanted to go fast. The worst things was, this woman was hotly after me for almost two years before she gave up it all up (I'm not bluffing). She disappeared without a trace.<br><br>Many years later, our path met again. It was so uncomfortable to see her again. All the mixed feelings creeped up to me. Feelings which I thought I never have or feelings which I can kept under controlled.<br><br>I talked to her, wanting to find out all the 'whys'. I finally got all my answers and they upset me too.<br><br>I found that she took my attitude very badly. Even as we talked, after so many years, she said "I know you never like me", which was not true. I just can't handled too many things at one time. In her frustration and anger, she resigned from her job, disppeared, than got herself married as fast as she can to the next available man (match marriage, I believe).<br><br>She was not two-timing me because I knew she was spending all her hopes and attentions on me. All these up to the date, the date where I cool everything (the date I can still remember) - the date I cool things was the date she disappeared.<br><br>She was such innocent, sweet and gentle woman. I am now feeling guilty and bad because if she married a bad man, I had an indirect role in infuencing her choice.<br><br>I wish I did not played a role in her choice of husband. I wish she did not spent those times on me if fate has not meant us together. I wish she has spent enough time finding out who her husband really was before she married him. I wish I did not play a role which resulted in her quick marriage.<br><br>Now I really know the meaning "men are from mars and women are from venus".<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Aiii... -shake head-<br><br>I dated someone who could not forget his past rship. He was attached for many years but girl left him due to his inability to commit. After that, he had other relationships and it was almost 6-7 years after the first relationship i met him.<br><br>Was with him for almost 3 years. Spent the first 1-2 years trying to 'convince' him that the PAST is the PAST. MOVE ON. By the 3rd year, I was discouraged, and simply tired of it. I dont need someone to make me feel like I am someone he is simply 'settling' on.<br><br>So, I moved on. And walao eh, I realised its got nothing to do with me or the ex-gf. Its just HIM. he only lives in the past and only when the girl leaves him, then he will begin to treasure. I can only shake my head in disbelief.<br><br>That's why I say MOVE ON. why live in the past? Unless you intend to make action towards rectifying it, or else forget it. Over means over liao loh.<br><br>As for feeling that your choices 'affected' someone else's decision, in the end we are all adults lah. Unless you 'cheated' by lying, betraying, intentionally hiding - or else its fair play. If you were honest throughout - and the person is a sane, intellectually and socially developed adult, then they too are responsible for their own choices.<br><br></div>
