            <div class='col-md body'>It's the same reason on why you guys penalise some local girls when they want a better life than what they have in SG <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">. They get labelled as being SPGs, materialistic etc etc when it's exactly the same thing that is happening with the girls up north. I mean seriously, it's the same dress worn by a different person.<br><br>Shows you how skewed perspection can be. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Sure, I have met really nice girls from up north who geniunely marry out of love and not because of $ but you get more bad eggs than good eggs out of the basket. Oh, btw the nice girls don't have a sob story along; that is the difference I see so far.<br><br>Oh gimme a break. A moment of folly arises because you allow it. It could be some kind of surpressed fantasy to being a knight in shining armor; to save a maiden who is oh so dependent on you instead of someone who can stand on her own feet. If you really wanted to be honest from the start, you would have been straightforward and let the Thai girl know that you have a gf.<br><br>Why did you keep it from her? Is it because you think she won't have a fling with you if you were attached or you didn't want to be shattered with the nice image that she would still get close to you even though you're attached? Much better to have some "innocent" girl whom you can save from her inner demons or past isn't it? Plus, for that moment itself, it might make your conscience feel better that you're not attached isn't it?<br><br>Using your infidelity as an excuse because of some kind of conflict or unresolved conflict you had with your gf is really really lame. If that is the case, why even bother to make wedding plans?<br></div>
