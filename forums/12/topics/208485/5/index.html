            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by dirge:</div><div class="quote_body">Recently, I choose a thai ger over my ger of close to 8yrs, and I confess my actions to me ger..hurt her bad and at the same time, I felt real bad and pain in myself that I really duno who to turn to. Perhaps alot of you will say I deserve it, but I need to do something before things turn even bad.<br><br>Before I go to thailand for work, me and my gf have already decided to get engaged, got ourselves wedding band, and already inline for BTO flat..I felt so great that hey, things decided to settle down for me after close to 8 yrs together,so much effort time and money has went in.<br><br>Things started going topsy turvy while I'm in thailand..I get to know this ger, working in a night bazaar selling food..quite cheerful and friendly looking and initially, I told meself, not to get involve but eventually, get to know her. From the start, nothing really goes on, just like normal friends..cox she's bit of outgoing type and fun-loving, so I let me guard down. I also did not tell her I have gf back home.<br>After a few meetings, she told me alot of things about herself, and that, deep down-inside her, she needs lotsa love as she comes from a broken family and has been quite messy in life while she was young.She has stopped studying at 15 and party and lead a wilful life till few backs, her mom came to look back for her for the first time in her life. She stays in a rented apt and I been to her apt before and I felt that she's very independent in life..due to fact that environment has turn it this way. I must agree that she's good looking and great figure and her softness...in no way a sg ger can match...till now I still think so.<br>One day she asked me,what do I really want it be...just normal friends or be her bf. I don't know what I'm thinking and I told her be her bf. Gosh....I tot it might just be fling and that she's prob not treating it serious since I'll only there for a short period of time. She also says she's afraid that it'll be a wrong choice for her since I'm not a thai and I don't live there. One day, she told me that whatever will be, will be, nevermind bout the future how it will turn out, she just felt happy with me that I care for her. All this while, I did not let me gf(sgp) know. I know its bad but I just couldn't fight myself way out.<br>As time goes, she becomes more attach to me and one night, she slept with me and that she says, she really loves me and she's willing to do it with me. She took pills to prevent pregnancy and over 2 weekends, we stayed together at the hotel and she allows me to take pics and says that I can keep it because she wants me to look at it when I'm back home to help me remember her. What surprises me is that she quite spontaneous in bed and got me quite worried, like shes know her stuffs. Before she likes guys...shes a les before,had a couple of gf. Now that she turn over new life, due to fact that she lost hope on thai guys (2 failed ones).<br>All this while, I did not tell her that I'm not single and she has fear that my heart is like a condo(multi heart)<br>I left thailand for home, she called me on my mobile and its not cheap to do so to call from overseas, esp she does not earn that much, and shes willing to go thru this...it gives me a sense that, she's willing to put her heart to it.She even called when I'm in aus...even more ex...and she says that her misses for me overrules everything.<br>I felt that, she can adapt her environment well and even in harsh condition, she's stilll optimistic in life and I now have tot of bringing her over. She's ok with me and tells me, as long as I'm with her...it supercedes anything. All this while, I communicated in very little english with her, and she talks thai with me, though i'm not very good at the language, all the way I can manage to gather what she means. Now. she oftens takes picture of herself and emails me and i try phone her as much often n I'll be visiting her soon.<br>OF course..alot of worries cross me mind..like, if there's a future, how will it be with her.like, getting a status for her in sg, how she gona survive,interact,etc etc.<br>Right now..problems i need to solve is my BTO flat,my wedding bad,duno how it'll turn out. I really broke my gf(sgP) heart when I told her and I know its unfair to her. Y can't i broke up with the thai one instead and a few mths wins over a few yrs relationship? Is it fair for both the gers. However, till recently, I know that I will prefer a thai ger more than a sgp ger...its just that I do not have the courage to tell everyone...being the sterotype thinking in most of people that, hey, the thai gers just wanna get out of there and that, they will try at everything.<br>I made a mess in my life now..and I will not say that its my gf(sgp) fault though she over the years, has mad some impact in my thinking of spending time with a sgp ger.<br>I'm a jerk thats all. </div></blockquote><strong>Hi dirge,<br><br>There is really nothing that we can say to help youÂ…<br><br>This is your life and you should make your own decision since you are an adultÂ… if you feel that by telling everybody on what you have done and getting a few scolding can ease your sins then I can tell you that it is not possibleÂ…<br><br>Put yourself in your girlfriendÂ’s shoesÂ… 8 years of youthÂ… it is simply not fair to herÂ… RememberÂ… a womanÂ’s youth is preciousÂ…<br><br>If you donÂ’t cherish her then better let her go, as she would be able to find someone betterÂ… it seems like you are spoilt for choice right but be it the Thai gal or your girlfriendÂ… do what your heart wantÂ…<br><br>Perhaps you would dump this Thai and marry your girlfriend after so much advises from us but I think you will still do the same thing again when you are overseas againÂ… Your heart is still not settled and you are simply not ready for commitment yetÂ… Because if you are then it should not be shaken easily by other womanÂ…<br><br>I got nothing much to say alsoÂ… just cherish what you have in life and donÂ’t regret it after you have lost itÂ… </strong></div>
