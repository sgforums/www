So, I hope that's a consolation thought.<br><br>Guys usually get very attracted to pretty girls, and like someone else said, you're just mourning a loss of a very attractive close friend. After all, defeat is always bitter. It sucks to walk off the field with a 3-0 result against you after all that effort. But hey, there's always another game, or girl, to look forward to.<br><br>Outrageously pretty girls like her feel entitled to use guys for emotional support, and after they have recovered, if they feel that the guy is not a good relationship investment, given the view that they are entitled to the best guys (character, money, brains, body ...) with their looks, they will dish out the "get lost" look.<br><br>Think of it as a good deed you have done to her, and the coolest response from you is to feel nothing against her in weeks and months to come.<br><br>May you find the right girl who desires your love.<br><br></div>
