            <div class='col-md body'>Anyway TS, i think u dun really love her, perhaps u are just infatuated as she is the belle in the uni. The reason for my assertion is u dun feel sad or rather u didn't feel the way it should be as per stated earlier in your reply.<br><br>Anyway, i think u are kinda possessive in the sense that u concern of who she went out with. I understand how u feel but well she still have to right to choose ya. Therefore, as far as she is concerned, avoid being too nosey about her stuff. Since u say u still like her, well my advice is only be there for her when she needs u. U might be treated as spare tyre though.

Therefore, it is reasonable for her to ask u thing while not answering urs in HER context. Therefore, it is important for u to acknowledge this so that u will feel less pain.<br><br>In the case of possessiveness, u said u are not possessive. I trust ur word. However, what really matters is u dun APPEAR possessive.<br><br>Imagine u are the girl, how will u feel when someone close to u ask u:"Are u going out with another guy?" This very question is wrong in the first place as the girl will think i go out with who is ur business? I am not even ur gf, u wanna know so much about me for what? Hence, u appear possessive to her.<br><br>TS, do remember to go slow. Be her normal friend first and c how it goes. What if one day u discover a habit of her that is so undesirable to u? BGR need not be too official, a simple walk along a road, a simple conversation can spark the beginning of a romance... If u still love her, do befriend her as normal, even if one day u all proceed to become very gd buddies, dun feel sad ya as u make a gd friend instead of a love foe.</div>
