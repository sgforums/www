I'll suggest the 2nd one. Dip. in hotel management... Looks like tourism and hotel business won't be flying too high in the near future.. By the time you've completed your dip. and working? Must things are already quite firm and established in the market... Unless you have rather good 'connections', I won't urge you on this one...<br><br>In my opinion, Dip. in fashion design is too specialised... Unless it's REALLY your INTEREST and you've got the TALENTS for it.. (plus you'll still need LUCK to be recognised..) Then you can try for it?<br><br>Dip. in fashion merchandising and marketing seems more practical as it's more business related and it's also easier for you to move on to a job of wider related scope in the future (this is rather important based on the current situation in employment...)...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually do what you like... no point working on something you are not quite interested in just to please youer parents.. fashion designers can also earn money just perhaps not that much in Singapore and maybe not regconised but its never to pursue your dreams... Afterall.. Versace became rich as a designer.. so actually see how you view it. If you ever make being one some day, your parents will definitely support you, i think.. Filial is impt but like some people say don be "yu xiao" foolish filial. Of course, given the kind of environment these days, money is definitely more impt.. If you plan to have a family than perhaps dreams is another thing but if you decided to be single, why not? be a freelance designer?</div>
