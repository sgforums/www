            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Kenashi,<br><br>Poor thing...  What a girl considers important is subjective.  Some feel age is important (hence ageism), some feel wealth is important (hence materialism), some feel ambition is important (ambitionism?), some feel character is important.  Usually, girls, and guys alike, will have an acceptable set of qualities which they hope their other halves will have.  This isn't necessarily bad, it just means the girl you like &amp; yourself have different preferences.<br><br>Age, understandably, is a factor.  Since I don't know what age your crushie is, I'll just have to give both sides of the coin:<br>1. If the age difference between both of you is large, then:<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> If you're much older, than she may wonder about the quality of life both of you will have in future.  You may Not be able to take part in the things she wants to do.  Different energy levels.  It depends on whether she's willing to be accommodating, something which may change as a person ages.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> There's also the part about maturity levels, which everybody has discussed ad nauseum, &amp; it's such a cliche that it'd be an embarrassment to repeat here.<br>2. If the age difference between both of you is small, then:<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> It could be just her pretext for her rejection, &amp; is Not really a factor in her decision.  She may have No feelings of that kind for you, but is hard-pressed to find a reason why.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Maturity levels again, plus differences in income (if she's older than you, or earns more than you).<br><br>Whilst I admire your perseverance, I would like to advise you that there is also a fine line between persevering &amp; plain butting your head against the wall.  You're intelligent enough to differentiate between the 2.  Thus, I wish you good luck in what you later decide to do, &amp; hope it's a wise decision made after much thought.<br><br>FeowFeow<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Kenashi:</div><div class="quote_body">It happened again.<br>I got rejected flat, she only want to be friend.<br>My eyes got wet when I received that SMS, my colleagues thought what had happened but I am a guy, no matter how much pain I am feeling, I will always bottled it up.<br>Why does gals care so much about a figure.<br>Is it that important or is it just an excuse?<br>I am such a failure, no one I love ever love me.<br>Am I asking too much?<br>I really should just find a hole somewhere and live like a hermit.<br>Love is such a burden that I don't ever want to go near again.<br><br></div></blockquote></div>

What a girl considers important is subjective.  Some feel age is important (hence ageism), some feel wealth is important (hence materialism), some feel ambition is important (ambitionism?), some feel character is important.  Usually, girls, and guys alike, will have an acceptable set of qualities which they hope their other halves will have.  This isn't necessarily bad, it just means the girl you like &amp; yourself have different preferences.<br><br>Age, understandably, is a factor.  Since I don't know what age your crushie is, I'll just have to give both sides of the coin:<br>1. If the age difference between both of you is large, then:<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> If you're much older, than she may wonder about the quality of life both of you will have in future.  You may Not be able to take part in the things she wants to do.  Different energy levels.  It depends on whether she's willing to be accommodating, something which may change as a person ages.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> There's also the part about maturity levels, which everybody has discussed ad nauseum, &amp; it's such a cliche that it'd be an embarrassment to repeat here.<br>2. If the age difference between both of you is small, then:<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> It could be just her pretext for her rejection, &amp; is Not really a factor in her decision.  She may have No feelings of that kind for you, but is hard-pressed to find a reason why.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Maturity levels again, plus differences in income (if she's older than you, or earns more than you).<br><br>Whilst I admire your perseverance, I would like to advise you that there is also a fine line between persevering &amp; plain butting your head against the wall.  You're intelligent enough to differentiate between the 2.  Thus, I wish you good luck in what you later decide to do, &amp; hope it's a wise decision made after much thought.<br><br>FeowFeow<br><br></div></blockquote>My principle is working against my feeling.<br>I wish to pursue her relentlessly but my principles forbid me to do so.<br>I have already decided to remain as friend. Better to be her friend forever n see her happy than to lose her forever.<br>If given the choice, I will rather butt my head against the wall until either my head crack or a hole open on the wall.<br>But logic shall always persevere for me, I am not such an emotional person.</div>
