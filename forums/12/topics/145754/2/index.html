It's a matter of choice.  You can allow yourself to wallow in misery, &amp; believe that you'll never fall in love again.  I've told myself these things before in moments of self-pity.  But perhaps I'm a very VERY stubborn woman, &amp; REFUSE to let my life be ruined by someone else.

Once I heard a manager said that "those are what u are paid for" to an ex-colleague of mine. After that incident, my ex-colleague left the organisation. within a mth. The rest just shrugged it off, I know that there is no future in my organisation. So after that, I just hit my quota of workload n do what I want for the rest of the time. Nobody bother me as long as I did my share of work.<br></div>
