Ask her out more often, call her up to chit chat more often, go out strolling together more often, and soon things may just take shape in natural course.<br><br>One'd like to think she may have dropped a hint or two, but like what the  posts above have said, the decision to act ultimately lies with you. You are a guy, and though times have changed, guys are still expected to make that first move when it comes to courtship.</div>
