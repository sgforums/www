              <p><br>Precisely. Or else why I keep my 600 friends? I am writing this because I happen to come across one Poster in Aunt Agony - I guess you can figure who, who said that he felt sad when he saw his friends doing so well in FB and it surprises us that a lot of people feel the same way.</p>
              <p>I am not ranting. I am merely saying is that there is more life to FB. I am telling people here not to be fooled by the false advertising that thsoe contributing much to FB are doing so well. There is more to life than FB. I am only raising that awareness.</p>
              <p>I am not trying to change people behaviour. I am telling those who feel envy of other people in FB not to feel this way but value what they've got even though they think they got very little but it is not the case.</p>
