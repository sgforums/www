This doesnt jus applies to love matters. Everything in life is the same. You tell a jobless man to upgrade his skills or send relentless applications and to cheer up.

It is of course easy to advice people. Damn easy. What's so difficult? But to understand other people's problems and to feel the same feeling as them is the difficult one because we are never in their position no matter what.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by zeny:</div><div class="quote_body">Since when are you are qualify to be a love adviser?</div></blockquote>Qualifications are needed to be a love adviser? A level cert? Degree in Love? What are you talking about? Anyone can become a so called 'love adviser', whether you are a good one or not. When you give advice on love to someone, you are so called a love adviser right? Sheesh..<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by zeny:</div><div class="quote_body">You have ended a 4 year r/s.<br>So what ? You think is a big deal is it?<br><br>Others have 10 years relationship which ended just like that.<br>Others can wake up and pick themselves up asap why can't you?</div></blockquote>Relax man.. 4 years is pretty long too, of course if you compare it to 10 years, relatively its not that long but to go through 4 years with someone is really something too.. And I would like to think he has already woken up and is picking his life pieces slowly so.... <strong>WTF</strong> are you talking about?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by zeny:</div><div class="quote_body">Cos you are not mature enough thats why always looking back thats why you always kena the same problem.<br><br>You can vent about everything under the sun but please do not said about others who you have not meet.</div></blockquote>Dude, you totally lost yourself here..

            <div class='col-md body'>ya right to all...<br>Most people have diff perspectives about things..me too...<br><br>zeny is right in his way too.. The good advice to people who fell out of love is not to think and live in the past. The more one think, the more he/she gets miserable...<br><br>Well, for me, i dont deny that at times, i do think of the past. Its not really my choice either... You know, like you pass by some places or saw somethings, naturally it will comes back to you... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>As for my ex gf, she seems to find some1 more suitable for her already.. Happy i am not, but neither sad..Probably it contains some jealousy..haha..<br>Cant i sense abit of jealousy? hehe...not that i am bitter about it, but in the end, i hope both of us will find our true halfs...<br><br>cheers! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>
