              <p>Quit your whinning.</p>
              <p>My younger brother does not have degree, he has a O level certificate and he owns a 4 room HDB flat, is happily married and has 2 kids.  He works as a sales rep for some electronics company and does pretty well.</p>
              <p>So you think living in your government built HDB flat is difficult and prefers to live on a farm?  Have you BEEN to farm before?  I mean a real one and not one of those toys they have in Singapore.  Do you know how difficult it is to make a living as a farmer?</p>
              <p>Farms are remote by nature, you will have to drive (you DO know how to drive right?) for a very long distance to get even the basic necessities.  No NTUC just across a few streets or 7-eleven in case you run out of instant noodles at home.  And oh, you'll have to protect your property too, against varmints, predators and human trespassers.  Do you know how to operate a firearm?  Do you know how use a 12 gauge shotgun or hunting rifle?</p>
              <p>And oh, you don't "grow" cows, just in case you don't know, a cow is a mammal and not a vegetable.  You raise them.  And you don't call them "cows" either, they're called cattle.</p>
              <p>And yeah, please stay in the nice, clean and safe Singapore city and leave the farming to people who actually know how to.</p>

              <p>I'm curious. You are only 20, where did you get the idea to actually live on a farm. The people in this forum are right - you're only 20, there is more than enough time to get your degree, find your way and succeed.</p>
              <p>Many people survive without a degree in Singapore. I would say degree &amp; experience is just as important but with heavier weightage on experience. When you<strong> first</strong> start working in Singapore, most companies would look at your qualifications because you have no experience to begin with. As you continue slogging it out in the corporate world, your prospective employers start looking at the experiences that you have. Many people say that when companies are considering employees for promotion, they would look at the qualifications again (if they have to compare you with someone of similar working experiences).</p>
              <p>I don't think height is the matter. Generally people are proud of what they have achieved (i.e experience) and tend to look down on others who are new. But this is just how the society works. Accept it, brave through it and one day when you are successful, don't do the same to others.</p>
              <p>P/s. My boyfriend's father does farming as a hobby. (not in Singapore) It is really no joke! I don't think there are any actual vegetation farms for you to live in Singapore anyway.</p>

              <p>The future in Singapore seems so dark. ): It's so difficult to
              survive with so many Foreign talents and people that has
              degree.</p>
              <p>I feel like moving to a farm, grow some cows, vegetables, fruits
              and when I'm starving, I just go out and pluck some vegetables to
              cook.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Life is so difficult in Singapore.</p>
              <p>House, car, transportation are all way TOO EXPENSIVE. I'm only
              20 yrs old and I'm so worried and exhausted already. <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/confused.png" alt="confused.png"><img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/sad.png" alt="sad.png"><img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/cry.png" alt="cry.png"></p>

              <p>your parents leave house, WORK...not only for themselves, but also for you!! apparently they were not born with silver spoon, so don't expect them to give you one.</p>
              <p>there is no short cut to success in life. a university degree doesn't guarentee anybody anything. I think the aunties looked down on you because you think you can grow cow.  <img src="http://sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"><img src="http://sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"><img src="http://sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>at 20 you have many years ahead, so study hard, if you dream, work hard to pursue your dream, and stop whinning,  just remember, your parents don't owe you anything, the country doesn't owe you anything, nobody owe you a living!</p>

              <p>I know quite a few people who lives life pretty well though they have no degree. Thing is you have to work harder to move up the ladder and probably earn less than your counterparts with degrees. Sad truth but this is reality. There are still many who earns a lot despite having no degrees. Many bosses also never study much still earn a lot.</p>

              Please understand this..
              
              1) Study a lot doesnt mean earn a lot.
              2) Never study doesn't mean it's the end.
              3) Having a degree is always better, but not having one doesn't mean you will starve.
              4) Like some of them say, those who have degrees do not necessarily do better in life. They just have a good headstart.
              
              I myself, a poly grad, and armed with some certificates on working skills, is living an ok life. I have not starved yet. Why would you? Do your job seriously, diligently. Stop comparing with FT. They do anything wrong can just go home and hide. 
              
              Where can you hide in your case? Make full use of every opportunity.. you will find that doors will open for you at many places.
              
              All the best!
