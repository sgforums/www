              haha..
              
              last week I was shopping and saw a cap to buy for him.
              I thought, hey no matter what I just want to buy him a present even if he doesn't want to talk to me anymore. 
              I sms-ed him if he preferred the colour green. I was expecting him not to reply, but to my surprise he replied and asked me, "I thought you don't want to talk to me anymore?"
              He said whatever happened was all in the past. He said he was dulan that time and I kept pestering him, so he said it like this, "you and I were angry, we both fight, then exploded and landed in hospital for 3weeks"
               
              Yeah. So now we are alright again. But of course I never hold his hand anymore or anything like that.

              feeling emo now..cant sleep..
              
              just yesterday i told him over msn that we had better not contact each other..
              
              I don't know why, now I feel like, whenever I talk to him I am scared I'll say the wrong thing...whenever I receive his sms I will get excited or scared...I find him...he judges people on the outside, so whenever I'm with him I am careful with my words..
              
              But now..I feel sad cuz he is not here...but when he is here I feel like...suffocating..
              
              But when I say he is here...means we still do talk to each other but just exchange of few sentences..he is..emo about his ex..and sometimes I feel he is just using me whenever he needs a friend to talk to..when he isn't he just doesn't reply my smses or reply super late...and whenever I sms him is cuz..he first started smsing me...then made me think of him again..and then..emo..and want to meet him..and he dowan..he no reply my sms...later he say he go slp so nvr reply..
              
              my boyfriend..I do tell him whenever something happens and I feel sad about it...but when I suddenly feel sad cuz of no reason...I don't usually tell him cuz he will just blame himself that he isn't there for me..
              
              And now..I don't know why I feel emo cuz of him(friend)...

              <p>When are you gonna admit to yourself that you do have special feelings for your "friend" ?</p>
              <p>One day.. you will regret not making up your mind and let someone special slip pass your grip because you are simply too greedy.</p>
