              <p>Gals like that need to have a strong sense of security to be able to open up and talk, i think you need some time to gain her trust before she will open up to share with you and accept your help. Because now she may be thinking that you will or may also back stab her one day. Give her more time and patience is all you need. I believe slowly she will know that you truly want to help her and she will eventually aceept your kindness and speak up to tell you her problems.</p>

              <p>If she is a true case, i mean she's truely troubled, unlike the case MythosLogos mentioned, then i think you need to be patient, if you truly want to help her, you need time, not easy for her to trust someone again. if you be patient, she will slowly realise your sincerity and after u gain her trust, she will surely open up and share with you her problems. If she really kana back stab many times in the past, she will lose trust in everyone, as she fear to be back stab again. That's why not easy for her to trust someone again and speak up. She may be keeping herself occupied with loads of work to prevent herself from thinkng too much, otherwise, she will end up fearing all her colleagues too.</p>
              <p>I used to have a female friend, she also nice to hang out with, but sometimes very emo as she think of her past relationship, she was suffering from depression. Now she is perfectly fine after many years of support from friends, family and medical help.</p>
              <p>I hope if your friend is a true case, be patient and help her. You two may end up becoming good friends, like me &amp; my female friend.</p>

              <p>Agree.... Helping a friend like that can sometimes drain you out.... You have to prepare yourself emotionally to go all the way.... She can become very dependent on you and suddenly you realise you become very important to her emotionally.... If you dun handle in well, you will end up have problems yourself....</p>

              <p>But after a whole day of soul searching, i know i am emotionally prepared to help her all the way. When it is time to let go, i will let go.</p>
              <p>I am not without my own bad experiences and my own self-defense mechanism will kick in automatically when the limit has been reached.</p>
              <p>In fact, i was like her in the past, but i managed to walk out of it by myself. It took me years to do so....i feel so old all of a sudden....haizzzzz..............</p>

              <p><br>Could be she is still in the state of confusion, fear, and let her emotions get the better of her.   One needs to have a clear mind, sense of reasoning, good sense of judgement to sort this out.    She needs to learn to be assertive.   One can be kind and pleasant but never portray the impression that being kind and pleasant others can take advantage on her or him and cause destruction.</p>
              <p>Guess she must have encounters with some bitchy, vicious people.     Nobody like these people and she must learn how to deal with them effectively.</p>
