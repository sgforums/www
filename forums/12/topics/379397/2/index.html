              <p>No way! Its not your problem....Guess as a friend you're totally not a failure/loser...Frankly you have been very supportive and always being there...thats good enough...you are not her keeper....its her decision whether she wants to continue or not....</p>
              <p>Maybe as you have mentioned she just got retrenched...maybe she can't make it financially? Even if she is unable to cope emotionally...its not your fault...the point is you have tried....If you truely feel so, your friend had emotionally drained you and I guess you need a break....</p>
              <p>One question...why do you feel like a stab in your heart? (if you just treating her like a normal friend?)</p>

              <p>anyway, the reason of her deferrment is not BGR...so no worries there....</p>
              <p>right now, i have to treat people around me better.....get a better job....</p>
              <p>i have no intention of staying on after finishing this course of mine...it will be a waste.</p>
