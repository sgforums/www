For whatever reason I dunch know.. I suppose you could have said hi.. at least be non-chalant about it and suave.. Walking away like dat is a bit of a signal to the other person that you have lost.. not very dignified as a guy also..if you have broken up then too bad just carry on with life.. singapore is so small.. you nv know when u may bump into her again.. She already showed you that she has moved on.. so maybe you should to..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks guys for all the advice.  Like I said, I actually long time never see her already.  Thought time will heal the pain.  After we broke off, I join the Army, ROD, and further my study, start to work, make new friends, etc.<br><br>Thought I have get over her.  Then suddenly out of the blue, appear in front of me, still as beautiful as ever, the woman I used to love so deeply, now with another man.  In an instant, all the sad memories just flow back.  Instinct tells me to turn away.  I can never face her at the emotion state I was in at that point.<br><br>Anyway, next time see her I will try my best to at least smile at her.
