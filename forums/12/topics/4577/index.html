Take this brief seperation as a test. You cant shrug away ur worries, who knows ur gf may be worried abt this r/s too? Have a talk with her, put trust in the both of you. If both are fated to be together, good.

            <div class='col-md body'>I remember when I was in KaoShuing earlier this year.  3 weeks passed very very fast.<br><br>Don't worry 3 weeks sure got nights off, can go cybercafe near by to e-mail, can bring handphone there to call her (must have international charger), can buy phonecard and use public phones there... I think you worry too much... that time I was only afraid of the airflight there.<br><br>Heck lar... you'll enjoy yourself one.  What's more can see so many cute Taiwanese XiaoMeiMei.  If you need to know where the book shops and discotheques are then ask them.  There's one called cowboy pub, one call Jurassic and another one called Lan Teng Kwang Xia.  Around the Fourth Road thingee... enjoy yourself but don't fool around.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
