              <p>What is most hurtful in a betrayal is the DECEIT. The lying and hiding, and more lying and hiding to hide the lies.</p>
              <p>Stop behaving like a thief and no one will think you are one.</p>
              <p>Be open and honest about who you socialise with. </p>
              <p>If you have nothing to hide, there's no need to act sneaky. Sneaking around is not socialising. </p>
              <p>When you love someone, you should never do anything that you will  be sorry about later.</p>
              <p>Trust must be earned back. Sometimes it'll take years to build but only takes 5 seconds to destroy it.</p>
              <p>Stop with your lame excuses. Hiding behind lame excuses only shows how lame you are.</p>

              <p>To wait or to move on? Well, if you change your ways.. you can still try to salvage the relationship . If you want to continue your folly, wouldn't matter who you end up with.. the relationship will not work anyway. </p>
              <p>If you don't see the value in this relationship it's best to let go.</p>

              <p>She treated me very nice, im his first bf that last for so long and she is my second gf. My last ex-gf gave up on me because i'm selfish, low qualification and no goal in career yet. still being kiddish kind.</p>
              <p>Now i have her and everything within 1 year but now on 2nd year. Appearance and outfit to a new change.she encouage, be myside all the while when i feel terrible at work or school, buy nice stuff even those are expensive but of cause i treat her nice food and expensive stuff too.</p>
              <p>I told i love the way she is, maybe i feel that i am quite stable in relationship and wanted to improve on others. Overall she is worth it for me. Maybe i just think too highly of myself for having such a good gf and forget about how she feels.</p>

              either your girlfriend is too possessive to demand that you cannot talk to other girls, or you gave her that sense of insecurity with your actions.
              
              from here, we cannot tell if you did anything that let her felt insecure, for example, did you ever stray before?
              
              in a relationship, both parties must be frank.  there is nothing wrong with going out with members of the opposite sex.  just tell the other party who you are going out with and the relationship with that person.  be open about it.  the more you try to hide, the more suspicions it raise.
              
              so, if you treasure the relatioship with her, give her the sense of security that you belong to her only.  but also get her understanding that socialising with people of the opposite sex is normal.  you can bring her on some of these ocassions
              
              when you come out to work, don;t tell me you are not allowed to talk to your female colleagues.  what if your boss is a female?
