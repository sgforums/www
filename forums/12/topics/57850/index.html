You need to attend LGM University in order to be able to sell like them. Only if you can sell it away on your own. Never believe any agent or company that promised they can get it off your hand in whatever time line. Because they will require you to first pay member fee and/or admin fee and then after that I think you could easily guess what happened.<br><br>Cancellation is usually very difficult because these people have been around for years and they cover their backside real well. It is very difficult to hit their backside because almost all cases you cannot find them. The proper channel to approach for advice would be CASE and lawyers. They need to go through your contract in order to advise you. Your friend can join our group. We are constantly sharing experiences and exploring ways to get money back.</div>
