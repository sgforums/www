            <div class='col-md body'><p>I am a pupil in FHSS. My class is like ostracizing me. I was never popular,i just want friends. No one in my class understands me. I might be tomboyish. Im sensitive. I speak without thinking. fine,true. But dont people deserve chances? I apologised,I changed. Then I discovered a class group without me,where the guys were talking about me. No,nothing about how cute or pretty she is. More of how bitchy and arrogant she is. When you see a entire group with hate messages,with those you thought were your friends not even bothering to defend you, it hurts. All hell broke out then. I took the screenshots,printed them out. But I never actually told anyone. I just stopped caring. And when the discipline master came in with a different bullying case everyone turned to me. In class,in front of the adults,im like "Oh heck cares" but im dying inside. Even during project work my teammates left the group because im inside.Â  Whats wrong with me? Why does no one like me?</p></div>

              <p>Well, it's just a probing question :) Seems like you have some growing pains. Just my 2 cents worth....you said you want people to accept you for who you are; that means you have some sort of expectation, perhaps even unrealistic. In life, we blend in....instead of others unto us. If you insist your way, universal forces of life are going to come down hard on you.</p>
              <p>Look at those who are popular in class....are they team players? Are they the kind who people want to stay close to because they emit some sort of positive glow and energy? What other attributes do they have which make them likeable? You DON'T have to be like them, after all, you are your own person BUT you can learn some things from them. BIG difference you know....at this age, you want to be your own unique personality but you don't want to be seen as copying others too.</p>
              <p>Be ready to say sorry when you screw up, people can sense that sincerity even if they don't initially appear to. Always process words in your brain before you speak. Good luck....</p>

              <p>Yeah,I'm 12. My birthdays in December. My two cents worth of the most popular girl and boy in class,well,The girl is pretty,good in some subjects,tall,but she's really fussy(is that the right word?)about the kind of friends she have. Hangfing out with either the rich,pretty or smart. No one but those. The most popular guy hold grudges. I dont really get why he's popular at all. I mean,he's smart,rich,but once you say something wrong to him he's like "WTF how dare u say that"and then he starts hating on you. Then his friends will start to dislike you. And those that like him/his group will start disliking him. Like last time in class a classmate got blu-tack on his hair. I offered to help remove it,and this other guy sitting behind me was like "Oi you dont touch my bro hair lah bitch!" I dont even have someone to talk to after school,or during breaks. The teacher sees me sitting there alone all the time and everytime she says that she can help,and she always sees people ostracizing me and she doesnt even do anything. I feel like something that can disappear one day and no one will notice or care.</p>
              <p>The one thing all of them have is that confidence. The confidence. They can walk right up to a huge group of upper sec people and start a conversation. They aren't even shy.</p>

              <p>You got to be a lot more thick skin. People obstracize you, you got to confront them. If they don't talk to you, force them to talk you. If they boycott you or treat you like you don't exist, don't invite you to their functions, confront them ! Tell them off in their face. Taruk them. Then, they will respect you.</p>
              <p>You think before you speak. So what? You are only thirteen. You didn't kill anyone, rob anyone or made a big crime. You were just being yourself. So don't think that you have done anything wrong or there's anything wrong with you. There is nothing wrong with you. Its just politics. You got to make them respect you. Show your angry face and ask them why they treat you like this. If they go on, be persistent. Until they respect you.</p>

              <p>I am a pupil in FHSS. My class is like ostracizing me. I was never popular,i just want friends. No one in my class understands me. I might be tomboyish. Im sensitive. I speak without thinking. fine,true. But dont people deserve chances? I apologised,I changed. Then I discovered a class group without me,where the guys were talking about me. No,nothing about how cute or pretty she is. More of how bitchy and arrogant she is. When you see a entire group with hate messages,with those you thought were your friends not even bothering to defend you, it hurts. All hell broke out then. I took the screenshots,printed them out. But I never actually told anyone. I just stopped caring. And when the discipline master came in with a different bullying case everyone turned to me. In class,in front of the adults,im like "Oh heck cares" but im dying inside. Even during project work my teammates left the group because im inside.Â  Whats wrong with me? Why does no one like me?</p>

              <p>Reading your post I find it ironic that you ask "Why does no one like me?"</p>
              <p>You heck care about others, and they heck care about you.</p>
              <p>People react to you. And how they react, depends on how you conduct yourself.</p>
