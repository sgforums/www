He doesn't think we'll ever be happy staying together....so till now we haven't solve them yet...sigh..thou he did say he will try to after we sort of got back but i dun see him putting in any effort in solving them...in fact it was i who suggested that we should sit down and talk thru our problems.<br>I wonder if you all will agree with me that sms is quite a lame way of communicating..esp during the period when you are trying to get back with s.o. He does call and tries to arrange for dates but till in the beginning when we got abck together he was worried to let others see us together. he also didn't tell me his intention abt getting back when he asked me out on the first date after we broke up. it's only after [b]I asked him </strong>wat's he trying to do did he express his intention!!!...and when my friends are angry with him for being so stubborn about the breakup previously, he felt indignant that they should be...he's also rather unhappy that he's second priority in my life now after my family.....till now he still dun dare to come and visit my family or bring me home to visit his. Little things that he promised after we got back together like going to watch Chicago, making new specs after we get our pay, lending me a textbook etc...he didn't even try to fulfil them! how can he hope to earn back my trust if he is so insincere?! The most champion thing he did was telling me not to put my hopes too high that this relationship being able to work out again!!! .....<br>can anyone explain his mentality? i really try to be nice and tolerated all his wishy-washiness and his lack of effort but i feel that this can't be the way....wat should i do.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> [/b]</blockquote>since his attitude is like not sincere at all... be brave and look for a new and more wonderful relationship elsewhere... not worth ur effort in such a stubborn and insensitive guy.. personal opinion only.. hope u dun mind...<br><br>but wats impt is u live happily no matter wat happens! rem u haf frens!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>....guess wat, after i was angry with him for abt a week for sth he did which i tot was rather insincere, he decided that getting back causes him, and me, too much hurt....and since no matter wat he did also can't win back my trust (not like he did much), he gave up again..so much for being serious abt wanting to get back... this whole 'getting together' event only spans 3 months!!. ..i must have made it too easy for him.....</div>
