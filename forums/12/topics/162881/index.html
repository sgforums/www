Not because you can't attain it, but more like because you've not reach out enough to GRAB IT...??<br><br>Not being fair to him, not being fair to yourself...

Maybe to you... Its ok if he does not trully trust you.... But usually guys expect the gf to trust him... "If she doesnt trust me that I am her man... How are we goin to have a long term relationship?" Becoz what happen is that when any of u love bird hasnt really trusted each other yet... A lot of jealousy... too much controlling... suspiciousness come... And guys DOESN'T like to be controlled too much, but still ok for certain extent...<br>Anyway.. you two just 2 months right?? I think its normal... but if u have been together for at least 1 year.. try to trust each other better...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear SmallCloud,<br><br>Love is, to a certain extent, a gamble sometimes.  I sympathise with you for having been through a bad relationship, &amp; I understand the pain you've experienced.  But that's Not to say you should bring the emotional baggage into your current relationship.  It's Not fair to you, &amp; neither is it fair to your current bf.<br><br>Sure, we'll be scared of being hurt again, but those who don't dare to take risks ultimately lose out on a true loving experience: giving your partner the best of your love &amp; care, &amp; receiving the same from him.<br><br>Not everybody is the same.  Granted, cheating is common nowadays, but you hafta believe you'll find that somebody who respects you &amp; loves you enough Not to do that to you.  If we all lost hope because of a few bad relationships, there would be a whole lotta very miserable people in the world, &amp; few married couples.<br><br>FeowFeow<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by smallcloud:</div><div class="quote_body"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> what is the best way out?<br><br>i'm into the 2nd month of a relationship.<br><br>he had a bad relationship before me, and i had a bad one before him too. initially, we started out fine. having lots to talk about and to share. but we were both holding back for fear of being trapped in another relationship tragedy. but he was able to walk out of his past. i'm still overshadowed by all the possible cheatings or lies that may happen to me. to make things worse, i have dreams of him cheating on me.<br><br>i really wan to love him. i'm quite certain he's not that bad a person, but i juz can't trust him with my heart. i thought i was able to, thats why i agreed to be his gf in the 1st place. before the relationship started, i wasn't as petty or sensitive. but as time passes, all the ugly sides of men start haunting me again. it led me to become very sensitive and possessive again.. and i know i'm hurting him because the way i'm behaving sort of reminds him of his past.<br>i really don't wan to hurt him. but i don't wan to get hurt too. when i put my defences up, he could feel that i am colder towards him, and he was upset about it. he sort of "runs away" when i "run away" from him, which only makes me feel even worse.<br><br>i feel so lost now. it made me feel as if i regretted saying yes in the first place. i dun wan the relationship to fail and lose him. if i had kept him as a friend, i might have been able to keep him by my side.<br><br>then again, if i hadn't give the relationship a try, i wouldn't know. but now i'm afraid to know.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br>i'm feel like a lost kid. i really wan to love and treasure him.<br><br>help me..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br></div></blockquote></div>

I'm a pisces too and we are known too be hyper-sensitive and often overly sensitive. It happens to me too but you know yourself you have to curb some of the feelings.<br><br>But before I make any further assumptions, do make some self reflections. What causes the breakup in your past r/s? Not trying to dig your history and put salt in your old wounds now, but to move on without learning is as good as staying put. In a bad relationship, there isn't just one villian and one victim. It's always two villian and two victims. So go think about it.<br><br>Knowing what triggers a bad r/s in the past is a good way to learn and move on to another r/s with better confidence. At least for me it does but am still learning relentlessly.</div>
