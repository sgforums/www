I though you would post an essay.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>I can understand why some parents are restrictive. No matter what they still treat us as their little son or daughter, furthermore you are a female and they are even more protective of you compared to males.<br><br>Its time you have a <strong>face to face talk</strong> with your parents. Tell them you have grown older and you are willing to venture into the outside world and learn to be more independant. You should also assure them that no matter what happens, you will still love them and respect them or more.<br><br>You can even ask them when they were that age what were they doing? If they said they were being restricted like you are, then they already know how its like to be in your shoes and you can relate your current situation to them.<br><br>Have a good talk with them and come to a concensus. If they are still adamant about limiting you movements, then be more patient and communicate with them more. Gain their trust and they will have no worries letting you go out on your own. Besides you have one more year till twenty-one......  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

I guess its possibly teen years and probably "raging hormones" that makes her more rebellious. (At that age I too avoided my parents alot of times)<br><br>Perhaps as her friend and if you care about her, you can try to listen to her problems? If you serious think you are not helping, maybe can refer her to professionnal help? (There is NOTHING wrong with seeking pro help, people in all walks of life seek help) In the years as a teenager, problems surely will arise but it should not escalate to a level where it will create a scar in their heart.<br><br>I even once thought of disowning them, but later I realised that at my age that time its hard for them to understand my intentions as I found it hard to understand theirs. I felt like an idiot and decided I would take care of them all my life.<br><br>I cannot tell your friend what to do as everybody have different issues that requires different ways to handle, all I can do is suggest based on what I have experienced, what I have witnessed in others around me and I sincerely hope your friend will finaly know and appreciate her parents and love them more than ever.<br><br>Peace and joy be with us, always.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
