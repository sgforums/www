Much as he keeps saying upfront he understand your pain and is willing to work hard for this relationship....he is also bleeding inside too...it's just that he hasn't got someone like himself to want to nurse his wound, isn't it?

            <div class='col-md body'>Guys, thanks for all the listening ear.<br>I did not get married on impulse. I do have feelings for him. But it is what he did that made me feel lose it and the confidence in the marriage. Remember the marriage vows - "love him, honor him, comfort him, and keep him in sickness and in health; forsaking all others, be true to him as long as you both shall live"? That did not happen to me. Rather than all parties be sad, why not start the pain now, knowing that the marriage could not possibly continue in those circumstances and that people were unwilling to change. Forgiveness is still something that I have to work on, even as I try to carry on with my life.<br>So, why is love so hurting? Why is he treating me this way, only he could answer.</div>

After so many yrs, really hope to let this issue rest. But still think of him now and then...<br>More than 5 yrs ago, this guy K happened to see me at my work place. I knew from friends that he is sort of interested to know me but I was attached then. 1 and half yrs later, he tested h2o by asking if I would be interested if he were to date me. I replied I dont know. He MIA. 2 yrs later, he appeared again and asked me out. I have passively been liking him and we went out a few times. During this time, I was on a happy long-distance relationship, in its 2nd yr. My then-fiance would try to return every 6mths fm work to be with me for 2 weeks or so. Guy K popped out into my life again at that time. After going out a few times, he MIA again. The heartbroken me decided to take a safe route and be with someone who loves me. I got engaged to get married within the next half yr. He messaged me if I was serious. I told him that he was too late, that I had given him enough chances, that he didnt treasure me and that I don't want to be hurt by him again. He asked to remain friends. We did.<br>A few mths after getting married, my marriage became rocky. My then husband neglected me and when I fell seriously sick, he did not take care of me and told me to leave. I left and filed for divorce. The now ex-husband only asked me to return through phone and refused marital counselling. The dejected me decided to go ahead with separation. Throughout this time, Guy K was with me, offering support. I was very touched and emotions started running again. Then he MIA again after 2 months. After which another Guy A came in. A romantic at heart, a humourous, caring and loving boyfriend, all that a woman would ask for. Just too sticky at times. But feelings were not exactly there. Something is missing. Maybe it is because he is still studying and I am working. Just when things between guy A and me were starting to settle, guy K appeared again. Asked me out for supper every now and then, and did not tell me that he was already attached with another. I let him be for a while to see if he would do anything. When he finally admitted, I told him to choose. I don't want to be a third party. He said he don't want to lose either. I gave him a piece of my mind and left, refusing to reply his sms.<br>Commitment phobic I would say. Everytime he would pop in and out of my life, leaving me heartbroken. Yet I was silly enough to let me back everytime. I just like him so much. And it still hurts now and then.<br>I know A is very nice, caring and understanding. But I have been hurt before and is afraid. And my heart is with K, although I am trying to forget him. </div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> There are three guys in the case; all three belonging to different era, different positions and different lessons. Beneath the problems, lies a similiar situation - guys appearing at critical moment to shake your relationship violently.<br><br>Guy K had successfully chain you within the grasp of his seduction and is pretty sure it would be, especially, seduction law 1, 6, 9, 12, 17 and 21. (Don't ask me explain each of them - not important at all). The crucial note you have to realise is that this attraction bond you had with him did not sever right in the beginning. It set roots within your heart and clings to you like an undetected virus. When the time has ripe and he make his appearance, this virus rebel within you and shook your emotions.<br><br>Actually, irregardless of the love involved, if you haven't realise by now: at that point of time, you are not exactly ready for marriage. Issues are lurking in some corner of your life and by avoiding doesn't neccessary meant that these are past chapters. Furthermore, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">your marriage is born from LDR </span>- which is treading on hazardous ground if you were to decide upon marriage within months after LDR, or still within the process of it.<br><br>It only took you a <strong>few</strong> months within marriage to realise that this guy you are married to, isn't a man you could foresee to live with for the rest of your life.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> You married for the right reason - but reality and basis of relationship wasn't substantial enough to hold your marriage.<br><br>A is a new guy that pops out and as mentioned, he is the kind of guy any woman who loves to have as a boyfriend. I presume you are still quite young, for this man you are considering is still studying.<br><br>From your past and everything else, you grew cautious about your environment and the new man that pops out - you said you feared to be hurt. Ironically and unknowingly, you are putting yourself at certain risk to be hurt if you preferred to remain in the grasp of K's unfulfilling love.<br><br>The new man, not too sure about that.<br><br>But your old flame? Defintely, hurtful.<br><br>You tried to address the issue and that confrontation has to be the concluding chapter for K. Don't seek for K in A - learn to release your limitation and set yourself free from K. Learn to see A more than just someone who is caring, kind, loving (or a man that woman would love to have) - <strong>see A as himself</strong>. Conflicts and personality will definitely surface as you know A better - learn to see him as a whole, not those few qualities.<br><br>P.S: You can only move after you resolve your thingy about K in yourself. A can only come in after that is done - you can't multi-task. Avoid trying to do it simultaneously. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>
