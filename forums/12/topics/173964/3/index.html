Chances are she will not enjoy herself at all.<br><br>She will end up telling you all those problems and turn the date into an auntie agony session.

Just be a good listener.</strong><br><br><strong><span style="color: blue;">Your aim is to enjoy yourself during the date</span></strong><br><br>Give her 10 mins max to talk about whatÂ’s bothering her. Be a good listener during that time.<br><br>Then spend the rest of the time making both of you enjoy the date.<br><br><strong>Go for action dates!</strong> ThatÂ’s the best way to help her forget her stress and worries.<br><br>In my case, I took her to a funfair with a bad ass Â“VikingÂ” so that she can scream into my ears until they bleed.<br><br>Then I took her to an arcade so that she can kick my ass in some computer game. (of course I told her I purposely let her win).<br><br>You see why I said confessions are over-rated now?<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">The way you talk and listen to her.<br>The way you look at her.<br>The way she can enjoy herself when sheÂ’s with you.<br>The way you touch her at the appropriate time.<br><br>Those are the things you should focus on.<br><br>Confessions will not raise her interest. </span></strong>So don't worry about whether you should confess, it is not that important.<br><br>Focus on doing the right thing and when your gut tells you the time is right, grab hold her hand.<br><br>But for nowÂ…start talking to her again.<br><br>Stop avoiding her and once you are in talking terms again, ask her out and do the right things.<br><br>Good luck.<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>thanks for ur points. i appreciate them too.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The moment has come and gone. U asked her if she in the PAST liked u and she said yes. The feeling u have for that person at a particular point in time may not mean that u will have the same feeling forever. She has moved on. Why haven't u? Don't be like me. I had waited 8 years for this girl, and she said she liked me too in the past. Now, we can only be good friends. Maybe that's what u should be with her too.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by ChairmanJay:</div><div class="quote_body">I just canÂ’t open my mouth to let her know<br><br>I really wanted to tell Cyndi I really like her very much, but i just can't do it. She has been in the same class with me for the 4th year. I never know that she is the one for me untill late 2005, during the school holidays.<br><br>Maybe it's a class gathering that made me change my views toward her. The class gathering was held at a charlet. We had our great times and memories there. After the charlet, I started msging her everyday and night. I try my best to show my care for her. We even started talking on the phone for long hours. She shared some of her problems with me. And I try my best to help her.<br><br>I started to know more about her. Then, I found myself in a love triange; she crush on another guy in the same workplace as her. however, that guy doesn't like her. I was heart-broken. I can feel that she was really depressed. I can't do anything to help as she just refused to tell me about it. After sometimes, she finally learnt to forget about that guy.<br><br>Once, she asked me to go out together with her. She said she was moody and need someone to accompany her. Although I'm kinda shy, I was over the moon and agreed without much thinking. Soon, we go out together more often and have dinner together sometimes. I really enjoyed being with her.<br><br>After school reopen, I seldom have chance to talk to her. One day, she lost her voice and was coughing badly. I bought her strepsel everyday till the day she recovered. In class I was quiet. Maybe I'm shy, or I have nothing to say to her. Then last saturday, we have lunch together. I can feel that she likes me too. I got the Chong Dong to tell her i like her too. But..those mere simple sentences, I canÂ’t say them.<br><br>Untill wednesday, I picked up my courage and I was about to tell her. Unfortunately, I found out that she crush on another guy AGAIN but she denied it. I asked her whether have she liked me before and she said she did. My whole heart hangs in the air, I can only watch from afar.<br><br>She is so important to me, I regret not letting her know.<br></div></blockquote>It's never too late to let another person know how you feels about her...as long as both of you are healthy and alive.  And yes, according to what I've read...she does liked you in the past when she's recovering from her sadness.<br><br>Why not take another chance and confess to her that you liked her too? Remember...you got nothing to lose if you tell her that you like her too and you are serious about her. Cos when you keep it from her, you will definitely lose her and regret. Think through thoroughly and decide if you want her to be in your future or not and stick to your final decision.<br><br>Well...it's good that you trust what your instinct is telling you...that she's probably sending out signals to you that signify she is also interested in you. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Do not be afraid about rejections, as you are probably her close friend at the moment and she won't be so outright and heartlessly reject you. She won't hurt you in a way that will brings you nightmarish memories okie... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Everybody is constantly seeking out the right 'one' for themselves, but they often have little choice to choose from...cos mostly are people which they are directly associated with. Even then, the 'one' might not turned out to be the real 'one' afterall. But there are alot of cases where we don't really need to find the 'one' for ourselves, cos the 'one' that we think he/she is...dislikes us. Afterall, it will all boils down to our individual ability to love whoever that we're with at the moment. And if we have learnt how to love an individual, we will realise that we don't actually need to seek out the 'one' anymore, cos love is reciprocal.<br><br>Anyway, I wish you all the best with your gal. And may both of you appreciate and grow each other's love forever. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Good luck. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>
