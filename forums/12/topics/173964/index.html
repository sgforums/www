            <div class='col-md body'>I just canÂ’t open my mouth to let her know<br><br>I really wanted to tell Cyndi I really like her very much, but i just can't do it. She has been in the same class with me for the 4th year. I never know that she is the one for me untill late 2005, during the school holidays.<br><br>Maybe it's a class gathering that made me change my views toward her. The class gathering was held at a charlet. We had our great times and memories there. After the charlet, I started msging her everyday and night. I try my best to show my care for her. We even started talking on the phone for long hours. She shared some of her problems with me. And I try my best to help her.<br><br>I started to know more about her. Then, I found myself in a love triange; she crush on another guy in the same workplace as her. however, that guy doesn't like her. I was heart-broken. I can feel that she was really depressed. I can't do anything to help as she just refused to tell me about it. After sometimes, she finally learnt to forget about that guy.<br><br>Once, she asked me to go out together with her. She said she was moody and need someone to accompany her. Although I'm kinda shy, I was over the moon and agreed without much thinking. Soon, we go out together more often and have dinner together sometimes. I really enjoyed being with her.<br><br>After school reopen, I seldom have chance to talk to her. One day, she lost her voice and was coughing badly. I bought her strepsel everyday till the day she recovered. In class I was quiet. Maybe I'm shy, or I have nothing to say to her. Then last saturday, we have lunch together. I can feel that she likes me too. I got the Chong Dong to tell her i like her too. But..those mere simple sentences, I canÂ’t say them.<br><br>Untill wednesday, I picked up my courage and I was about to tell her. Unfortunately, I found out that she crush on another guy AGAIN but she denied it. I asked her whether have she liked me before and she said she did. My whole heart hangs in the air, I can only watch from afar.<br><br>She is so important to me, I regret not letting her know.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Your case sounds very similar to my previous case.<br><br>1. Her various crushes.<br>- Does she have any previous boyfriends? If yes, does she change her boyfriend very fast &amp; often? i.e. one to three months. If no, how many crushes does she used to have? She seems to me like one who cannot settle down at any rate.<br><br>2. Her confiding in you her problems.<br>- Please don't attach any romantic feelings to that until she made some obvious hints, simply because to a girl, there's nothing wrong in confiding in someone her problems. To her, your presence to her is comforting.<br><br>3. Get in!<br>- Take a more active role in wooing her. Stop being the guy who patiently waits for her silently at her side. Ask her out, hinting to her that this is a romance date, not a friendship one. Remember, you only need one chance to get her completely hooked on you. So, good luck. If you don't know what to do, ask. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Her various crushes.<br>- Does she have any previous boyfriends? If yes, does she change her boyfriend very fast &amp; often? i.e. one to three months. If no, how many crushes does she used to have? She seems to me like one who cannot settle down at any rate.<br><span style="color: red;">yes. 2. one was a mistake. de other one ditched her.</span><br>2. Her confiding in you her problems.<br>- Please don't attach any romantic feelings to that until she made some obvious hints, simply because to a girl, there's nothing wrong in confiding in someone her problems. To her, your presence to her is comforting.<br><span style="color: red;">she did made some obvious hints. just that i never make my move. and..i missed the chance.</span><br>3. Get in!<br>- Take a more active role in wooing her. Stop being the guy who patiently waits for her silently at her side. Ask her out, hinting to her that this is a romance date, not a friendship one. Remember, you only need one chance to get her completely hooked on you. So, good luck. If you don't know what to do, ask. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><span style="color: red;">like? i'm a first timer by the way.</span></div></blockquote></div>
