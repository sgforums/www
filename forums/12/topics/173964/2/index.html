Too late? She's attached?<br><br>For a change, if you have the courage to ask her if she like you BEFORE, why don't you just ask her if she still likes you NOW??<br><br>Pal, if you have problems expressing your feelings to the girl you like, you'll probably will regret it (which I think you already regret as you mentioned).<br><br>Me like my gf for 4yrs but because of guts and several more other reasons I never express my feelings for her and also scared she can't accept me but when I finally did muster up my courage and confess, the next thing I know she's my gf ler (although we just broke up but it's not due to no feelings but rather exterior reasons like pressure from families).<br><br>Go for it pal before you regret even more. Like I always tell people, you'll never know if you'll succeed or fail if you don't try. You do it, you'll have a fair chance but if you opt out then you already fail.<br><br>Ask yourself, you wanna try and fight for a chance or you simply just chicken out and opt to fail even before you try?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Like what I have told you before, go for it before it is too late.<br><br>You might think it is complicated, but from what I heard, you just clutter your mind with too many thoughts and ideas formed from assumptions based on her actions. When you told me what she said and what you thought, I, as an outsider, could not find any links between those two.<br><br>So I think you indeed think too much. And I think you know it too. And the danger of thinking too much is that it will stop you from actually acting out. So in the end, too much thinking, until you got scared by your own thoughts, of what might have happened, when all those have never happened.<br><br>So I think the first thing you need to do is to block all these thoughts and assumptions from your mind. And just do it. Just tell her that you like her and that you want to be in a r/s with her if possible. She will tell you that she is afraid of getting hurt again, maybe she is still recovering from her pain from her previous r/s? Tell her that you will give her time.<br><br>And if she said she is afraid of losing the frenship with you if both of you happen to break up in the end, assure her that you will still be friends with her even though things didn't turn out well.<br><br>Good luck. Reach for your courage and tell her how you feel. Stop thinking of all the negative things, of things that did not happen because those will only stop you from doing the right thing. And once she has made her decision, respect it <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Maybe its rumour?<br>Since she mentioned that she liked you before, just go all the way for it. Try and talk to her more often in classes. Pluck up your courage. I am sure even if you fail, you will know you tried your best for it.<br>There is no harm letting her know that she is still important to you. Prob let her think about it and who knows, the tides might be in your favor.<br><br>My philosophy is always" You nv try, you nv know. If you tried and failed, you will have no regrets. If you dont even try, you will end up in regrets"<br>Good luck dude</div>

Be a good listener during that time.<br><br>Then spend the rest of the time making both of you enjoy the date.<br><br><strong>Go for action dates!</strong> ThatÂ’s the best way to help her forget her stress and worries.<br><br>In my case, I took her to a funfair with a bad ass Â“VikingÂ” so that she can scream into my ears until they bleed.<br><br>Then I took her to an arcade so that she can kick my ass in some computer game.
