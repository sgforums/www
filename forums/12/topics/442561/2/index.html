              <p>If you are resourceful at finding SGF. Sure you are resourceful at finding a shelter for the abused children. Go to the internet and see if you can google for any SHELTER for the underprivaledge. Contact them - a shelter is a place run by charity/religious organisations to help abused people. The shelter may provide accomodation, food and counselling until you are old enough to go out and work for yourself. But do this only as a last resort, when all avenues have been exhausted, you contact them. Life is not perfect, neither is the shelter - when you are out on your own, you may need to find a job, you may be living among delinquents (naughty people) at the shelter - so you may get some bullying - it is not easy. So think twice before you consider this avenue (only as the last resort).</p>

              Hi TS,
              
              it makes me sad to read your story. I can identify with you, because I went through the same things as you. I have a mum and a brother. Are you the elder one? I'm guessing you are, because that could explain why your mum has heaped so much expectations on you. Even if you aren't, the fact that you are girl would account for her relying on you so much more than on your brother. She is alone without her husband, afterall. And having to handle everything herself is no easy task.
              
              From your story, I can tell she has extreme and unpredictable mood swings. It seems she doesn't know what to do and how to handle it. She is definitely stressed. How old is your mum? She might be menopausal. It STILL doesn't make it right for her to verbally abuse you though, but I do think she loves you too much, and the only way she knows to hold you in to her, is to throw out verbal abuse. To make you feel small and need guidance (from her). I don't think she consciously does this to hurt you though.
              
              She may be hurt that she's 'losing' you - parents seldom relinquish control when their youngsters are grown up and ready to fly the coop. 
              
              I don't know what to do if I were in your situation. I went through all these when I was younger, and now things aren't so hard as my mum has mellowed, and I have learnt to understand her more. All I can say is, HOLD ON. You can and will do it. Time will get things better. 
              
              When my mum was like extreme crazy (when I was younger), I used to get into a lot of fights and arguments with her. I was never those kinds of rebellious ah-lians and all that, but she would bring out the rebellious streak in me. I would be mouthy, rude and mean-tempered with her (and anyone else who tried to interfere). I never came home on time from school, preferring to roam about outside (alone) until just before dinner time. And anytime we got on each others' nerves, I would go in the room and shut the door to steam. LOL. Better that than to fight back.
              
              Meanwhile, DON'T CUT, OK? If it really hurts so much you need another venue to release your pain, do something that is NOT SELF-HARM. Force yourself to exercise. Or pick up a new hobby, listen to music, write, email your online buddies, whatever.  
              
              You are always welcome to email me if you wanna, but I can't exactly help you, can just share with you what I did =)
              
              JY!

              It is hard to explain the special feeling of being able to identify with someone else. Everyone walks in their own direction in life but someone else will always stumble upon the same route you were on. Its always nice to talk about a bad experience and be able to educate someone else in the same plight on how we walked out of it.
