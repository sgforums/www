Most often, when guys initiate a break-up, the reasons are quite straightforward and predictable.

And hence dun wanna affect u as well...<br><br>Then after some time after e break then realise that actually they still wants you....<br><br>kinda of weird but that is GIRLS  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

In the end? the excuses they receive would sound really quite lame.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>There is certainly more than meets the eye. Either she never tell you or you never post it. Well, some question i could like to ask is about the same as Uncle Devil and one more thing: Why did she wanted to break you the previous time? Reasons being? Situation involving? etc, etc.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>
