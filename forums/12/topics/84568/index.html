Return him back his cold receptions and see how he reacts. If still no effect on him, then maybe you should start planning for the worst.<br><br>Hmm....I cannot make him love you again, and I also don't want you to make yourself desperate for him. So...best is to be a mirror and reflect the same treatment back to him. May he is having some internal struggle with himself....family problems, work problems...and worse...he like another girl.
