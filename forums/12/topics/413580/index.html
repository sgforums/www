              <p>This kind of scenario is the most easiest to handle.</p>
              <p>DO NOT TELL AT ANY COST.</p>
              <p>I don't care if you suddenly felt like you want to have some honour to your name or not.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The rule of the thumb is, PROTECT RELATIONSHIPS.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you are unable to protect people's relationships, then you will find that your own relationships will also be in trouble in the future.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>YOU SHOULD FORGET WHAT YOU HAVE HEARD OR KNOW.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Your friend confessed to you because she is feeling bad and she needs an outlet to vent her guilt.</p>
              <p>I'm sure your friend will not do it again, but if she choose to do it...that's her own choice and her own relationships. Let them go and sort it out on their own.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Knowing something doesn't means you MUST take some kind of actions.</p>
              <p>In short, IT IS NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS AND YOU SHOULD KNOW WHEN TO MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS.</p>

              <p>First of all, yes, A betrayed her friend. However, after one year, she has already made up her mind to end her friendship with her, so this decision is done only after she has weighed out the different consequences of her actions.</p>
              <p>In fact, she may already knew that neither the guy nor the girl will be grateful to her for her actions, but she still did it anyway out of conscience. </p>
              <p>Looking at this issue from a more analytical point of view, we cannot really blame her.</p>
              <p>At the start of the 1 year, the guy is just merely someone whom she just know, as compared to her long standing friend who has just confided in her her darkest secret. She may suffer some moral dilemma here, but her friend is definitely more important than some random guy.</p>
              <p>After some time, this guy also become a good friend of hers, this is when she need to think deeper. Which of her friends should she remain loyal to? She can only be a true friend to one of them, and betray the other. To tell or not to tell?</p>
              <p>After some considerations, she realised that there are many reasons to tell on her female friend. She has degraded herself by sleeping around, and can you really trust someone who can betray her other half so easily to be a true friend to you? On the otherhand, the guy is an innocent party - he didn't sleep around and betrayed his other half. Most importantly, there is no telling when the girl will pass some form of sexual disease to him. </p>
              <p>Last of all, though she knows she will get to keep neither of them as her friend in the end, she will rather be the villain to both of them, rather than to be a hypocrite pretending to be a friend for the rest of her life. This is really a tough decision for her, and I believe it also hurt her badly to make such a decision. She probably has some regrets, but she did what she believe was the best decision.</p>
              <p>Hence, her actions are understandable. If she has told on her friend from the start, what kind of person will she be? She will be someone whom you cannot trust anything with, and not someone whom you can truly call a friend.</p>
              <p>TS, pass on my message to her. She has done well and did what she truly believe in. She may have some regrets now, but tell her to learn to move on, such dilemmas are hard to avoid in life. </p>
