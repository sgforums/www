              <p>This kinda relationship is very complicated.</p>
              <p>But then does the friend know the relationship status of the boy and the girl?</p>
              <p>These days, some relationships got differenct clauses de.</p>
              <p>Some of these are OPEN relationship, EXPLORATORY relationship, and others are just DATING relationships.</p>
              <p>Any other more open de would be FB or friends with benefits le.</p>

              <p>I've elaborated my point quite clearly. Maybe you want to elaborate yours further? </p>
              <p>I wasn't even talking about honouring or dishonouring whoever's name. totally don't get what you're driving at here, so if u wld care to elaborate here, it would be wonderful. =)</p>

And the gal knew all this, so i would say it was a well informed decision and tat she has weighed out her options. </span></p>

              <p>This is tough one. And most like you will think "WTF! Omg.. I wish I dont know nothing."</p>
              <p>You normally have to balance out whether who is the better friend..  not to mention is the person really a good friend of yours and the repecussions of it. Because there are situations where, you would think you are good friends, but ur good friend just cant handle the truth.</p>
              <p>Not to mention, there will also be times where A for instance, likes the girl/boy .. and when it comes to dispensing the information, their agenda is simple. Break them up then make up with her.</p>
              <p>I was in this situation before, my ex was also in this situationa and HER ex was in it too.</p>
              <p>What I did was, I just kept quiet. Mainly because :-</p>
              <p>1) It is someone else's private affair.</p>
              <p>2) Before one can comment, one has to understanding the situation FULLY. Unfortuntely, that takes time.. and lots of cafe sit-ins, not to mention the level of keponess can be very high. And if you are not a particulary kepo person, it can feel uneasy and tedious.</p>
              <p>3) I dont want to be in a situation where, when she has to reveal source, I will be dragged in and oh my.. drama mama time.</p>
              <p>4) If you guys are really that close, there will be opportunity where you can question her doubt. And eventually it will lead to the truth that she can discover herself. That is what I did.</p>
              <p>Unless you want to know the outcome of my ex and her ex, I wont elaborate further.</p>
              <p>Anyways.. any decision you make, you will make at least one enemy.</p>

              <p><br>Betraying the trust of your GAL friend at the expense of sacrificing both the happiness of your GAL friend and the BOY (your friend also), DOES NOT MAKES YOU A BETTER FRIEND TO BOTH GAL AND BOY.</p>
              <p>So there is no reasonable explaination for your desire to reveal what you know from GAL to BOY, unless you are just out to satisfy your own righteousness in selfishness or you wish to destroy their relationship out of selfishness in the name of righteousness.</p>
              <p>Which one it's going to be, it's entirely up to your own evil intentions which I will have no part or agreement in it.</p>
              <p>You are selfish because your actions will only bring about the satisfactory result for YOURSELF. And neither the BOY or your GAL friend is going to be happy from what you are planning to do except for YOURSELF.</p>

              <p>What kind of ending are you hoping for when you planned to become a friend-betraying selfish and bitchy slut?</p>

              <p><br>This is an open discussion?? Ok, have fun with your own discussion then.</p>
              <p>Next time post your open discussion in the correct forum, not in Aunt Agony where people contribute their opinions at the best interests to help the topic starter.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Even if you insist to have an open discussion, you should know it's polite for you to express your own opinions FIRST.</p>
              <p>Sitting around and waiting to argue upon people's genuine opinions is just plain rude and ridiculous. This shows how little you know about starting an open discussion topic and your participation experience in any open discussion topics.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You're stupid to come to Aunt Agony forum to start a distress topic and tried to mutate it into an open discussion topic.</p>
              <p>You're stupid to even tell people that this is an open discussion topic when you as the topic starter, have failed to share and express your genuine opinions FIRST when you began this topic.</p>
              <p>You're stupid to even try to argue with other people's sincere opinions with the intentions to help/assist in this distress topic which you have started.</p>
              <p>You're stupid because you are unable to express yourself clearly in your own topic, including your stance in the topic and your intentions behind this topic.</p>
              <p>You're stupid to think that you could argue with people's opinions when they don't even belonged to you in the first place and these people were just trying to help you in your topic.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you do not feel grateful or thankful towards the genuine opinions that many forumers here have taken the time to share with you in this topic, then you need to realise that your time in here will be a very short journey.</p>
              <p>Because nobody is going to participate in any of your stupid distress topic, when it is only an open discussion topic in your stupid dictionary.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>6 posts or 7 posts doesn't means a thing if you need to be ignored and banned until you hit puberty.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Don't waste my time with your stupid topic if you do not need any help. Be polite and have some manners to let people or moderators know that you do not need anymore help and take some initiative to request for the topic to be closed.</p>

              <p><br>This is an open discussion?? Ok, have fun with your own discussion then.</p>
              <p>Next time post your open discussion in the correct forum, not in Aunt Agony where people contribute their opinions at the best interests to help the topic starter.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Even if you insist to have an open discussion, you should know it's polite for you to express your own opinions FIRST.</p>
              <p>Sitting around and waiting to argue upon people's genuine opinions is just plain rude and ridiculous. This shows how little you know about starting an open discussion topic and your participation experience in any open discussion topics.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You're stupid to come to Aunt Agony forum to start a distress topic and tried to mutate it into an open discussion topic.</p>
              <p>You're stupid to even tell people that this is an open discussion topic when you as the topic starter, have failed to share and express your genuine opinions FIRST when you began this topic.</p>
              <p>You're stupid to even try to argue with other people's sincere opinions with the intentions to help/assist in this distress topic which you have started.</p>
              <p>You're stupid because you are unable to express yourself clearly in your own topic, including your stance in the topic and your intentions behind this topic.</p>
              <p>You're stupid to think that you could argue with people's opinions when they don't even belonged to you in the first place and these people were just trying to help you in your topic.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you do not feel grateful or thankful towards the genuine opinions that many forumers here have taken the time to share with you in this topic, then you need to realise that your time in here will be a very short journey.</p>
              <p>Because nobody is going to participate in any of your stupid distress topic, when it is only an open discussion topic in your stupid dictionary.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>6 posts or 7 posts doesn't means a thing if you need to be ignored and banned until you hit puberty.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Don't waste my time with your stupid topic if you do not need any help. Be polite and have some manners to let people or moderators know that you do not need anymore help and take some initiative to request for the topic to be closed.</p>
