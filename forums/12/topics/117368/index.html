            <div class='col-md body'>Hidden charges may eat into investments<br><br>THE higher charges result from the increased costs of<br>insurance cover as people age and the likelihood of<br>illness increases.<br><br>The costs could end up soaring so much that they eat<br>into the 'investment' part of a person's policy,<br>resulting in it lapsing altogether. 'That's the time<br>when you may need the cover most,' says financial<br>adviser Evelyn Seah.<br><br>Feb 12, 2005<br>Insurance 'time-bomb' set to explode<br>by Lorna Tan<br><br>WHEN engineer Kelvin Yee bought an investment-linked policy (ILP)<br>eight years ago, he thought he had done the right thing: it gave him life<br>insurance, while at the same time his savings worked harder by being<br>invested in unit trusts.<br><br>But Mr Yee, 37, now finds that the investment product he purchased has<br>been described as a 'time-bomb' by one financial adviser - one which is<br>set to explode as a new scandal on the insurance industry scene.<br><br>Mr Yee, along with potentially tens of thousands of others who bought<br>the hugely popular policies over the years, has found out that, as he<br>gets older, hidden increased insurance charges mean that the premiums<br>that are meant for investment purposes are being eaten up just to keep<br>the policy going.<br><br>Under most ILPs, premiums are invested in securities such as unit<br>trusts and pay for life insurance coverage as well. But Mr Yee's annual<br>insurance charges are set to escalate at such a rate they will one day<br>outstrip the annual premium he pays.<br><br>When he turns 67, the charges work out to double that of the annual<br>fixed premium of $3,600 for coverage of $100,000. At 73, the charges are<br>expected to climb to $11,500 and when he turns 81, they will surge to<br>$20,000.<br><br>Mr Yee said: 'This policy does not meet my needs. My impression was<br>that it was a savings plan that gives decent annual returns of 2 to 3 per<br>cent guaranteed, at least.'<br><br>He alleged that he was unaware of the existence of the increased<br>charges until a financial adviser whom he consulted did the sums.<br><br>The higher charges result from the increased costs of insurance cover,<br>as people age and the likelihood of illness increases.<br><br>In some cases, the costs could end up soaring so much that they eat<br>into the 'investment' part of a person's policy, resulting in it lapsing<br>altogether.<br><br>The problem is emerging now as people who bought such ILPs several<br>years ago are seeing charges leap now that they are older.<br><br>Once a policyholder hits 40, an ILP's annual insurance charges<br>typically rise 'exponentially', says Life Insurance Association (LIA)<br>president Mr Raymond Kwok, who is calling for greater transparency on the<br>issue.<br><br>The problem lies in the small print. Most people's eyes would have<br>gone to the policy's 'benefits' table, illustrating how much their<br>investments would increase each year based on growth rate projections of 5 and<br>9 per cent.<br><br>No doubt they would have been tantalised by the big figures their lump<br>sums grew to at those rates - even though many financial advisers<br>nowadays say such high percentages are unrealistic.<br><br>What people probably glossed over were figures in a column generally<br>labelled 'effect of deductions'. With no breakdown given of the<br>'deductions', few, if any, policyholders would have realised these contained<br>the costs of coverage for death, disability and critical illness, say<br>financial advisers.<br><br>The older you get, the more of a risk you are to the insurer, so it<br>costs more to cover you. In industry jargon, these costs are<br>'non-guaranteed', which means they don't stay fixed, unlike your premiums. In fact,<br>they rise - astronomically in the case of ILPs that have regular<br>premiums with high protection elements.<br><br>People may have assumed the costs were included in the fixed premiums.<br>But in reality, they needed to break down the costs from the effect of<br>deductions column to get a complete picture.<br><br>Billions of dollars worth of ILPs have been bought here, many with<br>Central Provident Fund savings.<br><br>In echoes of the 'critical-year' controversy which rocked insurers in<br>2003, at least a few reckoned they were mis-sold the product. In that<br>scandal, policyholders were shocked to find that, due to the fall in<br>value of an insurer's investments, they had to keep paying premiums longer<br>than expected.<br><br>That controversy largely involved one big-name insurer. This time, all<br>except UOB Life offer the so-called regular premium ILPs.<br><br>Prudential Assurance was the first insurer to launch the first regular<br>ILP here in 1992.<br><br>As for Mr Yee, his financial adviser from Cornerstone Planners, Ms<br>Evelyn Seah, who did not sell him the original policy, noted that there<br>may come a time when the pool of units in the investment part of the<br>policy will be depleted.<br><br>This is because 'units will be deducted from this pool to pay for the<br>increasing non-guaranteed insurance and administrative charges when the<br>annual premium is not sufficient to cover these charges.<br><br>'When it happens, the policy lapses. That's the time when you may need<br>the cover most.'<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yah, even pure investments with no links to insurance policies also have hidden charges...<br><br>with insurance coys joining in the fray, and employ mlm like structure, there will be greater hidden costs to cover these two actions<br><br>btw, why is this in AA?</div>
