But I feel that as a human being, one should not regret. So perhaps would be better if you could pop the question or hint to her, so that you know at least you've tried and know the answer to your burning question.<br><br>But before you go and pop the question to her, you should have come up with a few 'if' situations. If she agree, what are you going to do and how to handle the current situation? On the other hand, if she rejects, can you both treat each other the same way as before and carry on with this platonic relationship? Do some homework with your heart. And listen to what has it got to say to you and act.<br><br>Good Luck!</span><br><br><span style="color: violet;">lavender_scent</span></div>
