Before you read it, read this: Life is too short for regrets.<br><br><blockquote>I pulled the plug on my mother<br>She showered me with all her love, but I had to make the decision to end her life<br><br>Melvin Tan Kok Liang<br><br>Oct 20, 2006. Today is my birthday and on Oct 26, it would have been yours, Mother. I dedicate this tribute to you.<br>.<br>IT HAS been a year and seven months since you passed away and I am still mourning you.<br>.<br>I was your only child, and you lavished your love on me and devoted yourself to bringing up a good son. We were not rich, but I was not deprived. You made sure I had the best, not just in material terms but in maternal love.<br>.<br>I remember in my primary school days, we illegally converted our one-room flat in Toa Payoh into a makeshift hairdressing salon.<br>.<br>Business was brisk, but eventually our house was raided by the authorities. During those tough times, I tagged along as we went door-to-door to promote your services in the estate.<br>.<br>You took such good care of all your customers, young and old, throughout the years, that even when we shifted to our three-room flat in Hougang, you were popularly known as Ah Hua, that dian mo jie (hairdresser) in Hougang Block 23. Your Toa Payoh customers continued visiting you there.<br>.<br>Everyone in the neighbourhood knew how thrifty you were Â— how you would walk to and from the wet market, to save on bus fare.<br>.<br>You saved up every cent and single-handedly managed the household budget. I never had to go hungry, never had to worry about my school fees or having a roof over my head.<br>.<br>As I grew older, I realised the things you did for our family, the values you lived by. In addition to taking care of the family, you also took it on yourself to look after both my grandmothers through their golden years. Though we never actually sat down and talked about such things, I learnt about integrity and honesty from the way you lived.<br>.<br>"Live within your means" was your motto and you did just that.<br>.<br>You never travelled (once, I went with some relatives to Malaysia, but you didn't follow as you thought two air tickets were too expensive). You never got into debt. You believed a simple life was a virtue in itself.<br>.<br>You never skimped when it came to food for the family, yet you skimped on your own material needs. The many handbags that I bought for you were carefully wrapped in layers and layers of newspapers Â— never used.<br>.<br>For 46 years, you slogged for the family, and when my hair salon business and overseas ventures did not do too well, you were the one who bailed me out without ever asking questions.<br>.<br>You encouraged me to try again, to never give up my dreams, but also to never forget those who helped me. I was 30 then.<br>.<br>Whenever we went to the temple, you would leave coins for the needy. Your lesson to me was to donate whatever I could, and not only when I am called upon to do so. Indeed, the way you helped others through small gestures, endeared you to many neighbours and friends.<br>.<br>As the years passed, you were diagnosed with high blood pressure. But you did not want me to worry Â— you would often brush aside your dizziness as a minor headache.<br>.<br>The day you fainted at home and was rushed to hospital, I knew it too late Â— that I had not done my part as a son, to check diligently on your health. I had taken it for granted that you would take care of yourself.<br>.<br>My heart sank when the doctor asked us to prepare for the worst, as you had gone into a deep coma due to a burst blood vessel.<br>.<br>As the only child, the decision to pull you off the life-support system fell to me. I had been showered with all your love Â— how could I possibly make that decision?<br>.<br>I hesitated for a long, long time. The doctor told us we were prolonging your suffering, and that the chances of your recovering were very slim. After much emotional struggle, we asked the doctor to reassure us that they had done everything they could for you.<br>.<br>Then we let you go.<br>.<br>As I stood by my cousin, the nurse unplugged the life support system. Your heartbeat slowed gradually. I cried for the longest time and held your body. I begged, I cried, I tugged at you, hoping you would miraculously show some movement.<br>.<br>You left us on March 1, 2005, at 2.17pm.<br>.<br>A year and a half has passed. It feels like you've never left me.<br>.<br>As I move on without you, I will always remember how you left me the best thing you could Â— your name, and everything good thing that it stood for. Ah Hua, that Hougang Block 23 dian mo jie.<br>.<br>Dear Mum, I love you and miss you.<br>.<br>The writer works as a report analyst in an IT company.</blockquote><a href="http://mybelovedmum.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://mybelovedmum.blogspot.com/</a></div>
