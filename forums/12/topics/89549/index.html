            <div class='col-md body'>No, unless you can outwit him. But even then, you must take very close attention on him. He is probably the type to cheat u for his own benefits, even if he have no guts to do big frauds, its likely he will abuse his position for small benefits.<br><br>Then again, if he is working for you, he can use his wits against your rivals or whatever.</div>
