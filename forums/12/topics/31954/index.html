F1 and M1 were ex before, for some reasons, they went separate ways. M2 falls in love with F1 and with M1 help...<br><br>The reason why M1 is doing that is because since its his ex and his good friend like her - as not to appear selfish and possessive and lame, he assisted - but who really knows what is going on behind the picture? I am *not* saying that he backstab M2, rather this assistance you people so *sure* it is helpful? - Many a times when it comes to chasing a woman, friends that intervene often creates hinder than help. Think about this: If you - XLN - were told by your ex that your Ex's good friend likes you. 97.35% you wouldn't have even thought of that idea of being together with his good friend, because your ex spoke to you not him. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>*PLUS*: IMAGINE going out with her present bf and ex together... now thats suck. F1 rejected M2 on the basis on this point. Furthermore, think about this - if she has feeling for M2, she would have gone with him instead of M1 *OR* they would be together long ago and not wait until now.<br><br>XLN, you being the third party and if you wish to solve this problem - you need to let M2 *realise* - not just by saying - one thing: Many a times, friendship last longer than a relationship. If he wanna give up a proper friendship because he couldn't accept a rejection for F1 - then he would have lost more than he started with - a friendship. You need to convince him that and once he got hold of that thinking, plan a day when communication can take place between F1 and M2. The topic must involve him stating *strongly* that he rather be a good friend with her because the problem is that M2 is making things difficult and F1 cannot pei he. Since he started it - he must end it. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>Forget about asking M1 to assist during this period. This is between the both of them F1 and M2 - asking a third party who is indirectly related to this situation will make matter worst.<br><br>Possible Complication Foresee: Never ask F2 to go for M2 at this period of time. M2 would likely to make her substitute if he accepted her. XLN, just tell him this phrase: 'When one door of happiness closes, another one opens; but we often look so long at the close door that we failed to see the one that has been opened for us.' anything else that comes in the future, let nature takes it course. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>Warning signs: M2 must not act strangely when F1 is around - instead he must learn to react normally like he would. If he needed time to cool down - this time taken he must Bu kan (zero view), bu ting (none of her voice), no jiang (zero speech). In short if he needed the break to crack open his confused mind, he shouldn't see her, shouldn't speak on the phone, shouldn't use irc/icq speak to her, etc for a period of time until when he feels that what he is doing is being silly - then he should get back to normal, followed  by the communication plan to be taken from the above. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Originally posted by Yunhaier:<br><strong><br><br>Firstly, all of them are friends for many years already - this is a critical point to this case. F1 and M1 were ex before, for some reasons, they went separate ways. M2 falls in love with F1 and with M1 help...<br><br><span style="color: green;"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> yah..</span><br>The reason why M1 is doing that is because since its his ex and his good friend like her - as not to appear selfish and possessive and lame, he assisted - but who really knows what is going on behind the picture? I am *not* saying that he backstab M2, rather this assistance you people so *sure* it is helpful?<br><br>[b]<span style="color: darkblue;"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> actualy this M1 is v helpful guy...and he is also like flirting around sometimes..treats girls v nice...this F1 his ex used to be quite plumb...when they r together ...(and i wondered if its the reason y they broke as alot of friends was pointin and saying they r nt compatible and ppl sees M1 is only using F1 for her homework, studies and knowledge when we were in sch last time...i do suspect so due to M1 broke up with F1 after exams..)and they become friends back because of me keep asking them out etc.<br><br>After 1 yr plus...this F1 slim down alot...and look v pretty now...then last few months M1 then dated F1 out for movies...and most of the times with M2 together.. (i guess this is how M2 start to fall for F1)...Actualy i thought M1 wanted to be with F1 back but i was wrong when i know that its actualy M2 who wants to be with F1. but sometimes from the way i see...F1, i feel the one she like is still M1... (It might be becos of M1 she lost so much weight...she don like exercise....she dn eat...oni eat a meal a day..)...</span></strong><br><br>- Many a times when it comes to chasing a woman, friends that intervene often creates hinder than help.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Yesh...it does hinder...when M1 is around..can see that M2 don realy dare to action..and M2 did suspect F1 still  like M1 and keep trying to test water like testing if she stil likes M1..this aso can see how M2's little confidence...<br><br>Think about this: If you - XLN - were told by your ex that your Ex's good friend likes you. 97.35% you wouldn't have even thought of that idea of being together with his good friend, because your ex spoke to you not him. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> yah.....nv thought of tis...<br><br>*PLUS*: IMAGINE going out with her present bf and ex together... now thats suck. F1 rejected M2 on the basis on this point. Furthermore, think about this - if she has feeling for M2, she would have gone with him instead of M1 *OR* they would be together long ago and not wait until now.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> mostly the 3 of them go out together...<br><br>XLN, you being the third party and if you wish to solve this problem - you need to let M2 *realise* - not just by saying - one thing: Many a times, friendship last longer than a relationship. If he wanna give up a proper friendship because he couldn't accept a rejection for F1 - then he would have lost more than he started with - a friendship. You need to convince him that and once he got hold of that thinking, plan a day when communication can take place between F1 and M2.<br><br><span style="color: olive;"><strong><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> i told him many times...friendship is longer than relationship...time will heel....bt he still v sad...n refuse to listen to me...sayin he canot do it.........</strong></span><br><br>The topic must involve him stating *strongly* that he rather be a good friend with her because the problem is that M2 is making things difficult and F1 cannot pei he. Since he started it - he must end it. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>Forget about asking M1 to assist during this period. This is between the both of them F1 and M2 - asking a third party who is indirectly related to this situation will make matter worst.<br><br><strong><span style="color: darkblue;"><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> i agree that M1 is a big hinder....but i find that M1 has a way to make F1 say more to him.....than what F1 told me.....he has a way with girls...i was thinkin if M1 really wan F1 to be with him again....M2 will be greatly hurt...as I sense that F1 still likes M1....</span></strong><br><br>Possible Complication Foresee: Never ask F2 to go for M2 at this period of time. M2 would likely to make her substitute if he accepted her. XLN, just tell him this phrase: 'When one door of happiness closes, another one opens; but we often look so long at the close door that we failed to see the one that has been opened for us.' anything else that comes in the future, let nature takes it course. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> i tink M2 wont go for F2 as substitute...as he oni likes F1 ...i did told him that in a jungle,, there r many trees....<br><br>Warning signs: M2 must not act strangely when F1 is around - instead he must learn to react normally like he would. If he needed time to cool down - this time taken he must Bu kan (zero view), bu ting (none of her voice), no jiang (zero speech). In short if he needed the break to crack open his confused mind, he shouldn't see her, shouldn't speak on the phone, shouldn't use irc/icq speak to her, etc for a period of time until when he feels that what he is doing is being silly - then he should get back to normal, followed  by the communication plan to be taken from the above. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> M2 very weird....he totally ignore F1 ....after she reject him.....i dono leh....issit really v hard to face her....i think he jus canot take it lor...haiz.....then he these few days torturing himself...dn wana eat...jus keep himself in room....i scolded him lor...say wats the use...haiz. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>Cheers[/b][/quote]<br><br>Wow rely thanks alot for your reply.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br></div>
