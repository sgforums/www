            <div class='col-md body'>i stopped trading since August, when my savings had been exhausted. I just started rebuilding my savings with my september salary onwards. But i feel guilty because my parents don't know how i squandered my money.  I feel that they are disappointed that  i haven't been judicious in spending my money.<br><br>And i used to be so careful with money till i started this addiction in March of this year. In fact the first 2 months i made small profits because i was careful in my investments. but then when the losses piled up, i started behaving like a gambler, raising my stakes and losing more.<br><br>The fact that i behaved so recklessly is shocking to me too. None of my friends also know about my addiction. I am afraid to confide in anyone about this for fear of ridicule, hece my opening up here.<br>I fell terrible. i feel guilty. i feel like a fool and i feel like a loser.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dont u know how to invest? Dont u know that its important to cut yr loses quick. Dont u know that playing with mkt trends is like playing with fire. Once the timing is wrong boom. Dont u know that u need up to check up on the accounts of the company u invest. Go for long term gains not short term which are volatile to the market trend. Please curb yr greed and be more discipline.<br><br>Now instead of whining why dont u pull yrself together, rebuild yr finance and earn enough $$ to buy Yr PARENTS A EVEN BETTER PROPERTY.</div>

There are many who have trodded the same path and fallen below.<br><br>You are a newbie trader who made mistakes and got fried.

Regarding psychological damage, yeah it will take time to heal. Just realize that it's not the end of the world. It's really not.<br><br>If your parents keep asking....hmm, maybe you can just tell them what happened. Up to you, maybe it depends on the situation.<br><br>Dont worry about it, it's only money.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi crazyarrow,<br><br>I think the best thing you can do right now is to be straight with your parents. Make an appointment with them to have a heart-to-heart talk with them regards to your financial situation.<br><br>I won't lie to you; they would definitely be disappointed in you. But eventually I'm sure they'll empathise and try to work something out with you.<br><br>In the meantime, take all measures to ensure that you don't lose any more money recklessly. Develop a sound financial plan to build up your assets and wipe out your liabilities.<br><br>Good luck.<br><br></div>
