            <div class='col-md body'>You may have disagreements now, but there may be a point in your life later when you feel your time with her is limited..  so if there's anything you can do to improve the relationship, now's a good time to start.  I can't stress more on this  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>For me, my dispute with my mum got so bad that I moved out with my then-boyfriend (now my fiance).  Only recently, when my mom found 2 lumps in different parts of her breast, did I realise how silly it was to hold on to all those quarrels .. it wasn't just a problem with her... it was also me.  All I needed to do was open up.  I was VERY nervous when I moved back with her, fearing a reprise of the past.. but all she had to say was, "Welcome home." and that 5-year old barrier just dissolved.<br><br>Try taking more initiative to communicate / bond with your mom, eg :<br><br>-  update her about small events of your life without her prompting..<br>-  ask HER more frequently about what's she's up to/ her current interests, just sit n listen if and when you have the time..<br>-  make small gestures like offering to buy food home for her.<br>-  If you don't have the time, try to end the conversation on a positive note..<br>-  if she nags, just brush it off laughingly and try to gear the conversation towards any of the above points.<br><br>Force yourself to view the situation from a different angle.  Dun see it as she's wasting your time / trying to make life hard for u / all her fault or it will show in your body language.. when mums feel like you care, they will trust you more.. and tend to nag less <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>If you're wondering why she's like that, it's most likely because she is still struggling to accept the changes in you starting from your teen years..   It's quite a common thing.    If U keep avoiding/ignoring/being unpleasant with mum, things will really snowball.  So guide her along patiently, help her to help you.<br><br>Best of luk 2u &amp; ur mum    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

What happens when you're 40 and she's still nagging ?<br><br>Many ppl I know (myself included) are all grown up, have children of their own and some are even grandpa and grandmum already...and guess what !...their mum (or sometimes dad) are still nagging at them.<br><br>I must be lying if I said that I liked it before but now that my mum is in her twilight years (but still nagging), whatever she said is listened to and replied with respect. The seniors won't be around forever so make peace with yourself first and love thy parents.<br><br>Heard from a young friend who recently lost her mum that the naggings she got before is the thing that she'll miss the most...and how she wished she could be nagged at by her mum again.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>because u are Not even 21 yet, which is the official age for a adult, that's why ur mum is not treating u like a adult.<br><br>Lame joke aside, look at it this way. Most mums are like that. Their children are growing b4 their very eyes, but somehow, all they see is that 6 year old kid in them. It will NEVER change. Ur mum loves u a lot, that's why she do all that. But whether it is right or not, who is to say? u cannot blame the maternal instinct in them.<br><br>All u can do is talk to her, make her realise u are already 20, and that u can take gd care of yourself, and that u will make the right choices in life. Do not only talk, but u must prove it with actions. For example, if u say u will reach home a certain time, make sure u do not exceed that time. And call/sms someone in the family if u are late. Let them know ur whereabouts.<br><br>It is not a problem at all actually. It is just part and parcel of having a mother who loves and cares for u. U will probably miss ur mother nagging when u go NS, because ur sergeants won't be nagging u, but instead f**king u upside down. Do spare a thought for her feelings, and eventually, she will let go of u gradually.</div>
