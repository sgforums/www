No one is good or bad for the person he/she likes, just not mean to be.<br>Don't force yourself to hard to recover. In the process of recovering, take this opportunity to discover yourself, know more about your feelings and ways to handle them. Just as most ppl here suggested join activities to broaden your horizons n perspectives in life etc.<br>And when you found the someone whom I mentioned earlier on, it will be sweeter than you thought.</div>

When those thoughts creep unexpectedly, tell yourself at least you confess to the person whom u like, there's nothing embarrassing if you do it in a matured and sensible way. girls usually do appreciate guys who do that and take their rejects in stride.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>ur mind says 'get over it son', but ur heart needs time to get over and proceed from there.<br>at least good to hear from you tt suicide is plain foolish...u r nt kenny frm south park.<br></div>
