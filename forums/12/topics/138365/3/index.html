ARELIUS ANUS ? or MIKEY' hahaha..  soz about the religious thingy.. i cant help it.. i just cant help it!After reading all the post.. i may as well decide that anyone that is like Jesus is the REAL nice guy.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  So how about girls ? are we guys all @$$holes pretending to be nice guys ?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

We all have different perception to what is good what is bad. What is nice to you may not be nice to others. To continue on this discussion i may just be contradicting myself..   sometimes being nice just cant cut it. BEcause u are NICE.. u get used by those evil conniving girls. They know u are nice..therefore u are supcectable to constant hurt or being pushed around.

Nice is subjective.<br>But those pretenders, or people-call-them-nice-guys, or nice-guys-wannabes are definitely @sshole.<br>So, what is nice, and what is not?<br><br>Does nice speak?<br>Do nice guys need to SHOW nice to people?<br><br>The theory of nice is simple.<br>For example, a guy, who saw there is a nail on the floor, and he feel that this nail will harm, he pick it up, and throw it to the bin, nobody see, not show to anyone, nobody in this world knows about it, he is a nice guy.<br><br><span style="color: red;">But, a guy, who gave seat to the old, where actually he just wanted to show people, to show his friends, he is a nice guy, obviously this is an @sshole. A big @sshole.</span><br><br>A nice-guy-wannabe, the more you want to show to people you are "NICE", with statements like "I am a nice guy", well, you sux, you should go to lick the monkey @ss. Because people will feel that you are very very disgusting, donÂ’t even mention about the one you love. Now you know why she feel you sux? Because you really sux.<br><br>The conclusion is not 1 nice guy kill a girl, then all nice guys = @sshole, at least this is a very very very (X 1000 very) GOOD example.<br><br>So, girls, those nice-guys-wannabes, or people-said-they-are-nice-guys, or he-said-he-is-nice-guy, you should be more alert, nice won't speak, nor show.<br><br>Nice is from heart.<br></div></blockquote>i think this is an act of courtesy and social responsibility. not wanting to show how good u r. for this i beg to differ on ur so-called theory.<br>and while some nice-guy-wannabes are spoiling the name, they r only minority of the population. you r being subjective and shouldnt draw conclusion so easily.<br>think about it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>YOU ARE THE HYPOCRITE! e.g. offering your seats = an act to make yourself a nice guy. Only one who acts, or one without kindness will thinks this way. Most people offer seats because they just pitied a person, and offered the seats with respect. You are narrow minded. And im sure in your life you won't go far. *Nobody knows you here. You can voice whatever you want without being afraid to be sued or bashed. But one thing to remember. What you post implies what you think. And you better make some reflections upon yourself. Take people's advice*</div>
