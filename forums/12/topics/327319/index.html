              <p>Then what is it you want to see ?</p>
              <p>A cage surrounding her with spikes ?</p>
              <p>C'mon lah. It's not like she lets the guys grope her boobs.</p>
              <p>Besides.. she's not even attached.</p>
              <p>Are you jealous because you don't get to put your hands on her waist.. while some other guys are able to do it ?</p>
              <p>If it's just out of some clean fun and posing for the camera.. what's the big deal.</p>
              <p>Unless she is already your gf. then you should be alarmed.</p>
              <p>Right now.. you should focus on working your part of the deal.</p>

              <p>You dont have a name to her yet, and her waist give other guys grab, is also quite common? As she didnt make a choice yet. If she's your GF, u can have something to say, but sadly to say, you are not.</p>
              <p>From what you said, she's quite OPEN and FRIENDLY i guess? Dont be too alarm if she do something similar even after acknolwdge you as her bf. As you said she's have many ex.flings.</p>
              <p>Girls that are like this, hard to stay "decent" actions to guys (: but they mean no harm, maybe is their way of thinking or playing? =)</p>

              <p>ok ill just rughly sum up abt me and dis girl</p>
              <p>we go out often and behave like couple, she told me that she is open and has many exflings but wans to get into a serious relationship nw, she told me that im special to her or whatever shit.</p>
              <p>but on nat day, she went out with her friends to celebrate birthday for her friend, my guess is that many guys tried to hit on her that night through how she described to me the session.</p>
              <p>in some pictures, she was pretty close with this guy, close as in hands around waist? i mean, i dont know what she calls me, her bf or whatever. but i find it offensive how come he has his arms around her waist?! come on, shoulder is okay but this?</p>
              <p>then i asked her show me some other pics of the night, she dont want saying its too wild.</p>

              <p>i guess you're feeling confuse because you are not sure what you want?</p>
              <p>and then along comes this girl who tells you you are special but is "friendly" and open to conquest.</p>
              <p>Let me guess, you seldom chase after other girls?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Perhaps it might be a good thing to quiet down your mind and ask yourself what you truly want. There might be issues of insecurity that one may sometimes overlook and needs to be address before one can move on to settle down in a stable relationship. And tell yourself that it is ok to admire someone and not have your affections return. However a true relationship of course needs to be 2-way in order to be carried on as a true relationship.</p>
              <p>And any relationship BASED on jealousy and insecurity is a sure recipe for disaster in future. If you cannot afford to get close to a girl whom you are not sure you are capable of loving and who cannot give you the security you need, I say curtail it and save yourself all that pointless agony. However, if you are sure that she is the girl for you, I say go all out for her regardless of the outcome.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Before that however, know what you truly want and do not want. There is a price to pay for everything.</p>

              <p>Pardon me... in view of your thread title "Getting played?"...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>are you trying to play around too?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As I've said, the only way out of this predicament is to be very sure of what you DO want and what you do NOT want. If there are behaviour which you would despise yourself in others, make sure you do not repeat them in your very own actions to those girls too.</p>
              <p>Perhaps you may want to try date around, as in casual dating or meet-up with other girls instead of focussing on this girl who told you "im special to her". You may realize that there are more girls who are more special to you than her than you might have realized.</p>
              <p>Once you've brushed up your social etiquette with girls by mixing around more, you may then start to truly prepped yourself for "The One". Perhaps the time has yet to come.</p>
