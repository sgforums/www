You seems to keep wanting her to do things your way. Have you seriously ask yourself why do you like her or not?<br><br>Maybe is hard to see from your view point, lets change to her view point then.<br><br>Imagine you are a jc girl. You wish to study well for exams and you cannot study in a group. When you are hard studying at home this guy keep smsing asking you out on a date. You do not like or love this guy so you ask yourself why borther ? I just reject him.<br><br>I know and understand to chase a girl is tough but if the girl refused to go out in groups with you what do you think she will go out with you alone?</div>

I know and understand that you do not look good. The only way to handle the problem is to study hard, get good grades and get a good job. This will help you gain an edge over the other good looking.<br><br>Girls peak beauty usually last from 14 to 26 then they start to lose their edge.<br>For us guys, 26 is the start for us. We become more and more stable with our life and this will help us get an edge over others.<br><br></div>
