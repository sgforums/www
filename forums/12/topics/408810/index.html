              <p>My dad has retired. He does not have high education and is not computer literate. Worse, he does not have any hobbies etc. During weekends, he will just go to the supermarkets to walk around or sit at home. And he doesn't like to watch TV. </p>
              <p>I am seriously desperate to know what I can suggest for him to do. I've tried to teach him how to use the computer but he isn't so interested. </p>
              <p>Him being so bored makes me feel kinda irritated at times because he would just come to my room and stare at me while I am doing my work. </p>
              <p>I can chat with him but I can't do it all the time. I need him to be busy with SOMETHING that he likes.</p>
              <p>Hope some of you can suggest to me what your parents do at their free time so that I can tell my dad to do the same. Thanks ppl.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Get him enrolled on compuer literacy programmes lor. There are lots of these type of programmes conducted by C.C.s. This is good also as he will get to know other senior citizens/retirees. Then your when your dad learns how to surf the net, he can learn to get busy watching porn......

              <p>I believe slowly he will find what he likes to do. Maybe he will do something part time , or pickup a hobby.</p>
              <p>I think meanwhile you can suggest a sport for him, such as, jogging, swimming.</p>
              <p>It is also good to suggest books / reading. Visit library and borrow some books.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I also have a father who is retired and has nothing to do at home.. But he managed to find peers of similar age as him to lim kopi and go cycling with.. He also goes to the library everyday... He even picked up rollerblading (i know looks kinda funny seeing a middle aged man rollerblading at ecp)... I guess its the mindset not the age that matters.. perhaps you can suggest that he visit the nearby CC for some starter activities 1st?</p></div>
