No. did not watch <a>.<br><br>I understand that she ever seen a doc..tho i duno when.  Only found out from her that the doc is no longer around (  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  ) which means she dun see a doc now ba.  I know she got appointments at NUH also, but i think it's more of a female problem and not some psychiatric ward.  I will try to persuade her to go NUH psychiatric ward.<br><br>Checked up the BPO, but there are not many info online...hmm..<br>"Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a serious mental illness characterized by pervasive instability in moods, interpersonal relationships, self-image, and behavior."<br><br>She minds a lot about her image, always try to be pretty dressed up, she is also a very organised person, her room is always tidy, not a single thing laying around. She dun throw tantrum like that, in fact she is easy going and very forgiving..but if it's big quarrels, she might really take days to cool down.  I know her relationships are not very stable.  She said it's due to the first r/s she had..she always try to make her bf think she she dun love him, a little bit of imperfection will turn her off and she will want a break up and won't regret.  Perhaps that is one of the characteristics of Pisecs...she also feels that she will never settle down.<br><br>I dun meet her often, not to mention do things together and make her happy.  Just like yesterday, she asked to meet me on wed and then minutes later, she said won't meet me liao.  Even if I go to the shopping Mall near her home, she would also be reluctant to meet me.  It's very hard to get her out of her home.  I asked whether she could stop her driving lessons for the time being, she said she enjoy driving, and she tend to speed..I dun want any accident to happen lor..<br><br>How should I persuade her?  Her mum also asked her to see a doc.  But she dun heed.  What can we do?  </a></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>a person under depression normally has totally lost any hope or confidence, so it's much harder to get them to listen or see your care. From my own experience, i can only suggest to spend more time with her, try to boost her confidence/morale, and get her to see a doctor asap. Proper medication really helps greatly, but of course the best help is still friends and family. Give in to her if possible, so that she won't feel anymore negative than she already is.</div>

I don't know your friend, so i can't judge how her respond would be, but when my friends made their care too obvious the last time, i didn't exactly give a very good respond, coz definitely will have the thinking like "why suddenly so nice? what motives are there?"<br><br>Maybe try to just ask her out as often as you do normally, to places that she usually love going to  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
