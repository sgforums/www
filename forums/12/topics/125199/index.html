Terrible.<br><br>She said the reason she told me is to make me mentally prepared if one day anything happens to her and we will know why.  So i said why wait till that day?  Prevent it from happening!  What if I know that I have a risk of getting cancer and yet I do nothing about it?  Until it's at the terminal stage then I tell her that I'm going to die meh?<br><br>She is more stubborn than me.  But knowing that she got depression, I can't be harsh to her.  Haiz. </span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well.. like they said.. It's hard for ppl with depression to come to terms with their own ''illness''.<br><br>Probably let her do stuffs she enjoys doing like singing shopping playing games etc.<br><br>Another thing is i am afraid she may turn to think that u are also looking @ her like she's a crazy person and turn away from you  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  so u may not want to keep urging her to see a doc.<br><br>Maybe can find out the cause/root? or... maybe her parents can help? But different methods have different kinds of response from different ppl.<br><br>Well.. just my point of view :]</div>

Forget abt the doc first and do things u both enjoy doing <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> It can be anything. @.@ got pros n cons for your response lar huh.. maybe she will sink into deeper depression coz even her close fren also gone.. maybe she will kinda 'awaken' knowing how depressing/worried u are for her..<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
