Since last time what you did was a mistake.. Don't do it again!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Though is a painful experience.. but don't you think you attended the most precious lesson in your life??  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Always think positive.. Even when you are looking back to the past.. Be it somethin that upset you alot or some painful moments.. Smile whenever it flashes in your mind again..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Past is past.. What has happened cannot be undone.. Learn to accept the fact and move on.. You can't change the reality neither can you prevent it the last time.. It was jus a wrong move that you have made.. and is not something which you can turn back! It's still not late.. right?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>So now you have to chose your own path.. make sure is right.. Having high expectations doesn't mean no good..<br><br>Most importantly.. you must build up your self-confidence and motivation.. Don't let the past bothers you.. Or leave a bad image.. This is jus part of your life.. Many people out there have worse experiences than you.. But arent they still living happily??  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>All these are only perceptions... Happy or not.. YOu still need to go with your life.. Why make yourself living in misery rather than happy person?? Happiness is what you need to seek for.. You also hope that everyone around get their happiness.. If everyone oso look gloomy.. depressed or other negative signs.. Issit this world so unlively, dull and motionless?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheer up my dear friend..
