Mine is abit different in the sense... my frd n i used to be really close. Then i really have no idea wad happened. After she came back from some kind of events, i got totally ignored like that. I mean i really dun get it, like she was totally changed after the whole event.<br><br>It happened 4 times, and every time i have to bear with everything... n everytime i have to go back and get things right. Then all i can see is she getting close to everyone else except me. Spoke with her and both of us wanted the friendship back.. but she said she wanted things to go slow... i have no idea wad she meant.. but it's just so HARD...</div>

Neither of you are courting each other. Maybe she meant to <strong>go easy</strong> on her by being <strong>less demanding</strong> in her personal space.. Just guessing. It's nice to stay away from her for a short while. The absence will help you to re-adjust yourself to her new attitude. She's your close friend, not your sister, not your gf, not your wife.</div>
