Somebody will know something and words will get around.<br><br>If your girlfriend has been 'brainwashed' as claimed by you, it's not the fault of this forum, other than individual's integrity being questioned. This has nothing do with being a moderator or not because that's simply a position given to him to take care of the forum.<br><br>Whether he's a good person or not - to each his own. Replied to Kitty before; nobody can make anybody like anybody. Everybody is entitled to his/her own opinion and I respect that.<br><br>I can tell you blatantly that this phenomenon has been going behind the scene for gawd knows when. I can safety say that there are also some non-moderator going around AA, looking for troubled ladies and ending up in relationship with them. They too offer to dispense advice and stuff - you know those kind of things? Although, they are quiet and lurking around - I know it. And it's not like something people must tell me, but obvious when people drop PM to me about their BGR issues and I can piece a tale together with different people's PM/story.<br><br>There are times when I just wanted to post a topic to bash them - but at the end of the day, who is yunhaier? What can yunhaier do to alter karma? (Uranus-influenced). Nothing.<br><br>Therefore, is it just because a moderator is a moderate and therefore subjected to the axe while the non-moderators can hide quietly in one corner?<br><br>I won't defend anybody here because at the end of the day, everyone is accountable for their own action.<br><br>For people seeking private PMs from specific people - you are finding them (moderators/non-moderators alike) at your own risk. You find them because you trust them and of course, when you put trust at the wrong hands, you end up suffering more. That's the decision you make my dear - you cannot always have someone policing here and making sure that everything is good and holy - this is a gawd damn forum and everyone is using a pseudonym to receive and dispense advice. At best we try to keep things in order, but nothing is perfect.<br><br>You can have TankKH80, being a counsellor, and ending up having a relationship with his client - my goodness, what else cannot happen? But is it the fault of the 'position' given to him or is it the fault of the organization he is serving?<br><br>It's personal integrity, my dear friend.<br><br>P.S: As regards to your relationship: when your house is made of bricks and the wind blows - one often agrees that the house is strong and not that the wind is weak. When the same wind blows at the straw house, one often agrees that the wind is strong and not the house is weak.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>
