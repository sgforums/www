I think she is tring to make a statement. Voice out her views and bring some doubt into our heads on how a moderator should be like in AA , what a moderator is about , who is to give advice and what not. The very intergrity of AA forum itself. Question the foundation of it and so on.<br><br>Advices given here by people are those that vary. Of course u must have ur own wisdom to determine which is the best one. N its no harm in seeing the views of others and what they have to say. Some are b.s some are genuine, some comes from thier perspective and experience on it and some are there to give u the hard realities of it.If not, why would u be posting in here anyways but to seek certain advice?clarification? A good friend that u consult to and gives u advice does he/she need a cert to prove that his advice are sound?Its who u seek those advice from that really matters.<br><br>And moderators with pursue of power in here and so on. Personally dont care of any moderator powers or not.If some moderators are doing an @ss job, its his problem. He will be found out eventually , replaced. In here i am nothing. But i know in real life, i am in a position of power in my office and i get to smack ppl around.<br><br></div>
