I've read through the linked thread and it's, um, interesting.<br><br>Speaking not only as a practicing psychologist but as someone who's worked with abused children for years, I'll come at this from a practicioner's perspective.<br><br>I agree with kitty that textbook answers don't really offer much help.  However, generalising from personal experiences is precipitous as well, and if the person you're trying to help thinks you're being ignorant, you'll be shoved well behind square one.<br><br>The fact is that the motivation for self-harm varies on a case-by-case basis.  Yes, some people are just drama queens, and in such cases an REBT approach, such as kitty's SIA girl example, might work.  On the other hand, REBT, when used in the wrong situation, can lead to things going pear-shaped very rapidly.  For that matter, any approach used in the wrong context will produce detrimental results.<br><br>This leads to the point that, as a rule, any competent practicioner would know to perform some proper fact-finding before attempting to generate solutions.  Self-harm (or any observed behaviour) is only the symptom, not the problem itself.  Fix one symptom and another will pop up to take its place.<br><br>The underlying problem also dictates how effective the solution is.  The DSM-IV (the diagnostic bible) lists self-harm as a diagnostic criteria for Borderline Personality Disorder.  A BPD person would be highly unlikely to have any interest in being a flying waitress for SIA, or any other airline for that matter.<br><br>The bottom line is that what's good for the goose is not always good for the gander, and jumping off the mark to close one door isn't going to do any good if the rest of the building's on fire.  You always need to make a point to find out what's going on before offering solutions - doing so too early is just a waste of time.<br><br>Anyway, for what it's worth (about a hundred bucks by the reckoning of the APS), that's a professional's take on this debate.</div></blockquote>BTW, post back into the actual thread can you.<br><br>This thread is still a question of whether the moderators here has certification to back up their advises and are they infalliable.<br><br>$100 to date a professional and devil.  I can afford it.</div>
