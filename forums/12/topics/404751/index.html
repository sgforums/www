              <p>I am currently undertaking part-time studies and would like to approach this guy in my audit class.</p>
              <p>First Lesson: When class was over, I was asking the lecturer about some important notes and this guy stopped right ahead of me to listen to our conversation. After leaving, I head towards the toilets for a while and later took a lift down the school and while walking out, I turned my head to my left and saw this guy smiling subtly at me but I shifted my head towards the gates instead very quickly, walked out and thought nothing of it.</p>
              <p>Second Lesson: I was release from work and came to class and I coincidentally made eye contact with the same guy, probably I was smiling and he too, was smiling softly at me. I wanted to choose a seat next to him but his head was lowering slightly and I couldn't read any hints from him so I decided to take a seat far right in front of him instead.</p>
              <p>Now, I am a very shy person and I am probably slightly older than him (i'm in my early 20's). I don't have many friends or a relationship so I would like to make some real life friends instead of virtual reality ones.</p>
              <p>Anyways, lessons starts and ends quickly so it's pretty difficult to get accquainted. And there is only a short few minutes break.</p>
              <p>I'm afraid of scaring him or coming across as awkward.</p>
              <p>I want that both of us would be mutual enough to hold a friendship.</p>
              <p>And wondering what is the best appraoch?</p>

              <p>I think it is better to concentrate on your studies.</p>
              <p>For relationship, it takes 2 hand to clap.</p>
              <p>So my humble advise is try to be natural and dont feel awkard.</p>
              <p>Try finding time to talk to him about subjects you not sure.</p>
              <p>There is a few min break right, maybe you can just walk over to him and have a small talk. I find it nothing wrong with this.</p>
              <p>Take a small step at a time and I am sure he will feel the same way as you do.</p>
              <p>Good luck to you.</p>

              <p>Halo? Why don't you go in front of him and introduce yourself. Start a conversation from somewhere. If he doesn't respond positively then is his lost. Or perhaps he may later start a chat with you once you both are acquainted. Please don't resort to tricks, guys don't like this type of thing.</p>

              <p>I think it is better to concentrate on your studies.</p>
              <p>For relationship, it takes 2 hand to clap.</p>
              <p>So my humble advise is try to be natural and dont feel awkard.</p>
              <p>Try finding time to talk to him about subjects you not sure.</p>
              <p>There is a few min break right, maybe you can just walk over to him and have a small talk. I find it nothing wrong with this.</p>
              <p>Take a small step at a time and I am sure he will feel the same way as you do.</p>
              <p>Good luck to you.</p>

              <p>I think you should just go talk to him without the intention of "finding a bf". Though u might think its awkward from your point of view, when looking at it from a 3rd party there is certainly nothing wrong at all with a girl starting a convo with a guy from her class.</p>
              <p>The next lesson, just sit next to him, and say "hey wassup whats ur name!!!"</p>
