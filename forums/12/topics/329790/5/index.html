              <p>The main problem is that you can't judge every relationship by putting them on one equal grand scale, measuring them as if they are made from the same shit because there is still the component of time.</p>
              <p>I knew my first love when I was fourteen - the most amazing person I ever knew. Many people came later - but did that mean that my first love was still as amazing? Or has that feeling taken a backseat?</p>
              <p>What's critical is that at that moment in time... in that distant past... that developmental stage... that particular cosmic lesson... everything was real as it could possibly be. However, as time passed by, certain variables are altered, thus things changed. But does that mean that my first love is any 'lesser' than the ones that I have adopted later on in life? Or are later relationships any 'truer' than the one I began with?</p>

              <p>Wtf is true? Can one True Love be any 'Trurer' than another? Or can it only be ONE True Love?</p>
              <p>People should phucking wake up one day to the fact that their Love is true until the day they are proven false. That should only be the reality that must consider and believe in. Why should any good relationship be labelled as 'untrue' just because you reckon that something is amiss? And yet you know not of this 'something'? I can have someone who is married to a good wife, yet feeling dissatisfied just because he is missing the 'soul mate' feeling.</p>
              <p>Totally wtf.</p>
              <p>Most of the time, the concept of True Love is but a facade for the operation of karmic relationship. 'Blindness' and 'selective perception' are common 'symptom'.</p>
              <p>The entity of a relationship leading to fulfillment is achieved through the blessing of both nature and nurture aspects of Love. True Love is not granted by the stars, neither can hardwork alone succeed in constructing the most beautiful relationship - both are equally important.</p>

              <p><br>True love is a pure (without hate, untained) and sincere (loyal) attitude that an individual GIVES / PROVIDES for another individual. It is an undying, motivating, understanding, protection of well-being emotions that an individual SHARE / FEEL unconditionally for another individual.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately true love might become one-sided love if the receiving individual does not or were unable to return the intentions in a love that is close or equivalent to the received love.</p>
              <p>Nevertheless, only people who understands the meaning of true love will be able to provide true love for all their loved ones and future loved ones.</p>
              <p>So to be able to find another person who also shares the same/similar conviction of true love and is returning their true love back to you is truly divine and astronomical.</p>
              <p>Everyone has fears of being ridiculed or getting rejected if they tries to seek out their true love in another individual by expressing their true love to that appealing individual first. Thus everyone ended up adopting a passive approach in their future relationships.</p>
              <p>No doubt the path of seeking each and everyone's true love will be different, some will be lucky to find their true love around them and some will be disappointed, despaired, depressed with their unsuccessful tries at seeking their own true love...especially when they have given it their all to the other individual.</p>
              <p>I would like to take this opportunity to encourage all who seeks true love in their lives not to feel disappointed, depressed or despaired. As true love is an act of giving, serving, feeling towards another individual, every unsuccessful attempt, rejection, humiliation experienced doesn't degrade an individual's ability and capability to provide true love. And neither does it increases the failure rate to prevent the individual from finding their true love with the next individual. It actually grows the space in their heart which resides their true love.</p>
              <p>The individual may not have noticed, but the individual's ability to provide true love has grown to allow them to provide a more refined true love for their next individual. </p>
              <p>True love does not comes to you unless you can understand and provide true love to another. Cos only people who understands the meaning of true love will be able to recognise they themselves are receiving true love from another individual, and there will no longer be any doubts about their feelings for each other anymore. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
