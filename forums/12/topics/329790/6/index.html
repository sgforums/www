              <p>Then I'm afraid that true love is stupid. People cannot be trusted to do the right thing all the time, and they always let one another down. Throwing yourself and your resources at a such a flawed being in a bid to manipulate them is just insane.</p>
              <p>What do you get in return? You only keep the chemical reaction inside your head going, fuelling the illusion. You do "nice" things for each other just to keep your own feel-good factor up and win the other person's approval. Otherwise, you're nothing more than two people benefitting each other for your own personal gain - until the day one or both of you fail.</p>
              <p>That is why people can be "loving partners" and "doting parents" to their loved ones, and yet switch off their conscience or become cutthroat towards other people, or do what is wrong or stupid (crime or being an antisocial nuisance) to impress or provide for their loved ones. That is why they accept only a few people the way they are.</p>
              <p>Meeting your "true love" is no more of a coincidence than meeting 20,000 other fans of your favourite team at the stadium or having a bird crap on your favourite outfit. And you have only found someone whom you need less work to get approval from.</p>
              <p>This is what "love" really is - a cycle of mutual manipulation. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>

              <p><br>True love is a pure (without hate, untained) and sincereÂ (loyal) attitude that an individual GIVES / PROVIDES for another individual. It is an undying, motivating, understanding, protection of well-being emotions that an individualÂ SHARE /Â FEELÂ unconditionallyÂ for another individual.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately true love might become one-sided love if the receiving individual does not or were unable to return the intentions in a love that is close orÂ equivalent to the received love.</p>
              <p>Nevertheless, only people who understands the meaning of true love will be able to provide true love for all their loved ones and future loved ones.</p>
              <p>So to be able to find another person who also shares the same/similar conviction of true love and is returning their true love back to you is truly divine and astronomical.</p>
              <p>EveryoneÂ has fears of being ridiculedÂ or getting rejected if they tries to seek out their true love in another individual by expressing their true love to that appealing individual first. Thus everyone ended up adopting a passive approach in their future relationships.</p>
              <p>No doubt the path of seeking each and everyone's true love will be different, some will be lucky to find their true love around them and some will be disappointed, despaired, depressed with their unsuccessful tries at seeking their own true love...especially when they have given it their all to the other individual.</p>
              <p>I would like to take this opportunity to encourage all who seeks true love in their lives not to feel disappointed, depressed or despaired. As true love is an act of giving, serving, feeling towards another individual, every unsuccessful attempt, rejection, humiliation experienced doesn'tÂ degrade an individual's ability and capability to provide true love. And neither does it increases the failure rateÂ to prevent the individual from finding their true love with the next individual. It actuallyÂ grows theÂ space in their heart which residesÂ their true love.</p>
              <p>The individualÂ may not have noticed, but the individual's ability to provide true love has grown to allow them toÂ provide a more refined true loveÂ for their next individual.Â </p>
              <p>True love does not comes to you unless you can understand and provide true love to another. Cos only people who understands the meaning of true love will be able to recognise they themselves are receiving true love from another individual, and there will no longer be any doubts about their feelings for each other anymore. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
