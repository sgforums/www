When you don't know the details, don't infuse your own experience with the thread starter's and start pushing all the fault to the other party who has no chance to rebutt whatever the thread starter says.

            <div class='col-md body'>I didn't exactly go thru all 7 pages of this thread, but I did go thru a bit here and there....<br><br>Believe it not, there CAN be a normal relationship between man and woman, even if they were ex. At least it worked for me. Personally, I have a few ex who are very close friends with me now. When ever they have a prob is their current r/s they will always come and look for me for advices/company. I'll be frank here, I even had a married fren who come over to stay at my place once. It's just a matter of trust.<br><br>Be forewarned though.... Trust is a very vague subject. How much trust to have? Too much and the other party will take advantage of it most of the time. Too little  will result in conflicts and jealousy.<br><br>Even though ur gf still meet up with her ex even though she complained to u that he's a loser, she might just be testing ur trust and how much confidence u have in her. Have it occured to you that she kept the outings from you because she's afraid that you might get jealous?<br><br>That's where the trust factor comes into play. How much do u trust her? Are u really sure that she did hanky panky with her ex in the first place? Do u have concrete prove? Those SMSes means NOTHING. If u think she's been unfaithful when you have no concrete evidence, you have no trust in her at all. There's no point in carrying on a r/s w/o any trust in it. What if she really remained faithful and yet you accused her otherwise?<br><br>Bottom line is, how much trust is there in this r/s? Sit down and trash things out with her. Abortion is the last resort.<br><br>p/s: sorry for being str8 forward.. but you come across to me as a very ignorant and egoistic guy.

At least it worked for me. Personally, I have a few ex who are very close friends with me now. When ever they have a prob is their current r/s they will always come and look for me for advices/company. I'll be frank here, I even had a married fren who come over to stay at my place once. It's just a matter of trust.<br><br>Be forewarned though.... Trust is a very vague subject. How much trust to have? Too much and the other party will take advantage of it most of the time. Too little  will result in conflicts and jealousy.<br><br>Even though ur gf still meet up with her ex even though she complained to u that he's a loser, she might just be testing ur trust and how much confidence u have in her. Have it occured to you that she kept the outings from you because she's afraid that you might get jealous?<br><br>That's where the trust factor comes into play. How much do u trust her? Are u really sure that she did hanky panky with her ex in the first place? Do u have concrete prove? Those SMSes means NOTHING. If u think she's been unfaithful when you have no concrete evidence, you have no trust in her at all. There's no point in carrying on a r/s w/o any trust in it.

            <div class='col-md body'>There is alot of finger pointing here, if there is no trust in the r/s there is nothing to talk about. Everybody do made a mistake, to you is wrong but to him is right. Can't just point the finger at him or her as they should know what they are doing and be responsible. Communication is the key to the problem, nothing can be solve if both dun speak up. Hear-say is not a answer to all the problem as there are many thing involve in a r/s.</div>
