I actually answered your question in my last sentence.<br><br>It only boils down to the amount of feelings the man has for you my girl. Once he has lost feelings for you, it's good bye soon, even if he is the nicest man in the whole wide world. It 's the most important factor. You have to figure out what you did turned him off. It applies for guys too.<br><br>However, if you notice carefully(especialally in aunt agony) most of the time, girls are usually the ones controlling the direction of the r/s because they hold the rejection cards.</div>

When both parties are equally committed in a relationship, or even in a marriage, are the gals still controlling the direction of the r/s?  i do not think so.  Havent you heard of tonnes and tonnes of stories whereby the husband has a woman (mistress or fling) outside when the wife has <strong>no choice </strong>but to close one eyes?  On the contrary, how many stories are there where the man will close one eye if the wife commit adultery?  Im not saying there isnt, but there are definitely much lesser.</div>

I believe there are as many jaded guys as there are jaded gals (check out aunt agony on the number of guys whining why do women always......).  Generalising, saying things like "Alot of girls seem to fall into the 1st leh. Then make guys out to be so  bad. When they got problem also say their fault" is a sign of being jaded you know?</div>
