Ask her to show it to u thru her actions, not with words.<br><br>listen guy: this girl has no integrity. every action she makes shows no intimacy on her part. there's a thing called lip-service whereby the person just say nice things to make u feel happy. Girls are naturals at it. Too many nice guys are like that. I hate to see nice guys like that. Can nice guys be stronger for once?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>THQ: First of all, you have a <strong>very</strong> smug attitude. Don't think having money means you own the world. The truth is, money owns you. So LEARN to have more humility. Things like "I care for her so much but she waste my time" just goes to show how selfish, arrogant, et cetera, you are.<br><br>But I digress. I suggest you have a nice talk with your girlfriend. Calm down, have a nice talk about your doubts. If you think she cannot give you a satisfying answer:<br><br>1. Probe deeper. If you have $1000 notes to THROW at her, please take that note you are about to throw, and hire a PI. Solid evidence. No need to worry, think, crap anymore.<br>2. Ask her again, telling her how you feel. If she still cannot give you a satisfying answer, then too bad. Abort the baby. Why The baby, whether innocent or not, will be born under an environment full of violence. THQ's family deals with illegal businesses; I reasonably presume violence is a daily element. And no, we don't need another hooligan on the streets; we have enough already.<br><br>salvox: If she can lie blatantly in your face and you saw her with your eyes, then please, stop cheating yourself, and stop defying her her rights to engage in sexual activities with her so-called EX-boyfriend.</div>
