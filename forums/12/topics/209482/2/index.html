BUT in threadstarter's case, he and his gf are on the same level playing field. None is superior to the either.<br>However, I wouldn't say that threadstarter is wrong to read his gf's smses.

If the baby is mine, i will pay for the abortion and after that, i'll break off with her since she prefers her loser ex bf so much then go back to him lor. since no trust olready, no point being together. Got tai tai life don't want, want to be with that poor bastard with no money. No point getting married also, divorce will soon be on the way. </div></blockquote>All the talk about abortion. Easy for the guy in a r/s to say. Have you any idea how much emotional and physical torture the girl has to go through by having an abortion?<br>Since you still love her so much, aren't there any other solutions to this problem? Don't be rash and let rage take control of your mind; make sound solutions.<br>Also, from your above post I assume you two are co-habiting? In the first place if your attitude towards having a child is not optimistic and fully confident, why cohabit? Cohabiting is preparing you and your partner for marriage. If so, there should be a hell lot of trust between both of you, but I don't see that.</div>

I treat my gf very nice and in back she loves me too but she sometimes says wat a fricking loser his ex bf is, that time her eyes must have past stamps that she loves him blah blah...but when i look at her sms quietly, i found her asking him out lah got alot of things to tell him abt her current working place and the ex bf reply in her sms that he still loves my gf alot. I mean if you say so many bad things abt your ex bf but you wanna chat with him and ask him out behind my back. This is not the first time olready and we quarrel many times regarding this issue. she told me it's been months she even bother sms him. Just recently i been checking her phone and almost everyday, they been sms to each other. Now she is pregnant and I am wondering who's child is she having? Mine or the ex bf one. Can anyone help?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> </div></blockquote>Even though she said her ex-bf is a loser and all that, so what? The point is, she keep mentioning her ex. Why would some girl mention her ex if she loves her current bf? A case of contradiction!<br><br>Since you mentioned she loved you, why did she continue to SEE him? That is the most important question. No ifs and buts, it's obvious she has more feelings for her ex than you. She doesn't love you. You are No. 2 and the ex is No.1. Why did she want to contact her ex even though she and you are together? The answer is very clear: She hasn't forget the ex all along.<br><br>You shdnt have quarrelled with her. Instead, you shd have remained cool and instead praise the ex and then mention your ex-gf also.  When you met her, you shd have checked if the ex is in the background.<br><br>Anyway now, there's a possibility the child cud be yours. But if i were you, I wud never take her back. She's out although you mentioned she's  a threat to your family biz. Depending on your moral values, consider whether the child shd be aborted as it's not fair to the child.</div>
