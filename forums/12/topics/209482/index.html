            <div class='col-md body'>But u all think of this lor...<br><br>eh, the threadstarter had the rights to protect himself, y her gf want to bother with her ex bfs again? l mean who noes whether the gal got do any handy panky actions behind the threadstarter back, the best thing and to avoid misunderstanding, is to ask the gal hav a clean and complete break from the ex bf.<br><br>Besides l seldom hear ex bf and ex gf still toking and smsing together de..<br>U all see what threadstarter say..she rather told the ex bf that she is going china rather than telling her own bf?<br><br>What is this abt? To me...it seems that the gal is fickle minded le, dun hav her own stands, and thus how to gain trust? u all say lo...<br><br>You wan people to trust u..u hav to show it by ur actions. In a r/s yes, everything shld be equal and rite..there is no such thing as, hey we are in a r/s, we must hav trust with each other..and the nxt day..the gal go flirt with another guy? So trust hav to given to onli the right ppl, same to r/s.<br><br>That is my point of view<br><br></div>

If the baby is mine, i will pay for the abortion and after that, i'll break off with her since she prefers her loser ex bf so much then go back to him lor. since no trust olready, no point being together. Got tai tai life don't want, want to be with that poor bastard with no money. No point getting married also, divorce will soon be on the way.</div>
