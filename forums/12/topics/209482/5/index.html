            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by !hawker:</div><div class="quote_body">haha, really nice analogy. but just one flaw, in your example, the boss has the right to check on Andy as he is his superior. BUT in threadstarter's case, he and his gf are on the same level playing field. None is superior to the either.<br>However, I wouldn't say that threadstarter is wrong to read his gf's smses. This is done out of love I presume.</div></blockquote>Yes yes. very true. There're several aspects on how people view it.<br><br>When a couple goes steady, there's a mutual verbal agreement of being faithful to each other. Unless the couple made it clear in the first place that they should be also open to other opportunities. This is like between a boss and his new employee. Except the boss has an extra right to probe into the subordinate's email with or without reasonable doubt though I do not do that on my subordinates unless I really have reasonable grounds that he's doing something in perverse to honour and integrity.<br><br>Otherwise by breaking the faith, it means also breaking the agreement. So it becomes the point where the threadstarter stands at the position on whether is he based on overly-suspicious or based on actual events that led him to doubt reasonably. He has the right to confirm his doubts also. Though I believe he could've asked his gf personally before doing any silent actions eg. checking her HP.<br><br>His deed of checking her Hp equates to getting a PI to check up on her.<br><br>Similarly, he will also have a chance that he ends up finding nothing wrong with his gf. In this case, he will become all the more affirmative that the problem lies with him. And I believe his gf deserves to demand an apology from the thread starter.<br><br>However, relationships are based on trust. If there is no trust, then the relationship will not be worthwhile.<br><br>What I suggest now to the threadstarter is to let go of this relationship. For him to doubt until his current stage, the relationship has become a sinking boat. Hold on to it and everybody drowns together.</div>

And deception will surely kill [Third Law of the Old World (CloUdiSm)].

Delaying is only delaying the inevitable - a intense break up will surely happen, when the right planetary trigger strikes.

And because this topic is strictly about the relationship, I will not discuss the ethics of abortion because (I repeat) ultimately, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>aborting or not will not save the relationship</strong></span>.
