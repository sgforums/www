            <div class='col-md body'>Despresso, that guy in your church very "lucky" that nobody in your church opposed him from marrying his gf. From what I seen from friend's churches and my own experience (a young christian), some leaders/pastors do interfere and will comment negatively or stop/discourage a couple from being together becoz of the different spiritual climate between the two of them. I find that ridiculous! Those pastors/leaders are not God themselves how can they kaypoh and digging into the business of two lovers.<br><br>For your information, it is not Christian standards or Human standards those pple should keep up to but God's standards!<br><br></div>
