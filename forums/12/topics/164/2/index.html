            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Birdbird,<br><br>There is a difference between the need to convert to Christianity and the choice to do so. In my entire life as a emotional human being and Christian, I have never came across the golden rule that states YOU MUST (note the MUST) marry a Christian. That is preferred but not forced upon a Christian man or woman.<br><br>Faith and acceptance of any faith has to be may purely based on choice and not influenced by circumstances like you pleasing your girlfriend. Because at the end of the day, the logic is that you do not answer to your girlfriend for your actions but rather yourself and God.<br><br>Also, sometimes God can work in many strange ways. I have known couples who are of different faiths, marrying and their faith still remains strong. My mother was a non-Christian when she married into my dad's family who were Christian. Later on...twenty over years down the road, she became a Christian, not to please anyone but it was a personal choice. So too with me. My children do not necessarily have to follow my footsteps and become a Christian. It is all about choice at the end of the day...the reason why there are many intepretations out there is because people choose to intepret God's actions for Him.<br><br>Let your love for your gf and her prayers for you guide the way. Sometimes faith grows in the most unusual of circumstances...and fyi, I'm going out with a non-Christian and I see nothing wrong with that. Because he is a wonderful man who encourages me to grow spiritually and mentally...and I know God would want me to be so...<br><br>So take heart that God doesn't force people to be saved but rather advocates the element of choice. Good luck!</div>

Good luck!</blockquote>again, its nice to know that this is your interpretation of the bible and it allows for tolerance but a lot of christians aren't like that. anyway, just keep doing what you're doing; i respect it so long as you respect other people's beliefs  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>NinGNinG:<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>True, the Bible can be intrepreted in many forms by many pple.. I had a bf who told me we need to break off becoz I am a spiritually low Christian and would drag his walk with God.. its really mean of him to use God's words as an excuse to break off wif me.<br><br>BirdBird, I guess for now, you should put this "religion" issue aside and enjoy the relationship. Christian wif Christian relationship does not guarantee 100% lasting even. The most important issue is the character of the person then the person's religion. I dun koe wat your belief is, but I really respect you for being so concern abt your gf's feelings when you said that she kinda hope u will convert and u are worrying over this issue. Come on, leave everything to God and if you believe that she is the one, then let nature take its course. U never koe how your thoughts will change in a few years time. I believe that its not by chance that u both meet and fall in love. For two hearts to become one, it takes a miracle. For now, juz tresure each other.</div>
