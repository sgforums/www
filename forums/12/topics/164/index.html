            <div class='col-md body'>Well, my brother, Christianity is nothing more than a bridge to foster our relationship with God. Anything more than that is superfluous and redundant. God doesn't care what religion you belong to, as long as you have faith in Him and yourself; as long as you can love others like He loves you.<br><br>In short my brother, you don't have to be a Christian to believe in God and to love each other, and I'm sure that your gf will understand that if she's open enough; to God love and all that He has prepared for us that is. What really matters is your thought(your faith), and not just the superficial aspects. Life is bountiful...and may God bless you  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

Does LOVING someone means to go into her religion even if it means to do so BLINDLY...? Tell you what do I THINK?

            <div class='col-md body'>hey birdbird:<br><br>I think you should just be very firm on your own beliefs. Tell her that since you respect her beliefs and you don't try to convince her to renounce her faith, she should do the same for you, and respect your beliefs and stop trying to convert you to christianity. I think in insisting on you converting to christianity, she's being very selfish and inconsiderate.<br><br>And there's no such thing as a christian being allowed to mix only with christians. One of my closest friends that I have known since pri4, is a devout christian, and I am not. He never bugs me to go to church or convert christianity, because as a friend he knows how to respect my beliefs, and I think your friend should learn how to respect yours as well.<br><br>On the whole, I think christians should learn to respect other people's beliefs and religions (or lack of). The way some of them go around denouncing other relgions as "pagan" is disgusting...<br><br>Anyway, as for my thoughts on religion, I'll post something I wrote on it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> And btw, good luck with it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm still of the opinion man created god because they couldn't face up to reality...basically our lives are pretty pointless and we're no different from animals. We're just smarter but when we die, we die. No such thing as having a soul that goes to heaven, etc. When shit happens, its because life is unfair and you had bad luck, not because god has a plan for you or whatever.<br>If you look up any ancient civilization, any culture or country, you'll notice that they always have some form of religion, be it worshipping the rain and fertility gods, or whatever. It would seem to be that religion is created by man as a form of emotional sustenance. Religion is also created by man to explain things that they can't understand. Like when there is an earthquake or flood, its because the gods are angry, blah blah.<br><br>Without religion, most people would find their lives meaningless and they would not have a good reason to continue living. For christians, whenever something good happens, its because god is being graceful and whenever something bad happens, its because we have failed god and he's teaching us a lesson or something like that. A god you worship is basically like an imaginery friend, and a means of taking away your feeling of powerlessness. Like when a farmer's crops fails, instead of having to admit that its just his bad luck that the weather is bad, or there was too much rain, etc, he prays to his fertility god or whatever to make his crops grow, so he can feel as if he actually has the situation in control<br><br>Argh I think i could go on with this forever<br>basically i think religion was created by people with no backbone and who are emotionally weak, making them unable to face up to reality.<br>When science finally is able to explain everything, the need for religion would go away. I think that's one of the reasons the pope and all the religious people are so afraid of genetic engineering. Having science able to explain everything would be the death knell to religion.<br>btw, no offence to anyone...just my opinion.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

So long as it helps people to have a meaning in life and u believe in it wholeheartedly, by all means.<br>Not untill I came upon a girl who is a Christian and she nearly ruined by marriage. Luckily my husband came back to me, or we'll have ended up in divorce.<br>My husband knew her before we married and he threatened to end our six years of relationship because of her. She was trying to convert my husband to Christian but my husband was unwilling as my mother-in-law<br>is a Buddhist, although he himself is a free thinker. Thank goodness he did not want to be converted or our relationship would have ended there. But just after a year into the marriage and our child was borned I realised that my husband was still seeing her. She was asking my husband to leave me and my child. I have called her a no. of time, asking her to stay out of my family but she just hanged up on me. I was totally devastated. I threatened to leave my husband and take the child with with me, that's when my husband finally woke up and have a clean break with her.<br>Believe me, they are a group of over friendly people. Too much friendly for comfort. And they can talk very well and if they want to convert u, they will try ways and means.<br>By the way this girl is a teacher, and with such a bad example, I'm really worried for the children she teaches. If I can write to the MOE and ban her from being a teacher, I'll do so.<br>As all Christian believe, they both have to be Christian before they can be married. So unless u convert or your girlfriend don't mind u r a non believer u can forget about the whole thing.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yea....<br>christians always complain about people not respecting their religions but they hardly respect other peoples' religions. they're always trying to convert people and i think its disgusting.<br><br>how would they like it if i stood outside a church to distribute atheist phamplets?<br><br>crying angel: i can just imagine her trying to convert the pupils in the school and all. i'm just curious as to what school she's from. if she's from a methodist institution such as mgs, acs, chij, etc, then there's nothing much you can do. if she's from a government school, i think you can stir up something with her. good luck if you do try, i'll fully support you. somehow such behavior is acceptable from christians but if a muslim were to do such things, i doubt people would be as tolerant. btw if you're curious, i'm a free thinker or atheist  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
