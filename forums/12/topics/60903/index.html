What wrong have you done to her?<br><br>Anyway, you shouldn't told her you like her since she had hinted to you that she isn't interested in you by telling you she might avoid you. You had obviously gotten very emotional here and had to failed to respond rationally.<br><br>It should not be very jia lat if you go out with her in a groups of friends. Just be confident and natural, do not be embarassed or malu. Show her that you can live without her love. She'll be shocked as she might expect that you'll act like the other men out there.</div>

Nobody could escape this early fate.<br><br>She hinted to you that her relationship with you could not proceed anywhere further than normal friends. In heat of being rejected, you blurted the go-on-and-avoid-me-then thingy - you indirectly stepped onto her trigger which made perform exactly what you asked her. She showed you the land mine - you activate it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Write her a letter saying that you will remain friends and you will forget her? Is there a link? Chances are, such content will not improve situations. My suggestion to you is that the letter must contain message which state:<br><br>I) Took some time to think over things<br><br>II) Great friend you have there; decide to respect her wishes and remain good friends. Like always. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>III) Forget about writing things like forget her kind of thing. According to my experience, these words and content never really work. <strong>If you want to forget - there is no such need to tell her.</strong> And later on, if you can't, you are breaking your own words and putting yourself in bad light.<br><br>P.S: Letter itself must be conjunct with other tools to make your solutions effective - mainly body language and feel. When you see her outside, react and act as normal. You have to lead her - in a sense where you feel that you are behaving what you wrote to her, a friendship like before and better. Even if she acted weird and avoid, be generous about it and lead your usual self.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>
