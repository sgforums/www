Just be yourself, I know it is easier said then done because you are meeting the girl for the 1st time, but best is being yourself. Don't be so fake lah.. </span><span style="color: brown;">Meeting people for the first time can be quite an interesting event. Because both of you are totally unknown to each other, so objective is get to know each other(obviously duh!! hehe <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> ) Try to find out her interests. See if it matches yours. For example she likes sports and you too.
