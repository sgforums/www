I dunno web. From the oldest Science in the world, it has always been this way and I learn it that way. Maybe you can try typing Medicial Astrology in Yahoo. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Anyway, the field of Medicine is very young (say the last hundred year or so), physician long before that had to study Medicial Astrology even before they are declared professional physician. The field of Medicine back then isn't exactly the core/method of healing the physical body, it was actually a small thing, unlike now. People back then used Hebalism (earlier science of Medicine) and I think alchemy (earlier science of Chemistry) and some even spiritual healing (we still have it now and we call them New Age).<br><br>Alexander Fleming didn't exactly discover Penicillin very long ago (in human age). The first antibiotic (If I am not wrong).<br><br>As for 'Still got Medicial Astrology?!?' question - it is losing its lush. People generally don't study them in detail anymore because the field of Medicine had taken over the importance of it. If you noticed, in Medicine, there isn't any elemental division within the Medicine itself, unlike say oriental Medicine (Cool/heaty herbs, 4/5 basis elements, etc). Medicine is just... Medicine. There are people who feel that Western Medicine upset their body energy flow (or whatever you calls it), makes them feel weaker and prefer traditional for small problems instead of depending everything on antibiotics.<br><br>P.S: Actually I only know pure surface thingy about Medicial Astrology because I don't study them in details. Ask me about Love Astrology and I can tell you a story.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Cheers</div></blockquote>Err... If you know much about 'earlier' medical practice, alot of them ain't really that scientific based (but only much more of a chance thing)...<br><br>No doubt western medications these days like you've mentioned seems to lack 'some things'... But that's only because they're more empirical or scientific based now...</div>

I am just trying to tell him to be himself. We only got one life here... why must we be so restrictive about everything? It would be so gawd-damn boring sia.. anyway, think about this... the other girl with bigger boobs could do more things in bed. Think about this... br3ast-fark!' B...
