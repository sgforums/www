              <p>i've been liking this particular girl for quite a while right now. well, i somehow found out that she is planning to go overseas to further her studies and at the same time, realise her ambitions. upon knowing that, my heart sank quite a bit, but still i wished her all the best if she really went. i've been admiring her for more than a year and i have yet to confess. i shall not reveal my age, but i am willing to say that i am below 18. what should i do? i have a major exam this year, and i do not want to tell her how much i like her and distract her from her studies, but at the same time, i really don't want to lose her. if i don't, will i lose her? if i do, will she be distracted from the exam? thanks for your time. very much appreaciated.</p>

              <p>it is better not to distract her overseas studies right now.</p>
              <p>Ask her any way to communicate with her when she's leave Spore.</p>
              <p>And for you side, study well at the same time, get a good grade.</p>
              <p>And you are below 18yr old, time is on your side.</p>
              <p>Take it slow for courtship, built up the relationship nice and slow.</p>

              <p>Dude, i'll hate you if u are the bloody one who stole my girl away. Me and this girl have been talking for a while and she told me one fine day that there is this other guy who told her that he has been observing her for a while. Then she started talking lesser to me. Damn you if you are that f**ker.</p>
              <p>But anyway, just tell her how you feel. It is always better to let people know how you feel about them. You never know what will happen to you or her tmr (touch wood). So, go ahead. At most, it'll get a lil awkward. But the awkwardness will wear off in a while. Go man! Maybe she likes you too ^^</p>

              <p>aiyah chill la......if the girl you like doesnt reciprocate, blame no one. Not even if another guy comes in.</p>
              <p>Anyway to klutz bao, what is your level of relations with the girl? Ordinary or good? If good, then test waters a bit la. Don't confess right away. It would be akin to vomitting.</p>

              <p>Come on, man. U r below 18 and still young, so is she. Many things happen in between. I know a 18 year old who have a crush on tis gal but he didn't have the chance to tell tis gal. And then she went overseas to study. She then had a boyfren, and then she broke off. For my fren, he oso had a galfren then broke off. Then one day when my fren is 25, he was walking along the sidewalk after work, he bump into her. They say hi, then they exchange phone number. He kept in touch n ws excited to know she is single. He pursue her. Finally got her. He started a relationship wif her. But after 8 months it became a nightmare, she was so hurt by her past boyfren n the memories of him, she became difficult, she was no longer that sweet 18 gal, he used to know. So after 1.5 years, he broke off wif her.</p>
              <p>Moral of the story: Everything is fated. Don't despair if u fail.</p>
