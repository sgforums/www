That is not true. Crying is simply an avenue for one to release stress so that he would be able to put his mind into a better situation to think about his problems. Hiding emotions is unhealthy and causes unnecessary stress and this in no way helps or solves anything.<br><br>What does one acheive when he allows his ego to gain contol of his head and chooses to potray a "macho" image? The simple answer is nothing. YOu simply close yourself to help which people may offer you out of goodwill becos of your pride. And you put yourself in a situation where you may not necessary solve your problems because of further stress you build up inside your heart.</div>

Even so, he can choose to cry alone, but crying in front of you is something he showed to you, a form of respect. So you can respect him back by not ridicule him or laugh at him.

Such attitude is motivated by the traditional male ego that a male is always strong. The definition of strong has now expanded such that when a guy cries, he is now stronger because he has managed to overcome his stress by releasing it out in tears.<br><br>How does restraning emotions shows that you have a clear head? In fact, restraining emotions lead to much unhealthy behaviour later on when one loses control of himself due to immense stress and feelings locked up in the heart which leads to extreme mood swings and erratic behaviour.</div></blockquote>maybe right. But i'll rather have a bf who has mood swings (say smash bottle, overturn table, kick the pavement, punch the van) then cry.</div>
