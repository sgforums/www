            <div class='col-md body'>I know this hurts a lot, but the best thing you could do is to really just let her do what she wants. In a relationship, it takes two to work things out. When one party decides to walk away, don't cling on to it.<br><br>It's difficult yes, but when it's time to walk away you have to walk away. Just know that you have already done your best to protect her and care for her. It is now her choice, and as an individual you should respect it.<br><br>One day when she gets hurt, and think back, she will realise who is the person who really loves and cares for her. What doesn't kill you makes you stronger. We all need to learn from our mistakes and grow stronger. You have done your part on walking with her, so for now let her choose her own path.</div>
