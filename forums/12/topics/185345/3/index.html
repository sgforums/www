            <div class='col-md body'>Indeed, you have made some mistakes. Now, it is the time to move on and stop making any more mistakes.<br><br>Usually, I would try to see if a couple can reconcilate. But if your statements are true, then it would be best for you and your child to move on without him.<br><br>Jeff gave good advice, but you might also want to file a police report and have him criminally charged for assault and abuse on you. This fella is thinking he get away with such atrocious behaviour without any repurcussions. Dun give him that lee way and let him suffer for all the wrong doings he's been perpetrating.<br><br>In addition, I suggest you to seek counselling, not only about you baby but with regards about yourself. The decision of what to with the baby is a momentous one, and not one to be decided immediately or from advice given over this forum.<br><br>Factors to consider keeping the child or giving up for adoption include your financial status, supportive family as well as your overall capability to raise a child.<br><br>Someone may have mentioned that other adoptive parents can raise the child better than you can, but note that the example cited is a far extreme, and many orphans are not so well off. No one wants to be raised apart from their true parent(s).<br><br>Another thing you must consider is his role in your kid's future. Do you want to allow him to participate? Given what I heard, the divorce proceedings should progress to prevent him from seeking contact with the child. Overall, it may be harsh, but your description of him may show that this is the best for the kid.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>How a husband &amp; wife should be with each other is not a simple matter. Sometimes circumstances conspire in a strange way, so that wealth or an easy life can actually drive a couple apart, whereas what looks like a mountain of problems to an outsider can be the time of greatest happiness that draws the two closer together.<br><br>Unlike the kind of trust that wavers depending on the situation, true love, in the deepest sense of a bond between two people, is something that develops in the face of rough seas. But this does not mean that one partner has to always give in to the other, or that the happiness of one can be built on the suffering of the other.<br><br>The husband is not the centre of the relationship, nor is the wife. It is not a question of who is the leader or who must make himself or herself a sacrifice for the otherÂ’s success &amp; happiness. Just like a song is a marriage of music &amp; lyrics, husband &amp; wife are equal individuals who, at the same time, perform a single melody of life together. What is important, is how beautiful a song these two life partners can create together.<br><br>In order to achieve a deep &amp; harmonious relationship, the two most important ingredients are a sense of gratitude &amp; a common goal.<br><br>In todayÂ’s society, perhaps a family could be thought of as an aeroplane. Buffeted by the winds of change, the two co-pilots have the responsibility of assuring safe arrival. The stability of an aeroplane in flight requires clear direction, momentum &amp; constant effort. And a successful flight requires that the co-pilots keep the same destination in sight.<br><br>One English proverb says: Â“Keep your eyes wide open before marriage &amp; half shut afterwards.Â” Both husband &amp; wife must try to be tolerant, &amp; have a big heart which forgives minor faults &amp; mistakes by the other. If you are being constantly scrutinized &amp; criticized, you will not feel like trying to change, even of you know that what has been pointed is out true.<br><br>Love takes a thousand different forms. Sometimes the husband may appear to be impossibly domineering to outsiders; yet a couple manages to get along with a surprising degree of harmony. On the other hand, there are cases where the wife seems to have her way in everything, but still an atmosphere of peace prevails. It is not, in fact, the outward appearance that matters. When a couple has shared the joys &amp; sorrows of life over a long period of time, a deep tie develops between them that cannot be severed by outside forces. This is not the kind of open, direct love we might see amongst young couples. It is something broad &amp; deep, a sense of shared destiny.<br><br>There are couples who seem to possess this power. You will find such couples of the tedious, whining talk of some old people. And, although many of them have not lived easy lives, there is no gloom in their expressions. You will find only the sense of deep self-sufficiency that come when two people have successfully made their way over lifeÂ’s rough places together. Along with an appreciation of the preciousness of their remaining time together.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by jeffning:<br><strong>Look like you have 2 grounds of divorce, namely adulterly and unreasonable behaviour, against your husband. However, as your marriage is less than 3 year, you have to apply to court for special permission to initiate divorce proceedings if you can prove that you had suffered exceptional hardship. So, the court will consider the possibility of reconciliation and interest of your son in granting the permission.<br><br>Divorce is a very complicated and delicate situation that pose great impact to your son and yourself. The following web resources should shade lights to your predicament:<br><br>[b]Legal Aid Scheme</strong><br><a href="http://app.minlaw.gov.sg/lab/info.asp" rel="nofollow">http://app.minlaw.gov.sg/lab/info.asp</a><br><br><strong>FAQ on Divorce</strong><br><a href="http://www.familycourtofsingapore.gov.sg/principles/FAQ_ThinkingDivorce.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.familycourtofsingapore.gov.sg/principles/FAQ_ThinkingDivorce.htm</a><br><br>On personal notes, I suggest the following:<br><br>1) Consult a doctor for probable post-natal depression, aka baby blue.<br><br>2) Make police reports against your husband and the fraudulent transactions made at Courts and the telco companies involved. This is a serious criminal act that should not be ignored.<br><br>3) Collect and maintain records of payments, bills, receipts, and other documents to establish that you are financially capable on your own. At the same time, prepare your balance sheet of assets and liabilities plus the income and expenditure items.<br><br>4) Get a Personal Protection Order or Restraining Order for your husband.<br><br>5) Seek professional help for your son and yourself.<br><br>For the rest of us, learn the lesson here. chgal78, you have to be strong for your son and perservere. Take good care of yourself.[/b]</blockquote>Thanks jeff for this advice. I wil take note  of these points.<br><br>In btw, hubby said i was too oversensitive n nowadays keep too close tabs on his movements taht made him felt very suffocated. I asked him to try to be in my shoes, how do i feel after being betrayed n being made use for everything, etc.  Recently i screamed at him the moment i saw a female name in his msn, then the shouting match begun. Dunno why i suddenly had the strong urge to walk out n smash his car up at the car park. Hmm am i such childish to think like that? but i cant stand lots of resentment towards my hubby for causing me embarassments with the companies n these isses that involves the sexual harassment towards my sis n friend.<br><br>How i wish i have the courages to bash my hubby up, or make him cuckold or even worse i want to smash his car up n let him feel the pain of seeing his favourite car being damaged heavily n the heavy finanicla burden for repairing car.<br><br>I hv already got in touch with the lawyer n now advisin me what to do.
