Less than a year is too little time to adjust. Give it 3 years and if you are still unhappy then get out.</div>

Does he has your approvals? Did you sign anything in the process? If you didn't, don't think you should be responsible to pay up for anything. Ultimately, they can sue your husband for frauds if they want.<br><br>You can go to any lawyer to have your divorce done. Are you working? Are you working much for your income? Sad to add, but pls give your child a life. Since you've already birth to the baby and he's your flesh and blood, do NOT forsake him NOW. Can you imagine how would you feel that you're a forsaken child where everybody has given up on you, only born of mistake? Can you imagine giving your flesh to a father like that? It could be sending your kid to a condemned life? Unless he's really keen in having and taking care of the child, and you on the other hand is totally uninterested and just wish to start your life afresh... That would be a different story altogether...<br><br>Meanwhile, you can try going to the Legal Aid for advices and recommendation of lawyer for your proceedings... At the same time, pls remember to apply for PPO asap. Stay CLEAR from him as far as you can since you know this guy can be highly violent.<br><br></div>

Just because she had pre-marital sex does not make her a slut<br><br>2) She made a mistake and she is being responsible for her actions.
