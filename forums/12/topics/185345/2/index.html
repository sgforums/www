I admit i was too rash to get married without giving it second thoughts to what wil happen to me after marriage.

Initally he was good to me for first few months n everything was all right till i got shotgun. then after i married him. i was nearly 6 months pregnant n then gave birth pre-maturely at 8months. i am not blaming myself or him for the nightmare at all but just need some advice on how to file. I might hv enough of him n his unreasonable behaviour. As for the using my IC to apply for hp n hire-purchases, it was done within my full knowledge but unfortunately he defaulted on payments without my knowledge till the letters from the company's lawyers arrived n i was too shocked, Patlee71 do u understand n do not anyhow say bad things without understanding my full story.<br>As for my child, i am uncertain whether i shd let him hv my son or not but given his current situation, i doubt he can provide for my son so asking for advice too. but for adoption, i dun think so cos i love my son too much n i dun wish to let him be adopted by others. my hubby n i love our son alot  but still fight and argue abt wanting our son to stay with me or him even if we decide to separate.  dunno if it is worthy to give marriage another chance or go separate ways although my love for him alr died.</div>
