              <p>Yeah. I told her that, and she gave me more space that i could ask for. Its like, even slower replies and stuff.</p>
              <p><strong>BrainError &amp; mlmersrlosers:</strong></p>
              <p>Hmm yeah. I guess i'm just trying to be a loving guy towards her. I would do anything to make her happy. And now, she got used to it. There was once, she even cried and said to me on an sms, "Why didn't you get me a present?". And she regretted saying that later on.</p>
              <p>Breaking up would probably be an answer, but being the first to initate the break up, it would feel 10 times worse.</p>

              <p>Wow. That must be really though for you. The problem is every time i wanted to break up, she will get even more angry because she knows that i will not seriously break up with her. When we "broke up" and "got together" again, things were much better. She wasn't so spoiled, everything is happy again. But it didn't really last long. Lasted around 2 to 3 weeks. Oh by the way, may i know your gender and age range? xD Sorry. I just want to know where the advice is coming from. Thanks.</p>
              <p><strong>RedNano:</strong></p>
              <p>I guess you could say that. Although i'm not happy with her, please do not give me pervertic comments. Thanks.</p>

              <p>I want to see a future in this, but it isn't as bright as i hope it would be.</p>
              <p><strong>Readers:</strong></p>
              <p>She's both in my school and my church. Which makes it harder. I'll see her no matter what. And i'm not sure if she will attend church anymore if i break up. No religion remarks please. Just a general answer. Thanks guys.</p>

              <p>Yes. The same poly. If i break up, i'll probably see her around
              and i know it'll hurt.</p>
              <p>She broke up with me once, and patched up within the next day
              because she can't leave me. I considered breaking up with her a lot
              of times. Hmm, thats true. I hate her nonsence. But her other side
              is really what is consider is sufficient for me. I miss singlehood.
              Where you don't have to get scolded, feel guilt, to slack with my
              friends. I even missed to go out with my friends today so that i
              can go out with her. I told her that i was going out with my
              friends, she said she felt bad and got over it when i smsed her its
              okay. Is that really feeling bad? She's also a selfish girl and
              sometimes i feel that it is a one-sided relationship.</p>
              <p>How do i assert authority? She might cry again and not talk to
              me which makes me feel like shit.</p>

              <p>This post really helped me thanks.</p>
              <p>Hmm, after the short "breakup" and "got together", she complied for 2-3 weeks. And after that, things returned to normal and we are getting into arguements again. The next thing i know is that, i'm being treated like that again. Hmm, I gave her the ultimatum when i decided to "get back together" again. I told her that if she continues to be like this, i'm going to break up with her and i'm not getting back into a relationship with her. She agrees and starts crying, kinda cause her life is in a mess, with her parents divorce, friends and stuff. And i'm her only support. If i break up, i'll feel really bad.</p>
              <p>May i know what is your gender and age to know where is the advice coming from? Thanks.</p>

              <p>Haha, goes to show how fickle you are. An ultimatum only works when one is resolute.<br><br>So what if you're the only support in her life.? Who ever said about break-ups being goodbye for good.? <br><br>Yes, it will be a little awkward at the start, but you'll be able to get along for sure cause i have a theory. "<em>The only way a man and a woman could truely be friends, is if there's something about each other that they can't accept.</em>" <br><br>If your female friend was so perfect in your eyes, why don't you date her.? Sounds logical.?<br><br>And since you managed to have some good times with your girlfriend so far, it goes to show that you guys may be able handle the intimacy of a friendship, but a relationship may be "pushing it".<br><br>Although i personally think my age and gender is a non-sequittor, i'll oblige.
