              <p>Heya people of SGforum!</p>
              <p>I've got a girlfriend who is kind, funny and cute.<br> However, sometimes, she mood swings kick in and it really irritates
              the hell out of me. She also expects things from me, for example,
              sending her off to the bus stop. Because i do it often and is a
              sign to show her how much i love her. I don't even mind sending her
              home even if i have to take a 45 minutes bus ride home. Its really
              out of love. But when i refuse to send her home and told her nicely
              about not getting used to me sending her off, she got pissed and
              just left without a trace.</p>
              <p>Also, occasionally, we have arguements because of little things,
              such as, not replying smses fast enough. And when i told her we are
              fighting over something small, she cries and the next day, gave me
              the same treatment.</p>
              <p>To be honest, she's a nice girl but over sensitive. I just need
              real comments on this. Thanks.</p>

              <p>For your case, she is not the only immature one.</p>
              <p>Tell me, in the first place.. why was she attracted to you ? Why did she not choose other guys instead of you ?</p>
              <p>Never start something you cannot finish.</p>
              <p>First , you set up her expectation being such a wonderful guy.. then you complain about her expecting the same level of care and love later ?</p>
              <p>You are a very confusing guy. Any girl will be frustrated with you because you employ the hook and dump attitude on your relationship.</p>
              <p>You ask for more space.. when she gives you more space.. you complained about getting TOO much space. Then what exactly, is the appropriate amount of space you want from her ?</p>
              <p>Remember, she cannot read your mind. Neither can you read hers.</p>

              <p>Nothing wrong complaining about relationship issues to friends.. we girls do that all the time, that's how females deal with their personal issues. We just want to get support and a place to vent our frustrations.</p>
              <p>Expectations are part of any relationship. And the best is to be clear and consistant with what you set out and what you can accomplish. That's where communications becomes a very important tool.</p>
              <p>You did those things out of love.. you are also setting a standard to your relationship. It seems she is just expecting consistency, not asking for more.</p>
              <p>If you set a high standard.. it will be to your advantage. Humans will always make comparison, like it or not. So if this is her first relationship..and you set a high bar , then no other guy will be able to compete with you and win her heart away.</p>
              <p>Some guys prefers to set a low standard.. but they always end up being dumped.. because he forget there's other guys out there who can be better than him. So they complain about their unfaithful girlfriends.. blah blah blah... </p>
              <p>Remember.. what you like.. others will also like. </p>
              <p>So treat your girlfriend well.. and enjoy the blissful relationship.</p>

              <p>We decided not to break. But i know that she's complaining to
              her friend to reduce the pain. Anyway, how would i know that there

              <p>"How about the space in the middle? Where its just right?".</p>
              <p>Space in the middle is very subjective.</p>
              <p>Your "just right" is different from her " just right".</p>
              <p>Both of you needs to compromise and find a middle ground through communication, so that the expectations are agreed upon.</p>

              <p>Hi, is this post still alive and kicking?</p>
              <p>i'd say your gf doesn't really have the ability to understand things as much as you do.</p>
              <p>)which is i guess is pretty common amongst the youths nowadays)</p>
              <p>i'd say, you pluck up some balls and break up with her.</p>
              <p>although the consequences may not be too pretty, if this relationship is one-sided, it isn't healthy - and if i were you, i'd see no point in being with a girl who's cute and sweet etc. (there's more to that lah pls)</p>
