              <p>Heya people of SGforum!</p>
              <p>I've got a girlfriend who is kind, funny and cute.<br>However, sometimes, she mood swings kick in and it really irritates the hell out of me. She also expects things from me, for example, sending her off to the bus stop. Because i do it often and is a sign to show her how much i love her. I don't even mind sending her home even if i have to take a 45 minutes bus ride home. Its really out of love. But when i refuse to send her home and told her nicely about not getting used to me sending her off, she got pissed and just left without a trace.</p>
              <p>Also, occasionally, we have arguements because of little things, such as, not replying smses fast enough. And when i told her we are fighting over something small, she cries and the next day, gave me the same treatment.</p>
              <p>To be honest, she's a nice girl but over sensitive. I just need real comments on this. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Thats not true. I've been handling this for half a year now.</p>
              <p>There are both good and bad times, but now, i see its leaning more to the bad side.</p>

              <p>When we are quarrelling, we are both waiting for each other to see who breaks up first.</p>

              <p>Heya people of SGforum!</p>
              <p>I've got a girlfriend who is kind, funny and cute.<br> However, sometimes, she mood swings kick in and it really irritates
              the hell out of me. She also expects things from me, for example,
              sending her off to the bus stop. Because i do it often and is a
              sign to show her how much i love her. I don't even mind sending her
              home even if i have to take a 45 minutes bus ride home. Its really
              out of love. But when i refuse to send her home and told her nicely
              about not getting used to me sending her off, she got pissed and
              just left without a trace.</p>
              <p>Also, occasionally, we have arguements because of little things,
              such as, not replying smses fast enough. And when i told her we are
              fighting over something small, she cries and the next day, gave me
              the same treatment.</p>
              <p>To be honest, she's a nice girl but over sensitive. I just need
              real comments on this. Thanks.</p>
