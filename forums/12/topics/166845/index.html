But maybe cos I'm tired liao, so I tend not to have the same sort of exuberance and put in the same amount of effort towards relationships as he does.<br><br>But I guess its a trade off. He did not get the more naive, always giving in, waiting, doing-small-things-for-you-all-the-time girl that I was when I was younger.<br><br>But that girl during that time happened to be less evolved too - more insecure, less confident, and because of that, more prone to tantrums, and need a lot more reassurance.

            <div class='col-md body'>Sounds like you love yourself less than your partner loves you.<br><br>You may not have confidence in yourself as a lover, but what about in your partner?<br><br>Do you trust your partner?<br>Have you faith in your partner?<br>Is your partner deserving of your love?<br><br>If not in yourself, perhaps you should have confidence in your partner. At least in the choice he has made -- you. Out of kind and considerate intentions, you may doubt your ability to fulfill his expectations. However, you are also in effect questioning his decision in choosing you to love, and that may actually cause him more hurt than good. Is that the way you would repay him for all that he has done for you, all that he has given you?<br><br>Try not to compare the love he has given with what you can offer. To paraphrase a movie quote: You are not perfect. He is not perfect either.
