            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Rainee,<br><br>Sure, many people have these feelings, &amp; if you're having them, you're Not alone.  Even though my relationship is very much roses, I still get that feeling once in a bluuuuueeeeeee moon.  It arises from an insecurity, that you can't make your partner as happy as he makes you.  I guess there's always that nagging feeling of inadequacy now &amp; then.<br><br>In my relationship though, I do let my darling know how I feel, &amp; he's quick to reassure me that he's very happy with what he's got <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  We hafta realise that in relationships, what matters most is what our partners feel.  If they're happy, then don't ruin a relationship by your own feelings of insecurity.  Let your partner reassure you, &amp; BELIEVE him.<br><br>After awhile, with positive reinforcement &amp; views about yourself, you'll feel alot more confident.<br><br>FeowFeow<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by rainee:</div><div class="quote_body">As in like you dun think you deserve your partner?<br><br>You know he/she treats you better than you treat him/her, you want to love him/her more...but maybe due to time constraint or other reason, you couldn't give as much attention to him as he has been giving to you.<br><br>Anyone felt this way before?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"> </div></blockquote></div>

My relationship is on the rocks becos i give in to my gf a lot for the past 2 years. We never quarrel and is always me who is the one who is pampering her. In the end, I got so fed up with her princess ways and let it all out at her. I give her and me 1 week to think it over.<br><br>you are just too stress out lar. no worries girls tend to that all the time is normal lar..<br><br>sayang rainee..<br><br>Just give yourself sometime alone like go shopping alone or take a slow walk to relax your mind.</div>
