I finished reading all the pages. Your situation is better than mine, I guess. Anyway, this is not the first time I heard about your bf's church.  I've heard of other people kanna scolded too 'cause their gf/bf not Christian. Worse still, the fella a girl....kanna scolded until cry. Guess I have to thank God my gf not from there...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Anyway, thanks everybody for the advice.<br><br>My gf and I are still together...barely. Before you misunderstand her because of her being Christian, I must say that it is not easy on her part to start a r/s with me too. But she is a strong, mature and understanding person. Although she has been advised to find someone of the same faith, people around her did not reject to us(when they know)and instead, welcome me into her world with grace.<br><br>As for why she decided to start with me, you have to ask yourself if you believe in divine intervention. She got sorta a 'sign' from God and thus we began. Now for a free-thinker at that time, I was just happy that we got together. But we started to debate and argue over some things I simply couldn't understand. Maybe I was a bit stubborn too. This isn't the first time we quarrel. The last time we argue, I was the one who received the 'sign' and went to church with her. Everything ok from there.<br><br>This time, after our argument, I kanna a 'sign' again. It seems someone is trying to mend our r/s. But I had made her cry, which I am very sorry about. Since I am a half past 10 believer and in her turf, I would have to leave it in the hands of God now and hope that everything would be fine.</div>

Can they actually co-exist?<br><br>Actually, in CloUdiSm, it doesn't really matter whether the Love for God is greater than the Love for the relationship, or vice vista, because you are using different yardstick to measure. It is like saying, which is worst: possessiveness or insensitivity?<br><br>However, it is known for its possible conflicts that probably doesn't have any viable solution unless either one shift side completely. Compromising only works temporary, for such relationship is usually created by Jupiter/9th house affliction, astrologically speaking. During heavy plantary transit, which could trigger this affliction, many may find it daunting to keep the relationship alive.<br><br>Every relationship has its own tale to speak, own woe to share: likewise, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>such relationship is but a karmic challenge to the relationship</strong></span>, forge by the acceptance of Love for one another. When we ignore the religious part, what we get is like any other problems we faced in any relationship - conflicts that bend to tear the relationship apart, especially when faith in the relationship is at its weakest.<br><br>In a religion-conflict relationship (RCR), when we look at it closely, it is actually a conflict of frequency, of both mental and spiritual frequency. Nothing good or bad; just that unless steps are taken to narrow the gap, this vast opening will remain.<br><br>P.S: Difficult but possible. LDR (Long-distance Relationship) are difficult, but there are successful stories around as well.

Coz her mum ever felt this way before and so she went to ask the priest what happened.  The priest told her that Jesus knows she had a lot of suffering inside her and wanted to help her release by crying.  Since then, she became a christian lor.  But for me, I felt invaded.  Sorry, no offence to christians.  I respect ur religion and I hope u respect mine too.  I know that in the studies of christianity, all other religions are evil.  </span></div></blockquote>yeah.. i went to this church once, and at tat tym i was wit the muslim girl, could say she was my first love.. and suddenly while at church.. a voice sprang and it kept telling me to break off the rel.. well,, i really broke off ah.. n im real sad.. till now.. but i do noe tat the girl still has smth for me ah.. so i guess its jus smth god didnt want to happen.. destiny perhaps?? so mayb its destiny we're talkin about???</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am a Christian.Have seen, heard and been through this type of BGR. As a Christian, I would like to have an ideal Christian partner.However, this wasn't God's way of doing things.I ended falling in love with a non-believer.I faced the same difficulties as most ppl do. I prayed and asked God why was this happening.The answer is Love. Jesus even loves ppl who are non-believers. He did not hate them for their ignorance.In fact, He showered more love on them so that they could see and feel for themselves.<br><br>The problem with religion is that we do things that we think is right. Like, having a partner with the same faith walking down the ailse. If all goes well, then fine. More often than not, these ended up in bitter divorces.My point is that are we marrying the person or the faith?<br><br>To sum up,  if you truly love each other, don't let religion be in the way.Man can plan but it is God that works.</div>

Couldn't some words be replaced for the lack of a better word?  And we all know from movies, etc, that some meanings are lost when words are replaced.<br><br>Furthermore, there've been quite a few cases whereby I've actually noted Christians quoting the Bible for THEIR OWN BENEFIT.

Does Christianity advocate Christians INTERFERING in their neighbours' affairs?  If God feels a couple shouldn't be together, let Him do the necessary.
