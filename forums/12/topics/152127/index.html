            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks for all the advice.<br><br>Some of you put it quite truthfully. She does love GOD more than myself. It does sound sad, but you see I am not jealous or what. Even if I am the 2nd man in her life, it doesn't bother me.  I mean, we do love each other, just that the topic of religion always gets between us.<br><br>I have already went to church with her, not by force or anything. I find the experience to be quite pleasant. I see a lot of people worship, but also because they have some form of problems or another. But up till now, I have no plead or favour that I want to ask. If there is, maybe to ask for my girl to return to me. But you see, without placing my faith into the regligion, she will not return to me. Situation sounds kinda complicated.<br><br>If I love her, I must put my heart into her faith. If not, then nothing. Sounds like a package deal. I thought the religion preaches love, understanding and compassion in the world, how to explain this kind of situation?</div>

After my past, I have cherished and worshipped life more than ever. But it turns out that I am more "free" than "faith".<br><br>You see, I'm usually curious about new ideas and stuff. If I happen to open a book on Quran or Buddhism, I think it may freak her out. I always keep an open mind about things and I find that sometimes Christians are not that compromising. Quite simply put, the topic of evolution will be rejected in the face without even finding out what it is. Isn't this vision kinda limited?</div>

I was quite surprise about the things they do.<br>They ask question like " Where ur from ? " or "how old you are "<br>to start the conversation. But i don sense the sincerety in them to know me.<br>They smsed me for a few days, and i putted a point across which i'm not interested in christianity, the sms stopped coming. Lol, come to think of it. I didn't even msg them once.<br><br>Seriously, I don't think your gal thinks she's on the "right" path, and she seriously wants you to be with her in the "right" Path. Sometimes this makes relationship hard when only one sides compromises or non.

Christians believe that bad things are put on men for them to learn and grow, so you can say it's kinda a test. ..</div>
