            <div class='col-md body'>You are stumbed because your question isn't even valid in the first place. People dont label due to the sheer fact that people have differing perspectives. Even if people have different faith, we all have a common set of socially acceptable morales.<br><br>I believe all of us respect each others' belief, but if religion is used as a reason or rather an excuse to go against morale, these people who do that deserve a scolding.<br><br>For example IF someone says that all non-christian will go to hell, he/she is cursing a whole group of people he/she doesnt even know. Do you think society is tolerant to people who behaves like that?<br><br>I am addressing an issue here, not suggesting that anyone is guilty of the above behaviour.</div>

No. </strong><br><br>Yep - being devoted does not mean one understands God - same for the christian.<br><br>Having read the bible, I can understand "why God deem a marriage based on love wrong simply because 1 part is Not Christian, yet chooses to pardon a murderer". I suggest the best way (if you want to find out a good answer) is to turn to the bible and let it do the talking.<br><br><strong>What I'm saying is, which you can't seem to understand, is that many Christians like to have ONE interpretation regarding this marriage business, &amp; I've SEEN many force their opinions on hapless couples.

Then how can they keep going, "This is right, this is wrong, you should leave this guy/girl because he's/she's Not Christian" so confidently as though they're God themselves? </strong><br><br>Maybe it's because explaining why is cheem and lengthy that some christians prefer the fast and straight-answer method which imo may not be rightly used for every case. For example, non-christian marry non-christian and one of them later become christian, is the new christian to leave the non-christian thereby breaking up the marriage?<br><br><strong>Then when told that there is still such a thing as choice &amp; rights, they make an about-turn &amp; say that other people are generalising them, blah blah blah.

Such that Christians can't tolerate non-Christians so much that they must force their opinions on a couple in which 1 party is Not a Christian? </strong><br><br>Some christians like me know it can get lengthy and just want to say it quick and go, preferring not to be "chiong hei" because it can get pointless and emotions get ruffed. Ur..everything gets ruffed. I don't become a heavenly PR with lotsa patience just by being christian.
