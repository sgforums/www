            <div class='col-md body'>You all should make an agreement never to debate, discuss, slander, insult, etc, each other's religion.<br><br>Excerpt from: <a href="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol6no3c.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol6no3c.htm</a><br><br>Volume 6 no 3<br><br>The Voice of Bliss<br><br>The family is our source of strength and happiness. Yet at times a diversity of religion and faith can exist within the family circle. The spirit of Buddhism advocates a freedom of choice, tolerance and mutual respect, for what good is there if there is religious homogeneity but a stark absence of happiness and bliss in the family? The key is practising the code of family ethics, compassion and loving-kindness and even if through these, others are not persuaded to the realm of Buddhism, let it be. Happiness and bliss, after all, is what all humanity seeks.<br><br>Happy Family<br><br>Mutual respect begets harmony<br><br>How may a family whose members have different religions live together harmoniously?<br><br>One common principle that mankind all over the world abides by is the freedom of choice of religion and faith. A country may have different religions co-existing at the same time, such as Buddhism, Catholicism, Christianity or Islam. But, we have to understand that it is the condition arising from love that causes people to have families, parents and children. It is a good thing if the family is happy and blissful. <strong>However, if the family members bear different faiths, so long as each member keeps his faith to himself, refrain from slandering or debating over each otherÂ’s faith, but mutually respecting each otherÂ’s faith and character, then the family will naturally be harmonious.</strong><br><br>Further, the younger generation ought to refrain from arguing with their elders because it is their parents who brought them up. Moreover, there is no purpose in arguing with them. We have to practise filial piety and be good so that we do them proud. Then, they will feel that their children are righteous, well behaved, and may willingly join us to learn about Buddhism. This will be ideal. Otherwise, it is not filial to constantly argue with them. When we learn and practise Buddhism, we have to exercise wisdom. With regards to differences in religions and faiths, as long as we maintain mutual respect, I believe, the family will be harmonious.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">p.s my master was once an active Christian pastor before</span><br><br></div>

Then I started to cry.. after tat they were singing songs and I stood there, not particiapting.. but suddenly heard a sound (sounds like condor, chinese call 'diao1') and flapping of wings.. then I was clapping along uncontrollably, against my wishes.  Then the sight was.. all the people seem to be hallucinated and losing their senses.. just like those scenes in the movies whereby walking dead corpses all heading towards one direction.  I started to cry more and more jialat.<br><br>That's when my buddy and fren sensed tat something's very not right with me and led me out of the church.  My fren was also crying, she felt bad that this happened.  I couldn't stop crying even when I boarded a bus lor... so many people were looking at me.  </span></div></blockquote>Hey, I took the Ribena and biscuit too. Actually, it was through pure ignorance that I took it. It was raining heavily when I arrived at church with my gf. Partially drenched and in a hurry, the people at the entrance offered something. I was so touched, that they tried to comfort us 'cause of the bad weather and stuff. My gf was shocked that I took it. Then when the singing and praying ended, I drank and ate. No special effects like yours leh.<br><br>Anyway, no offense to any Christians, I'm pretty much a free thinker. I mean, I got pray to 'Guan Yin' and took beef. I do not believe in restrictions by religion. Faith is supposed to guide, not set rules. If my freedom is at risk, I'll pretty much go haywire...!!!</div>

That is the first thing I read from the bible. But haven't finish reading yet. I think cannot compare...he's a totally faithful believer, while I'm a half past 10 believer with an open mind.  But nevertheless, I'll finish the book. Thanks!<br><br>Like I say, I do not disagree to religion or faith, as long as it makes sense. I also believe a strong faith is a good way to lead a life, but since this is pretty much a personal thing, nobody can force or hypnotise anybody to join against his/her will.<br><br>I think not all evolutionists dismiss religion, but have you heard of any creationists that believe in evolution? It seems pretty much one-sided. I'm pretty much neutral against this argument. We've heard of how many scientists cannot prove evolution and eventually joined chrisitianity, but how many of you did not hear about the others who are faithful believers who eventually gave up?<br><br>No offense to all, buddhist, christians, islam and all, everybody knows their religion is good.
