And you also have to know if she's one who's mature enough to handle it in a sober way.....</strong><br><br>You've hit the point. In fact, I did mention before if this r/s is too taxing on her and she wanna let go, I'm fine with it (although I know it'll hurt me very much) but no matter what it won't change my love for her neither will I leave her side as a friend. But her reply to me is that she's still fine with it (another meaning, she's still can struggle with it) and breaking up is still not her option right now and she's not thinking about it.</div>
