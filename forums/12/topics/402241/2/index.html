              <p>The reason you are in this situation is because you are neither here or there.</p>
              <p>You are not a kid, at least you think so, and you are not an adult yet, but you think you are.</p>
              <p>Your problem is one of acceptance.</p>
              <p>In life you have to accept that sometimes you cannot have it your way. NS will teach you that there is a pecking order in human society.  As you grow up you get more and more independent and free, how much depends on you and your station in life. There will always be rules and procedures to follow even as an adult, in whatever occupation you later take up.</p>
              <p>As for now as a 17 year old, just obey your parents. Where do you stay and where your pocket money comes from? If you resist, you will feel uncomfortable, just go along until you can be on your own. </p>

              <p>it is common among southern china....there is a root to its origin.</p>
              <p>I believe you can trace it to Southern Song dynasty. 750 A.D. where lots of folks were drafted and die fighting with the Mongols. Back than there wasn't news about what happen to their love ones? where were the remains. Dead soldiers were mass buried. Families members were distress and worried.</p>
              <p>There were huge community funeral celemonial either by family Clans or by Villages as such combination of all 3 teaching believe they all play a part in bringing back the lost soul back to the family, but i think it is more of allowing those alive to let go of the love ones. </p>
              <p>That was how it evolved from here into a religion which is Rojak basically.</p>
              <p>To Add: Some of the Saint figure is none other than rebellion general that fought against foreign invaders. As a remembrance and continue struggle against occupier by means of remembering them.</p>

              <p>TS,</p>
              <p>First of all understand that if for some reason your deep calling is rebelling and wants to move out of this religion or ritual practics than you should listen to it.   (There is a reason to it)</p>
              <p>Many times it is not about the teaching of the "religion" but rather you have tried to seek explaination and answer but couldn't find. As such rebelling against the ritual becomes a survivor aspect of your growing to be An independent Adulthood.</p>
              <p>Also need to taken account that your mind is still developing and needs answer, and homones changes at this age.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>AT your age it is not about religion and being supersititious.  You need Answers and further ritual and religion dogma isn't going to give you what you want.</p>
              <p>My suggestion is to read up the origin  of these ritual or religion particularly stretch to your family clam or the "Temple" Sometime knowledge and rationale is to unlock your misery.</p>
              <p>PS: by the way since you are only 17 just thought that there are plenty more important decision you have to made.  Growing up is about making important but mature decision. Just understand that you are still growing up. Be Bold.</p>
              <p>Best wishes.</p>

              <p>since bout 4 or 5, cant remember, i was being brought into a
              religion by my parents.</p>
              <p>some info about the religion is that, its not mainstream.</p>
              <p>i have to be vegetarian and attend classes. sometimes lots of

              <p>a few years back when i told my mother that "i cant bring myself
              to believe in this shit"<br> i got slapped for the first time in my life.</p>
              <p>i've been playing along with her, maintained my religious diet
              and attend classes.</p>
              <p>i feel the sudden need to break away from these patterns.. what
              should i do? i need your comments.</p>
              <p>the situation now is that i want to leave this religion asap but
              my whole family including my siblings is in this.. and of course my
              mother is still an enthusias.</p>

              <p>I ont see why you cannot leave the religion when you dont believe in it anymore. My friend is a malay and he used to be a Muslim and he is longer a Muslim now.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">For me, I am a born Buddhist. So I used to pray and be a vegetarian on 1st and 15th on the month. But Jesus came knocking my head in my dream since I am in pri 6. So in another words, "God has chosen me". So I ended in Church for Sunday Service for a while. But strangely, I will still automatically end up in the temple on 1st and 15th month in Bugis without planning. So I believe one has to go with the flow and that is the principle for Tao.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">So my advice is to go with the flow,</p>
              <p>"Tonight, do some prayer tell him that you want to leave your religion, ask him to give you sign or signal for his approval or disapproval. Or shake the "sticks in the container" ask for his approval, Or throw the "gua", Or the "two piece wooden leafs". Since it is the will of your God, then you or your parents cannot say anything also. Every1 is happy. d</p>

              <p>I see I see . Same religion . It is not not mainstream , it's a different variation .</p>
              <p>Sorry for misunderstanding , I understand your pain , since you've already experienced what meat tasted like .</p>
              <p>Actually since i'm from "Qiu dao" , so I hope you can understand my point of view that I am against you of leaving .</p>
              <p>Since you have attended lessons you would've understand that everything has a life and as you watch those killing process , it disgusts me and I do not know for you .</p>
              <p>Ultimately if you're leaving , I believe no one can stop you even your parents . It's your life . One way is to speak to other elders of the religion when you go for "Ting ban" .</p>
              <p>Most of them are experienced in a way , especially those conducting it .</p>
              <p>It's sad to see someone from the same religion leaving , although I know the pain of good food and friend's not being vegetarian and myself getting mocked at .</p>
              <p>One thing is that I am very lucky to be born a vegetarian .</p>
              <p>I wish you the best .</p>

Rear inside portion large flat based suited for munching vegetables and softer food objects. look at our front facing set of teeth. they are narrowed based shrp and suited for tearing meat and harded objects. we had since evolved from our ancester type under whatever names do care lah from carnivores to herbivores, we evoled to a state where our digestive systems starting from the mouth give us the ability to cnsume meat and vegetables. so we are not wrong to be able to consume both meat and vegetables. Of sourse we are free to practise religions but nothing and no beliefs should be powerful enough to oeeverwrite the laws of nature, where puny mankind no matter how intelligent and influential we claim we are think we have control over.

              TS,
              
              é�“å�¯é�“ï¼Œé�žå¸¸é�“ [your lesson got teach you these 6 words?]
              
              The "way" is not by mere words or blind faith.
              
              If you think u have found your "way" follow your heart and soul and go the right path.
              
              Words are limited, we cannot advice when it comes to beliefs and religon but you must remember å¤©å ‚åœ°ç‹±äººè‡ªé€ ,ç¥¸ç¦�æ— é—¨äººè‡ªå�¬.
              
              One should not believe in something out of fear, greed or mere ignorance.
