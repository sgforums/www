              <p>how old are you now?</p>
              <p>If you're still in ur teens...then all I can say is...you'll have to live with it for a while more.</p>
              <p>As long as it doesn't involve breaking the laws and etc...then just go along with it until you're old enough and can survive on your own.</p>
              <p>Either that or you could try and explain to your parents and try to get them to see it in your perspective. But I don't think this would work since your parents seem really stubborn about it. Hmmm but then again no harm giving it a try.</p>
              <p>What religion is it ah? Jehovah's witness?</p>

              <p>Religion is mostly culture. You leave it, you leave your culture. The only thing that divides people however is beliefs within the culture.</p>
              <p>My advice, is just live with it first. Wait till you're much older unless you're a good debater.</p>

              <p>Wah...hmmm seems time consuming and expensive..</p>
              <p>Is your mum paying for all these? If she is then just continue with it, and if it takes up too much of your time, then make up excuses (school work, projects, etc.) to get out of some of it. No point straining the relationship with your parents over this.</p>
              <p>From your post, I'm assuming that your parents are very strong believers of this religion. It'll be very difficult to change their minds.</p>
              <p>You'll have to let your parents know that this is taking up too much of your time and you need to concentrate on other stuff. Get her to give you some space first.</p>

              <p>You may be against this religion. But your parents aren't.</p>
              <p>Don't force your thinking/belief on to them just like what they have done to you. I can tell you that this would only make things worse.</p>
              <p>It doesn't matter if the religion is "true" or "false", as long as the people believing in it get some sort of reassurance or peace of mind.</p>
              <p>Like I've said, get of out of it if you can, but try not to hurt the relationship you have with your parents.</p>
