              Hi everyone, just rejoined the forum after a long hiatus...Â 
              
              Facing a big problem infront of me. I'm going to be 24 this year and I just realized that I have not learnt anything.Â 
              
              I graduated with a diploma in 2007 and was enlisted in NS for 2 years. I joined the coast guard and it was fun/boing. As soon as I was about to finish ns, my father pressured me to join a "non private security agency" coz "the economy was bad at the time". And so I join this agency.Â 
              
              For a time it was good. I learnt a few new things and how Singapore is at night. But after a year in the agency, I began to realize that I have not learnt much at all. Being in a security line, all I learn was to patrol around, answer complaints, chase people and write report. That's it.
              
              Now I have been transferred to a more static duty coz of shortage of man power and I began to see the dark side of office politics. Discussions through emails only ( I mean come on, I'm only one room away you inform of a new order through email and not bother to tell me? Then come to scold me for not following orders?), favoritism, hypocrisy, the fact that looking busy is more important that finishing work early and then slack around coz there is no more work, etc.
              
              This is when I began thinking what the hell am I doing here. I don't like this job. I'm surrounded with people miserable with their jobs. I have not learnt anything at all. I also began to hate wearing a uniform. I have worn a uniform since primary school and I don't want to be wearing it till I'm 50. I began to hate standing in line with people every morning for some jerk with a degree to inspect us and scold us for not shining our shoe. I hate the fact that I could never let my hair grow long.
              
              I really want to quit. But my father is having a fit over this. My father is the orang lama kind and is having a fit when I told him I don't like this job anymore. He says that if I quit, I'm throwing away a wonderful career.
              
              Also, all my life, I have been following someone else's orders, teachers, professors, parents and supervisors. I have also never tried looking for a job outside before.Â 
              
              So for the first time in my life, I have to think on my own. And I'm scared and don't know what to do. I don't have any contacts and my closest friends and poly dropouts. All I know that I better find something better to do with my life before I'm 30 and realize that all I know in life is security.
              
              Any advices would help coz at this point, I have no idea what to aim for or what to do. And I have a limited saving of 17k that I don't plan to touch.

              <p>Hi there.. these kinda office politics will be everywhere.. especially at the offices which are having less man count. (Less than 100 people?). If more people means there are more things to do and everyone will be busy looking at their own problems.</p>
              <p>All you need is a change of Job. Between you didn't mention which specialization you are having from Poly.</p>
              <p>Try to join some MNC which is having more people. There the rules will be same for everyone. I mean less politics and being bossy thing... so that you won't feel down.</p>
              <p>Firstly  - No point doing a job you don't like (sacrificing yourself for your father in this matter is wasting your life.)</p>
              <p>Secondly - Job is a part of life which is to earn money. Job is not our life.</p>
              <p>Like your father's say "wonderful career", there is nothing / no job called wonderful. We will hate or may don't want to continue every job at certain point of time. We need changes man.. not stuck somewhere and end the life there..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Good luck !!!</p>

              I have a diploma in business admin, supply chain management. But I have never worked in this line before dispute studying for it. It's quite a generic field.
              
              But my friends advice is to try working for all other fields like fnb and tutoring so that I would see the world more. But one thing is for sure. I would never want to be a drone my whole file...

              <p>Go to a private security agency. This sector has a future in Singapore.</p>
              <p>At present the "jaga" mentality of the Security Officers (security guards) still remains, but is slowly beig replaced by professionalism.</p>
              <p>Demand for Security by commercial complexs, condominium, malls, buildings, institutions, is ever on the rise. The 'kuching-kurab' agencies take up the low end demands and the professional ones the high end ones.</p>
              <p>With your experience you can easily rise up in the ranks of a private security agency, if only you take interest in the profession, and always seek to upgrade yourself.</p>
              <p>Strive to be an expert in security matters, and you will be in demand.</p>
              <p>It will be exciting arranging security for rock concerts, visiting VIPs, grand events, against terrorist threats etc.</p>
              <p>You must want to work for it, not sit down and wish for it.</p>

              <p>Security job is a dead end job. The migrants from PRC and India are coming to flood our low end jobs. Soon Singaporeans will not be able to find low paid jobs.</p>
              <p>Your father like any other father wants us to do a dead end routine job. Fathers only want us to earn money, they want us to have security. But it is your destiny, you must decide, notyour father.</p>
              <p>If I were you, I would do anything, take a loan, sell property, anything ! in order to go somewhere and take up my studies. To survive in Singapore, you have to be a degree holder or else you will be look down upon and even the PRC migrants will be become your boss.</p>
              <p>If you are a poly drop out, suggest you go overseas to look for studies. Are you a malay? Malaysia supports a lot of malay and subsidise their studies. There are a lot of cheap universities in Malaysia that have twinning programmes that charge half the price of Singaporean colleges.</p>

              I'm not a poly dropout... =.= yes I am a Malay... The ones that dropped out are my friends...
              
              Yes I've heard so many times that security agency is where the money is at... But must consider the costs... A lot of people that join my current security agency share the same story which is kinda scary...
              
              "I joined coz I don't know what to do after NS" and "the starting pay is very good". But then when talking to the orang lama in the agency, many say "even if I want to find another job, all I know is security"
              
              Right now, 70 to 90% of the time, my job is to sit around, walk/drive around and watch as time pass me by making sure that people don't do bad things. Rarely do I feel I create any real quantifiable value to someone. As a business student, my professors taught me that a lot of money a company makes is wasted on paying workers that don't really make any significant input to the company. So I don't think that spending my time is a security agency is going to make me more mature, it only makes my learn how to follow orders.

              <p>Take some time to figure out what you LOVE doing / your strengths and passions.</p>
              <p>Then get off your butt and see which industries would best utilise those areas.</p>
              <p>Make the decision to leave.</p>
              <p>Realise that your father has no faith in you; the same that my own didn't have faith in me. He just wants to make sure that you don't starve because he doesn't think you can make it on your own steam.</p>
              <p>One day, he will be dead anyways. Any consequences that arise from your decision will be borne by you alone. make sure he knows that. Be prepared for the sneer.</p>
              <p>Put your pride aside. Accept an entry-level position into a well-researched field of your choice. Count on your passion and will power to push you through the first years. Be noticed.</p>
              <p>Go far.</p>
              <p>Do what you love. Be the best at it. Do that and the money will come.  </p>
              <p>Yeah but first. Get off your butt.</p>

              <p>I know of a singaporean malay who is a malaysian PR because his mom was born in Malaysia. He went to malaysia and was able to enter a local malaysian university at subsidise fees. He then took up postgraduate twinning with a UK university, paid in ringgit, cheaper than any other university had he tried to study in UK or singapore.</p>
              <p>After his studies, he went back to singapore to work, like any other white collar worker.</p>
              <p>So, you could follow his path because university education in malaysia is cheap and easy to get in. As a malay, you could easily obtain the PR in malaysia and enjoy the benefits there.</p>
