            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Jona,<br><br>i think if u have already spent the money, then it's over. What u can do now is the least is to be able to see that ur dad is willing to sacrifice so much for u... This is what i call parental love, give everything for their child, n nothing for themselves. Sometimes we only know the value of money when we sweat n toil for it. But now that u have an opportunity to learn by seeing from someone's elses exp. I think u should make the best out of the situation. Money is hard to come by these days my dear...<br><br>I wish u all the best.</div>

I suppose now you can appreciate what he has done for you. Many times, parents may not know how to express themselves, so they always tell you to study hard. By getting the comp for you, was your dad's way of telling you he loves you. I'm sure he spent the money willingly. If he knew that you appreciate what he has done, that's more than enough for him. Great things are happening...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
