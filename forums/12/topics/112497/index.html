            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all. I was speaking to this ex classmate of mine just yesterday. He is a homosexual. Yes, he openly admits he is sexually attracted to guys. In primary school, he once told his form teacher that he wanted to be a female wrestler. So after our little chat to catch up with the past, he became depressed and said that he cant see why singaporeans are open minded enough to accept his as a human being. I have many friends who are also like him(thats because Im from an all guy school). the sad thing about them is that, they are being shunned and hated for showing love to a person with the same sex.

In London, we have a very vibrant gay culture here, and I am growing to realise that gays are people, and they aren't as different as you or me. I used to think that gay clubs have lots of um... Ass screwing going on and all sorts of sexual debauchery going on in them, like guys being done up the Ass at the bar etc... but now I realise its not true, and that having guys kissing guys on the dance floor or getting more touchy feely in the more private areas of a club is no different from what goes on in a straight club.<br><br>In a sense, this is a society that is very accepting of gays, but at the same time, a few months back, a barman was murdered by a group of teens for being gay. It is in a way, a split of society. Gay clubs do enforce a majority gay and lesbian door policy, and straight people and gay people usually go to their respective clubs.<br><br>Personally, I've been opening my eyes to how it is for someone to be gay, as my best mate is gay. Oh also, here, gay is used to describe someone who likes others of the same gender. Hence, gay can be used to mean girls as well. Yes my best mate is a gay gal. We are really close and I've been offered valuable insights to what it is like to be gay. She moans about her ex(like many straight people do), pulls occasionally in clubs(like straight people do), generally loves to go clubbing and meeting new people(like straight people do), and thats about it. The only difference is that gay people are more open in nature, and Gay guys don't mind dancing with gay or straight gals or with straight guys and vice versa(Remember, to dance with a straight guy or a gal to them is like a straight guy having to dance with a gay guy or vice versa) If they know you are straight, they mostly respect your sexuality and do not hit on you. They do not mock you for not having the same sexuality they do. Unfortunately, I cannot say the same for straight people.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>OTher than the weird factor<br><br>I guess some of the bad eggs in that community attribute to this dislike.<br>I know that the gay men like to hit on straight men. I have often caught gay men openly admire my guy up and down and even trail him. The lustful look in their eyes are very openly display to my guy to make sure he knows the meaning(arse action). Its a longing look that is not even used by females nowadays and sometimes they start stroking their bodies and this is the point where it gets disgusting. Worse part of this is that these gay men ignore my presence totally while oogling him. However, some gays and lesbians will display hatred in their actions, eyes or whatever ways they can to the real women (don't know why they target women). I have a gay person and many lesbians (possibly a bi too) in office and in my first couple of years, as a straight, I got very bad treatment from them for no reason. I am not even close to these people. I didn't understand till like my 3rd year in the office where someone dragged me aside (he was leaving the company) and told me who are the gays and lesbians and why I am treated this manner.<br>To me, its their choice to be whatever they want to be. However, to take their anger out on me led me to dislike them all the more although prior to that, I never had any opinion of them. I simply find them disgusting in the manner they treat themselves as special creatures and think that everyone should change our mindsets just for them.  I don't go about calling people les or gay, but if they want respect, they should start respecting others. If its our choice to call them names, its our choice. Then fat people should also come out and say they don't like all the degoratory names like pig, fat, horizontally challenged and etc. Same goes. we are people who are biased and "colored" our views in this manner. If they don't like to hear all that, then adjust their lifestyle to avoid these encounters. I stopped shopping cause I hate certain things that people do to me.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If they are rude, dislike them, not gays in general.<br><br>Anyway i think its a vicious cycle. By being gay, they are subjected to the pressures of society and family to "change". This contributes to their character, outlook and the way they handle relationships. Btw. it is a statistical fact that homosexual relationships last shorter than heterosexual relationships. I think this is due to the aforementioned pressures.<br><br>Also, being openly gay is in iteself a rejection of societal norms, so the people who are openly gay may by have a greater tendency to behave in a deviant manner.<br><br>I do not think that they behave in that way because they are gays. They behave in that manner because of our intolerant society. If our country and society is more tolerant of them, i believe there will be less incidences of these deviant behaviour.<br><br>The scandinavia countries like Denmark and sweden is testament to the fact that gays can function well within society.<br><br>Note: Deviant behav as mentioned refers to the type mentioned by misty blue<br><br>Back to the topic: Migrate to denmark/sweden. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Unfortunately Singaporeans have grown into this stereotype that being homosexual goes against the will of God. Obviously they didn't keep in mind that God might be having his plans in his Bible for homosexuals to be in the world.<br><br>You're not the only one with friends who are homosexuals. Being homosexual is like being a vegetarian, it's quiet, it's discreet, nobody knows till you tell them or ask them.<br><br>At present, Singapore isn't big enough or open minded enough with this homosexual business, no matter how differently they claim to be. We are still too conservative.<br><br>My advice to your friend would be to find a job that takes him to another country, stay or migrate to places like Amsterdam, London, New York, San Francisco, Sydney etc far from the reaches of Asian community. The people in these cities have learnt to live with homosexuals and are really open minded about it.<br><br>And do watch your back, not all homosexuals are who they claim to be.</div>
