            <div class='col-md body'>hmmm... I think you should go to his house, and sit down and talk to him. But at the first place, I believe u should have stopped him from joining the MLM company, unless it is a reputable company. But i'll not talk about wat u should have done, cos nothing can change wat has happened.<br><br>just go to his house and sit down and talk with him. Dun go in and shout at him or anything, listen to wat he has to say first. If he really dun have the money to pay u back, ask him to pay in installment. like $200 per month or something like that.<br><br>If he simply refuses to pay u back for watever reasons, give him a tight slap and leave. There's really nothing u can do, u dun have a iou or anything similar, therefore going to the police won't help. If you really want to try and get the money back, as a last resort, go talk to his parents, i'm sure they know u. Tell them wat happened and ask them if it's possible to pay u back the money. But please dun quarrel with the parents for the money, cos the parents has no obligations to pay for their son.<br><br>Good LUCK!!!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
