            <div class='col-md body'>Well, if you feel a bit "paiseh" to use the direct approach like going to him, giving him a fatherly hug, telling him you still love him and you're not angry with him anymore, then you may want to try the INDIRECT approach.<br><br>You can try any one of the suggestions below, or if you can think of any other subtle way, that could work too:<br><br>1)  "da bao" (pack) supper back for him one of these days since he works late. If you don't feel like talking to him yet, you may want to write a simple note and leave it on the table.<br><br>2)  On his birthday, or on father's day, buy a small card or even a present for him. Once again, if you feel that you're not ready to give it to him directly, you can put the gift on his bed, or ask one of your family members who's living under the same roof, to pass it to him.<br><br>3)  When you're outside, pretend to give him a call and ask him if he knows where Sungei Gedoh (or other location) is, and say you're lost and you need directions (it's appropriate to ask him this since he drives, so he may know the roads of singapore well).<br><br>The bottom line is to do a simple gesture so that he gets the idea that you're ready to accept him again, that you're ready to let bygones be bygones. I hope everything works out fine between you and your dad from now on.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>what james say is correct,<br><br>AND DO NO procrastinate, cuz if he is like ignored or "neglected" then he may feel sad and despondent and go to gamble again!!!!<br><br>so make him feel at home and let him enjoy the family warmth, then he knows that everything is slowly getting back....else he may want to "forget" his problems by gambling again.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Initiate a family dinner as it'll encourage closer ties. Get him a gift to show that you still appreciate him as a father if his bday is round the corner. Can also get him a massager since he's working long hours.<br><br>Do not wait till it's too late to show concerns for your loved ones. Act now, and the results will be rewarding. Family is after all your family. Rem, blood is thicker than water.<br><br>Good luck!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>practical ways of starting include:<br><br>1) make milo for him when he's in the shower after coming home from work.<br><br>2) watch tv with him. u dun have to say anything, just pretend you're really interested in the show, that way u dun have to feel very awkward.<br><br>3) personally, i like the calling to ask where sungei buloh is idea. do something like that. talk to him about non-personal stuff... and act natural about it.</div>
