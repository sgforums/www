None of my girlfriends ever said that to me before, nor do the guys I dated bothered about my ex-bfs nor do I hear them complain about their current bf complaining about their exs.<br><br>Either that or the guy is someone who thinks that he has to be the first with the girl. No point looking back in the past. If the guy keeps looking backwards and not forward I think it's high time to move on  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Anyways you don't have to tell your current bf about your ex. I mean if you complain about yr ex it means you still carry along with you alot of emotional baggage and if you compare it will definately make the guy insecure.<br><br>Best is to not even mention your exs in front of current bf. Just give a generic reply if he ask about why bother about the past when we are living for the future.</div>

Neither guys or girls are able to accept the fact if either one of them still maintains contact with their ex-gf/bf. Which girl can actually tolerate the fact that her bf still maintains friendly contact with his ex? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I guess the reason behind our behaviour is solely due to our upbringing and our environment. Our society simply doesn't have the tolerance for this type of relations to co-exist in the first place, so we were brought up in that manner.<br><br>One of the solution is to make sure that the guy is never restless in a relationship. Once a guy is restless, he will start looking at other girls or finding fault with his own girl or comparing his girl with other girl. So girls....keep him busy with your schedule, occasional quarrels, spontaneous behaviours and of cos...helping him stay on track with his ambitions and goals (If he has any).  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>One of the biggest mistake that both guys and girls can make during a relationship is to start pointing fingers at each other. So if your bf/gf start to point finger or pick on you, the best way out is to ignore his/her nonsense until everything blew over and he/she has cooled down. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Anyway good luck to your relationship, some Singaporean guys are difficult to be with...especially if they have a close mind. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>
