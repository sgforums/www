In fact, I believe most of the guys I know won't mind too...<br><br>For those who would mind.. I guess it can be that they are really 'traditional' (only in this aspect?); have some inferiority complex issues; immature in thinking; living in their own world; etc..<br><br>My policy and personal advice would be... "If you can't handle it, don't ask..."<br><br>Well... Unless it's their gf who just can't help bringing up their ex in the 1st place..? Then that would be a different issue altogether...?</div>

I dun think the girl will feel secure either.. but i digress..<br><br>I have a gf and she has an ex.. but i think she does convince me that it is dead... as in the relationship.. and there is really no contact between them..  so why should i want to bother about the past when all that matters is really the present and the future..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Experiences with my ex boyfriends with regards to past issues (generalization).<br><br>He- refers to my ex boyfriends, not just one.<br><br>1. Mentioning of number of ex boyfriends<br>The number of ex boyfriends doesn't really matter so much. In fact he feels that i have quite a few ex, showing that i am good and he feels victorious (so long i do not keep staring at other guys). He would not dump me certainly.<br><br>2. Mentioning of ex boyfriends' deeds<br>This seems to irritate him enough and he become angry or sad. Thereafter, he would also start telling me how good his ex girlfriend is. Guys are revengeful. Still he is with me.<br><br>3. Mentioning about my past experience<br>When I thought i could share my past in truth to him. On how I stri.. because I lose a bet, on how i slept with my ex sitting down in public (we did not do anything) ..etc. He become very sensitive yet more touchy. Still he think no one is perfect, i should be the one for him. Still together.<br><br>4. Found someone else<br>After i did the above three, he is still around but he also secretly spend time looking for others. He found one pretty girl (would not lose to me in terms of looks), he broke up with me saying we are not compatible or cannot accept my past. Nowadays, guys dump you when he got another tyre.<br><br>End of Story</div>
