In many instances, the past is not strong enough to break up a relationship, unless it is very drastic case like Aids, Homosexualty etc<br><br>The wise words for couples are: "The smart ones should not reveal too much, the smart ones should also not ask too much"; if the couple is serious about a future relationship.<br><br>Revealing of one past to your the other half is necessary for him to know you better; on your values, background, likes and dislikes, habits etc. However, avoid revealing things that you do in the past that you feel is damaging to the relationship, because you are building a future not a past.</div>
