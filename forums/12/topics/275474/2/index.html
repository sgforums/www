            <div class='col-md body'>friends are important as they will play a part in forming our character. being with a group of friends who are constantly doing bad things will lead us to do the same and if they do positive and worthwhile recreational activities then we will end up following. so maybe its best that you find a new group of friends who will cherish you not only as a person, but rather, a person who makes a difference in their life. i wish you luck zhane, i'm sure there are a lot of these people, just keep looking out for them</div>

When you see them playing together happily , and you yourself is alone . Then u wanted to join in , they hesitate . Then when you play , they never pass you the ball ( for example) at all , then say you lousy.<br><br>Then during recess , they will ask me buy things aka shun bian buy things . I wanted to say no , but under peer pressure , i gave in and said yes . I know that im those blur type , and sometimes i shortchanged the money. I ended up having to pay myself and got scolded by the canteen auntie .<br><br>Then when one of them got birthday party , they seldom call me one . During the party , they took a video of it as well . I think " how i wished i was there as well".<br><br>Thats why sometimes i feel like having a girlfriend. Cause i can love her and for her to love me in return . All i wanted is to feel appreciated and in turn ,  love that person alot . Ofcuz if its a guy , friendship love lah hor , not gay !  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Girls are usually more soft hearted and understand how plp feel , boys tend to ignore plp feelings . Thats why sometimes with girls around , i feel more comfortable . Well , ofcuz with nice girls .

Then they will like comfort you if you are down. But with my group of 'friends' , they will laugh and mock at me sometimes.<br><br>Then i got this fcuked up friend ( sorry to use that word) who always disturb me . I kinda feel that he bullies me in a mild way . Im utterly pissed off with him and sometimes i feel like pulling a punch on him . But on second thoughts , beating him isn't the best idea . But im really angry with him . Then now that i have a GF , he said this " Eh i love her alot leh ... I want fcuk her upside down...." Feel like killing him literally. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>All that you and me wanted is to feel wanted and appreciated right?

Got similar things then can joke and suan each other, otherwise people talk then you nothing to talk, then they dun find you interesting lor. By the way, I am also those quiet type of person lor, so i know when i no similar interest with people, then can't really hang out with them, that's why my group of friends quite small. I only quite good at talking cock and being crazy lor, natural born siao lang keng.</div>

You keep mentioning "he" and "him".<br><br>If that is the case then it is not a matter of you not having "friends" it is a matter of you not having a certain someone you want.<br><br>You should clarify this matter so as to get good help in the forum.<br><br>If in fact you do not feel you have any real "friends", not just this one guy, but any friends. Then I ask you why do you bother with those people. Instead of people the person on the outside of a circle loking in, create your own dam circle of friends.<br><br>Do things that make others want to be your friends.<br><br>Try to organise outings or get togethers etc. Do not be the one following others, lead your own group.<br><br>Organise a movie outting or a outting at a chalet or whatever.

            <div class='col-md body'>People you talk about sounds like 'choleric' type. They are the ones who talk loud and decisive. When forming a group, they are the one who stand up and choose people. If you are not one of them, then there is only one way, you should be the most wanted one. How to be the most wanted by many? It's only if you are unique!<br><br>See your life back for a while, what are you good at? Sport? Science? Art? Everyone has talent, and everyone can be extremely good at something. The question is, have you found your talent? Do you realize what you do good without suffering? If you haven't found your talent, then that's the first thing you should do to fix your life. If you have known yourself very well, then I suggest you stick with people who have same interest, so at least they will see you at upper level because you are good at it. A sporty guy will be a 'spare tyre' in the midst of geeky guys, and vice versa... common sense, right?<br><br>Know yourself, find your place, and enjoy your life!</div>
