Then I'd propose you do the following;<br><br>#1 Go make loads of money... so he will never have to work... you give him as much money as he needs... buy him watever he needs...<br><br>#2 Never say no to sex... even if you know he's definitely infected with something down there (or anywhere else)<br><br>#3 Keep telling him that he's the best f*%k in the whole wide world (on second thoughts, don't say that, least he thinks you've slept with someone else and you had someone to bench-mark his performance)<br><br>#4 Keep telling yourself that he can never be wrong, even when he hits you, verbally abuse you or do anything that will hurt you physically and / or emotionally<br><br>#5 Do anything and everything he says... even when you know it is not right<br><br>#6 He scold you... just say sorry... and smile...  Do the same if he slaps you... and remember to turn to your other cheek to him, and say slap this side as well...<br><br>#7 Isolate yourself from the rest of the world... cos at this rate you're going... there's not much chances you'd have any friends too<br><br>#8 Tell your mom what he did to you (yes, include all the abuses)... and tell her that it is ok... cos he's not really as bad as you make him out to be (cos that's what you are telling us)<br><br>#9 Find a job in an all-female environment... and make sure there's no way you can possibly have male colleagues (try a nunnery)<br><br>#10 Don't groom yourself anymore... least it invites unwarranted attention from the opposite sex... make sure you look like some old auntie...<br><br>If you practice this 10 things... I'd think you can last for a longer time... If he's insanity doesn't cripple you...<br><br>Take good care girl... after saying all these... this is a public forum... and you are welcome to come back here anytime...  You have a mind of your own about your relationship already.... if you think it's right, no one else can tell you otherwise...<br><br>All the best....</div>
