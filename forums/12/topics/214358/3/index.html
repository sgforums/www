I think it's more of habit (perhaps sexual) than love that you stay in the relationship.<br><br>Before you change him or anyone, you need to change yourself first.  Perhaps, change the way you look at yourself i.e. tell yourself that you are worthy and deserve love and respect.  You have to learn to love yourself and have self respect for yourself.   Seek some counselling if you need to... just sort out your own personal issues first before committing yourself in a relationship.  I am sure once you have done that, you will be a happier person.<br><br>Good luck, my friend!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>

He is only interested in having sex with u and when desperate, u will be his prey to fulfill his sex fantasy.<br><br>For advice, please sit down with yr bf and have a clear talk. Ask him why he's so diff from the past? Ask him anything you want to know. Cuz if a man loves a woman, he will pampered her and try to give anything as long as she likes. Of course now and then couple will have small fight but better ask now and if yr bf lost interest in u, leave him and find yrself a new bf.<br><br>Or maybe yr bf is those big man's idea who likes to take control and also say u this no good that not good. When he say yes you cannot say no. Well, on and off, you have to take control too. Dun pampered him too much. Talk sense to him.<br><br>P/S: Try testing him if u meant anything to him. Make him jealous, see how he react. Seduce him by doing small touches kisses,hugs and licks but dun give in to him, make him desperate. Slowly can control, 'Sa Jiao' a bit to make him give in but dun over do it.

There is no power struggle, because you have given up your position to be his equal mate and reduce yourself to that of a acolyte.<br><br>You make all the sacrifice to his every whim. In return, I hope you understand that there will be zero respect from your man. You are dutifully 'rewarded' as and when he fancy, and not because love naturally made him so. If you could live with such a situation, then fine, because I know some women are like that. And this category of woman probably believed that love means suffering as they have never understood how it is like to be a man's equal and walk beside him.<br><br>I worried about you giving him whatever you reckon is pleasurable to him. Why do you have to love someone, with you constantly on a facade? Giving whatever you thinks he likes is a sign of donning a mask - you want to appear to be like a mate who could cater to his every needs, in the end, your man is likely to prefer your persona and not your real self.<br><br>There is inhibition of personalities and they are suppressed because of your fear to lose this relationship. Ultimately you are left with two choices: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>drop that mask and risk losing the relationship, or keep that mask and lose yourself.</strong></span><br><br>I don't know about your limit, but if a man - someone you deemed as your boyfriend - is capable of slapping you, walking out on you, calling you back for sex, throwing you out the house with 10 dollars for cab fare... all in ONE feat, this is something many guys cannot even put themselves to do it. And if you are thinking about changing him, you better prepare to have a trashed esteem and emotional state.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

Actually, it's only an illusion... you only think you cannot leave and allow yourself to be subjected to such ill treatment.<br><br>If you are trying to source for people to agree with you... saying you can't leave him, I guess you are likely to look for an affirmation to remain with him despite terrible treatment.<br><br>I am not saying you had to leave him; but you cannot eliminate the possibility that if the situation is overbearing, you must give yourself a route to leave the relationship. Talk to him: yes... do what you can: yes... but if all fails, for gawd sake, exercise some wisdom.<br><br>P.S: NOBODY has the prerogative to abuse anyone in a relationship. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Any abusive relationship is not love - it is a karmic relationship</strong></span>. Usually, I never like to dissuade anyone suffering in a karmic relationship because nothing goes in... so my advice is just go let him hurt you badly... let him trash your soul, your esteem, your ability to live and think like a human... then probably you will learn something from there.<br><br>First sight of love... last breath of wisdom.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>
