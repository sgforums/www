You mentioned you have 5 As in your 'O' Levels. Someone like you should have a lot of choices right? We are your pillar of support. We are your encouragement. Why limit your choices to this bf of yours?<br><br>Ask yourself: If pleasing him makes you happy, does that mean you have to please him all the time? All the way till the end of time? Assuming he is always very angry everyday, does that mean you will always not be happy everyday? Someone of great intelligence like yours should know what to do.<br><br>I think it is very hard to talk to you through logic...coz you have been messed up with emotions.<br><br>You need a real friend.
