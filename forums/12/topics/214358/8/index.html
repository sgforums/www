Don't think anyone with any common sense will tell you what you want to hear (i.e. to stay with your bf) if that's what you are hoping for.<br><br>We can only give you what we believe it's best for you but at the end of the day you are the only one who can help yourself.  Your future rests in your own hands.... you have 2 choices - to make it better by splitting up with your self-centred bf or to ruin the rest of your life by continuing your relationship with your self-centred bf.  The choice is yours.  You have a bright future ahead of you and please don't ruin it.  If you don't have any friends, come on, I am happy to be your friend and I believe there are many out there would be happy to give you the support you need.<br><br>If you choose to continue with the relationship, like one of the forummers metnioned, I hope you are practising safe sex otherwise you are putting your own health at risk and even your children one day.<br><br>Good luck!</div>
