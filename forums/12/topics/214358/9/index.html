Deep down inside you... do you think he really really loves you?

You'd just need to pick up the phone... call a good friend... cry it out... and face the fact that this time it just didn't work... but you did your best...<br><br>Babe... if you ever need listening ears... just PM me...

            <div class='col-md body'>This is the article I have got from a website and hope that'll help you to identify the trend of an abusive relationship.<br><br><blockquote> No respect, no relationship<br><br>We look for relationships so that we can share part of our lives. In a good relationship the partners support each other, sharing the good times and helping each other through the tough ones.<br><br>When someone matters deeply to us, and those intense feelings of love and respect are returned, it enables us to face the world with confidence.<br><br>Things will not always go smoothly. Building and maintaining a healthy relationship needs a commitment from both partners to work at it.<br><br>But it is worth it, because in a good relationship people feel good about their partner and good about themselves.<br><br>Not all relationships work that way, no matter how much we might want them to. When there is violence or intimidation the relationship can become very destructive and physically and emotionally dangerous.<br><br>While every person's experience of an abusive relationship will be different, there are some common patterns of controlling behaviour and abuse, which are often evident before the relationship becomes physically violent:<br><br>Possessiveness<br>- checking on their partner all the time to see where they are, what they're doing and who they're with<br>- trying to restrict where they can go and who they can see<br><br>Jealousy<br>- accusing their partner of being unfaithful or flirting without good reason<br>- isolating their partner from family and friends, often by rude and objectionable behaviour<br><br>Put downs<br>- humiliating their partner, either publicly or privately by attacking their intelligence, their looks or capabilities<br>- constantly comparing their partner unfavourably with others<br>- blaming the partner for all the problems in the relationship<br><br>Menace &amp; Threats<br>- yelling, sulking and deliberately damaging things that are of importance to their partner<br>- threatening to use violence against their partner, the partner's family, friends or even a pet </blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Continuing on from my previous post ......<br><br><blockquote><br>ItÂ’s not OK<br>ItÂ’s not OK to be physically threatened or scared into things which make you uncomfortable or unhappy, just because you are in a relationship.<br><br>CarolineÂ’s Story<br>I was with my boyfriend Matt for a year and a half. At first, I thought he was Â‘the oneÂ’ Â– we used to have such a great time when we went out together and he was always telling me how special I was. But then he changed. HeÂ’d get really paranoid and jealous and think I was cheating on him. He was always yelling at me. After a while it felt like I couldnÂ’t do anything right, he was angry with me all the time. One time after weÂ’d been to a party we had a huge fight. He said IÂ’d been coming on to one of his mates, and he slapped me hard across the face. After that, it got worse. Mum was really worried about me. I tried to make excuses for Matt but she said it was Matt who had the problem. My best friend told me the same thing. I talked to a counsellor and she explained that if I was so special to him then he wouldnÂ’t hurt me. If he really cared about me, he wouldnÂ’t hit me. I have a new boyfriend now. He really respects me. Sure we argue sometimes. But we have a great relationship where we can both talk about things honestly. It feels good and I feel good.<br><br>Sharon and DaveÂ’s Story<br>It all started a couple of months after our daughter Emma had started seeing Michael. We didnÂ’t like him because we thought that he was too possessive. She stopped seeing her friends so she could be with him, but he would still get jealous, and yell at her if she did something he didnÂ’t like. We found it difficult to talk to her about it Â– when we said something, she would say he only got jealous because he loved her. We didnÂ’t want to interfere, because we didnÂ’t want her to sneak around and see him without us knowing, but the whole relationship just didnÂ’t seem right. His behaviour was having an impact on the whole family. His angry moods got worse, and one day she came back from a weekend away with cuts and bruises. After that we called a relationship counselling line, and they really helped. They helped with ways to approach Emma and talk to her about MichaelÂ’s abusive behaviour, and help her understand that she wasnÂ’t to blame for his actions. When Emma broke it off, we helped by taking his phone calls for her. Now things are back to normal Â– Emma feels good about herself and is doing really well at uni.<br><br>ItÂ’s not OK to be put down and pushed around Â– shoved, hit, slapped, kicked, punched. No one deserves to be treated this way. No one should use violence Â– or the threat of violence Â– to make you do what you donÂ’t want to do.<br><br>ItÂ’s not OK for someone to use the excuse that they are tired, stressed, over worked or under financial pressure as a reason for their violent behaviour.<br><br>Breaking the cycle of violence<br>A violent relationship may not be violent all the time. Some of the time, violent people treat their partners very well. They can be very loving and sorry for their violent behaviour. It can make it hard to see whatÂ’s really happening. There is a strong chance that the violence will get worse over time and the relationship more abusive.<br><br>After a violent incident, itÂ’s common for both the abusive partner and the victim to try and make it OK Â– make excuses, apologise, promise to change. But there is no excuse for this behaviour and just saying sorry is not good enough. Sometimes the violent person will blame the victim Â– Â“it wouldnÂ’t happen if you did what I saidÂ”.<br><br>Things may settle down for a while Â– the abuser may feel guilty, the victim may try to go along with whatever they want. Usually itÂ’s only a matter of time before the build-up to violence starts again.<br><br>For someone who is experiencing violence in a relationship, things can feel very confusing, especially if this is their first relationship. They may try to make excuses, think of it as an isolated incident or something that only happened because their partner was drunk or stressed. They may not be sure what behaviour to expect from a partner.<br><br>People subject to violent abuse can begin to think that the violence is their fault. They might start to try to fit in with whatever their partner wants, even if it makes them uncomfortable. They might feel scared that their partner will hurt them if they try to leave.<br><br>SophieÂ’s Story<br>I had a close friend in school called Rachel. We were quite good friends through school and uni, where she met Marcus. He was a popular guy but had a violent temper. It became pretty clear that he was knocking her around. The stories sheÂ’d make up to explain the bruises were pathetic. She was always making excuses for him. She was a really bright girl but when Marcus dumped her she just went to pieces. She dropped out of uni and ended up living with Ian. Ian was just like Marcus. Somehow she seemed to think she didnÂ’t deserve any better. It was impossible to see her without Ian being around and he was so rude. I guess I just gave up and we lost touch.<br><br>I heard from one of our other school friends that Ian just got more and more violent. But Rachel just couldnÂ’t bring herself to leave him - the last beating was so bad she ended up in hospital. I never had the courage to talk to her about Marcus or IanÂ’s abusive behaviour. I sometimes wonder what would have happened if I had. Maybe I could have encouraged her to talk to the police or a counsellor about what was happening. Maybe I should have tried to make her understand that she wasnÂ’t the problem - that she didnÂ’t deserve to be treated like that, and most men are not like that.<br><br>Breaking up any kind of relationship is hard to do, but it can be particularly hard to leave a violent boyfriend or partner.<br><br>When you are frightened and your selfesteem is low, it can be hard to find the strength to leave. ItÂ’s sometimes easier to hope that things will change for the better. Too often they donÂ’t.<br><br>But the first step in changing things is to understand whatÂ’s been happening is wrong. Even if your boyfriend or partner says they care about you and you care about them, itÂ’s not OK to be treated like this.<br><br>Talk to someone<br>Listen to your feelings and trust them Â– if something doesnÂ’t feel right, it probably isnÂ’t. Talk to someone who cares about you. Talk to your Mum or Dad, a family member, a friend, or someone in your community like your doctor, your teacher, your local religious leader, or call the campaign Helpline for confidential advice.<br><br>Find someone you trust and tell them about whatÂ’s happening to you. DonÂ’t feel ashamed or embarrassed.<br><br>You are not responsible for somebody elseÂ’s violent behaviour. Your first responsibility is to yourself Â– get safe and stay safe.<br><br>If you want to talk to someone about your relationship or you want help to get safe, the contact points provided in this booklet will help you find the right person to give you support.<br></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sorry guys... it's a long one but it's the last one.... just hope this will give the threadstarter an idea of the situation she is in....<br><br><blockquote><br>ItÂ’s a crime<br>It can be hard to accept that someone you care about has deliberately hurt you. WeÂ’re not just talking about hitting. Abuse can also include using force or fear to make you do things that you donÂ’t want to do.<br><br>Perhaps more than at any other time in our lives, it is during adolescence and the early adult years that we seek out new experiences which help us understand who we are and what we want.<br><br>Sometimes this can involve getting caught up in high-risk situations.<br><br>Forcing someone to have sex when they donÂ’t want to, or forcing them into having sex by making them think they will be harmed if they donÂ’t, is a serious criminal offence.<br>Â• The definitions and labels differ slightly - in some states this offence is called Â‘rapeÂ’, in others it is called Â‘sexual assaultÂ’, Â‘sexual intercourse without consentÂ’ or Â‘sexual penetration without consentÂ’.<br><br>Â• Â‘Sexual assaultÂ’ in everyday language is a general term, which includes rape, but also other offences such as indecent assault.<br><br>Â• Sexual assault does not necessarily involve violence, for example it can be touching a person in a sexual way without the personÂ’s consent.<br><br>Sexual assault and violence against women is a significant problem.<br><br>No means no<br>BrettÂ’s Story<br>The police say they are going to charge me with sexual assault.<br><br>I met Julia at a party Â– I really liked her. We started going out but she was pretty old-fashioned about sex and stuff. I guess I was a bit more experienced than her. She said she didnÂ’t want to go too far. It really bugged me that she got to make all the decisions. Sure she had said Â“noÂ” that night when I finally went all the way. But I just thought if she was really my girlfriend and really cared about me she could do what I wanted for a change. Afterwards, she was really upset and crying, but I thought sheÂ’d get over it. She told her parents and they went to the police.<br><br>IÂ’ve tried to explain that I was pretty drunk, but the police say thatÂ’s no excuse. My mum is taking me to see a counsellor for guys. But I am really scared about whatÂ’s going to happen.<br><br>Being someoneÂ’s boyfriend doesnÂ’t give you the right to decide what they should do. And nothing gives you the right to use force.<br><br>Communicate<br>Communication is key for all relationships. Surveys report that boys in particular are anxious about communication. Many feel that they need to Â“have a few drinksÂ” before they are able to talk to girls. Sometimes they might need help to find more positive ways to handle shyness and the fear of rejection.<br><br>Without communication there can be no real relationship. If communication is poor or not valued, negotiating the boundaries of the relationship will be difficult, if not impossible.<br><br>Poor communication can lead to conflicting expectations, especially about sex. Sex without consent is sexual assault - there is no room for confusion.<br><br>Stay safe and play it safe<br>Sadly, most violence against women occurs within a relationship Â– thatÂ’s why learning how to build healthy relationships is so important. But trouble can happen outside relationships Â– with strangers or people you donÂ’t know well.<br><br>We have all heard or read about horrible cases where young people find themselves in terrifying situations completely outside their control.<br><br>Think about the things you can do to keep safe and out of trouble.<br><br>Plan to go out and hang out in a group. Go with people you feel safe with and who you know have your best interests at heart.<br><br>Look out for yourself and your friends Â– good friends make sure that their friends are safe and make safe choices.<br><br>Have some transport plans to make sure you can get there and back safely.<br><br>Let someone know (parents, brother/ sister, housemate) where you are going, and when youÂ’ll be home. If your plans change let them know.<br><br>Alcohol and sex can be a dangerous mix. If you are not in control of yourself, you wonÂ’t be able to control the situation.<br><br>Remember if you are so drunk that you donÂ’t know if the other person is consenting Â– stop. It could be rape. When you know that the other person is so drunk they may not be capable of giving consent Â– donÂ’t do it Â– because this would be rape.<br><br>Agreeing to one type of activity such as kissing doesnÂ’t mean there is a Â‘green lightÂ’ for other sexual contact Â– remember itÂ’s OK to change your mind and say Â“noÂ” at any stage.<br><br>You shouldnÂ’t stop being careful just because you know the person youÂ’re with Â– you may not know them as well as you think.<br><br>DonÂ’t be alone and isolated with someone you donÂ’t know well.<br><br>If you start to feel uncomfortable, go with your feelings, and get to a safe place as fast as you can.<br><br>KylieÂ’s Story<br>I was lucky because my friends were there for me and looked after me. It wasnÂ’t like I didnÂ’t know him. HeÂ’d been at the pub before, we had talked a bit. He seemed an OK guy. He kept buying me drinks and I guess I was in a mood for partying, so I kept drinking them. Way too many, way too fast. He kept trying to get me to go outside. I didnÂ’t want to but we ended up in the car park.<br><br>I was frightened. I felt sick. I didnÂ’t want to be there. I didnÂ’t know how to get away. Tanya and Jo had been keeping an eye on me. They were worried IÂ’d had too much to drink. They noticed I wasnÂ’t inside and came looking for me.<br><br>They just told him I was drunk and they were taking me home. They got my bag and me into a taxi and took me home.<br><br>Good friends can make a big difference.<br><br>How to get help<br>Finding the right time and courage for you to talk about these issues is important.<br><br>Relationships are a key part of our lives.<br><br>The relationship experiences of young people can affect their whole lives because how people treat us affects how we feel about ourselves Â– not only now but into the future.<br><br>DonÂ’t be frightened to ask for help, especially if you or someone you know is in a violent relationship or has been  exually assaulted.<br><br>Relationships may not be easy but they should never hurt.<br></blockquote></div>
