I had been through that state during my younger days (though it is nothing compared to what TS is goin through) too.  TS has to wake up herself.  Hopefully when she has suffered enough pain, she will want to walk out of that state.  For if she refuses to wake up, no one can wake her up.<br><br>All i can say to her is, Good luck and take care!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Your world practically revolves around him. You lead your life in a way that he wants you to. This is very sad. Even if both of you are romantically linked, individuals are entitled to choose his/her ways of living. You choose to give in to all his demands. You tolerate his anger which shamed you countless times in the public. Do you have a dignity? Maybe you need someone to knock some sense into you rather than teach you how to please him, because he cannot be please by you. You cannot please him because you cannot even please yourself or make yourself happy. Don't kid yourself by saying his happiness is your happiness. This is absolute mockery. Find your self-respect, seek your true happiness only then can you know the correct way to love him.</div>
