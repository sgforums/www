Like you say.. most.. but not all.. if the guy can handle its own relationship well.. and balances his life.. i dun see anything wrong with dating someone younger.. Yes, of cos sometimes certain things they disapproved or disagree with you when you try to reason out...

In short - He knows how to deal with girls.<br>More likely he will be able to attract older girls.<br><br>(If you think picking Love peas and giving a girl is very romantic and she'll definately fall head over heels for you. How many times are you going to do it? Even if you have the capacity to do it all the time. Ever consider she'll get sick of it.) - One may get sick by having Too much sweet.<br><br>Boyboy18: If you're asking this question because you see too many at your age. It's because girls about your age are more needy and ideal. Hence fall into hands of those older guys who have more experience.<br>As they grow older, they'll tend to set their expectations lower, they have another level of expectations.<br><br>Cheers</div>
