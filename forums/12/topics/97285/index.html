            <div class='col-md body'>Don't just go to the poly/JC just for the sake of going there.. Or just because someone ask you to go there.. Make sure you are confortable with the life in the institution you are in.. If not, even if you go into the best JC, your heart is with the poly, you will still do badly..<br><br>Of course, there are its pros and cons in poly and JC.. Both roads can lead you to a local uni.. Just how well you score esp in the poly as it requires the top 10% to be admitted..<br><br>Good luck for your exams.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Go JC if u are strong in languages cos GP is not easy. U have to read widely &amp; write lots of essays on terrorism, mass media, crime etc.<br>U either study Sc or Arts &amp; later decide to specialise when u are in the U.<br>JC u have to work very hard cos if u cannot make it in 1st yr. u can be retained or ask to leave.<br>U have to make sure u get yr full "A' level cert to get a place in Uni.<br><br>In poly, u have to choose the course immediately. Make sure u choose the right one cos u  have to study it for 3 yrs.<br>Only the top 5- 10% in poly makes it to U. (The fig. is increasing).<br>Those who cannot make it either go &amp; work or overseas studies.<br>Advantage of poly is u don't have to study Chinese.<br><br>I understand yr parents' concern cos pay &amp; promotion for U grads is better than dip. holder. Also studying in local U is cheaper than overseas.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ok pros and cons of JC vs Poly:<br><br>Polytechnic:<br><br>*Easier life, less stress in curriculum with module systems<br>*Free style clothing, + gurls are more "chio"<br>*get to almost immediately work after poly<br>*3 or 4 yuears, means u delay ns more.<br><br>JC:<br>*Harder life with stress and ****ed up teachers. Uniforms and crap.<br>*After As go university which will take like 4 years, before u go ns and work, more time. U may be an old man or a middle aged man before u finish ur education.<br>* Being in a JC gives u a +1 aura when communicating with many locals, esp parents.. for e.g. it makes me more attractive to friend's parents, or girls' parents <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> for the narrow-minded, being in a jC equates u are smarter etc even when its not true.<br>* After uni, u earn MORE $ than someone who took the poly path.<br><br>Anywayz, that's what i hear and from personal observations <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> especially the jc improving ur look part.</div>
