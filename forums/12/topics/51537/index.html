            <div class='col-md body'>I got a friend whose voice is very deep.. When you are talking to him his voice is not exactly the nicest piece of tune.. But guess where i knew him? As a telemarketter! When I first hear him speak on the phone I was surprised as he can really speak well, although his voice is not very nice. When he is talking to customer, the tone of his voice turned into a more attractive one.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>So, mayb you can try building up the way you speak to be like those profesionnal people? Know who I mean?<br><br>Anyway have you been to the doctors? Mayb they could help? Jus asking.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>
