            <div class='col-md body'><p>Hi, I got into trouble with some of my peers. The problem happen after when I log in into facebook using my friend's laptop and I forgot to lock out of my facebook account in his computer. My friend view my conversation with my sister as I have complained to my sister about my friend keep on making fun of me such as he would often make use of me, giving me lousy present on my birthday and giving his other friend luxury present treating me as if I am very low class than most of his other friends. We went to trip together and he and his other friends often makes fun of me treating me like an outcast to them which makes me get annoyed of his attitude. I talked to my sister about how I feel towards them using our facebook account. I insulted him by calling him "bastard", "four-eye moron", "dictator" etc. After I forgot to log out my facebook account using his laptop, he happen to see my entire conversation with my sister. I knew it because one of his friend told me as I notice that my friend often avoid me. I happen to make friend with my sister's ex-friend who was the same class as her before. My sister was surprised that I am friend with her ex-friend. She called him ex-friend because he deleted her in his facebook's friend list. My sister called him an "a$$" and I happen to actually call him an "a$$" too. My friend saw our conversation and I am afriad that he might tell my sister's ex-friend about our conversation and things might not look good. I am not sure what should I do? Should I apologised to my friend? Can anyone assist me what should I do?</p></div>
