            <div class='col-md body'>Anyway, Happy new year to pete_parker.<br><br>Of course you're not worthless, nobody is worthless. Your friends do not think that. It's just that friends also have their other friends. No sms does not really mean they don't think of you as a friend, really that is true. Getting tons of SMSes  and sending out tons of SMSes until hp bill explode also doesn't mean one has many real friends.<br><br>We all make more friends as we go on in life. Maybe we should think about how we've been treating our old friends so as to see what can be improved. In the meantime, can maybe strengthen bonds with family. Friends can come and go, but family stick with us forever.<br></div>
