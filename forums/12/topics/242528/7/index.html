            <div class='col-md body'>By the way to TS and others considering abortion, here's something I randomly come across in another forum just... there are many other sharings from personal experiences on how they were grateful they didn't choose to abort that you can find in other websites..<br><br><blockquote>I will speak from my heart.<br><br>Abortion is usually considered a woman's issue, but let me give you a man's side of it.  In the next room, I have a 24 year old son.  I'm 44, so at the age of 19 (1980) I became a father.  The reason was that when my girlfriend became pregnant through a malfunctioning birth control device and wanted to have an abortion, I begged her not to.  I told her I'd marry her and support them both if she'd follow through with the pregnancy.  I was scared out of my mind, but I also knew that I loved the speck of life that was to become my child.<br><br>At night as the pregnancy advanced, he'd kick me in the back.  Man, I loved him.  It wasn't conceivable to me to kill him.<br><br>I was there when he was born.  I gave him his first meal.  I taught him how to walk.  When I went out with my friends I took him with me.  Thoses memories are clearer to me than what I had for lunch yesterday.  My marriage to his mother didn't work out, -- she has what psychologists call borderline personality disorder -- and I wound up pretty much raising him from the age of five years old on.<br><br>I would never tell anyone else what to do with their life, their body, nor would I advocate passing laws doing same.  While there are plenty of things that I tryuly regret,  I never regretted this.  This was my choice.  What other people choose to do is their karma.  I *would* advise anyone considering ending a pregnacy to seriously consider what they were doing, though.  It's pretty serious business, not to be taken lightly.  I'm amazed at how lightly we as a society take life sometimes.<br><br>Anytime I'm arrogant enough to think that I saved my son's life, I think about the many times he's saved mine -- because without him, I probably would have become an alcoholic, drug addict, suicidal.</blockquote></div>

Of course, some minority people suffer from suicidal thoughts and has little motivation to live, this could even be due to psychiatric problems or suffering from clinical depression and can be treated or counselled, or for other reasons that are often 'short term', but this has nothing to do with being an adopted child.<br><br>Even if they question why they are born, most will still rather be born and alive if given a choice.

Also whether the child grows bad may have to do with a parent's upbringing... and usually most parents can bring up their child well. If they are not confident, they may request a relative to help take care of the child, or go for adoption.<br><br><blockquote>3. if the baby life comes at the cost of the mother which will u choose? just a thought though...</blockquote>However, TS's situation is probably not medical reason as shown in the previous posts. Also do note that in Singapore, only 3% of abortions are made due to medical reasons, and the rest are actually healthy and they can choose alternatives such as adoption.<br><br><blockquote>4. if the baby is adopted, u think the mother would want meh? later the mother wan the baby back? or the child will curse the day of his birth n his bio parents? u say u can make him happy but if he know u not his real parents he still happy? of corz not suicidal but still not happy ma...</blockquote>Actually many are fine that they give their children for adoption although it may be a painful descision initially... later they should be ok. IMHO, this is a much better and wiser descision then abortion. If you really love your child that much, then give him/her the gift of life. If you want another child, you can always give birth again at a later time... and of course if possible you can try to keep the child lah.<br><br>Anyway I do not think the children will really curse their real parents. I think most people are more understanding than that and even if they are not understanding, when they grow up with maturity they will. Also I think I will (and most people will) continue to appreciate and love my parents' care even if I were to find out that they are not my biological parents. This is actually a insignificant issue when compared to the issue of whether we should <span style="font-style: italic;">take away a life</span>.</div>
