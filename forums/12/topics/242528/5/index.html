            <div class='col-md body'>there are cases where it's either the mother lives or the foetus . for example when the foetus develops out of the womb , in the fallopian tube or something . to leave the foetus growing in the fallopian tube would cause the tube to burst and internal bleeding in the mother . in this case i guess it's okay to abort the baby when it has been found that its deveoping outside of the womb , because you can have another baby again but once the mother is gone its forever . but i think its unfair to abort a baby with birth defects or something . at least let it have a chance in the world .<br></div>

If they tell you that according to the Laws of Malaysia; Laws of Christianity; Laws of Indonesia; Laws of Islam or Morality Laws and whatever Laws... you can ignore them because you are a Singaporean. The Laws do not apply to you if you are not one of their members.<br><br>2. Taking of a Life. Life, especially Human Life has great potential. It can have great potential for good or evil. Even a disable person like Stephen Hawkings can achieve so much or a schizo like Nash can win the Nobel prize. We consider Human life, as compared to animal life as "precious" because of the potential. In that sense, a fetus (compared to an egg or sperm) is precious because of the potential. Unfortunately we live imperfect world. Take Singapore for example, how many lives are lost because medical costs are so expensive? But you have to also consider how many lives are saved because of the high standards (leading to the high costs). So the issue is how much of the high costs are due to the high standards and how much of it are due to hidden taxes.<br><br>3. There are many medical reasons with relation to the mother's health not to have an abortion.<br><br>4. They are against because they think that there is something wrong with the parents that lead to this situation. As long as you know that you are not perfect and seek perfection, that is more important. People that condemn you are equally imperfect but they do not see it. People that condemn you for going ahead with the abortion have condemned themselves. Even if you regret this decision, don't condemn yourself and remember that you too have the Human Life Potential in you.<br><br>Personally I prefer you do not go ahead with it. That you make the best of having a baby. It will be a very difficult and the choice have to be yours. It has to be the mother's choice as well since I think you are the father.<br><br>Whatever choice you make I for one will never condemn you for making that choice. People make their choices (to have an abortion and including to condemn others) and people suffer the consequences.<br><br>Maybe this real life story that happened recently can help you.<br><br>Someone I know when to Esther Ng Clinic &amp; Surg for Women. 358 Tanjong Katong Road (437120) 6440-0677 for consultations regarding her pregnancy and abortion.<br><br>The doctor, Esther Ng told her that the baby is not developing normally. She told her to have an abortion at the hospital and not at her clinic in case there are complications since her case is not a straightforward one. The hospital will be able to handle the complications with their equipment and manpower.<br><br>At the hospital it is more expensive then at the clinic. She was given a choice of two different hospitals with different prices. After the abortion, she took leave for a couple of weeks. She is now well.<br><br>Whatever choice you and your gf makes, I wish you all the best. I just feel sad that life is so imperfect and people have to make these kind of choices.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm not going to discuss any Buddhist views here (those who are interested can search 'abortion' on sgforums), but I would like to share something for those who are considering abortion.<br><br>Unlike popular misconceptions, babies of 1~3 months have heartbeat and sense perception... Meaning they can feel pain. Unfortunately most countries including Singapore allow babies up to 6 months to be aborted (and as you know babies as early as 4 months may be given birth and babies of 5 or 6 months old have almost fully developed). Even worse is that only a few percent of abortions in Singapore is due to medical reasons, others can all be avoided and alternative paths could have taken (i.e Adoption). Adoption is in high demand in Singapore right now (there's a news article on that last year).<br><br>Please do your own research and if you like, read my post on abortion. I have written a little more about that.</div>

If they can, then no need to look for CHEAP abortion clinic.<br><br>If the baby is born, who will support it? The baby's father who already now is looking for CHEAP abortion clinic?<br><br>Aside to all these financial abilities, i presumed that both are at a young age.<br>Also, ever thought about their parent's views? With such thoughts of going for abortion, it could means that the girl's very afraid to let her parent know about her pregnancy, and her parent's very strict on her? I dunno...just some pressumptions. (What will you do if you're the parent n your daughter's pregnant at a very young age?)<br><br>All in all, i would say that raising a child is not easy and cheap, especially at a very young age, of coz, unless the parents are rich enough.
