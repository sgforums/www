I have never heard of adopted children cursing their biological parents. Anyway even in a case that they are, there is little real consequences.<br><br><blockquote>On last sentence;  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> It is Not a insignificant issue when compared to abortion.<br><br>We are just shifting the weight of consequences through focus on discouraging abortion and downplaying the possiblities of damages thereafter.<br><br>All issues, from pre-birth stage to adulthood, have to be discussed and looked at carefully and responsibly.<br><br>I respect that this is your opinion.<br>Please understand that this issue will lead to many moral and social problems in a long run.<br>So we have to look at both the value of life and social decline.</blockquote>Like I mentioned earlier adopted children's quality of life is not any worse than us. Especially when those parents who adopted a child is probably very willing to have a child (maybe they aren't able to give birth).</div>
