Meaning they can feel pain. <span style="color: blue;">Unfortunately most countries including Singapore allow babies up to 6 months to be aborted </span>(and as you know babies as early as 4 months may be given birth and babies of 5 or 6 months old have almost fully developed). Even worse is that only a few percent of abortions in Singapore is due to medical reasons, others can all be avoided and alternative paths could have taken (i.e Adoption). Adoption is in high demand in Singapore right now (there's a news article on that last year).<br><br>Please do your own research and if you like, read my post on abortion. I have written a little more about that.</div></blockquote>Just for a brief history lesson.

Just that mother's lives are also endangered too for those cases).<br><br>It was quite a serious problem in the past, though I would agree that the society might be more 'open' these days about certain things... But still, being in an Asian country and a 'mixed generations' age... Many just cannot afford to opt to face the conseqence.<br><br>Some would rather die than to face it. Some suicided after they opt for keeping the children and cannot handle it. (or they sort of 'deserted' the children) Some having too much pressure ended up in a VERY messy life. Life for their kids ain't that much close to 'good' neither.<br><br>Of course, there're also examples of mums who take care of their child well..

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by Mid9Sun:<br>Most of the discussion seems to focus on the boy the girl the morality etc etc<br><br>Lets look at the perspective of the baby....</blockquote>Good and timely.<br><br><blockquote>Does it want to be given birth to and then given up for adoption??</blockquote>As far as I know most adopted babies do not mind very much that they are adopted. Most adopted children are quite understanding of the situation of their real parents. And most adopted children have a good quality of life as well -- especially when adopting parents really want to have children, that is why they adopt them. When they grow up, they are also like any of us, they can have a family, they can just be like any ordinary persons like us so an adopted child generally does not have a lower quality of life than any of us.<br><br>Honestly if you found out today that your parents are not your real parents, would you just want to stop living and become suicidal? No. You may be a little sad for some time, but life goes on, you can still enjoy living your life. And you will still appreciate your adopting parents' care for you all the while.<br><br><blockquote>Does it want to be considered a burden when the parents are not ready for it (esp if finacially inability)</blockquote>Like I said if it is impossible to personally take care of the child, adoption can be considered.<br><br>Anyway <strong>nobody wishes to die</strong>, even if the parents may have financial difficulty to raise the child. Do understand that financial difficulty can gradually be solved but life is priceless.<br><br><blockquote>Even if the baby is born and the parents cannot provide proper care and love, dont you think its better off the baby's not born?</blockquote>Same as above.<br><br><blockquote>There is no right or wrong cos every case has its own unique situations and conditions. But only those involved will live with the consequeces of their decisions.</blockquote>However in most cases there are alternatives to be considered.<br><br><blockquote>Peace and all best to TS and others in similar situation</blockquote>I wld also like to wish the TS and others all the best.</div>

This is called spontaneous abortion, miscarriage, or early pregnancy loss.  Women choose abortion in less than 25 percent of the 6,000,000 pregnancies that are diagnosed in the U.S. every year Â— 50 percent of which are unintended.  This is called induced abortion.<br><br>Women have turned to abortion to end unwanted pregnancies throughout the ages.  In the U.S., induced abortion was common among Native Americans, and it was legal from colonial times to the middle of the 19th century.  But unclean, primitive medical practices made it very dangerous.  To protect womenÂ’s lives, laws against abortion began to be passed during the mid-1800s.  But by the middle of the  20th century, cleaner, more advanced medical procedures made safe abortion possible.  All U.S. laws against abortion were overturned in 1973 by the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade.  Today, abortion is legal nationwide and is one of the safest of all available medical procedures.<br><br>Use the navigation bar on the left to find up-to-date information about choosing abortion, first-trimester options, risks and side effects, various procedures, and information about the thousands of fake clinics that have been set up to frighten women away from choosing abortion.</div>
