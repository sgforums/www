Some fail because they chose the wrong major, some fail because they didn't study enough etc etc etc.  Bottomline is, you're Not alone in failing, so don't despair to the point of giving up.  Sure, Nobody feels like failing, but that's part &amp; parcel of life.  Better to know what it tastes like now, rather than experiencing it for the 1st time at work, &amp; you dunno how to cope.<br><br>Whether your bf is made a manager or Not, shouldn't affect your self esteem.

Time wasn't a luxury to me, had to sacrifice my weekends for the libraries &amp; project work.<br><br>Honestly, I attempted 2 diplomas &amp; given up becoz of work till I realise I need to set my piorities rite &amp; only then everything went well so much so I didn't even take any supplementary examinations.<br><br>Been thru all these, my advice to you is FOCUS, don't be intimidated by your surroundings (BF), it's ur life &amp; ur future, don't bother too much with what others have to say. Just ask yourself what do u actually want in life, when do you plan to complete your studies, set a GOAL &amp; DETERMINATION will soon follow.  Never be disheartened by past failures &amp; MOVE ON.  Only have nostalgic feelings when you going thru ur convocation ceremony, its then you'll feel the utmost SATISFACTION in ur ACHIEVEMENT.<br><br>I sincerely wish you the very best &amp; strength in ur future undertakings  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

Since when got positions and status gotta do in a relationship? I maybe will understand if you are the manager and he's doing his Uni still and as a man, usually the ego will slip in.<br><br>Another reminder, manager nowadays are nothing. The streets are full of them flooding the MRT trains. If my gf is studying and I'm about to be promoted to managers, I'll probably ask her to put her full concentration on her studies and not to worry about anything else.<br><br>Anyway, to ask you. You working and studying at the same time or studying full time?</div>

If you got accepted by open U that already proof that you are not stupid.  You already proof yourself to be capable and smart enough, to make it this far.<br><br>However you may not have study right or may not have put in enough effort. So sitting there and thinking that you cannot proceed is not going to help. You cannot sit there forever.  Life is full of exams, you will find a lot more of it in your career and marriage next time, well you cannot win them all, but at least you must try to win as much as possible and learn cope and move on for those you fail.<br><br>If you can afford it , repeat that semestar or even redo that year, put in more effort and don't run away from it.<br><br>Don't think about working part-time and taking night classes.  You be stepping into another worst nightmare, I been through that.<br><br>A manager is just a title, it is you who he must like ! Be you a beggar or no-body. If he love only a princess, than what he love is just title, that any one also can, than dump him. In the world, nothing is certain, till you put in your effort.</div>

Since life in singapore is so miserable and stressed, why must u cope with something that is currently beyond ur limit... Take some time to cool down... Once things starts to settle , do what you need to do...<br><br>To be in this rat race, it's not easy given today's singapore uncertain economy...<br><br>Gf or bf, it doesn't matter... Each party will show its true colour when faced upon obstacle/diffculty/challenge... Hence, give and take/encouragement/positive thinking is required in either party...<br><br>Thus, to lose hope means to lose everything... sometimes, it's best to lose everything than to lose hope...</div>

Do u care to work in it for the rest of ur life?<br>4.  can ur parents afford the sch fees etc?<br><br>there is no easy way out of anything.. to spend more time on something, means u have to spend less time on others..<br><br>it is nv a perfect world~<br><br>feel free to pm me and chat chat bah~  i can at least listen~ <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>nite~</div>
