            <div class='col-md body'>Yah maybe you are anti-social or something like that lor... but then heh the problem can be with us partially also if your problem is partial. U has to think about this. But i guess ur moderator is right; it takes 2 hands to clap; because the problem is with u partially; meaning asians also got some of the problem. SO i guess you are right, we all don't feel easy to talk to a pure angmoh in school sometiems ebcause they are different.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To: bismarck<br><br>Sure u can argue that chinese girl with Indian bf and Indian girl with Chinese bf blah blah blah blah etc<br><br>But that does not surprise me, because Chinese...Indian...Malay...Indonesian...Vietnamese etc... you all fall under the same category: which is ASIAN.<br><br>However, I am a part of WESTERN and ASIAN by blood, my problem is I LOOK WESTERN and not ASIAN... so Asians find me to be a complete outsider because of my looks. Therefore I am not part of the category of ASIAN. Hence I cant really socialise with Asian girls cos of that thing they got.... i mentioned in my long post.<br><br>U understand my problem???<br><br>And another thing; 1 guy said that girls like mixed blooded people? Well that is BS, no offense, but it really is, you can be mixed but if u look completely out of this world different... you wont stand a chance...in order to get good with people...u Must LOOK LIKE THEM AND BE OF THE SAME CATEGORY... well the general category at least.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Im sorry to see some sarcastic remarks posted on this thread. But this could be reality. Actually, I feel sad for the chinese in USA and other western countries in which they are being discriminated by the Caucasion. Y? Cuz what I heard is that firstly they cant forgive what the white ppl done to them, next, they dun mix around with other races. What about in Singapore? All the caucasion think that they are very $$ so they choose pte schools for them..I duno what iz the other reason..dun want to mix around with we yellow ppl? They dun even want to come and mix around with our HDB heartlanders, only like to go to Pub.<br>But 1 advice I can give u is to stop ur paranoia of chinese girls not liking u cuz u r Caucasion. If u really want to find a chinese gf, I suggest y not u go and look up for those English speaking ones from JC and NUS? Dun bother for ITE ones.<br>Dun get me wrong, upon saying that, I would wish that I have the chance to get to know more ppl from other races.</div>

Yeah yeha sure although u say u people want to mix around blah blah blah...when u do...you all begin to "shy" and "shun" away from the guy.... GOD KNOWS WHY you people are like that... its cos I look so bloody different from you people that I am such an outsider.... if I looked more malay or more Asian I am sure I would be accepted.... so don't give me that bull**** about you all wanting to know and mix with ppl of other races... cosi seriously doubt it.... this world is one of race.... you either have what people want or not... **** it... booze time.</div>

I get zilch conversation... or weird stares about "what am I doing in a local JC"...one girl told me "Wtf are you doing here? You should be in UWC".... well I try to mix around and i get zero... so what else can people like me do? Mix around with people in our own circle...and the circle clearly is defined by race... i mean... look at your schools...look at how the Malays form their Brotherhood...all sitting together at 1 table...same with the Indians and CHinese....very rarely you see them talking to one another....

While groups of guys crowd together... It's natural... Nothing's wrong about it... But males and females still DO mix around... Same thing goes for the cases you've brought up... Indians TENDS to sit with Indians... Malays and Chinese alike... It doesn't mean they don't mix though..? Just like people who naturally love the outdoors usually don't mix with people who stays indoor and read whole day...<br><br>If I think of myself as a Devil solely and not part of a human race, then i won't mix around with people... Same thing applies here... Though skin color might have a certain degree to play with how people might respond to you (with varying degree among different people...), you most certainly can choose the people you wanna mix around with and try various things to overcome the 'barrier'...<br><br>If you think that they're avoiding you or even holding something against you, then you'll sunconsciously creates this 'space' between you and the people you've mentioned... Which despite what the real situation is, would further draw you apart from the rest of the people... Easily resulting in what you call 'zero'....<br><br>Yes, it's an obstacle you face there... No doubt about it, it's certainly there for you... But ever heard a saying...?<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"Obstacles are meant to be overcomed...."<br><br>~good luck....  </span><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hey mixblooder.. i am a eurasian myself with dutch/chinese blood .. and so far i do not  really have any problems with the girls here.. in fact i think my race has helped me quite a bit with them.. i always thought that no fellow eurasian here would have a problem getting a girl/guy, considering how  unique and beautiful we look.. being a eurasian living in asia, i don't know about you but i seem to get quite a bit more attention.. like people constantly asking where you are from and what race u are.. and the girls here seem to like eurasian guys.. anyways i have no idea why girls are avioding you and stuff.. maybe its the way you carry yourself? i don't actually think they are avioding you cos of race.. maybe they're shy or something? and also have you ever tried going out with the eurasian girls here? i found it much easier being with a eurasian girl than a girl of another race, probably becos we are both mixed and we can relate to each other easily..<br><br>anyways all the best pal  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To ChinpiraX: Piss off! Least I am sure I look more beautiful than you you squint eyed snot nosed piece of crap... you have no idea how i feel, and what you said is not helping.<br><br>To Dutchin: Thank you for relating to me... its great you got people talking to you and asking what race you are and stuff. But don't people give you strange stares about why your in their school or something? Your in UWC or a local school? Cos i get stares that say "what am I doing here". About girls, I really don't see how being a crossbreeder will help me or even you with girls...  I get ignored whenever I like say "hi"... or when i try to make small talk... i get hardly anything in return... like as if no-one wants to talk to me, most girls are "always busy" or "have somewhere to go all the time" which is kinda weird...  A friend of mine said the local girls are kinda weird cos they shy up sometimes... BUT I FIND THAT BOGUS COS THEY CAN DARN WELL TALK TO THE LOCAL GUYS BUT NOT ME.. i wonder why... as for Eurasian girls... well...there are none that I know of here.... I am the only one of my (our) kind here.<br><br>To Moderator Devil man: Thanks for relating... this is one bloody obstacle... I think it is too hard to overcome. I am begining to think "munjans" should go back to China... "Indians" back to India.... and "Cross breeds" like me back to the embryos/sperm of my parents from whence they came... I feel as if I don't belong here, I don't fit into any cliches. All I see is this:<br>Guys/Girls/Indians/malays/chinese etc all talking to each other and having fun...  and you say they mix around...yeah they do... I am saying its easy for them cos they all come under "ASIAN" (as i have pointed out so many times before), therefore it is easier. I am really starting to believe I should get out of the system and go somewhere where I can be accepted. My guy friends say there's nothing wrong with me that they know of... 1 guy said I "look different" and "its hard probably for them (asians) to relate to me". This confirms my speculation that race plays a part in how you are treated and stuff.<br><br></div>
