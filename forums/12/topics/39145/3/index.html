I am the only one of my (our) kind here.</strong><br><br>Well.. You mentioned that you're 'one of the kind' here... SIMPLE PROBABILITY.... Majority of the people around you are what you labelled as ASIANS (if not all)....? By throwing you into a box FULL of blue beads (representing asians..) and you as a red bead (or eurasians..)... Chances of red beads being pick up is definitely smaller than blue beads being picked up.. Why? Because there're MORE of them... In reality they ALL STANDS an EQUAL CHANCE of being picked up from the box... What you've seen around you is just an DELUSION caused by SIMPLE PROBABILITY...<br><br>And from the standpoint of one person... It's usually EASIER to see the things happening around you than yourself... Like you see the weakness and features of others usually more readily as compared to yourself... YET, you would usually tends to OVEREMPHASIZE the particular 'feeling' you've having... Because it's ALL YOURS... Having keep this 'feeling' to YOURSELF (more on a personal basis) would make you feel more ALONE and 'one of a kind'.... Which sums up what I have to tell you earlier....<br><br>"Don't push yourself into believing something which might not be true... Your subsequent distanting from the others would only ENFORCE the reality (which you've created indirectly...)...."<br><br><strong><br>To Moderator Devil man:</strong><br><br>A Devil is devil.. There is no such thing as a 'Devil man'...<br><br><strong><br>Thanks for relating... this is one bloody obstacle... I think it is too hard to overcome. I am begining to think "munjans" should go back to China... "Indians" back to India.... and "Cross breeds" like me back to the embryos/sperm of my parents from whence they came... I feel as if I don't belong here, I don't fit into any cliches. </strong><br><br>This is what you think...? Don't be so narrow-minded.... Others have their own thinkings too... Doesn't neccesarily means that they have to be true...?<br><br><strong><br>All I see is this:<br>Guys/Girls/Indians/malays/chinese etc all talking to each other and having fun...  and you say they mix around...yeah they do... I am saying its easy for them cos they all come under "ASIAN" (as i have pointed out so many times before), therefore it is easier. I am really starting to believe I should get out of the system and go somewhere where I can be accepted.</strong><br><br>If you feel so? Like I've said in my previous post, you can CHOOSE and CREATE your own group of friends... If you feel that some of them don't fit in or don't readily accept you, go for others... You can't possibly be rejected by EVERYBODY...?<br><br><strong><br>My guy friends say there's nothing wrong with me that they know of... 1 guy said I "look different" and "its hard probably for them (asians) to relate to me". This confirms my speculation that race plays a part in how you are treated and stuff.<br></strong><br><br>Just because ONE guy said you look different and you CONFIRMED your speculation?<br><br>Hmm... Does it sounds LOGICAL to you?<br><br>To me it SIMPLY MEANS 'ONE guy thinks that race PROBABLY plays a part in how you are treated and stuff'....<br><br>Note. ONE guy. He said PROBABLY. He's not even representative of ALL ASIANs (by the way, is he a GIRL?). You CONFIRMED your SPECULATION based on his SPECULATION?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br></blockquote></div>

But don't people give you strange stares about why your in their school or something? Your in UWC or a local school? Cos i get stares that say "what am I doing here". About girls, I really don't see how being a crossbreeder will help me or even you with girls...  I get ignored whenever I like say "hi"... or when i try to make small talk... i get hardly anything in return... like as if no-one wants to talk to me, most girls are "always busy" or "have somewhere to go all the time" which is kinda weird...  A friend of mine said the local girls are kinda weird cos they shy up sometimes... BUT I FIND THAT BOGUS COS THEY CAN DARN WELL TALK TO THE LOCAL GUYS BUT NOT ME.. i wonder why... as for Eurasian girls... well...there are none that I know of here.... I am the only one of my (our) kind here.<br><br></div></blockquote> Nope, i never really got any strange stares in school.. maybe its becos i inherited more of my chinese side.. but i remember when i was in primary school other kids would call me 'the eurasian boy', and i would get really angry cos i thought i was pure chinese.. anyway, i was in a local school from primary  till mid secondary, then i switched to an international school. i'm now in the army, and when i first entered my camp everyone was like 'what are u doing here' 'are u singaporean' 'you don't look chinese' 'are u from australia/britain' 'are u eurasian' blah blah. my officers call me ang moh which i REALLY hate cos i'm not and never ever considered myself one.. well most eurasian guy/girls are really cute.. so i guess it'll be a plus with the girls.. are u sure the girls are ignoring u when u say hi? that's really wierd, they're probably just shy or don't really know what to say to a eurasian.. well as whether local girls are shy i'm not really sure, but i do know alot of eurasian girls that are pretty shy.. you don't know any eurasian girls here? there are quite a few in the local schools (mainly the convent schools), and they are really fine.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
