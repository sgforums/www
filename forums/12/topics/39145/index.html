            <div class='col-md body'>i am a mixed blood of french and singaporean chinese. I have never been successful in getting any dates with some local girls, yet i do have some girls who are just friends. Its like everytime i ask someone out they are always busy/sleeping/eating/out etc, and whenever I try to even speak to some of them, they just blatantly ignore me, and this has happened with 11 girls so far. Both my guy/girl friends say that i am a nice person, i don't have flaws that should impede me. So i am suspecting my race and nationality have some impact on my romance life, do u people think so? I am not a Singapore citizen.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Could be your approach, or they just ain't used to talking to a mixed blood since erusians often had their own social circles and rarely mix with people outside.<br><br>You could always ask a few other friends to tag along when you start, perhaps the girls merely feel uncomfortable with a erusian and trying to go out alone with one is something they're not mentally prepared for. When she gets to know you better perhaps she would be more willing to start a relationship with you.<br><br></div>
