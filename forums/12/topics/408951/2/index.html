              <p>Haha very nice. I dislike girls with high ego. I won't even like them if i realized they are ego. I used to like this girl and thought she was so good. In the end we didn't end up together and later on i entered another school and i found another girl who was love at 1st sight with me. And cut short the story.</p>
              <p>My message for simple gal is i moved on in life although i was sad at that time. I found something to do by studying and making new friends. I even found a girlfriend and now we are still together. Now we graduated le and not in the same school. We all miss each other. I understand how you feel la. But there is no need to follow them by studying overseas or getting married. Just because you do that doesn't mean you will continue to be close with them. </p>
