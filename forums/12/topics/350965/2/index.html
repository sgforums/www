              well, actually it is not really a problem. 
              A teacher would not bother a student if he /she followed instructions. He/she is trying to educated you. 
              
              The teacher is also abit  crazy. You can just say i would buy the ring file later =&gt;  the problem is solved. 
              
              Unless you are a bad student??

              <p>Sometimes, this kind of things can bochup one lar. When I was in Secondary 1, we had a Literature teacher who went around singling students out, calling them things like "idiot", and she would even go to other classes and tell them that so and so from Class 1Z is a failure. But everyone knows she's cantankerous, so we just shrug it off.</p>
              <p>Even if your teacher is not usually like that, just shrug it off! You feel insulted, but chances are, most people won't mark down this incident in their minds (unless you've got a reputation for being reprimanded all the time by teachers).</p>

              <p>Teacher merely say you abit, you say they insult. Then what about the numerous topics that they teach you? Will you reciprocate it and treat them as dieties?</p>

              <p>hi,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>got insulted and fight back is easy, shoot angry words back is easy and this goes to retaliation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>bring insulted and shrug it off is hard, being insulted and not being angry is difficult.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>if u can shrug it off without getting angry and analyze what is going on after being insulted and re act rationally, this is the higher arts of human relationship u need to learn.</p>
