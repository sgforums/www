            <div class='col-md body'>I'm in a long distance relationship with another forum member. She's a white girl living in Europe.

            <div class='col-md body'>hello,<br><br>I am not sure if you know of my r/s with my ai ai...which is also a long distance and an online r/s so far. I will be going back next year to meet him and my parents havent even known about him yet. We have been "together" for almost 8 months now, and yet, I have not had the courage to tell my parents about us.<br><br>Though I believe that an online r/s can only be real once the couple take the initiative to bring it into the "real" life. It will never survive if both of you just rely on talking through the phone or on instant messenger. Besides that, you will need to meet her physically to judge if the chemistry is present. Not to say that you do not know that now, but meeting in reality will enable both of you to judge more accurately how suited you are for each other.<br><br>So, I guess even as your family forbids you to meet her, you have to find a way to go to her. And how much you are willing to do is up to you. I am not sure of how old are you, but is it possible for you to take a trip to where she is? Or ask her to come over to Singapore? Once your parents have met her and see that she is real, maybe they will be convinced to let you stay in this r/s.<br><br>Being in a r/s is always hard. A long distance one makes it even harder a trial. Add to the facts that it is also an online r/s...you have got yourself a huge hurdle to cross. But have faith and take everything as a test, knowing that if both of you manage to go through this safely and come out of it still as close as ever, it will be a very strong r/s.<br><br>Good luck  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>erm. jz to check, u saw her pic and got seen her live through video conference? are u working now? if yes at least u can plan a trip to europe and visit her with your own $$$... but since 2 of u love each other so much then set a goal to visit each other when possible. its quite impossible to change your parent's ideas now so if she comes here in person and let your parent see her then maybe they might change their mind abt her.. so till then u haveto carry on like this with your love for her.... good luck... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Kuali Baba:</div><div class="quote_body">I'm in a long distance relationship with another forum member. She's a white girl living in Europe. We've known each other for about one-and-a-half years and have been a couple for more than 6 months, keeping in contact via the Net (including Skype and IM) and SMS very frequently.<br><br>Trouble is, my family doesn't approve of our relationship. Since summer I've been asking my parents to let me fly there to visit her. The response from Mum has been a flat-out 'No', while my father has been making excuses not to visit her any season.<br><br>They aren't interested in getting to know her better either; they say 'no' when I ask them to talk to her over the Net phone or IM. Due to the time difference, I talk to her at night, staying up if I have nothing important the next day, but Mum often does everything short of tripping the power to chase me away. They also tried to get my relatives to convince me not to carry on. And my elder sister has been calling her a b|tch too, when I've been sometimes reluctant to let the former use the computer for leisure while I'm in the middle of one of our conversations.<br><br>It's obvious to both of us that she's not welcome in my home, while I can't pay her a visit without rebelling. Each of us knows that the other exists for real, we love each other deeply and we aren't planning to let go of this relationship. I know I'm not going to live here forever (for other reasons). I need to know where I can take this.<br><br>Ask us anything if it'll help...thanks for listening.</div></blockquote>Just wonderin, why did you mention she is a white girl? Does your family object to having europeans in the family or something? Well, worse comes to worse, you could always move out from your family and live your own life. Your 21yr edi right? An adult by legal right if Im not mistaken.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>long term relationships never hold for long, its afterall a teenage romance. you'd end up hurting yourself in the end. i know how you feel cause its actually happening to me now. i've been like crying everynight before she leaves and after she comes back for another 2 more days she actually told me she's confused whether she still likes me or not. we been together for 6 months too. its like i've never met someone like her, 5 mins to end everything. a lifetime to forget her.</div>

The truth could be a fairy tale or a harsh fact, but it's better to face it sooner rather than later - we've been honest to each other about everything.</div>
