After that break-up she din even contact you from then on.. Are you sure that you can get her back?? She has move on.. but you haven't.. if the break-up was not that bad.. i'm sure you both are still friends.. right now.. it seems that she want to get out of your world totally.. without contacting you..<br><br>You dun mind being friends with her.. but if she thinks the same way as you.. will she be so mean that no a single call after break-up?? After so long.. you should moved on and lead your own life.. Stop thinking about the past.. stop thinking of how to get her back.. Concentrate on what you suppose to do and plan your routes.. It's time to wake up.. Don't dwell into this..<br><br>Cheers..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

If I am rite, may I say sth not so nice which is u lost ur chance. When shes there, u dun treasure her, now when shes gone u need her back.<br><br>Another query for u. What do u think is love? U just wan someone by ur side so u wan to find her back?? If u are having this idea, i think its best for u not to get her back. Not to discourage u but u are not doing it out of love u are doing it out of ur need. Whats lost is lost, learn to let go. If she really wanted to be back with u, she would have remained frens with u and not totally not contact u. If theres a slight chance, it would have happened some time ago.<br><br>Although u are a never-give-up person, which is good in many ways, i would suggest u get urself over this. Not only for urself but also for her. If u really lover her, let her go. Love is not about possessing.</div>

She changed her HP, shift house, severed all contacts with me. i tried calling her on the old phone but she barred my call. i moved on, its difficult but just when i was feeling better, she called me 1 late evening and started talking about why the relationship failed (providing for her). i asked her whether she still feels for me, if not i say let me move on, but if she is willing to give it a chance, i made my promise to provide for her, i told her to decide.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi verloren,<br><br>appreciate your reply; anyway its been 1 week since she called. No further call from her. I am actually feeling much better nowadays, but sometimes still hurt especially when i pass by some familiar locations that i was with her in happier times. She is still holding to my phone account; should i terminate it? or should i just hang on to it? Sheeesh, terminating it would mean abandoning her totally rite? But even though i still have feelings for her but we are not together anymore, so i wouldn't want to be a "carrot head".</div>

It's not wise to be doing such things for someone, especially when you're no longer on close terms with that person... Also remember 2 things..<br><br>1. It's not a life and death thing.
