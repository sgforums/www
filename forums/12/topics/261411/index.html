            <div class='col-md body'>i guess the singapore bubble has just burst....there was a time we were told as long as you are a uni grad, you will make it.....reality bites.....utilities will be increasing soon, not sure if you wanna assume that responsibility.....<br><br>as someone suggested, giving fixed allowance is best.....must speak to them and tie them to the agreement....tell them you got your own loans to deal with....lay down your law...so your pay is $1.3k...loans $350, then your transport and meals and others...show them proof of your repayment....i would give $300 to them period...one trick you can do is to give both of them at the same time and announce its their monthly allowance....<br><br>if they ask for more, let them understand that you got to save for your future too.....i think you are lucky if you can save a paltry $50 a month....sad isn't it, considering the propaganda we hear about how prosperous the country is...</div>
