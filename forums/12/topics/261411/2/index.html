            <div class='col-md body'>Seriously, DO NOT give them money as and when they request for it. Just tell them that you will give them $200 each everytime u get your monthly pay. This will limit the amount of money you give them to $400 a month.<br><br>I am not against giving money to parents becos personally, I feel that it is just right for us to give money to our parents. After all, they have spent a lot to bring us up. But your parents' attitude is abit weird. I suggest you talk to them and try to make them understand that you can only give them money once a month.<br><img src="http://i55.photobucket.com/albums/g122/bad_lewis/freakass2.jpg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Firstly you need to sit down and write down your current financial situation.  Write down your income, and expenditure.  Look at where you can cut expenses.  Remove the non-essential spending.<br><br>Once you have done that, tell your parents about your real financial situation and the family's. Find out if the family is over-spending unnecessarily. Discuss with them if it is possible to reduce your contribution. Seek their understanding. Reducing $10 each will probably help quite a bit already.</div>
