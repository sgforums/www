              <p>Recently met a woman who has a reputable career. She confided
                  all her issues with her husband to me and when we went out, she
                  allowed me to be close with her. We even shared a kiss. However,
                  she is now acting as if she don't know me. She is even angry at me
                  talking to her now because she says her husband doesn't like it.
                  Why is she acting this way? Why did she lead me on if she has no
                  intention of being with me? What's wrong with women these
                  days? </p>

              <p>Recently met a woman who has a reputable career. She confided
              all her issues with her husband to me and when we went out, she
              allowed me to be close with her. We even shared a kiss. However,
              she is now acting as if she don't know me. She is even angry at me
              talking to her now because she says her husband doesn't like it.
              Why is she acting this way? Why did she lead me on if she has no
              intention of being with me? What's wrong with women these
              days? </p>

              <p>What's wrong with you though?</p>
              <p>Do you think it's appropriate chasing a married woman?  Clearly, her morals are poor - why must you join her?</p>

              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.65px;">Hi Guys,</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.65px;">I need some help.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.65px;">I visited a girl , who i found on craiglist, at  a hotel. On reaching the hotel, we just sat aound chatting for a while. Then, things got a little intimate, but we never had sex. It was just light cuddling and kissing. Nothing more. I had made it clear to her before meeting itself that i was not looking for sex ( sent her an explicit message). I left within 30 min. However, i did pay her some amount just for the time and company. </p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.65px;">As i was leaving the hotel, the staff stopped me and asked me if i knew the girl. I said she was a friend who i met online. They asked me my name and contact number, as they were suspecting some illegal activity going on in that room (they saw a lot of guys entering that room on cctv) and that they might call me if they need help/info. </p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.65px;">Since i never had sex , or never intended to (i have proofs of this interms of sms), did i do something illegal by visiting her? Did i break any law? I have been freaking out ever since this episode happened and have been sleepless at nights.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.65px;"> </p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.65px;">Is there a cause for concern? </p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.65px;">Appreciate your help and advice in this matter. </p>
