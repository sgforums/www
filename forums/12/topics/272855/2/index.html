During major public holidays like Chinese New Year, National Day , Christmas or New Year's Day, my mood dives down.  On normal working days, I feel better and my mind is occupied. That's why I always like to keep myself busy or to find new goals to challenge myself whether I can succeed in achieving them or not.  The process excites me and keeps me busy.<br><br>Public holidays are the time when I feel lonely.  These are the days when my married siblings bring their children out to enjoy the festive season but my elderly parents will want to stay home to rest.  Being a single and still unattached despite being of marriageable age, the sadness inevitably find its way into my heart as I think about my efforts for the past few years to socialise whether through online dating agencies or to try to go church to find people who make good lifetime partners or those who are also sincere in finding one to know as friends first.<br><br>Reading Aunt Agony sometimes add on to some of my emotional burdens when I start to discover that marriage or dating for many people is a like "a mountain to scale " - not easy.<br><br>I have also tried to champion for marriage in public forums before but these are of limited effects because marriage is after all a private matter between two persons.  It takes fate and two persons' efforts to make a relationship work.  If either party tries to make things difficult for another by "acting to be cool" when it comes to whether the relationship will work out in the end or not, then this relationship is bound to fail, 100%.</div></blockquote><span style="color: indigo;">try not to let postings in AA affect you..<br><br>and dun be too pessimistic..<br><br>it may be hard to look for a better half.. someone who will walk down the rest of your life journey with you..<br><br>but i believe.. if you believe in what you believe in, it will happen.<br><br>Always think positive.. </span></div>
