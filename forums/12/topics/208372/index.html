I don't see that as a problem as he might lose a day due to the time difference if he don't correspond during the few hours he have.<br><br>2) If the girl is feeling left out, she can always suggest to tag along to view the car with his friend, family etc especially since if it is serious dating. I don't think the girl needs individual attention does she?<br><br>3) By making time for her from 7pm to 11pm (Mon, Wed,Thurs,Sat) is already taking the initiative to make time for her. What else does she want him to do? Spend time with her 24/7?<br><br>4) Single or not is by choice. Even if you are extremely eligible it doesn't mean that you have to be attached. Look at Sim Mong Hoo. If you want to say if he is eligible or not, he is extremely eligible but not attached. If the gal thinks that he is making changes to his lifestyle etc, she should exercise some trust in him.<br><br>Excuse me for saying this but the girl seems to have no self-confidence and doesn't seem to be very trusting. It could be because she had some form of bad experiences in the past but isn't it time to move on? The girl shouldn't let past bad experiences affect her potential future happiness.</div>
