              <p>Hi, I have posted this before here: http://sgforums.com/forums/12/topics/493043 my parent did complaint about this guy feeding the pigeon to the town council, but he still continue to feed the pigeon sometimes, but not as regular as before which is very annoying.</p>
              <p>This morning, my parent saw this guy was standing behind our kitchen window. Btw, we are staying on the first floor, that is the reason why this guy can stand outside our kitchen's window. My parent said that they wasn't sure what he was trying to do, but when he look up and saw them, he got shocked and walk away. When we check outside our window and underneath the window, we can't see him he do anything to it.</p>
              <p>I once saw him doing the same thing last year, standing outside our window and he walks away. We do not know where to complaint about this guy as he is getting more and more irritating as before. There is a CCTV there, but I believe the camera is able to capture him standing and walking pass our window. Does anyone know where should we complain about this guy?</p>

              <p>need approval from authories and if approve, I can only install only one camera for six months which after six months, I will have to force to remove it. Wow, how troublesome this can be. I hope the approval doesn't require any expenses. I don't understand what is wrong with installing camera, would it affect someone? For me, if my neighbor install camera, I don't mind. I would have understand that it is for security reason. This article is like it is a big deal of having camera for security reason :(</p>
              <p>Well anyway, I am worried about something, this old guy was feeding pigeon, I know my parent well as they always doesn't want to make any complaints such that they are saying like lets ignore them, let that kids or that old guy do whatever they want, making noises above our apartment, feeding pigeons or whatever, be thankful that we have a place to stay. I was pretty angry when they said that. So that old guy keeps on throwing foods out of his window and feeds the birds. Their foods invited insects such as red ants crawling around ouside our house. I can't believe they (my parent) would keep on tolerating them (the old guy and the noisy kid staying above us) like for three years.</p>
              <p>After we have found out about the red ants crawling around outside our house, my parent asked me to pour some insect repellent around our house which I don't think there was any use of it. While we were pouring it, that old guy look out of his window and watch us in a secretive behaviour. I pointed a middle finger at him and he saw it. That was like months ago somewhere in the July or August last year.</p>
              <p>I told my parent about it and they scolded me. So I believe the reason why that old guy would pour gasoline behind underneath our kitchen's window was because I pointed middle finger at them and plus we called town council about his behaviour of feeding pigeon. He got annoyed of it and do something different by pouring gasoline under our kitchen's window.</p>
              <p><br>Gasoline are very dangerous as the smell can cause health problem to us just like those pigeon flying around and eating the foods that are thrown by him. There are people throwing cigarette butts there and it may cause fire which is very dangerous.</p>
              <p>If I report him to the police and that old guy would counter attack and said that I pointed middle finger at him, I wonder what would happen, will either of us gets into trouble?</p>
