              <p>well, my parent has contacted the HDB, one of the officer went to our area to check the place and saw that old man was nervous after seeing the officer and was walking around suspiciously. He told us that this old man is secretive, he asked us that it is best to catch him in action such as him throwing foods out of his house and feed the pigeon, but it is very difficult to catch him because after immediately he threw the foods, he disappear very quickly. He might stand from a far away distance from his kitchen window and throw the foods. It is difficult to capture his action. Any suggestion on how to capture his action?</p>

He still keep on throwing foods to feed the pigeons out of his windows and I have to call NEA to report about him constanly until the staffs of NEA are sick of it, I guess. This old guy is very cunning, he knows that he is being watched, so he threw the foods in a random timing. Now the NEA officer has installed the camera and he did not throw anymore. This is very difficult to deal. I have also reported my indian neighbors who are staying above about their throwing of litters out of their windows to the ground floor. They seems to know about it and they purposely throw it on top of my parent's plants. This is going to be difficult. I will update this thread if there are any news. I am worrying that if NEA can't do anything about them, they will take their revenge on us by throwing more litters and foods out of their windows since their behavior can tell what type of personalities they have. It is very dangerous staying at ground floor without any security camera nearby us.</p></div>

              <p>I am unlucky to have very bad evil wicked neighbors, but at last
              the town council has managed to lock the rubbish chunte door since
              that old wicked guy kept on opening it. He still keep on throwing
              foods to feed the pigeons out of his windows and I have to call NEA
              to report about him constanly until the staffs of NEA are sick of
              it, I guess. This old guy is very cunning, he knows that he is
              being watched, so he threw the foods in a random timing. Now the
              NEA officer has installed the camera and he did not throw anymore.
              This is very difficult to deal. I have also reported my indian
              neighbors who are staying above about their throwing of litters out
              of their windows to the ground floor. They seems to know about it
              and they purposely throw it on top of my parent's plants. This is
              going to be difficult. I will update this thread if there are any
              news. I am worrying that if NEA can't do anything about them, they
              will take their revenge on us by throwing more litters and foods
              out of their windows since their behavior can tell what type of
              personalities they have. It is very dangerous staying at ground
              floor without any security camera nearby us.</p>

              <p>Your evil neighbour is as sick as my neoghbourS.    If caught they will get warning or fine for littering.    Have you thought of alerting the mainstream media they can go to the venue to observe and publish news to shame them ??? </p>

              <p>It is no use, this old guy is very alert around his surrounding. When the NEA officer came, he did not feed the pigeon. Now with the camera on, he did not feed the pigeon at all. This old guy is very difficult to deal with. The worst neighbor that I have ever encounter in my entire life.</p>
