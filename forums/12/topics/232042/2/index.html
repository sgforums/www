Talking about open space, I was once approached by a stranger out of MRT while waiting to cross the road.  I simply ignored him because I don't know him at all.  Oh,. may be look at it this way - this is asia and in general, gals are more conservative so vast majority will not respond positively to strangers when approach.  IN the west, may be you will get more positive response.<br><br>May be can start smiling at the gal a few times before approaching her in the lift.  This way when the gal is approached by the guy she will not feel so sudden.  But when you smile, smile without being sleazy OK.  Remember gals don't like guys to be sleazy.  Good luck.</div>

Usually we exchange nos.  But for my ex -  he gave me his no and expect me to give him a tinkle when I said yes to going out with him.    Hey, to me when a guy gives his no to the gal he already indicates his interest and is up to the gal to respond.  Think this is one of the good ways to get to know a gal.</div>

Anywhere is the same as long as the girl kan ta shun yan.<br><br>He doesn't even know you and just can't find the guts. Put it simply, as long as the guy you like approach you, you will talk to him. As long as you don't like him, you don't even care about him. Am I right? That's why I brought up your example.<br><br>But ya, I think he lost the chance with you. I will say goodbye to you for him...unless he's willing to approach you.<br><br>doko</div>
