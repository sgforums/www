              <p>Its always easy to loss touch with friends when people go their seperate ways. It depends on how close the friendship is and how both parties want to maintain the friendship.</p>
              <p>Just try to make friends with your new schoolmates. It might not be easy to click with them as easily but if you are willing to try, it should be possible. If you feel others are not asking you out, try to take initiative and ask people out instead if you want.</p>
              <p>Go into a relationship if you want. 1 that starts with boredom can still develop into 1 of love.</p>

              <p>When people get lonely, they tend to look around and asks questions. <br>If you find yourself asking <br>Why this and why that..</p>
              <p><br>Perhaps there is something missing right now in your life.. a void perhaps.<br>Maybe last time, you had close friends to hang out with often, now things seems different. Things will never be the same. It's just like breaking a stick and glueing it togethe again.. it'll never fit in perfectly.<br><br>Unfortunately.. people are always moving on.. taking different paths. We all collide with one another somehow.. maybe this is the moment that you meet the next group of people that you'll spend the better part of your life with. <br><br>Get out often, play less of computer games.<br>Perhaps this is the phase in life that you're suppose to go out more often~</p>
