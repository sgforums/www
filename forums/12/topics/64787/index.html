My mom dun seems to accept her as there's some age difference between me and her. She sometimes will bad mouth my gf and sometimes my mom and i will just flare up and quarrel. But after awhile, my mom starts to accept her since i bring her to my house more often and since den my gf and her starts to chat more.<br><br>Conversation with your mom is equally important as to your gf.<br>But whats the meaing of "should i continue to see her" means? You mean if your mom dun accept her, den u are gonna forsake your gf? I agree the point where loving a person doesnt transcend to physical appearance. But a relationship is not easy to be created, and thus treasure it while you can.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
