It's not the end of the world. Lust will always be there. If the guy doesn't appreciate your care and concern, he's not worthy of your love or he's simply not the right guy for you, so in a way you did the right thing to break up. Take a break and have fun. The right guy will notice you and come around when your heart is ready to love again.</div>

I've known friends who suffer break-ups after 5, 6, 7 and 9 years. Two guy friends of mine went through divorce. It's not the end of the world. Lust will always be there. If the guy doesn't appreciate your care and concern, he's not worthy of your love or he's simply not the right guy for you, so in a way you did the right thing to break up. Take a break and have fun. The right guy will notice you and come around when your heart is ready to love again.</div></blockquote>My fwen broke up after 7 days .. wow..</div>
