            <div class='col-md body'>TS,<br><br>What is 4 r/s if you are still young with time on your side? I don't think and hope that past failures means that you want to rush things to get it right.<br><br>Perhaps it would also be good to reflect on your past failures and really be true to what is actually bothering and failing you. You seem to have a strong view about men handling lust, what is it really? In the 1st place, we live in a time where porn and vices are readily available and accessible, it will really be good if you could put some effort in understanding your partner in this area.<br><br>All of us including aka myself is imperfect and we all have our habits. If he is not in a habit of calling perhaps you can initiate calling yourself. Hang up and be comfortable after knowing that your man is fine and alright, period. What is wrong if he places his friends before you at this stage? Afterall, he has known them before you and surely you should not be sulking. I think it is just too early to deduce your bf just like that. I'd rather show you my true colors rather than let you have false expectations. This is what you are gonna get even when you are gonna get married, honey.<br><br>Understand now? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation"></div>

Even as husband and wife not everything must be reported between each other, moreover you both are just into a 3 months relationship as gf/bf. Truthfully it was a blessing in disguise for HIM.<br><br>Only 3 months into the relationship and you want him to tell you everything. You sounded like a control freak. Do you know what is 'giving breathing space' means? You are smothering his lifestyle. You didn't even allow the relationship to have a chance to bloom. You didn't let your ex bf have a chance to trust you enough to tell you everything. You were rushing him. Walau, can you imagine if he marries you. He sure do die of suffocation.<br><br>Please hor, learn to give people space. You highlighted everything about you so good and still can't understand why you can't find the right man? Well, isn't it obvious there is certainly something very wrong with you? Reflect on your behaviour and change and learn to accomodate other people's feeling and respect other people's personal breathing space hor. Not everything is just YOU, YOU, YOU.<br><br>And don't lump all Singaporean guys together hor. Lots of Singaporean guys are just as decent. Lust? Which man don't have lust? It's how they control their feelings. I'm glad my bf lusted after me or else he might as well be a monk! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

You broke up with your guy, citing serious incompatibility, but I believe it's more likely that he is just unyielding towards your decree of how you perceive and desire the structure of your relationship to be like and that emphasis itself may not lie with incompatibility as a whole.<br><br>You seemed immalleable towards your attitude towards love, secretly hoping for a product which fits perfectly into how you want your relationship to shape into. Surely, that might happen to some, (especially people who managed to build excellent benefic relationship accrued from previous existence/s or having evolved personality from present life) but more often than not, if your cosmic lessons in life lies largely with your relationship, your growth will automatically spring forth from your challenges within and that you have to learn it with humility.<br><br>Your demand out of love will not materialise at face-value; in fact, it often develops an inverse relationship with your thoughts. What will only happen is that you will meet people that will allow you the potential to grow that personality and wisdom to eventually fulfill this demand or understand why you should drop such thoughts.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Ironically, the people who always claim they don't want to fall in love because of the pain, are precisely the very people who always fall in love and always come out battered. </strong></span><br><br>The rationale is very simple; if you allow fear to govern your attitude towards love, then fear will manifest into reality for you. The quantum of fear you have in love is closely linked to one's inability to accept reality and growth in relationship. If you reject growth due to fear, then fear will circumvent you like a pall of miasmatic cloud.<br><br>A simple relationship per se is never simple - in fact, what simple to you could be a 180 degree change in behavioural pattern for another.<br><br>A perfect relationship is never by birthright; it always forged through understanding, compromising and maturity by imperfect partners ourselves. Only by breaking down the emotional barriers we have put in place for love and love with wisdom, would our higher consciousness attract the best possible mate in the same wavelength and make that into reality for us.<br><br>P.S: We learn to walk so as to prevent falling - we don't learn to avoid walking just because we don't want to fall. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>
