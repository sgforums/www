              <p>When I read this I smiled to myself. Because I have exactly the same case as you, except that I am the guy, and and I behaved in exactly the same way as what you have described.</p>
              <p>When you tell a guy you only wanted to be a friend, it is not so much that he is turned off by you, but really he thinks you do not want to be serious (for reasons such as yours), and so naturally he does not want to put in so much effort / hope into you anymore. I know I did when I confessed and got a "I'd rather we be just friends" reply.</p>
              <p>So I did not give her as much attention as I did before. We would still go out though, but in groups (so that she would not feel so awkward, and I wanted to continue to see her). After a while, when things continue like this, the man just doesnt feel he can go on much further with the gal, so since he looks around elsewhere. I know I am in the process of doing that. Thereafter I didnt ask her out with my other friends anymore. Funny thing is that other people think she is my girlfrfiend! How I wish that was true!</p>
              <p>I am obviously not up to the stage where the girl confesses back and says she liked me after the rejection, but as a man, I would really be skeptical about it. Why did you change your mind?</p>
              <p>Not pointing fingers of course, but perhaps both parties just did not communicate properly?</p>
              <p>I would really like to know how a woman would think. Maybe we can learn from one another!</p>

              <p>Hi bigthumbfoot,</p>
              <p>I cannot tell for sure, since I am not a guy. But I suspect that it is just as what Jason has thoughtfully pointed out - It is an ego thing.</p>
              <p>From the time you rejected him, his ego was already hurt to the point where he starts to dislike you, and thus he tries not to talk much to you, and gave you short replies instead. This point will likely be true if the dates are initiated by you.</p>
              <p>Since he has already ask for you to look for other better guys, you should take up that offer and forget about him. He is certainly not ready for a proper relationship yet.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

              <p>I think he just momentarily interested in you when he first met you and then maybe at that moment he had some fantasies about you and therefore wanna you to be his gf so that he can take advantage of you physically. Cause i think its a great turn on for guys if you manage to get the girl to be your gf at the first meeting. In short, he might just be interested in having sex with you...</p>
              <p>On the other hand, i dont understand why you also can be so "cheap". Even though you rejected him, you still held hands with him. I mean you are not related to him and you know him just recently and met him for the first time. So seriously, you might want to also ask yourself what the hell are you actually doing by holding hands with a "Stranger". If you think this is fine, then why dont you hold the hands of all the forumers here...</p>

              <p>Yes. You have hurt his ego and pride.</p>
              <p>Yes. You have given him no hope of taking the relationship further.</p>
              <p>And Yes, he is probably no longer interested in you and may have moved on.</p>
              <p>You are wasting your time with a guy like him. A guy that fickle-minded is not worth your time at all. Then again, I don't know how you rejected him so I cannot judge if it is your fault too. If you rejected him by saying something like "Let's remain as friends for now...", then you may have given him the signal to back off. "Let's get to know each other first" is also an ambiguous statement of putting him off. How do I know? I know some guys who behave like that too and are not that broad-minded.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, this guy is just trying to see if he can get you with as minimum effort as possible. If not, he would move on. Harsh reality, don't you think? </p>

              <p>bigthumbfoot,</p>
              <p>That guy is just interested in what's inside your panty.</p>
              <p>Treating you cold is his way of punishing  you for the rejection. <br>The level of pettiness in him is appalling.</p>
              <p>There are many good looking guys around. This one is not worth a dime.</p>
              <p>When you go back begging for him to take you back, all you doing is fuel his big distorted male ego. </p>
              <p>A game many perverts like to play.</p>
              <p>The best thing to do is trash his contacts and leave him alone.</p>

              <p>halo,</p>
              <p>normally when somethings goes wrong. human will tend to paint a picture that they are the victims. this happens to me too. when i finally realized that what the meaning of "reap what you sow".</p>
              <p>first of all, i agree that you did a great choice to reject that guy when he approach you so fast.</p>
              <p>but when you say you hold hands even when you rejected him. what does it meant to him? i guess he is confused by you. whats is in your heart? ... i guess he doesn't trust you anymore at the point of time. when what you say is not what you mean?</p>
              <p>maybe he was confused, inside in his mind. what type of person are you...???</p>
              <p>maybe he's a jerk also... we do not know.</p>
              <p>i guess he turned cold to you, could meant 2 things.</p>
              <p>1) either he's a jerk to take revenge.</p>
              <p>2) or he has made up his mind that he can't trust you anymore....</p>
              <p>but i could see he's still "a nice guy". he did not take advantage of you even you say you like him. eg: having sex with you and then dumped you...in revenge.</p>
              <p>i am not siding with this guy, i just read your story and it feels this "might" be it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>thanks</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>I believe the reason is already laid out by someone with similar experience...</p>
              <p>(loudmonkey)</p>
              <p>I think so too......</p>
              <p>It's not a question of "ego"</p>
              <p>When you "declined" by saying "let's be friends first to know each other better"</p>
              <p>It set off a series of thought process.....</p>
              <p>So the guy became disinterested and demotivated....</p>
              <p>Im not saying whether this is right or wrong, or whether what you did is right or wrong....</p>
              <p>Maybe learn from this experience.......</p>
