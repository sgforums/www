In the midst of my sleep i woke sudddenly and saw this shoulder length hair girl in white gliding across the corridor. It was as if she was skating. The amazing thing was, i was so tired i closed my eyes and opened them again. When i opened my eyes it was daylight!It seemed 2 real to be a dream. But i did dream of the same girl a few times later. Later i found out some years back, someone was riding a bicycle along the corridor and fell to her death</div>

Then i can sleep all the way to morning, waking up every few hours to ensure the house is alright. I also scared of the dark, hehehehehe</div>
