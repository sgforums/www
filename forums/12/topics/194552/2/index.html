            <div class='col-md body'>I used to have a problem like yours. But after awhile, It overcame with positive thinkings. Look, think about it. Why on earth. Over more than 10 billion people, Why would the ghost specifically pick you and haunt u, no sense right?. As im a christian, whenever i see ghost movies, then i buay ta han. When i sleep, i just put a bible beside me then can liao.</div>
