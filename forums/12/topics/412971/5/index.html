              <p>well i think mr TS shd slap himself in the face and shout "wake up!!". It's all a dream. Wouldnt he at 30 years of age, be naive to think this girl would give up her money making ventures just to be with him? Unless you are high income earner but apparently not....sorry.</p>
              <p>Fuck one chap $100-200? 2 blokes in one night would be $400. That's pretty gd money. And she's an old hand in this industry, 9 freaking years. God knows if she has aged parents back home as she claims.</p>

              <p>Just because a person is a hooker doesn't mean that person always has to be one and will be. Who hasn't got a past?</p>
              <p>If you truly love a person, you'll only be interested in that person's present and future. Acknowledge her past by all means. It may even serve to remind the wrongs that should not be repeated for the good of the future.</p>
              <p>She may be a hooker now. But that's hardly the problem when one has power to change one's future and destiny. The whole world rejecting her and maybe even TS himself is a real possibility. But this is a merely convenient excuse to adopt to walk away from this crossroads.........</p>

              <p>wow...... <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Violet/confused.png" alt="confused.png">, such extreme differing opinions. </p>
              <p>How about this, true love does not take into account either lovers past, however in this situation you are talking about the present, ever thought of making her prove herself?</p>
              <p>what i mean is get a regular job and try to live a regular life if that is possible ( meaning to say that with a regular job she can make rent and pay her bills etc. ) obviously she will have to compromise her standard of living but I would say that it's a great start. </p>
              <p>you have to be with her and support her emotionally, maybe a little financially, and pscyologically for the change and also be prepared for all the negative people who may be aware of her past and try to disrupt her life. </p>
              <p>it has to come from the both of you........ be strong and be positive</p>
