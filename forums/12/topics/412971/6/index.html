              <p>i met up with her today for lunch. It's the 1st time we met after that night with my frens few weeks ago. She has been calling me regularly for the pass few weeks but i just ignored her calls. But this morning i picked up the call and agreed to meet her up for lunch.</p>
              <p>Strangely, i felt very excited when i agreed to meet up with her and was very happy when i actually met her at this little restaurant in town. I told her about my feeling towards her and that i was very hurt when she had paid sex with my frens that night. She apologised to me and told me that she wasn't aware that i was interested in her. She thought we were just normal frens. But now she is happy that i am interested with her and she told me that she actually likes me too. She then asked me to be her boyfriend officially. During that instance, i was actually very happy to hear that and i said yes to her. But i told her i'm not confortable with her job, in which she said she hope to stop working in night club too when she earns enough to be able to support her family in Malaysia. I told her that she could get another job and i can help her financially. She said she can't let me take the burden of her family.</p>
              <p>We will meet again tomorrow.</p>
              <p>I don't know whether i'm doing the right thing or not. On 1 hand, i think i should ignore the fact that she's a prostitute and just love her as a woman who also need love; on the other hand, i worried that the relationship will be affected when my family and frens knows that she's a prostitute and pressure me to give up....i don't know....</p>
              <p>Those frens of mine are close frens who i know for quite long already. Some of them were my primary and secondary school frens, while some were army mates and colleague. I don't know how will they re-act when they found out she's my girl fren.</p>

              <p>Rock Star has a very good point, talk to your friends about it ( something you guys should have done sooner ). Be prepared to  lose some friendships in the process ( especially to those who have already had sex with her ) Be firm in your decisions and stand your ground and stand by her ................they will try to talk you out of it but you should'nt change your mind, be strong. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Don't worry too much about your kids , if found out , just be honest about it ....... as your kids, they will have the same kind of understanding and compassion as you do </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If this all gets too much for you , as a last resort , the both of you move away ..... to somewhere where she won't be so easily recognised, give yourselves a chance to start anew, obviously not for her to go back to her old job.. lol</p>
              <p>i wish you both all the happiness </p>

              <p>PRI, u must be very very mentally prepared for the rest of your life if you really want this kind of relationship especially your friends have went to bed with her for sexual services.</p>

              <p>what i mean is that, most guys, especially those high egos and pride type but yet with low IQ and intelligent tend to develop a phobia of marrying his own country gals, which are actually his sisters, mother and aunties, they do not wish to marry up or even on equal par, so they choose to marry low, and for singapore gals, I would said most are well educated and some earning more than guys, but these are your daughter, your sisters, your nieces, your aunties and your gal next door who can help and guide you financially to built a better family. You marry a vietcong, who knows how to take money from you only, maybe to built village toilet or her mother expenses, if you take home $5000, in Singapore, you are near choking with cost of living and yet have to support a vietcong family that cannot help you financially or even help you in term of investment, and you also need to pay airfare and time wasted on travelling to vietnam for her.</p>
              <p>Now,if your friend who earn a thousand less than you get a Singapore gal who earn $3k and improving, the take home will be 8k, +++ bonus and investment both of your work together, they will get more, and being in a better financial situation you think better. No doubt you get sg gal tellin you what to do, but that is what they are, educated to support their sg husband for a better tomorrow.</p>
              <p>For every successful man lies a smart and successful wife.</p>

              <p>well, it is a battle of the sexes here, do you expect me to said those going for vietcon gals to be clever? Play play ok lah, but to marry them, guess you must be blinded. It is not that my Joo Chiat here got no vietgals, hundreds of them, they can even tell me sg guys are damn stupids, like to throw their hard earn money here instead of taking care of their wife or get a sg gal and built a nice family.</p>
              <p>You dun look at a few sg gal who are materialistic and start to condone the whole sg gal reputation, we are afterall, also your sisters and nieces, or even daughters, you dun expect us to be breed to look down on poor guys?? or someone earning lower than us, as long as the guy love me, do not do hanky panky, work a decent job, can support himself and a family of 4, why not, we can chip in to help out, earning more or less is not a problem to him. But then, we expect guys to open up too, remove their male chauvinism, help us with housework, care for childrens and shopping. Since we are helping guys financially, we expect them to work less and help us out in a double income household. We do and still respect them as head of the family, but we dun want them to become overly male dominant, we expect discussion, consultation btw husband and wife before he makes a final decision on certain matter. No like those viet or thai or philipine gals, you can make whatever decision, just give me the money will be fine</p>

              </p><p>it is a battle of perception too.....it is not one who has that view....most of us....the rest is silent because they were too busy...</p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 18px;">the system has a great part to play which will affect the lives of one gender as compared to the favourable other....it cannot be lopsided...</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 18px;">the system has to balance both interests and not lopsided......</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 18px;">now the system has to suffer with the rising phenomenon of singles and greater divorces....they are creating greater disparity of both genders than harmoniously balancing them....for all they are good in economic aspects, they failed socially</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 18px;">if sg gals cannot appreciate the balance, should we show the least respect for both the system and the gals who dun support?  </span></p>

              <p>one bad egg sg gal and you said all are bad, that is discriminating. There are also many bad sg guys in singapore cheating us, taking webcam, threatening us etc etc...more than sg gals, so am I going to said all sg guys are bad egg. Having said all, most of these PRC or vietcong gals are here for money, in term of ratio, they are certainly more than us, for sg gal, it can be 1:5 go for money, for them, it can be 5:5</p>

              <p>Nonono, congrats, you are damn rich though not the richest i've seen. Rich can be a relative thing and yeh, good for you if you're as rich as you claim. Cos I see in a lot of your posts about you always subtly mentioning how rich you are lol.</p>

              <p>i met up with her today for lunch. It's the 1st time we met after that night with my frens few weeks ago. She has been calling me regularly for the pass few weeks but i just ignored her calls. But this morning i picked up the call and agreed to meet her up for lunch.</p>
              <p>Strangely, i felt very excited when i agreed to meet up with her and was very happy when i actually met her at this little restaurant in town. I told her about my feeling towards her and that i was very hurt when she had paid sex with my frens that night. She apologised to me and told me that she wasn't aware that i was interested in her. She thought we were just normal frens. But now she is happy that i am interested with her and she told me that she actually likes me too. She then asked me to be her boyfriend officially. During that instance, i was actually very happy to hear that and i said yes to her. But i told her i'm not confortable with her job, in which she said she hope to stop working in night club too when she earns enough to be able to support her family in Malaysia. I told her that she could get another job and i can help her financially. She said she can't let me take the burden of her family.</p>
              <p>We will meet again tomorrow.</p>
              <p>I don't know whether i'm doing the right thing or not. On 1 hand, i think i should ignore the fact that she's a prostitute and just love her as a woman who also need love; on the other hand, i worried that the relationship will be affected when my family and frens knows that she's a prostitute and pressure me to give up....i don't know....</p>
              <p>Those frens of mine are close frens who i know for quite long already. Some of them were my primary and secondary school frens, while some were army mates and colleague. I don't know how will they re-act when they found out she's my girl fren.</p>

              <p>Some of you folks can take out the debate  elsewhere. Might affect the mood and decision of TS.</p>
              <p>TS is having a hard time. At one hand, perhaps his first love of his life. On the other, this love might hurt him more. The thought of giving up someone you love is unthinkable....</p>
