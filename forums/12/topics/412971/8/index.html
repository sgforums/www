              <p>Reminds me of that old 'Pretty Woman' movie leh. In the end , the Richard Gere truly fell in love with that Julia Roberts and both were happy. But fren, that is only a movie. In real-life, damn troublesome lah. Unless you got lots of money and go far away with her to live in the other side of the world. Then she can also start afresh for good. If not, consider other gals lor.</p>

              <p>Another problem of our relationship is the lack time to meet. I work from 8.30am to 5.30pm monday to friday. She works from 7pm to 3pm in the night club everyday including weekends. After works, some of her customer would book her out and she would usually reach home around 9-10am each day. She would also sometimes take up some customers in the afternoon. So during weekdays, i sometimes take the opportunity to meet her between our works (between 5.30 to 7pm) .We have more time together during weekends, but sometimes she has customers too. In fact she has more customers during weekends.</p>
              <p>So it's quite hard for us. It's quite frustrating sometimes, like last Saturday where we were supposed to spend the whole day together. She had to excused herself 3 times, each time for about 2-3 hrs to have sex with her customers. The waits was quite hard for me. Each time i have to either wait for her at the hotel lobby or at the nearby shopping center.</p>

              <p>bro....</p>
              <p>excuse me to say this....i think she doesn't love you at all...she only takes the advantage from you</p>
              <p>let's see from this fact:</p>
              <p>she
              works as a prostitute to support her family in Malaysia coz she is
              low-educated and no choice for a better living.  Your salary isn't
              enough also to support her.</p>
              <p>You said that she has many customers...she is always fully-booked which means she earns a lot of money.</p>
              <p>But
              WHY she is still "entertaining" your friends ????  How many friends of
              you become her regular customer?  i think only few of your friends
              become her regular customers....less than 5% of her total customers.</p>
              <p>If
              she stopped entertaining your friends...i think it wouldn't shaking her
              financial stabillity........unless 50% of her customers are your
              friends.</p>
              <p>In my opinion, if she trully loves you .... the first
              thing she must do is "terminating the contract" with her and your
              friends..... TO RESPECT YOU AS HER TRUE LOVE.  I am sure the money she
              gets from your friends only a small percentage of her total income. 
              Which one is important, a small percentage of her income or your
              feeling?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>That's why I said that she only take the advantage from you and she doesn't respect you at all.</p>
              <p>once again, sorry to say that...i just try to analyze from your post</p>

              <p>She chooses her customers and don't sleep with everybody that offer to pay her for sex. So she doesn't have too many customers. She has some regular ones who hire her at least once a week or two. 6 of my friends and colleagues has had paid sex with her. They contribute to almost 30% of her income, so it's still quite significant to her.</p>
              <p>On weekdays, she has between 1-3 customers; on Saturday and Sunday, she has between 6-12 customers for the 2 days. My friends also booked her during weekends. She said that some of her friends who don't choose customers can have up to 10-12 customers for saturdays alone.</p>

              <p>Another problem of our relationship is the lack time to meet. I work from 8.30am to 5.30pm monday to friday. She works from 7pm to 3pm in the night club everyday including weekends. After works, some of her customer would book her out and she would usually reach home around 9-10am each day. She would also sometimes take up some customers in the afternoon. So during weekdays, i sometimes take the opportunity to meet her between our works (between 5.30 to 7pm) .We have more time together during weekends, but sometimes she has customers too. In fact she has more customers during weekends.</p>
              <p>So it's quite hard for us. It's quite frustrating sometimes, like last Saturday where we were supposed to spend the whole day together. She had to excused herself 3 times, each time for about 2-3 hrs to have sex with her customers. The waits was quite hard for me. Each time i have to either wait for her at the hotel lobby or at the nearby shopping center.</p>
