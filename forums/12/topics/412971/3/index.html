              <p>Thanks for all your comments and advice.</p>
              <p>Just to clarify, the night i met her was the first and only time i have visited a nightclub. I have never visited any prostitue or paid for sex before. My last relationship lasted for 3 yrs but ended 2 yrs ago, after my ex-gf left me for another guy.</p>
              <p>I did try to date other girls for the past 2 yrs but have not have any success.</p>
              <p>Currently i meet this girl almost everyday. We go for meals and shopping during day time as she works at night. She's from Malaysia and has worked in this line for almost  9 yrs already. She needs to support her aging parents and a daughter she has from a previous relationship. All of them still stay in Malaysia.</p>
              <p>My friends are still not aware that i'm going out with her. They still visit her nightclub often.</p>
              <p>Yes, i admit i'm very confused. Is it love or infatuation like what some of you said? But i'm very happy when i meet her and she seems very happy meeting me too. We have so much to talk about and so much to laugh at together..i have not felt so happy for a long time already.</p>

              <p>Your heart took over your brain liao. People with such low morals can do whatever want like being a prostitute and going out with you cuz maybe your a free meal ticket? She can work any full time job but she had to be a prostitute. That really says alot about her. Malaysiaaaaa truly asiaaaaa~~~~</p>

              <p>With a woman such as this, the relationship is an easy one.
              There is no challenge as there would if it was an ordinary girl.
              There was not much wooing, no courting, as would be with
              other girls.</p>
              <p>There is only misplaced sympathy.</p>
              <p>She know how not to piss off a man, and know how to flatter a
              man.</p>
              <p>It is easy to be infatuated with a prostitute.</p>
              <p>She will find you acceptance of her welcoming, but she will also
              have her conflicts in her mind. She will deal with it
              clinically.</p>
              <p>You on the other hand, will have to live with the knowledge of
              her past. This will always surface when you meet your friends in
              social situations, when you have sex with her, when you put on
              a bold front, whenever you declare that you don't care about her
              past, when other prostitutes are in the news, it will never go
              away. Can you handle it?</p>
              <p>To come clean about her past, or to hide it?</p>
              <p>Whatever, you will be between a rock and a hard place. And it
              won't be easy for her either.</p>

              <p>I agree with what Mancha wrote. But if you think you're ready to accept her for what she is, may I suggest you bring her to your friend's gathering someday. Sometimes words are easier said than done. </p>
              <p>There's nothing wrong with marrying a prostitute but it's the stigma that comes along with it. We don't live in a one man island. Whatever your decision is, please think through it carefully before anyone gets hurt in the end. </p>

              <p>Life is not business and needs, expectations and fears would quickly rush headlong to cement to bind the other. Why? Is there a need to elaborate. For those who are being self-honest they would know.</p>
              <p>Sadly, human beings rationalize so what can one do except unlearn the difficult way when the misery and the pain sets in. The cause may seem like the other but the truth is it is self-created. Pain is a good teacher. Of course, it is not necessary if one is unserious about living, play and leave lah.</p>

It is those weak hearted, dreamers, too ugly to have gfs or too old to find a wife, or simply want a simple relationship out of it, or too much money got no where to spend will fall for them.

              <p>Anyone can be in a business but to solicit for customers especially when one is ''troubled'' or ... is ugliness. Well, when one predates on anothers misery for self-gains or purports to make another happy but has a motive - then it is nothing more than prostitution.</p>
              <p>I do wonder if this person would give the same advice to a prospective spouse or even one's sibling to adopt such a stance.</p>
