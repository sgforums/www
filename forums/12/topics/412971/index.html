              <p>I'm a 30 y-o unmarried man. The problem is i'm in love with a woman same age as me who is working as a night club hostess and part time prostitute. I want to marry her but  I know my family and friends will not accept this and i don't know what to do.</p>
              <p> I first me met her during a night out with a group of my friends at the nightclub she works in. It was the first and only time i have visited a night club. She kept me company there and we had a good chat. I fell for her after that night and could not forget her. She followed me and my friends to one of my friend's house that night and 2 of my friends paid to have sex with her there. I refused to do the same. Both of them paid to have sex with her again several times more after that night. I kept in touch with her after that night though phones and finally, 2 months after that i asked her out for the first time. She said yes, and we have been going out regularly for dates for 3 months now.</p>
              <p>I haven't really express my feeling to her yet although i told her i enjoy going out with her very much.</p>
              <p>What should i do? Any advice?</p>

              <p>Well, if you really love her so much, by all means, go for her.</p>
              <p>And if you can realy wont mind her past, by all means, go for her.</p>
              <p>Remember next time you ever quarrel, DO NOT EVER bring up her past.</p>

              <p><strong>YOU ARE IN DANGER OF TURNING INTO A SERIAL KILLER. GARY RIDGEWAY WAS MARRIED TO PROSTITUTE AND BECAUSE HE WAS BETRAYED STARTED KILLING PROSTITUTES:</strong></p>

              <p><strong>Gary Leon Ridgway</strong> (born February 18, 1949), known as the <strong>Green River Killer</strong>, is an <a title="United States" href="/wiki/United_States"><span style="color: #0645ad;">American</span></a> <a title="Serial killer" href="/wiki/Serial_killer"><span style="color: #0645ad;">serial killer</span></a>. Ridgway murdered numerous women in <a title="Washington (U.S. state)" href="/wiki/Washington_(U.S._state)"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Washington</span></a> during the 1980s and 1990s.<sup id="cite_ref-Haglund_et_al..2C_1990_0-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Haglund_et_al..2C_1990-0"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></span></a></sup> He strangled them, mostly with his arm, but he would also use <a class="mw-redirect" title="Ligature strangulation" href="/wiki/Ligature_strangulation"><span style="color: #0645ad;">ligatures</span></a>. After strangling the women, he would dump their bodies throughout <a class="mw-redirect" title="King County" href="/wiki/King_County"><span style="color: #0645ad;">King County</span></a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Prothero_2006_1-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Prothero_2006-1"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></span></a></sup></p>
              <p>On November 30, 2001, as he was leaving a <a title="Renton, Washington" href="/wiki/Renton,_Washington"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Renton, Washington</span></a> factory where he worked, he was arrested for the <a title="Murder" href="/wiki/Murder"><span style="color: #0645ad;">murders</span></a> of four women whose cases were linked to him through <a title="DNA" href="/wiki/DNA"><span style="color: #0645ad;">DNA</span></a> evidence.<sup id="cite_ref-Prothero_2006_1-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Prothero_2006-1"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></span></a></sup> As part of a <a title="Plea bargain" href="/wiki/Plea_bargain"><span style="color: #0645ad;">plea bargain</span></a>, he was spared the <a class="mw-redirect" title="Death penalty" href="/wiki/Death_penalty"><span style="color: #0645ad;">death penalty</span></a> and received a sentence of <a title="Life imprisonment" href="/wiki/Life_imprisonment"><span style="color: #0645ad;">life imprisonment</span></a> without <a title="Parole" href="/wiki/Parole"><span style="color: #0645ad;">parole</span></a>.</p>
              <p><span id="Early_life" class="mw-headline">Early life</span></p>
              <p>Ridgway was born in <a class="mw-redirect" title="Salt Lake City, Utah" href="/wiki/Salt_Lake_City,_Utah"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Salt Lake City, Utah</span></a>, to Mary Rita Steinman and Thomas Newton Ridgway. He has two brothers—Gregory Leon and Thomas Edward. He was raised in the McMicken Heights neighborhood of <a title="SeaTac, Washington" href="/wiki/SeaTac,_Washington"><span style="color: #0645ad;">SeaTac, Washington</span></a>.</p>
              <p>Ridgway's homelife was somewhat troubled; relatives have described his mother as domineering and have said that young Ridgway witnessed more than one violent argument between his parents.<sup id="cite_ref-Time_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Time-2"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></span></a></sup> As a boy Ridgway had a habit of wetting the bed. His mother would often be the one to discover the accidents and would bathe him immediately. She would belittle him and embarrass him in front of his family. While she was bathing him she would usually be wearing a bath robe that would sometimes open. When the bath was done, she would dry him completely, even into his early teen years. From a young age, Ridgway had conflicting feelings of sexual attraction and anger toward her.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></span></a></sup></p>
              <p>As a young child, Ridgway was tested with an <a class="mw-redirect" title="I.Q." href="/wiki/I.Q."><span style="color: #0645ad;">I.Q.</span></a> of 82, signifying <a class="mw-redirect" title="Low intelligence" href="/wiki/Low_intelligence"><span style="color: #0645ad;">low intelligence</span></a>, and his academic performance in school was so poor that at one point in high school he had to repeat a single school year twice in order to attain grades decent enough to pass. His classmates at <a title="Tyee Educational Complex" href="/wiki/Tyee_Educational_Complex"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Tyee High School</span></a> describe him as congenial but largely forgettable. His teenage years, however, were troubled; when he was 16, he stabbed a six-year-old boy, who survived the attack. According to the victim and Ridgway himself, Ridgway walked away laughing and saying, "I always wondered what it would be like to kill someone." While in high school, Ridgway joined the <a title="Navy" href="/wiki/Navy"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Navy</span></a>. After graduation, he was sent to <a title="Vietnam War" href="/wiki/Vietnam_War"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Vietnam</span></a>, where he served on board a supply ship,<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></span></a></sup> and saw combat.<sup id="cite_ref-Time_2-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Time-2"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></span></a></sup></p>
              <p>Friends and family, questioned about Ridgway after his arrest, described him as friendly but strange. His first two marriages resulted in divorce because of infidelities by both partners. Both a prostitute and his second wife claimed that, in 1991, he had placed them in <a class="mw-redirect" title="Chokeholds" href="/wiki/Chokeholds"><span style="color: #0645ad;">chokeholds</span></a>.</p>
              <p>In 1975 his second wife gave birth to his son, Matthew, who is a <a title="United States Marine Corps" href="/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Marine</span></a> now living in the <a title="San Diego" href="/wiki/San_Diego"><span style="color: #0645ad;">San Diego</span></a> area.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></span></a></sup></p>

              <p><span id="The_murders" class="mw-headline">The murders</span></p>
              <p>Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Ridgway is believed to have murdered at least 48 women near <a title="Seattle" href="/wiki/Seattle"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Seattle</span></a> and <a title="Tacoma, Washington" href="/wiki/Tacoma,_Washington"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Tacoma, Washington</span></a>. Most of the murders occurred between 1982 to 1984. Most victims were either <a class="mw-redirect" title="Prostitutes" href="/wiki/Prostitutes"><span style="color: #0645ad;">prostitutes</span></a> or runaways picked up along Pacific Highway South (<a title="Washington State Route 99" href="/wiki/Washington_State_Route_99"><span style="color: #0645ad;">State Route 99</span></a>) whom he <a class="mw-redirect" title="Strangled" href="/wiki/Strangled"><span style="color: #0645ad;">strangled</span></a>. Most of their bodies were dumped in wooded areas around the <a title="Green River (Washington)" href="/wiki/Green_River_(Washington)"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Green River</span></a> in Washington, except for two confirmed and another two suspected victims found in the <a title="Portland, Oregon" href="/wiki/Portland,_Oregon"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Portland, Oregon</span></a>, area. The bodies were often left in <a class="mw-redirect" title="Clusters" href="/wiki/Clusters"><span style="color: #0645ad;">clusters</span></a>, sometimes posed, usually nude. Because most of the bodies were not discovered until only the <a class="mw-redirect" title="Skeletons" href="/wiki/Skeletons"><span style="color: #0645ad;">skeletons</span></a> remained, four victims are still unidentified. Ridgway occasionally <a class="mw-redirect" title="Contaminated" href="/wiki/Contaminated"><span style="color: #0645ad;">contaminated</span></a> the dump sites with gum, cigarettes, and written materials belonging to others, and he even transported several victims' remains across state lines into <a title="Oregon" href="/wiki/Oregon"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Oregon</span></a> to confuse the police.</p>
              <p>Ridgway began each murder by picking up a woman, usually a prostitute. He sometimes showed the woman a picture of his son, to help her trust him. After having sex with her, Ridgway strangled her from behind. He initially strangled them manually. However, many victims inflicted wounds and bruises on his arm while trying to defend themselves. Concerned these wounds and bruises would draw attention, Ridgeway began using ligatures to strangle his victims. Most victims were killed in his home, his truck, or a secluded area.<sup id="cite_ref-Prothero_2006_1-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Prothero_2006-1"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></span></a></sup></p>
              <p>In the early 1980s, the <a class="mw-redirect" title="King County, Washington Sheriff's Office" href="/wiki/King_County,_Washington_Sheriff%27s_Office"><span style="color: #0645ad;">King County Sheriff's Office</span></a> formed the Green River Task Force to investigate the murders. The most notable members of the task force were <a class="mw-redirect" title="Robert Keppel" href="/wiki/Robert_Keppel"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Robert Keppel</span></a> and <a title="Dave Reichert" href="/wiki/Dave_Reichert"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Dave Reichert</span></a>, who periodically interviewed incarcerated <a title="Serial killer" href="/wiki/Serial_killer"><span style="color: #0645ad;">serial killer</span></a> <a title="Ted Bundy" href="/wiki/Ted_Bundy"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Ted Bundy</span></a> from 1984. Their interviews with Bundy were of little help in the Green River investigations but elicited confessions from Bundy on unsolved cases. Also contributing was <a title="John E.

              <p>Ridgway was arrested in 1982 and 2001 on charges related to prostitution. He became a suspect in 1983 in the Green River killings. In 1984, Ridgway took and passed a <a class="mw-redirect" title="Polygraph test" href="/wiki/Polygraph_test"><span style="color: #0645ad;">polygraph test</span></a>, and on April 7, 1987, police took hair and <a title="Saliva" href="/wiki/Saliva"><span style="color: #0645ad;">saliva</span></a> samples from Ridgway. These were later subjected to a <a class="mw-redirect" title="DNA analysis" href="/wiki/DNA_analysis"><span style="color: #0645ad;">DNA analysis</span></a>, providing the evidence for his arrest <a title="Warrant (law)" href="/wiki/Warrant_(law)"><span style="color: #0645ad;">warrant</span></a>.</p>
              <p>On November 30, 2001, Ridgway was at the <a title="Kenworth" href="/wiki/Kenworth"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Kenworth</span></a> Truck factory when police arrived to arrest him. Ridgway was arrested on suspicion of murder of four women nearly 20 years after first being identified as a potential suspect when <a title="DNA" href="/wiki/DNA"><span style="color: #0645ad;">DNA</span></a> evidence conclusively linked <a title="Semen" href="/wiki/Semen"><span style="color: #0645ad;">semen</span></a> left in the victims to the saliva swab taken by the police. The four victims named in the original indictment were Marcia Chapman, Opal Mills, Cynthia Hinds, and Carol Ann Christensen. Three more victims—Wendy Coffield, Debra Bonner, and Debra Estes—were added to the <a title="Indictment" href="/wiki/Indictment"><span style="color: #0645ad;">indictment</span></a> after <a class="mw-redirect" title="Forensics" href="/wiki/Forensics"><span style="color: #0645ad;">forensics</span></a> laboratories detected <a class="mw-redirect" title="Microscopic" href="/wiki/Microscopic"><span style="color: #0645ad;">microscopic</span></a> paint particles similar to those used at Ridgway's job at Kenworth.</p>

              <p>Early in August 2003, <a title="Seattle" href="/wiki/Seattle"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Seattle</span></a> television news reported that Ridgway had been moved from a <a class="mw-redirect" title="Maximum security" href="/wiki/Maximum_security"><span style="color: #0645ad;">maximum security</span></a> cell at King County Jail to an undisclosed location. Other news reports stated that his lawyers, led by <a class="new" title="Anthony Savage (page does not exist)" href="/w/index.php?title=Anthony_Savage&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1"><span style="color: #ba0000;">Anthony Savage</span></a>, were closing a <a title="Plea bargain" href="/wiki/Plea_bargain"><span style="color: #0645ad;">plea bargain</span></a> that would spare him the <a class="mw-redirect" title="Death penalty" href="/wiki/Death_penalty"><span style="color: #0645ad;">death penalty</span></a> in return for his confession to a number of the Green River murders.</p>
              <p>On November 5, 2003, Ridgway entered a <a class="mw-redirect" title="Guilty plea" href="/wiki/Guilty_plea"><span style="color: #0645ad;">guilty plea</span></a> to 48 charges of <a class="mw-redirect" title="First degree murder" href="/wiki/First_degree_murder"><span style="color: #0645ad;">aggravated first degree murder</span></a> as part of a plea bargain, agreed to in June, that would spare him <a class="mw-redirect" title="Execution" href="/wiki/Execution"><span style="color: #0645ad;">execution</span></a> in exchange for his cooperation in locating the remains of his victims and providing other details. In his statement accompanying his <a class="mw-redirect" title="Guilty plea" href="/wiki/Guilty_plea"><span style="color: #0645ad;">guilty plea</span></a>, Ridgway explained that all of his victims had been killed inside King County, Washington, and that he had transported and dumped the remains of the two women near Portland to confuse the police.</p>
              <p>Deputy prosecutor Jeffrey Baird noted in court that the deal contained "the names of 41 victims who would not be the subject of <em>State v. Ridgway</em> if it were not for the <a class="mw-redirect" title="Plea agreement" href="/wiki/Plea_agreement"><span style="color: #0645ad;">plea agreement</span></a>." King County Prosecuting Attorney <a title="Norm Maleng" href="/wiki/Norm_Maleng"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Norm Maleng</span></a> explained his decision to make the deal:</p>

              <p>Ridgway led prosecutors to three bodies in 2003. On August 16 of that year, remains of a 16-year-old female found near <a title="Enumclaw, Washington" href="/wiki/Enumclaw,_Washington"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Enumclaw, Washington</span></a>, 40 feet from <a title="Washington State Route 410" href="/wiki/Washington_State_Route_410"><span style="color: #0645ad;">State Route 410</span></a>, were pronounced as belonging to Pammy Annette Avent, who had been believed to be a victim of the Green River Killer. The remains of Marie Malvar and April Buttram were found in September. On November 23, 2005, <a title="Associated Press" href="/wiki/Associated_Press"><span style="color: #0645ad;">The Associated Press</span></a> reported that a weekend hiker found the <a title="Human skull" href="/wiki/Human_skull"><span style="color: #0645ad;">skull</span></a> of one of the 48 women Ridgway admitted murdering in his 2003 plea bargain with King County prosecutors. The skull of Tracy Winston, who was 19 when she disappeared from <a title="Northgate Mall (Seattle)" href="/wiki/Northgate_Mall_(Seattle)"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Northgate Mall</span></a> on September 12, 1983, was found by a man hiking in a wooded area near Highway 18 near <a title="Issaquah, Washington" href="/wiki/Issaquah,_Washington"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Issaquah</span></a>, southeast of Seattle.</p>
              <p>Ridgway confessed to more confirmed murders than any other American serial killer. Over a period of five months of police and prosecutor interviews, he confessed to 48 murders, 42 of which were on the police's list of probable Green River Killer victims, plus six more murders.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></span></a></sup> On February 9, 2004, county prosecutors began to release the videotape records of Ridgway's confessions. In one taped interview, he told investigators initially that he was responsible for the deaths of 65 women, but in another taped interview with Reichert on December 31, 2003, Ridgway claimed to have murdered 71 victims and confessed to having had sex with them prior to killing them, a detail which he did not reveal until after his sentencing.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></span></a></sup> In his confession, he acknowledged that he targeted prostitutes because they were "easy to pick up and that he hated most of them".<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></span></a></sup> He also confessed that he had sex with his victims' bodies after he murdered them, but claimed he began burying the later victims so that he could resist the urge to commit <a title="Necrophilia" href="/wiki/Necrophilia"><span style="color: #0645ad;">necrophilia</span></a>.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></span></a></sup></p>
              <p>Ridgway talked to and tried to make his victims comfortable before he committed the murders. In his own words, "I would talk to her... and get her mind off of the, sex, anything she was nervous about. And think, you know, she thinks, 'Oh, this guy cares'... which I didn't. I just want to, uh, get her in the vehicle and eventually kill her".<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></span></a></sup></p>
              <p>Later in a statement Ridgway said that murdering young women was his "career".<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></span></a></sup></p>

              <li>Ridgway denied killing Amina Agisheff whose remains were found on April 18, 1984. Agisheff does not fit the <a title="Victimology" href="/wiki/Victimology"><span style="color: #0645ad;">profile</span></a> of any of the victims of the Green River Killer considering her age, and she was not a prostitute or a teenaged runaway.<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></span></a></sup> </li>
              <li>Although he has never been charged with her murder, Gary Ridgway did confess to killing Kase Ann Lee. During police <a class="mw-redirect" title="Interrogations" href="/wiki/Interrogations"><span style="color: #0645ad;">interrogations</span></a> in 2003, Ridgway stated that he strangled Lee in 1982 and left her body near a drive-in theatre off the Sea-Tac Strip. As of October 2008, law enforcement officials have been unable to locate Lee's remains at the dump site that Ridgway indicated.<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>16<span>]</span></span></a></sup> </li>
              <li>Ridgway is also a suspect in the death of Tammie Liles. Her body was discovered in April 1985 within a mile of the bodies of known victims Shirley Shirell and Denise Bush.

              <li>Evidence exists to suggest that Ridgway murdered Keli Kay McGinness. Shortly before her disappearance, McGinness was questioned by a Port of Seattle police officer while "dating" Ridgway near the <a title="SeaTac" href="/wiki/SeaTac"><span style="color: #0645ad;">SeaTac</span></a> Strip. Furthermore, during the summer of 2003, Ridgway led authorities to the bodies of several of his victims. One of those bodies (which later turned out to be April Buttram) was initially identified by Ridgway as being that of Keli Kay McGinness. According to Ridgway, he often confused McGinness with Buttram because of their similar physiques.<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>18<span>]</span></span></a></sup> </li>

              <p>hello...30 yr old man. what have you been doing for the past 30 years? </p>
              <p> no one can decide for you if you should go ahead with this girl of yours. But whatever you have decided on, you bear your own consequences for your decision. Some day in future don't ever look back and tell yourself that you regret, saying how stupid you are for doing this, because you only live life once and there's no clock for you to turn back. Be sure that when you look back you're telling yourself I have made the right decision and you're living in happiness.</p>
              <p>This doesn't just apply to marrying her, but for many other decision makings in life. </p>
