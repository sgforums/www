              <p>I'm a 30 y-o unmarried man. The problem is i'm in love with a
                      woman same age as me who is working as a night club
                      hostess and part time prostitute. I want to marry her but  I
                      know my family and friends will not accept this and i don't
                      know what to do.</p>
              <p> I first me met her during a night out with a group of my
                      friends at the nightclub she works in. It was the first and only
                      time i have visited a night club. She kept me company there and we
                      had a good chat. I fell for her after that night and could not
                      forget her. She followed me and my friends to one of my friend's
                      house that night and 2 of my friends paid to have sex with her
                      there. I refused to do the same. Both of them paid to have sex
                      with her again several times more after that night. I kept in touch
                      with her after that night though phones and finally, 2 months after
                      that i asked her out for the first time. She said yes, and we have
                      been going out regularly for dates for 3 months now.</p>
              <p>I haven't really express my feeling to her yet although i told
                      her i enjoy going out with her very much.</p>
              <p>What should i do? Any advice?</p>

                       developmental needs. You being the unmarried bachelor is hoping to 
                      fall in love, date and marry the woman you love. She is one woman 
                      working to pay her bills and fuel her current standard of living. Her 
                      encounter with you is merely a business transaction, eloquently said by 
                      ditzy.<br> <br> Despite heeding to your moral intention of not having to pay her for 
                      sex, that does not mean that her dealing with you does not stem out of a
                       business transaction. On one hand your simple minded perspective just 
                      want to love her for love sake, on the other hand, it is highly probable
                       that she actually perceive you as a 'lucrative' business deal that 
                      could rake in much more than 'per-session' deal. <br> <br> Surely a woman, regardless how slattern, is entitled to their pursue of 
                      love. However, the astrological causal connection towards how the man 
                      first begin the relationship with these ladies is all too familiar: the 
                      classic Neptune-afflicted relationship, thrown with a couple of karmic 
                      strings attached to it. It would be worst if your profile somewhat 
                      belong to either one/more of the following:<br> <br> 1. You do not have any meaningful relationship before OR isn't in a meaningful relationship for a long period of time. <br> <br> 2. You do not receive much positive responses from ladies in a romantic 
                      sense. You have encountered multiple rejection/failed chase process 
                      towards forming meaningful relationships.<br> <br> 3. Your life has history of being involved in/as (i) third party, (ii) sub-rosa relationship, (iii) elicit relationship.<br> <br> P.S: Not all presenting choices are benign. Some existed because these 
                      are karmic landmines to get us into deep shit. You have been warned. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="icon_idea.gif"><br> <br> Cheers</p>

              <p>fell in love with a prostitute ? Either your balls and your brain must have switched places that night or been in the wrong place for the last thirty years !</p>
              <p>Same for the prostitute who fell in love with her client.. and as it takes 2 hands to clap, it takes 2 such person to make a tragedy !</p>

              <p>If you are serious about the relationship.......and you gone thru the decision and consequences process.......How do you transit her to work in a normal stream of work and not fall back into Prostitution?</p>

              <p>Hi...</p>
              <p>She is a problem woman, and you wont have any future with her....</p>
              <p>She has some issues.......</p>
              <p>Maybe even health problems / STDs....</p>
              <p>Why should you do that...?</p>
              <p>There are other women out there....I think you are just confused because you are lonely, and thus your loneliness is channelled into her, and you think she is the answer, and you love her. But I dont think so......Do you know her? How long have you known her ? Do you know her personality, her past, her dreams, etc all these ? You barely even know her. You just met her a few times.</p>
              <p>If you can go meet prostitutes....my suggestion is go join dating agencies and go to dating events........rather than going to prostitutes.....</p>
              <p>Because at least if you join dating events, maybe you can meet someone more suitable and has long-term potential.....stop wasting time visiting prostitutes.....they dont do anything, really. Maybe you should even change your friends. No offense bro but your friends are bad influence.</p>

              <p>Ts,</p>
              <p>What is lacking is ''self''-love and the other thing is that u unconsciously seem to be projecting what you deem as love when it is not. If it was love - u would not be here. it belies the fear, the need to ... also, approval and acceptance; all offer opinions, views and even advice but no one is privy to that aspect that belies the facade of projections/role that you seem to be engaged in now and only when you are of your own volition willing to see and  may it be amenable to the other or even absenting the other.</p>
              <p>Being self-honest mite make you see ''issues'' ''reasons'' 'fears' and ... these if unresolved, if unreconciled is bound to surface in another relationship even if this flounders. How can one who is unintegrated within relate. At the most it is a mutual benefit scheme. Two beggars with invisible bowls using and fulfilling each other. It is a dicey affair and bound to derail cos only one thing is certain - change and when the reasons to love once fulfilled - the demise of that begins.</p>
              <p>In this instance, it is a ''prositute'' but it could be another and it wont make any difference. What one really is bound to surface. When unreconciled one is an accident waiting to happen. The friendship, the relationship is a mere excuse!</p>

              <p>With a woman such as this, the relationship is an easy one. There is no challenge as there would if it was an ordinary girl. There was not much wooing, no courting, as would be with other girls.</p>
              <p>There is only misplaced sympathy.</p>
              <p>She know how not to piss off a man, and know how to flatter a man.</p>
              <p>It is easy to be infatuated with a prostitute.</p>
              <p>She will find you acceptance of her welcoming, but she will also have her conflicts in her mind. She will deal with it clinically.</p>
              <p>You on the other hand, will have to live with the knowledge of her past. This will always surface when you meet your friends in social situations, when you have sex with her, when you put on a bold front, whenever you declare that you don't care about her past, when other prostitutes are in the news, it will never go away. Can you handle it?</p>
              <p>To come clean about her past, or to hide it?</p>
              <p>Whatever, you will be between a rock and a hard place. And it won't be easy for her either.</p>

              <p>fell in love with a prostitute ? Either your balls and your brain must have switched places that night or been in the wrong place for the last thirty years !</p>
              <p>Same for the prostitute who fell in love with her client.. and as it takes 2 hands to clap, it takes 2 such person to make a tragedy !</p>
              <p>I suggest the following:</p>
              <p>a. visit other night clubs. you do not know what you may find. you may fell in love with another one..</p>
              <p>b. join more social activities, know more decent women and know your options. as someone says, no other gals is it ??</p>
              <p>c. read more books so that your brain can work properly</p>

              <p>TS, ever ask yourself why she is a prostitute?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Reasons:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1) Due to poor family background, force to work as a chicken.</p>
              <p>2) Got cheated by her bf.</p>
              <p>3) Repay debts.</p>
              <p>4) Love money.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>TS, you should find out more before you committed this kind of relationship.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Usually once she earn enough, she will leave you.</p>
              <p>Not to pour cold wter on you, just to be careful on yourself.</p>

              <p><strong>Luv at 1st sight not safe. See below: Serial Molester.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Robert Joseph "Dolly" Dunn</strong> (ca. 1941 – 11 July 2009) was an <a title="Australia" href="/wiki/Australia"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Australian</span></a> convicted <a title="Child sexual abuse" href="/wiki/Child_sexual_abuse"><span style="color: #0645ad;">child molester</span></a>. He was a school teacher by profession, working for the <a title="Marist Brothers" href="/wiki/Marist_Brothers"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Marist Brothers</span></a>, a <a title="Catholic" href="/wiki/Catholic"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Catholic</span></a> religious order.</p>
              <p>He began a 20-year jail sentence in 2001 for 24 <a class="mw-redirect" title="Sexual offence" href="/wiki/Sexual_offence"><span style="color: #0645ad;">sexual offences</span></a> occurring between 1985 and 1995. In 1996, a <a title="Royal Commission" href="/wiki/Royal_Commission"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Royal Commission</span></a> chaired by Justice James Woods was shown home videos and photographs from Dunn's collection, which included many images of child sex abuse, usually featuring Dunn himself as the perpetrator. Dunn fled the country, but was later found in <a title="Honduras" href="/wiki/Honduras"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Honduras</span></a> after being tracked down by Australia's <em><a title="60 Minutes" href="/wiki/60_Minutes"><span style="color: #0645ad;">60 Minutes</span></a></em> program. Then-<a class="mw-redirect" title="US Secretary of State" href="/wiki/US_Secretary_of_State"><span style="color: #0645ad;">US Secretary of State</span></a> <a title="Madeleine Albright" href="/wiki/Madeleine_Albright"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Madeleine Albright</span></a> authorised his <a title="Extradition" href="/wiki/Extradition"><span style="color: #0645ad;">extradition</span></a> back to Australia after he was deported from Honduras to the <a title="United States" href="/wiki/United_States"><span style="color: #0645ad;">United States</span></a>.<sup id="cite_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-0"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></span></a></sup></p>
              <p>Dunn had a long history of abusing boys between the ages of seven and 15, often videotaping them. Usually, he would offer them money and <a class="mw-redirect" title="Marijuana" href="/wiki/Marijuana"><span style="color: #0645ad;">marijuana</span></a> in exchange for <a title="Anal sex" href="/wiki/Anal_sex"><span style="color: #0645ad;">anal sex</span></a>. From jail, he repeatedly made written and verbal statements to the effect that he saw nothing wrong with sex between a man and a boy. He previously spent time in <a title="Indonesia" href="/wiki/Indonesia"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Indonesia</span></a> and the <a title="Netherlands" href="/wiki/Netherlands"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Netherlands</span></a>. He was a friend and accomplice of Australian diplomat <a title="William Stuart Brown" href="/wiki/William_Stuart_Brown"><span style="color: #0645ad;">William Stuart Brown</span></a>, another convicted child molester.<sup id="cite_ref-MSHJan04_1-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-MSHJan04-1"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></span></a></sup></p>
              <p>In 2004, Dunn underwent <a class="mw-redirect" title="Coronary bypass surgery" href="/wiki/Coronary_bypass_surgery"><span style="color: #0645ad;">coronary bypass surgery</span></a> after suffering from <a title="Angina pectoris" href="/wiki/Angina_pectoris"><span style="color: #0645ad;">angina</span></a>. Believed to be at high risk of retaliation from other prisoners, he was isolated from the main prison population.</p>
              <p>Dunn died on July 11, 2009, aged 68,<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></span></a></sup> from multiple organ failure. He would not have been eligible for parole until November 9, 2015.</p>
