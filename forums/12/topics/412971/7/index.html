              <p>Marriage is nothing but a legal process, you can chose not to marry but still can remain together, legal process meaning you are registrated, able to apply for house and you need a divorce proceeding to separate. It does not mean you are total in love...what sharing life together or i take care of you for the rest of my life become null when both decided to separate. There is nothing to do with soul, just a process of legal rights.</p>
              <p>In a free world, life takes whatever you choose, by just remembering to take the consquences of whatever you choose, be it Slut or gay or pros, nobody is going to give a damn about it.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">I visited her at her hometown near Ipoh during the CNY period. Was there for 4 days. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">She lives in a modest single storey house with her parents and her 11 year-old daughter. Her father is suffering from late stage of dementia and doesn’t know how to take care of himself anymore. Her aging and frail mother takes care of her father and her daughter. Her daughter is very smart according to her mother but very naughty and is a bit out of control.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Her parents and daughter don’t know about her real job in Singapore. They thought she do office works. She is the only bread winner of the family as both her parents can’t work anymore and have no other income. Her father used to be a gambler and gambled away all his money and much of his other properties, including their house. He still owed the loan sharks tens of thousands till now. The house they are staying now belongs to her brother who had passed away 2 years ago in a traffic accident. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Now I could see for myself that she doesn’t live in luxury. Most of her income is used to support her parents and daughter, pay for the outstanding house loan and pay for his father’s debt. She told me that due to her low qualification (she didn’t finish her secondary school), she can’t earn what she is earning now elsewhere. So she has to continue to work for the time being. She also knows that my salary alone of just $3000 is not enough to support both of us and her family. She has not much choice.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">She also admitted that my friends still book her for sex once a week and they paid well. She charges between $150 to $250 for sex <span> </span>each session. She has paid sex with 8-9 men each week. Some are regular customers, some not.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">She said she just want to be honest with me by telling me all that and said that it’s up to me whether I can accept her or not. I told her it hurts knowing all those things but I was willing to give our relationship a try….</span></p>

              <p>at the end of the day its just you and her walking through this path together. you met her, fell for her and if your gut and your heart is convinced, and you're sure you can accept her for who she is, accept that she isn't going to quit any time soon cos she needs to make ends meet on her side, and that she genuinely loves you too, then go for it. no need to care what everyone else thinks, esp your family. </p>
              <p>why did you use the word "hurts" though, it hurts knowing all those things? is it because deep down you wish she'd stop doing this? and when it comes down to it, what do you love about her(take away all the physical aspects)?  </p>

              <div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Pritzzi07:</div>
              <div class="quote_body">
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">I visited her at her hometown near Ipoh
                  during the CNY period. Was there for 4 days.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">She lives in a modest single storey house
                  with her parents and her 11 year-old daughter. Her father is
                  suffering from late stage of dementia and doesn’t know how to take
                  care of himself anymore. Her aging and frail mother takes care of
                  her father and her daughter. Her daughter is very smart according
                  to her mother but very naughty and is a bit out of
                  control.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Her parents and daughter don’t know about
                  her real job in Singapore. They thought she do office works. She is
                  the only bread winner of the family as both her parents can’t work
                  anymore and have no other income. Her father used to be a gambler
                  and gambled away all his money and much of his other properties,
                  including their house. He still owed the loan sharks tens of
                  thousands till now. The house they are staying now belongs to her
                  brother who had passed away 2 years ago in a traffic
                  accident.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Now I could see for myself that she doesn’t
                  live in luxury. Most of her income is used to support her parents
                  and daughter, pay for the outstanding house loan and pay for his
                  father’s debt. She told me that due to her low qualification (she
                  didn’t finish her secondary school), she can’t earn what she is
                  earning now elsewhere. So she has to continue to work for the time
                  being. She also knows that my salary alone of just $3000 is not
                  enough to support both of us and her family. She has not much
                  choice.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">She also admitted that my friends still
                  book her for sex once a week and they paid well. She charges
                  between $150 to $250 for sex <span> </span>each
                  session. She has paid sex with 8-9 men each week. Some are regular
                  customers, some not.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">She said she just want to be honest with me
                  by telling me all that and said that it’s up to me whether I can
                  accept her or not. I told her it hurts knowing all those things but
                  I was willing to give our relationship a try….</span></p>

              <p>Ouch....brother....I can feel your pain and your dilemma.....</p>
              <p>I have an opinion....</p>
              <p>My opinion is basically like this......</p>
              <p>I think you can know and can imagine the kind of difficulties that you will have if you have a relationship with this woman, now my question to you is....why ?</p>
              <p>In my humble opinion, one should not try to "help" the other person in a relationship. A relationship should be healthy, wholesome, constructive, positive.</p>
              <p>Now if you enter this relationship, and you want to do "good" , you want to do "love conquers all", then you will carry a burden. You are shouldering something. You are carrying something, some complication.</p>
              <p>I think you will be unhappy and you will get burnt out, consciously or subconsciously.</p>
              <p>So my question to you is.....have you thought about this properly ?</p>
              <p>If you just wanna follow your heart and "love conquers all" , I think you are behaving like some 17-year old teenager who doesnt understand the world yet. You can use your heart but also must use your head.</p>
              <p>Conclusion = break up.</p>
              <p>Btw no more prostitutes because this is all related. If you wanna find a real, true relationship, then you must start to focus on your "real world" and not the "underworld" of the prostitution. Stop going to prostitutes and clean up your act.</p>
