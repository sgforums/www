Its not about what had we done - its about the process and why just do it. We do because we love and not because we expect anything in return. What will return to us will eventually come back. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You mentioned nothing about the reason why the relationship died and got so heated up over failed relationship. Seriously, I begin to wonder if they had made the correct choice. If I was your girl, well, the competitor would have an easy task to win me away from you because the last thing a girl would ever want to see in a man is to see him degenerate. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><strong>WHAT HAS HAPPENED AND NOT LEARN WILL REPEAT ITSELF</strong>.<br><br>What has went wrong?<br><br>Nothing to do with God.<br><br>Nothing to do with Army.<br><br>Its between you two.<br><br>And sure its all about her?

He is not really searching for a girfriend, as par say, but rather he is searching for acceptance and attention to be filled in his life.<br><br>Well, I can't say much to him, but I think he already knows what he has to do, just that he is unable to overcome his self-pity and pride to do it, to finally admit that he is nothing, can do nothing, and needs help.<br><br>Sitting on the floor and bawling like a baby kicking your arms and legs and beating your chests don't help you much buddy.

I am sorry, i was pissed off, you probably are now, but believe me it feels better when u cool down. So u should at least cool down before you think about killing yourself ok? Just some advice from me.<br><br>You should cool down and think about what u have and stuff, before you kill yourself. Unless ofcourse you've already done it... so that's why u so quiet.<br><br>Holy FUCK i have caused the death of someone... shit!</div>
