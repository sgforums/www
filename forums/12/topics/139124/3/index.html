            <div class='col-md body'>Being too sticky to your gf is indeed disastrous. When my ex betrayed me for another guy, I couldnt take it, seriously so suffering to accept the fact that she dump me for another guy. I am lucky cos there are a couple of friends standing by my side encouraging me to move on. Virtually lost contact or drifted apart from most of my friends when I am with her.<br><br>I believe in karma too. The one who betray you may be enjoying with her new bf right now but how long can it last when approaching a turning point?<br><br>I learnt from my mistakes too. Balance yourself alittle between loving your gf as well as loving your friends.<br>Just tell yourself, time will, shall and must heal.

It's Not that I don't feel for you, but let me share with you an experience.<br><br>I've cheated on someone before (Not gonna go into details, but suffice to say, I've felt bad eversince, &amp; it's Not something I'm proud of...  Perhaps I had No idea then...).  That person, I would say, loved me so much, he forgave me.<br><br>1 of his friends asked him this question: Are you sure she's worth it?  You're gonna have your heart broken again if she cheats on you again, you know?<br><br>His reply?  If she does it again, then I probably won't be able to forgive her, but right now, I still think she's worth it.<br><br>If you really want her back, you want to forgive her &amp; give her another chance, then perhaps you may Not want to already convince yourself that she isn't worth it?<br><br>FeowFeow<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by arrggh:</div><div class="quote_body">and I broke off with her immediately. All these while, she was making out with another guy behind my back. I love her so much and gave my all to her. I miss her now and really want to have her back. I can forgive her for what she had done although I know that she's not worth it. But i really love her.. gave all my best to her. For the past few days, I'd been crying and wailing.. and if not for my friends who held me back, I would have ran towards an on-coming car. I am so used to having her around me and it seems so weird suddenly these days. We haven't been contacting each other and I'm really struggling to resist calling her. I am really scared of getting involved in another relationship... i know that i need to move on with life but I find it so hard to without having her around me... I'm regretting to have broke off with her and I really want her back.. I can forgive and forget all that she had done if she repents and promises not to do it again.. I really love her.. I have committed too much into this relationship and I'm really finding it hard to let it go suddenly....</div></blockquote></div>
