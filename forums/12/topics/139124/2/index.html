All these while, she was making out with another guy behind my back. I love her so much and gave my all to her. I miss her now and really want to have her back. I can forgive her for what she had done although I know that she's not worth it. But i really love her.. gave all my best to her. For the past few days, I'd been crying and wailing.. and if not for my friends who held me back, I would have ran towards an on-coming car. I am so used to having her around me and it seems so weird suddenly these days. We haven't been contacting each other and I'm really struggling to resist calling her. I am really scared of getting involved in another relationship... i know that i need to move on with life but I find it so hard to without having her around me... I'm regretting to have broke off with her and I really want her back.. I can forgive and forget all that she had done if she repents and promises not to do it again.. I really love her.. I have committed too much into this relationship and I'm really finding it hard to let it go suddenly....</div></blockquote>Move on...You are a guys...How can you accept having a gf, or future wife who cheat on you? Never accept that....If she is single, and sleep ard...that a different story...but she is ur partner....and sleep ard...who noes whether the other guy has any illness?? or aids?? or anything....i will never accept that....even if u can tolerate....how far can u control urself...i can't imagine this at all...u deserve someone better.....move on pal...</div>
