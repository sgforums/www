Going on with your life, dont spoil urself drinking, hurt urself etc... if she finds out.. its not that she will be back to u... the truth is that she will ignore u no matter how hard u try or maybe she glad that she's not with u because u dont respect ur ownself...<br>sometimes it's not fair since u have done everything and at the end received nothing. However the fact is SHE'S NOT WORTH of  your Effort and Time. Once she cheats.. and even if (maybe) she's getting back to u... she will always cheat again and again. Imagine if u just find out next time and its too late... that u find out after u marry her after she suck ur money dry...</div>

She's "dead", your (ex)gf is no longer the same gal. be sad cry, wail... mourn the loss. but never go back (UNLESS you can be 99.9999% sure she'll change, and stay faithfull if not we are just going  back to square one).<br><br>Let's put it this way. even if you went back to her and she promises not to cheat, can you be sure of that, will you find yourself looking back over your shoulder... wondering if she's where she say she is and with whom she said she's with? for me. no I can't accept that. I'll let go. it's the only chance for me to have a life without looking over my shoulders and checking if my parthner is faithful.</div>

And you should be grateful that you have discover the truth earlier. She's definitely not worth crying for. She will get her retribution sooner or later. Just get over it and move on, pal.

As what others from this forum had advise me, can you imagine if both of you are married and she do this to you? No offence.

Even if you accept her back, this incident will still haunt me.<br><br>As for my ex, if she ever come back, I will definitely not accept her cos I will never accept such girl inflicting pain on me and leave me alone for several months alone.<br><br>6 months down the road or even 1 year down the road when you have cooled down, you will know why things happens in such way.
