            <div class='col-md body'>My hk gf cheated on me... with one of my frens wen I was 17. I guess its my fault for not being able to spend as much time as I like due to overprotective parents (not much freedom).<br><br>And when I attended uni, she n her new bf had the nerve to come to my house to visit my fren (one of my fren moved in to my house).<br><br>Haih... its hard...especially when your 100% committed in the rs.<br>But I know u are able to get thru it. I guess I was mentally strong to take it in one stride..she just txt me saying she never want to see me again...right in the beginning of the exam period.<br><br>Anyway, in uni, I had a jap gf..i put 100% my all.. my philosophy was "love like u never been hurt"... stayed faithful despite many temptations... I was kinda like a social butterfly but I toned down...cos my gf at that time gets jealous easily even when a girl just smiled to me.<br><br>But then on last sunday...we broke up for good. 3 years of rs.. Just now i was driving back home..I kept thinking what could have gone wrong..and absent mindedly I hit my car on a concrete block at a roundabout  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>I guess its best to seek first to understand. Because I gave my all in a relationship, but it failed in the end. Somewhere along the way, something went terribly wrong and a relationship just failed like that when initially it was sweet as candy.<br><br>anyway, u just need time but dont forget 3 things.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Love like u never been hurt<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> dont revenge/take out ur feelings on the next gf u have<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> seek first to understand, change must come from within</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, havent been responding to threads here for quite some time, but happen to be interested in this topic hence decided to give my two cents worth.<br><br>firstly, i have to say that i am relatively lucky coz i havent experienced any two-timing happening on me, yet. but, i have almost, on the brim of two-timing my gf, when she pulled me back, and lead me back the right path.<br><br>i wouldnt go into details on how it happened, but i am happy and lucky tat she pulled me back at the right time, because i came to realised that she's the one i love, and would certainly wish to spend the remaining of my life with.<br><br>therefore, two-timing should not only be the fault of one party, when both parties love each other. imagine this, if you are so in love with someone, and he/she reciprocates with the same affection, then, i don't think that he/she wold be able to fallin love with another person, consecutively.<br><br>on the other hand, if he/she is able to love another person so quickly and easily, then, it must be that you're not important in her heart. and if tats the case, then i see no point to retaining this relationship.<br><br>good luck to those in love. love one another.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My ex contact with me recently. She told me tat she is happy with life and be it whether I can or cant take it, I was betrayed and being dumped and I cant do anything but to take it. I did not contact her for past week. I will never forget such past but I have a future to look for.<br><br>She is right but she will nvr know how much I suffered cos she is enjoying herself.She will nvr care how much I hav to endure. To all the people being betrayed, really hav to move on with your life. Time will nvr wait for you.</div>
