            <div class='col-md body'>Hi guys/gals...my first post..<br><br>Here's a scenario.. ..<br><br>"My girl was clubbing with her own friends and she complained she dropped something at the club and lost her belongings...<br><br>Being worried i came down to look for her, and saw her and a guy (whom she introduced to me only a couple of days ago) boarding a taxi... I decided to follow her as she was nearly brought to some guy's home by one of those so-called friends...<br><br>The tailing ended up at the guy's place inevitably.<br><br>She went up with him in the lift with him. Then she Sms-ed me that she loved me...<br><br>I called back immediately to ask her to come down. But she had switched off her phone on purpose. I then decided to look for her at that particular floor..<br><br>Having found her, I pressed on the bell till the guy answered the door. I asked for her and she came to the door but REFUSED to go back with me. She SAID she's not gonna do anything just that she doesn't want to go back home.<br><br>I left only after she threatened to leave me forever.<br><br>I came back in 6 hours time and asked her to leave with me. And she didn't either.<br><br>Should i believe that they didnt do anything?<br><br>Or i was just dumb?"<br><br>I was once told, if you truly love somebody you'd accept anything, even when you're on the losing end. Even when the odds seem impossible.<br><br>Tell me wat's the story guys and girls...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Bro, I've seen girls cheating behind their bfs' backs b4 and vice versa. Being cheated is universal. What matters most is that we take things within our stride and move on with life. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  If that girl is no longer worth what it takes to love her, then just forget it! There are so many better ones out there to let you pick. My advice is that true love withstand all trials. If you really think that girl is 'the one', then I guess you should've trusted her more. Doubting her will lead to MORE quarrels, break-ups and patch-backs. Is that what you want?<br>Then again, open your eyes and look around carefully for your perfect bride might be someone close to you. But don't rush into one so soon. Allow yourself to recover before deciding on a new one.<br>From my pov, that girl is no better than a slut(sorry to say). In my opinion, I club, party but I don't want a girl who does the same. Insecurity is pointless. Go find one whom is 10X better than you.<br>Don't give everything to any girl, thinking she's the one. Self-control is better than prevention.<br><br>Just my 0.01c worth</div>

Don't worry, one day when she is done playing (and doesn't want to play anymore) OR when she has been done playing with (and no one wants to play with her anymore), let her know that you still think she is wonderful and she'd probably come back to play with you (and hopefully not play you out) again.<br><br>You also wouldn't hold it against her if she's like given you 500 kids and none of them carried your DNA, right?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey peeps,<br>realli sorri after readin wat happened between relationships. Niwae, mine happened abt 4 yrs ago. I lost my relationship to another guy, n e worst ting is we borke off 1 wk b4 i enter NS. My officer ask me hw m i copin so well e first dae i went in, n i replied "wat can i do, unless u wan 2 write a report rgdin ur recruit jump 2 death due 2 relationship probs." Niwae, frm my pt of view, no matter hw much u love a gal, 1nce seperate, jus let it go. Instead, let it b sumtin 2 spur u on in ur career or other stuff. No pt ponderin over it. When we broke off initially, i told her n swear upon ma life i wun b callin, smsin, or get ani contacts wif her ever again, unless over my dead body. N im proud of it, cause till nw, i havent contact her. I promise myself tat im gg 2 b damm successful in my career n make her regert her decision. HA... 1 yr after my ex broke off wif me, her mum's frien call n c if im attach, n i said im nt. Then last yr, her mum calls me, n ask me hw im doin, at tat time, my career is at peak, even  till nw. N she ask me if im attach, n says tat my ex's friens saw me clubbin wif gals n veri close to them. Till nw, my ex's mum n brother r still callin her 2 cum bk 2 my side, but im nt interested. Im enjoyin singlehood nw, no worries, no commitment. Wat im tryin 2 say is move on, dudes. Use all these negative tings 2 spur u on in life. If e gal wans u bk, she will try all means 2 ask her friens ard abt u. S o dun worry. N REMEMBER, RELATIONSHIP IS NT A GAMBLE, NEITHER ITS A INVESTMENT, CAUSE WHEN U R IN 1, IT A WIN WIN SITUATION. U DUN SAY IT AN INVESTMENT OR GAMBLE WHEN U R HAVIN SEX WIF HER, CAUSE U R WILLIN 2 GIVE ALL OUT URSELF, NOBODI'S FORCIN U.<br>gODSENT, out!</div>
