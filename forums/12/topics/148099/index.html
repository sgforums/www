            <div class='col-md body'>One day you were as usual, chatting with your closest of friends in regards to things happening to your life.. After the chat, your VERY CLOSE friend actually utter some of the things regarding secrets of your bf / gf and words actually spread around... Your bf / gf learns about it and is very upset about the whole thing...<br><br>But since this is your closest of friends and he / she is actually very regretful for the spreading of things, you've decided to forgive him / her....<br><br>HOWEVER, your bf / gf whose secrets were let loose simply cannot opt for the 'forgive &amp; forget'.... And he / she is simply disgusted with the fact that you have 'ignore his / her feelings' and stay with this friend of yours...<br><br>In the series of such a event, what would you do?<br><br>Suggestions anyone?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Like to declare first that the below are only suggestions not instructions and the person can chose to follow or not to to follow these suggestions.<br><br>Suggestions 1<br><br>Use a high level method call counter spreading. It works by spreading things or words to counter the secret told by the close friend. Friends wlll be confuse by the fact as who is telling the truth and once people are confuse they will not dare to say too much. Often use by rival comapanies when their company's secrets are exposed by others. Only to be use by people who have good PR skills and have a very high trust level.<br><br>Suggestions 2<br><br>Ask the friend to say to the public that the secret is false and say she or he is sorry to have hurt your bf or gf.<br><br>Suggestions 3<br><br>Cool down period of 1 week and slowly say that you are sorry for what had happen and wish to make up for what your friend had done.</div>
