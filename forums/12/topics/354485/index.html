              <p>Hi everyone, much needed advice here.</p>
              <p>Im a female, turning 21 this year and have recently thought of living alone with a colleague when she expressed interest in buying a house together and co-owning it.</p>
              <p>My family is religious and very strict, especially my dad. He controls just about everything in my life; my job, my friends, the way i dress and even the tv shows i watch and frankly im getting sick of it. I have numerous times tried to sit down and talk to my parents about my unhappiness, but they are conservative and think that only their opinion matters and i should just follow whatever they decide for me.</p>
              <p>Instance 1: My first perm job was as a manager at a convenience store and i really liked it there. There are times where i have to work after hours as i hate to leave my work unfinished or the store unruly, and when my staff are having problems, they would call me at home and i would give them advice over the phone. My parents think i place my staff above family and whenever im working late, they would repeatedly call and shout for me to come home thus disrupting my work flow. I do not agree since whenever i have my off days, i do stay at home and spend time with them like eating out together, shopping with my little sisters and taking off for BBQs and holiday trips etc.</p>
              <p>In the end i quit the job because my father said im neglecting my religion and the family and that im doing too much for the company. He disapproved of my previous job at Sentosa and made me quit also when i came home at 11pm one day after eating out with my colleagues courtesy of the manager because we achieved our target sales.</p>
              <p>Instance 2: I have a bf, and right from the beginning my father told me i cant hold hands with him. Above all, i seldom even watch tv but just recently whenever i do find the time to sit down and watch my fav shows, he would come and tell me to switch the channel and watch a religious forum with him. There was one time he forced me to sit with him while the forum talks about MARRIED WOMEN BEING ABUSED, just because i have a bf.</p>
              <p>Also, my father does not allow any of his daughters to overnight at a chalet, even though we're already 21years old and even if its an all-girls chalet because he has a negative outlook of the world and thinks overnight-ing is not our religion's 'way of life'.</p>
              <p>These are just some instances from the many other things i do not see eye-to-eye with him. And when i expressed the desire to live alone and to finally be independant and make my own decisions now, he told me that if i leave, i can forget about coming back home. He won't look for me and he would regard me no longer part of the family.</p>
              <p>Of course, financially and mentally i am ready to live alone, but thinking about the future, i am a bit hesitant. I would need my father to give me away when i get married in the future and what if after living alone for a few months i realise its not something i want to do in a long run; i do not have the luxury of returning home and reconciling with my family.</p>
              <p>Help me pleaseee, ur comments are much appreciated!</p>
              <p>Thank you.</p>

              <p>You might need to have a heart-to-heart talk with your parents.</p>
              <p>In their view, it may seem that they are doing these things for your own good.</p>
              <p>But if views differ, you should tell them how you feel.</p>

              <p>Your father seems to be over strict with you and i understand why you would feel like moving out. Have you ever tried having a proper talk with him?</p>
              <p>Hes trying to protect his children but maybe not in best possible way.</p>
              <p>Somehow i feel that telling him you want to move out might lead to really serious arguments and affect the family relationship.</p>

              <p>Hmmm... You should tell them that this is your own life and you only got to live on this Earth once (and hence link to the point that you should make your own decisions).. Tell them that your generation and their generation very different... I strongly feel that you shouldn't let your parents (especially your dad) to affect you in a very bad way... </p>
              <p>And also, in what way they said that you are negliecting your religion?</p>
              <p>By right at the age of 21, you should have a lot of freedom already.... So..... </p>

              some shrinks may tell you they actually have closet incest urges .....
              like that josef fritzl fellow in austria ... being protective of daughters is one thing ... going overboard, is an indication of some serious issues.</p>
              <p>and a more
              telling thing would be that he seeks an escape in religion ... one
              should always be suspicious of people who go overboard in religion, any
              religion .... they tend to be twisted one way or the other .... either
              blowing themselves and 50 others up with them ... or they go after
              little boys and their dotters and the like ... so they turn to religion in a bid to punish themselves or seek an absolution ... when, really, they should really go see a shrink ... instead of a priest who'd tell them that they are sinning .....</p>

              <p>to Q.C. Pak : Have already sat down with my parents and tried to voice my unhappiness countless of time, but we always end up arguing and in the end ill give up and keep quiet and let him lecture me. And then we ll stop talking for a few days and eventually start talking again.</p>

              <p>to gigabyte: exactly! somehow i think living alone is something everyone has to try out at least once in a her/his lifetime...if only i can make my parents see that.</p>

              <p>to dkcx: my mum has learnt over time not to argue with my dad because its pointless, he will never agree to something he feels strongly about so she agrees to his every opinion...without my dad, my mum is more lenient really....just that my dad is a driving factor backing up the family..</p>

              <p>to Q.C. Pak : Have already sat down with my parents and tried to
              voice my unhappiness countless of time, but we always end up
              arguing and in the end ill give up and keep quiet and let him
              lecture me. And then we ll stop talking for a few days and
              eventually start talking again.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>to gigabyte: exactly! somehow i think living alone is something
              everyone has to try out at least once in a her/his lifetime...if
              only i can make my parents see that.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>to dkcx: my mum has learnt over time not to argue with my dad
              because its pointless, he will never agree to something he feels
              strongly about so she agrees to his every
              opinion...without my dad, my mum is more lenient really....just
              that my dad is a driving factor backing up the family..</p>

              <p>Hi everyone, much needed advice here.</p>
              <p>Im a female, turning 21 this year and have recently thought of living alone with a colleague when she expressed interest in buying a house together and co-owning it.</p>
              <p>My family is religious and very strict, especially my dad. He controls just about everything in my life; my job, my friends, the way i dress and even the tv shows i watch and frankly im getting sick of it. I have numerous times tried to sit down and talk to my parents about my unhappiness, but they are conservative and think that only their opinion matters and i should just follow whatever they decide for me.</p>
              <p>Instance 1: My first perm job was as a manager at a convenience store and i really liked it there. There are times where i have to work after hours as i hate to leave my work unfinished or the store unruly, and when my staff are having problems, they would call me at home and i would give them advice over the phone. My parents think i place my staff above family and whenever im working late, they would repeatedly call and shout for me to come home thus disrupting my work flow. I do not agree since whenever i have my off days, i do stay at home and spend time with them like eating out together, shopping with my little sisters and taking off for BBQs and holiday trips etc.</p>
              <p>In the end i quit the job because my father said im neglecting my religion and the family and that im doing too much for the company. He disapproved of my previous job at Sentosa and made me quit also when i came home at 11pm one day after eating out with my colleagues courtesy of the manager because we achieved our target sales.</p>
              <p>Instance 2: I have a bf, and right from the beginning my father told me i cant hold hands with him. Above all, i seldom even watch tv but just recently whenever i do find the time to sit down and watch my fav shows, he would come and tell me to switch the channel and watch a religious forum with him. There was one time he forced me to sit with him while the forum talks about MARRIED WOMEN BEING ABUSED, just because i have a bf.</p>
              <p>Also, my father does not allow any of his daughters to overnight at a chalet, even though we're already 21years old and even if its an all-girls chalet because he has a negative outlook of the world and thinks overnight-ing is not our religion's 'way of life'.</p>
              <p>These are just some instances from the many other things i do not see eye-to-eye with him. And when i expressed the desire to live alone and to finally be independant and make my own decisions now, he told me that if i leave, i can forget about coming back home. He won't look for me and he would regard me no longer part of the family.</p>
              <p>Of course, financially and mentally i am ready to live alone, but thinking about the future, i am a bit hesitant. I would need my father to give me away when i get married in the future and what if after living alone for a few months i realise its not something i want to do in a long run; i do not have the luxury of returning home and reconciling with my family.</p>
              <p>Help me pleaseee, ur comments are much appreciated!</p>
              <p>Thank you.</p>

              ur dad says u are placing ur job above family, but I think he is placing religion over you!
              it sounds like ur dad has his insecurities and he needs to place more trust in you and not treat u like a kid (well, u r a kid no matter how old u r in ur parents' eyes).
              
              (Tell them whos boss)
              First thing, u need to prove to him that u have already grown up and that u can be trusted
              But,
              Dont ever breach a person's trust cos its difficult to get it back.
              
              Secondly, try to interact  ur family wif ur bf more often. I'm sure they will accept him if they find him he is a guy that can be trusted with and reliable. Any father in the world would not want his daughter to be placed in a wrong person's hands.
              
              This is a matter of trust issue. Ur father is conservative, but I think that he treats u this way because u r a gal.

              <p>The dad is driven by FEAR.</p>
              <p>He fears for his reputation as a religious person.</p>
              <p>He fears his manhood position in the family is being eroding.</p>
              <p>He fears for his standing in the eyes of his community.</p>
              <p>He fears for the honour of his family.</p>
              <p>His authoritarian stance is just a facade for his FEARS.</p>
              <p>He lacks LOVE, to him the most important word is " I ".</p>

              <p>Seems like alot of people here are extremely unhappy with their parents.</p>
              <p>Even though you don't like your parents, that doesn't means it is right to advise other people to follow you.</p>
              <p>If we are unable to understand our parents and realised their intentions behind their strict restrictions upon us, then we have failed in our duty as their children and we are not good children either.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Everybody here will be a parent one of these days, if you are unable to fully comprehend your parents, then you will only end up becoming a bad parent in your own future.</p>
              <p>It's not easy to be a parent and let alone becoming a good one in the future.</p>
              <p>If it's really that easy to be a good parent, then every Ah Kao Ah Mao also can be a good parent and nobody will ever have family problems in the future.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So please give the right advice even though you do not like it. But if you're uncomfortable doing so, then you can refrain from swaying another child to join you. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>well, I'm telling you guys ... the dad reminds me of josef fritzl .....</p>
              <p>the symptoms are the same .... that austrian nutcase was a control freak over his daughter too .... and after his daughter started going out with another boy .......</p>
              <p>some people are punishing themselves and hiding behind the cloak of religion, when they could have probably gotten better with the help of a good shrink ....</p>
