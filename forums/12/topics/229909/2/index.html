Once I had a major quarrel with her and it ended up that we weren't talking after that around my prelims period.<br><br>After O's, I decided to apologise and hopefully we can get back together again. We started minor minor chats, but I know things will never be the same. She just don't seem to forgive me. During prom night, I plucked up my courage and asked for a photo with her. She agreed.<br><br>Now all of a sudden, she just dont wanna talk to me anymore. Countless sms, calls and msg on MSN, she just dont wanna give any reply. Her female friend did talk to her though.<br><br>So WTH are these kind of girls thinking? I've been begging like f*ck for that photo  I took with her during prom night because the photo was taken with her camera. Why could she forget all the wonderful times we had together so easily? She once told me she treasured me a lot.  Those memories really kept me emotional all these while. <strong>Those memories, I promise you, are as good as though we're really together as steads</strong>. So WTH is she thinking?</blockquote>That, my friend, could be your source of problem. You look back at all the wonderful memories, and feel that it was as if u 2 were togther. She may not look at it this way. True, u guys could be the best of buds, but remember, a girl is different from a guy. They are much more sensitive. Whatever your quarrel is may seem trivial to u, but it has changed her opinion of you. I don't know who started the quarrel, but its a good guess that you probably made it a lot worst than needed.<br><br>Give her time, and give urself time. I say this because she is still probably angry over the quarrel, and she has now seen u in a different light. You need 2 give urself time because u need to realise that you two cannot return to the past. The friendship between u two now is not that of a best bud, but be prepared that it may now just be a normal "Hi-Bye" friend type.</div>
