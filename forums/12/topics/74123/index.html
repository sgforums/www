            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: olive;">this story was included in Yes933 Music Diary 1 CD.....<br>It was Veri Touching....Hope You all like it.........</span><br><br>A YEAR AGO today, I had lunch with my boyfriend and took the opportunity to complain to him.<br>"Today is Valentine's Day. Why didn't you give me any flowers?"<br>He raised his eyebrow.<br>"Why should I give you flowers? You are not my anyone."<br><br>"Then... you should at least give me a card!" I pouted my lips, hurt by his<br>tone.<br>"I know, I know. After lunch, I'll send you an e-card."<br>"E-card??"<br>That sounds so impersonal, but that's the way he is.<br>"You have to e-mail it to me. I'll be waiting." I excitedly smiled and ran<br>to sneak home after lunch to check e-mail. Even though he wouldn't use any<br>romantic words, I still looked forward to the card.<br><br>"I'm going back to work. Hurry and send me the card!"<br>As soon as I walked in my door, I turned on my computer and got online.<br>Staring at the empty inbox, I began to reminisce about how we met. Maybe no<br>one will believe me, but my boyfriend and I were actually neighbors. Our<br>homes were only 1 wall away. Ever since we were kids, we liked to fight with<br>each other all day long. We were only neighbors. At that time, I hated my<br>parents for making us live next to him.<br><br>At that time, I had a crush on a senior. After a while, I found out that the<br>senior student had lots of girlfriends. When I cried about it, he silently<br>passed me a handkerchief and awkwardly held me in his arms.<br><br>"I told you he wasn't any good." He roughly comforted me.<br>I cried in his arms the whole night, and began to see him in a different<br>way. Things began to change between us. We still fought all the time, but he<br>started to look at me differently. And I blushed and my heart beat faster<br>when he was near.<br><br>We both knew: we fell in love with each other.<br><br>Even with this knowledge, neither of us said anything. Even though we would<br>not be able to resist and kissed each other constantly. Even though we cared<br>about each other's every moves. Both of us refused to admit our love.<br><br>Alright, we became lovers, but we still wouldn't say we loved each other. We<br>didn't even spend Valentine's Day together until he saw me share dinner with<br>a man one Valentine's Day. That night, he waited for me in front of my door<br>and said that he would take me out to dinner on Valentine's Day from then<br>on. I have to say that he was very arrogant. But I nodded and accepted his<br>request. Since then, we spent every Valentine's Day together. On the<br>surface, we may have left each other. But in reality, we were still<br>together. We spent every Valentine's Day together but each year became more<br>dreary than the next because he never told me he loved me even with all my<br>hints.<br><br>Still facing the empty inbox, I suddenly grew very angry. He wouldn't say it<br>and wouldn't send me a card. What did he mean? Who did he think I was? I<br>called his cell phone.<br><br>"Hello." He picked up the phone.<br><br>"I didn't receive the card." I immediately showed my displeasure.<br><br>"You didn't receive it?" He seemed really busy.<br>"But I sent it." He was really busy but I didn't care.<br><br>"I didn't receive it. Send it again."<br><br>"Okay, I'll send you 100 times. Is that good enough??" He said with<br>impatience. His tone further infuriated me. Is that how lovers speak to<br>each other?<br><br>"Don't bother sending it to me. And you don't have to pick me up tonight.<br>I'll eat dinner by myself."<br><br>"Don't be childish, ok? I'm really busy."<br><br>"I AM childish!" I hung up the phone and tears rolled down my cheeks.<br><br>Childish?? Why didn't he consider the situation? We've gone out for so many<br>years and spent countless Valentine's Day together. I never received any<br>flowers nor cards from him. Now, I just want a little e-card. Is that too<br>much to ask for?? I unplugged the phone from the wall and turned off my cell<br>phone. I didn't want to hear his explanations.<br><br>After I returned to the hospital, I instructed the receptionist not to<br>forward me any phone calls. I wanted to concentrate on work. Because there<br>were so many emergencies today, I was sweating 1 hour later and forgot about<br>our argument.<br><br>"Dr. Shu, please take a look at that patient."<br>As I was collecting my equipment, the shrill sound of an ambulance sounded<br>outside the ER. When I stepped out the door, the emergency medics hurriedly<br>wheeled in a gurney.<br><br>"What happened to him?" I asked the 1st medic.<br>Everyone else were trying to help put the patient on the gurney. He was<br>covered with blood.<br><br>"Car accident." The medic replied.<br>"Very serious. He may die." I nodded and ran to the operating room with<br>them.<br>When I arrived, the nurses told me that the man had already stopped<br>breathing and also his heartbeat also stopped.<br><br>"Prepare for shock." I calmly instructed the nurses.<br>Saving people is our duty. We can't and shouldn't lose our calm.<br><br>But when I saw who laid on the operating table, I lost my calm. That person<br>was my BOYFRIEND!<br><br>"NO..." I stood in shock.<br><br>"NO!!!" I grabbed the paddles and continuously shocked his body.<br>His body bounced up and down from the shocks. The scared nurses went to find<br>another doctor, to tell him that I was crazy.<br><br>I didn't know if I was crazy or not. I just wanted to save my lover. Even<br>though we fought all the time. Even though he never showed me his love. I<br>still wanted to save him. He still owed me a card. He couldn't die! I threw<br>away the paddles and began to press on his heart. I pressed with all my<br>strength, hoping it would revive him, but he didn't wake up. He didn't even<br>say "It hurts". He just laid there with his eyes closed, punishing me with<br>his silence.<br><br>Dr. Jian angrily pushed me away. By that time, I couldn't see clearly<br>anymore. I cried. I wailed. I bowled until no sounds could come out of my<br>mouth.<br><br>"It's too late, Dr. Shu. He's already dead. I'm sorry." Dr. Jian patted me<br>on the shoulder.<br>They knew each other and ate together once. I introduced them.<br><br>"He can't die." I shook my head.<br>"He can't die!!" I struggled to run to him.<br>"Dr. SHU, control yourself!" Dr. Jian slapped me.<br>"I understand what you're going through, but you're a doctor."<br><br>"Yes, I'm a doctor, but I'm also a regular person. How can Dr. Jian<br>understand how I feel? I've loved him for so many years that it's become a<br>habit. How can I just throw away a habit? Besides, he still owed me a card.<br><br>"I want him to live! I want him to live!" I ran to him again and tried to<br>knock the life back into his body.<br><br>"Take her away!"<br>That day, I lost my control and my professionalism. And that day happened to<br>be Valentine's Day.<br><br>Afterwards, I asked his co-workers why he left work early that day. They<br>told me that after I hung up the phone, he tried to call me several times<br>but couldn't reach me. Worried, he drove to the hospital to find me and got<br>hit by a large truck on the way.<br><br>When I heard this, I froze. My tantrum killed him. Just because of an<br>unmailed card, he died. After that, I lost my privilege to be childish. Like<br>an abandoned cat, I couldn't even cry anymore.<br><br>After his death, I couldn't cry anymore, regardless of how touching the plot<br>or how tear-jerking the dialogue. They didn't affect me anymore.<br><br>I turned on computer after a year later, even though I know no one will send<br>me a mail, I still hoped that someone will remember me on this day.<br><br>GOSH....I have.... 100 emails! Who would be bored enough to send me 100<br>junk mail? I was just about to delete them all when I received another mail,<br>and this one said: "Because of system error, we could not send these until<br>today. We apologize for the delay."<br><br>The sender was my BOYFRIEND!!! I looked at the 1st mail. It showed the send<br>date is last year's Valentine's Day. My heart began to beat fast. Could he<br>have sent these? With a trembling hand, I opened the mail.<br><br>The first thing that popped up was a gorgeous red rose set against green<br>leaves. Then a beautiful melody began to play...."Only Love". I couldn't<br>believe it. The rose was so beautiful and the music was so dreamy.<br><br>I almost thought I was in a fantasy. Most touching of all were the words<br>underneath the rose, because the words read like a beautiful poem.<br><br>"Only love can make a memory. Only love can make a moment last.<br>You were there and all the world was young and all it's songs unsung.<br>And I remember you then when love was all, all you were living for,<br>and how you gave that love to me...."<br><br>The lyrics of this song fits our love so closely. When he was alive, my<br>world was so young. Every day, I could find a something different to fight<br>with him about. But after he left, my life is only left with memories and<br>coldness that will never go away. When I read these words, my tears<br>unconsciously came, wetting the keyboard. I replied 100 times, and "Only<br>Love" played 100 times.<br><br>In this cold Valentine's night, the line that's been broken for LAST ONE<br>YEAR finally got RECONNECTED.<br><br>--------------------<br></div>
