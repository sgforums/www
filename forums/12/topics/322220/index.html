              <p>My ex just broke up with me about 1 and a half week ago. Her reason was that love was fading and she don't feel love for me anymore. I asked her if there was a 3rd party and she reassured me that there is no one and i trust her about that.</p>
              <p>Then i asked if the problem was me or if there is any problems between us that i didnt notice. She said no, she just said that her love for me was fading and it wasn't fair for her to lead me on. Well, everything was so sudden, just days before the break up, i still surprised her with flowers and she also surprised me. We always led a very loving life together.</p>
              <p>I know that many will ask me to move on, but i have still a lot of feelings for her. And i have always seen her as a potential life partner. I don't wanna lose her, especially for unknown reasons or problems. I don't know if her lost of feelings are temporary. I wanna get back together with her because i still see a lot potential in this relationship.</p>
              <p>-------------------------------------</p>
              <p>After she broke up with me, i tried to ask her out and date her out. She went out with me for 2 times but after then she is very reluctant to. I know that the line is drawn and i have been treating her respectfully as a friend during these outings.</p>
              <p>I have raised the issue about getting back together, but she rejected me politely. When i asked her if it is still possible in the future for us to get back, she says "I really dont know :("</p>
              <p>Since then, she had been obviously avoiding me. More i try to contact her, the more she draws away from me. It has been very hurting but i have holding on to it. My friends are advising me to give her some time out first. Thats what i'm doing right now, i haven't been contacting her (neither did she contact me) for the past few days.</p>
              <p>According a common friend, she is living life normally, and been trying to engage in various activities.</p>

              <p>And i would like to ask...</p>
              <p>How do i get back together with her? I am feeling very helpless and lost because i don't know why that her love for me is fading (definately not a 3rd party) and don't know how i can get her back.</p>
              <p>When i try to talk to her on MSN, there always seem to be this wall that is between us. Keeping her from opening up to me, we chat like normal friends all of a sudden. And i really don't know how to initate a conversation and get her to respond and open up to me like before.</p>
              <p>How? I really want her back. Can anyone who are experienced advise me please? This issue have been affecting my life, i can't concentrate on anything right now. I feel so helpless.</p>

              <p>Since the love for you have faded , why you still want to be in a relationship with her. A relationship without love is hard to maintain.</p>
              <p>And now you treating her like a friend instead of girlfriend. How old are you by the way? Stop trying to asking her to open up. You are giving her pressure and scaring her by your action.</p>
              <p>Get away from the problem for a while and calm yourself down!</p>

              <p>I think she needs space for herself....why not...take this as an opportunity for both of you....to get back into doing other things other than what you've done in the relationship? She wanted to know if she made the right decision by living this "single" life too...and...i feel that you shouldn't pressurize her anymore...by trying to strike a convo with her so regularly. You should try doing other things too...</p>
              <p>Either way...you can like try contacting her after a while....like as a friend...that's ok...not trying to strike a convo with her everyday....or as and when you like....she just wants a break for a while...give her that =)</p>
              <p>Meanwhile...try not to keep thinking of getting her back...because that mentality and thought will just force you to do more things that are unecessary and might even jeopardize the friendship/relationship that both of you had...</p>
              <p>Cheers and i hope that you won't be so troubled over it...</p>

              <p>what heart to heart talk...better not lor, let it go smoothly, the gal is good enough to tell him that she do not wish to lead him on, she already is so truthful to him. Sometime when I broke up with a guy, it is for the good sake of him to find one more suitable to his characters and personality.</p>

              <p><br>Most of us, and especially sg guys are blind by love and relationship, they failed to once a while put themselve out of the box and look at it. To check back on how was he doing? Can he make it? what strategy should he use in order to better the love relationship? and finally, Is the gal really love me?. You must alway check back and ask yourself, otherwise, you may end up with one sided love or lovesick syndrome.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For us gals, we are more precaution about love, we do ask ourselves, is he good for me, can i trust him, how am i going to control him, is there really love in it??. Therefore, we are more prepare to check back.</p>
