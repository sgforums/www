              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>My ex just broke up with me about 1 and a half week
              ago. Her reason was that<strong> love was fading and she don't feel love
              for me anymore.</strong> I asked her if there was a 3rd party and she
              reassured me that there is no one and i trust her about that.</p>
              <p>Then i asked if the problem was me or if there is any problems
              between us that i didnt notice. She said no, she just said that her
              love for me was fading and it wasn't fair for her to lead me on.
              Well, everything was so sudden, just days before the break up, i
              still surprised her with flowers and she also surprised me. We
              always led a very loving life together.</p>
              <p>I know that many will ask me to move on, but i have still a lot
              of feelings for her. And i have always seen her as a potential life
              partner. I don't wanna lose her, especially for unknown reasons or
              problems. I don't know if her lost of feelings are temporary. I
              wanna get back together with her because i still see a lot
              potential in this relationship.</p>
              <p>-------------------------------------</p>
              <p>After she broke up with me, i tried to ask her out and date her
              out. She went out with me for 2 times but after then she is very
              reluctant to. I know that the line is drawn and i have been
              treating her respectfully as a friend during these outings.</p>
              <p>I have raised the issue about getting back together, but she
              rejected me politely. When i asked her if it is still possible in
              the future for us to get back, she says "I really dont know :("</p>
              <p>Since then, she had been obviously avoiding me. More i try to
              contact her, the more she draws away from me. It has been very
              hurting but i have holding on to it. My friends are advising me to
              give her some time out first. Thats what i'm doing right now, i
              haven't been contacting her (neither did she contact me) for the
              past few days.</p>
              <p>According a common friend, she is living life normally, and been
              trying to engage in various activities.</p>
