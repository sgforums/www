So please don't hold your breath waiting for her to change her mind.<br><br>Ask yourself this first.<br>Since she no longer love you. Will you still want someone who don't "really" love you , to be your girlfriend ???<br>Do you want to hold her back just for your sake ?<br><br>Typically when a relationship changes after a certain period, there is actually nothing wrong with the people involve. It's just that the needs of either one or both party has changed as time pass. So don't beat yourself up trying to figure out what went wrong.<br><br>Good luck to your next better partner.</div>

Very common in our X-generation.<br>Text messages is the typical way people of our times communicate difficult  emotional messages.<br><br>It seems she is over you. So please don't hold your breath waiting for her to change her mind.<br><br>Ask yourself this first.<br>Since she no longer love you. Will you still want someone who don't "really" love you , to be your girlfriend ???<br>Do you want to hold her back just for your sake ?<br><br>Typically when a relationship changes after a certain period, there is actually nothing wrong with the people involve. It's just that the needs of either one or both party has changed as time pass. So don't beat yourself up trying to figure out what went wrong.<br><br>Good luck to your next better partner.</div></blockquote>Hmm....</div>
