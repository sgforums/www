            <div class='col-md body'>Sigh.... politics... It happens everywhere. In the classroom, the workplace... you name it.<br><br>The best idea is to not get involved in them and go it alone. If those b*tches still want to badmouth you, go ahead and let them waste their energy and saliva doing that. I'm sure you have better things to do than to listen to them.<br><br>Reminds me a lot of when I was working at a hotel while on vacation. I was a bellhop, and most of the other bellhops (around my age) would badmouth me behind my back. Most of them are lowly-educated, and took the fact that I'm an undergraduate as an indication that I'm snobbish, rich, pampered, no street smarts, etc....<br><br>I found out about this from one of the nicer older bellhops. Now I know why they always seem to enjoy picking on me, criticising me, belittling me, etc...<br><br>Come on... if I ever did anything that resembles snobbishness, I don't know what it is. I did my best to remain humble and polite, I mixed around with them, treated them as I would treat anyone else, etc...<br><br>In the end all those politics were affecting my mood and I became depressed. After a few weeks I went up to my manager and told her that I was quitting - even though I still had four more weeks to school.<br><br>I'm out of work with nothing to do - but I'm much happier now.<br><br>However, it also struck me that by quitting, I may have played straight into the hands of those jerks.</div>

But now, things seem to be better lar, I ignore her, she ignore me.<br><br>Yah, like you, I thought poly is suppose to have mature students...but I must mention my dissapointment with the maturity standard of the school....from what I see, only the business school seems to have more matured students.</div>

In the classroom, the workplace... you name it.<br><br>The best idea is to not get involved in them and go it alone. If those b*tches still want to badmouth you, go ahead and let them waste their energy and saliva doing that. I'm sure you have better things to do than to listen to them.<br><br>Reminds me a lot of when I was working at a hotel while on vacation. I was a bellhop, and most of the other bellhops (around my age) would badmouth me behind my back. Most of them are lowly-educated, and took the fact that I'm an undergraduate as an indication that I'm snobbish, rich, pampered, no street smarts, etc....<br><br>I found out about this from one of the nicer older bellhops. Now I know why they always seem to enjoy picking on me, criticising me, belittling me, etc...<br><br>Come on... if I ever did anything that resembles snobbishness, I don't know what it is. I did my best to remain humble and polite, I mixed around with them, treated them as I would treat anyone else, etc...<br><br>In the end all those politics were affecting my mood and I became depressed. After a few weeks I went up to my manager and told her that I was quitting - even though I still had four more weeks to school.<br><br>I'm out of work with nothing to do - but I'm much happier now.<br><br>However, it also struck me that by quitting, I may have played straight into the hands of those jerks. </div></blockquote></div>
