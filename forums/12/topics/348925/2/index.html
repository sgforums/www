              <p>And now that she's come clean, forgive her, and let things blossom. For someone to confess takes a lot of courage, and for her to confess to you, shows her connection to you.</p>

              <p>bro, time to wake up. this is one of the tactic women always use. and i learnt it from them, and use it on many women sucessfully too.. she tell you all the problems she had and make you accept her. and once you accepted her, you lose the game. coz u already knew what kind of person she is, you can never use this as a reason to pick a fight with her even if you don't feel happy abt what she's doing.</p>
              <p>use your damn brain to think factual bro.</p>
              <p>or you need me to bring you to the 1000 girl ktv in china to make you feel what women really are.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>p/s: sorry those women i'm referring to are bbitches, there are really nice ones around as well.</p>

              <p><br>Well, she already explained the fear of losing you.</p>
              <p>Seriously, listen. The past is past; and it should only serve as a lesson, not a burden. She paid the price for her folly and she's repentant, you should not condemn her again. For the love of God, she came to you and made such a grave confession, in hope that you will find it in your heart to forgive her past and to accept her wholly.</p>
              <p>I can repeat this a hundred times, but end of day, it's still your decision if you want to let go of this burden and carry on with this relationship. Having seen love, being loved and love somebody - I'd say "Heck, to hell with the past. Everybody makes mistakes, people learn and grow from mistakes. Just take this one shot.</p>
              <p>End of day, if you lose, you lose small - because you know you've given it your best shot and you'll find it easier to walk away. The biggest regret always come from the things we've failed to do - trust me on that one, I've walked that path one too many a time.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>There’s no question that what you are going through is an incredibly upsetting and challenging experience. When something of this magnitude occurs, it is critical to take some time to breathe and to resist the urge to react impulsively. Healing the wound that infidelity causes requires long-term work. Whether you want to stay in your relationship is a decision that only you can make when you are hurt in this way. You and your partner must ultimately have a conversation in which you decide together whether you want to try to do the work and repair the relationship</p></div>

              <p><br>Why don't you sit her down and talk to her about your fears? Like how you're talking to me right now.</p>
              <p>That should be the way a relationship functions - lotsa discussions and don't just bottle up inside.</p>
