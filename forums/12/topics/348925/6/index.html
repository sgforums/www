              <div class="quote_body">
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Got this news from my gf and it
                  totally broke me down. I have not been sleeping from yesterday till
                  now thinking and thinking.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Have been together with my gf for
                  around 4 months and she has a bad past and she was really truthful
                  about it. Told me basically everything about her past and why she
                  divorced.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">To recap a little bit on her
                  background she was actually in a bad marriage with her ex husband
                  for 2 yrs plus due to her ex husband behaviour, basically ignoring
                  her and neglects her. And then she falls in love with an ex
                  colleague which sweet talks her and show her concerns. She also had
                  sex with that cheater colleague due to her love for him.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">But it turned out that the guy is
                  actually a cheat and she broke off with him. She also told me
                  another colleague also went after her and he was the relative of
                  the first cheater colleague because they are working in a family
                  owned business. She dun likes him initially but she tried and
                  eventually that guy shows her that he is very sincere and she also
                  falls in love with him. (she actually wanted to use this guy to
                  divert attention so that she can manage to forget that cheater
                  colleague)</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">But she told me that her last
                  sexual encounter was with that cheater colleague and she has no
                  intimate relationships with this guy initially when we started this
                  relationship. On and off we did discuss about all these stuff and
                  she says that she did not had and sex with this particular
                  guy.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Yesterday she told me that she does
                  not want to hide from me anymore and she did have sex with the
                  second guy (still let him shoot inside). I think she really got
                  poor thinking that nowadays HIV, STDs are so common.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">And she lied to me initially
                  because she do not want me to leave her thinking that she is a
                  loose women. (intimate relationships with 2 guys that are actually
                  relatives) She was thinking of telling me the truth but she knows
                  that she is taking a chance of whether I will accept or leave her.
                  But she knows that I will probably leave her after knowing the
                  truth. She was thinking of when to break out the news to me and was
                  planning to do it after valentine day because she really wanna
                  spend that day with her love one and she do not have a good
                  valentine day for many years liao. She actually says that she is
                  guilty of hiding the truth from me initially fearing of me leaving
                  her. But decided to come clean with it because she loves me and do
                  not wan to hide anything from me.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">After her telling me the truth, my
                  heart actually went scattered and I was in a complete loss because
                  I really put in my heart and soul into this relationship. She says
                  that it is ok if I wanna leave her because it was her fault and she
                  still loves me (she loves me and dun mind me leaving because she
                  wants me to be happy). She also told me that her feelings for me is
                  completely real and she did love me with all her heart. She did
                  asked me whether I mind her complicated past but I could not answer
                  because it was too sudden for me. A person that I love so much
                  actually lied to me for 4 months, Although she is very truthful on
                  all her past things except this. Now my heart is feeling very sour
                  and I dun know wat to do, if I leave her I will be very very sad
                  and if I stay. The shadow is always there.</span></p>

              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"> The problem with people is that they want to investigate their
                  partner's history, yet their love and maturity are not magnanimous
                  enough accept the outcome.</p>
              <p>It's only human if people are very
                  sensitive to 'certain scenario' (open to variety of interpretations),
                  but having that self awareness to understand that since our hearts are
                  not exactly very big to begin with, to pursue relentlessly about
                  people's past is like slapping yourself around a bit with a large
                  trout, while trying to maintain your smile. The question is why then
                  allowed yourself to be confused with all that past when the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>main</strong></span> fringing thing is to look forward into the future?</p>
              <p>That
                  shadow you are talking about is nothing but an illusion of what you
                  perceived as an 'inferior product'. At that very moment when you won
                  the heart of your prized woman, that feeling is akin to a child
                  receiving a present. I am sure that euphoria lasted quite a while.</p>
              <p>However, when she poured the truth to you, it's akin to the child opening the present, only to find a broken toy train.</p>
              <p>You start questioning yourself like how the child would ask: "how come my present so lousy one?"</p>
              <p>But unlike the child receiving the present - can love be inferior?</p>
              <p>Or
                  is it because our perception has weaved such a formidable spell, so
                  strong that we began to believe it, even we used to think otherwise?</p>
              <p>People
                  talk about love all the time - some even swear by God (you even used
                  words like 'heart and soul...'). But when the real situation arise from
                  nowhere and begin to probe the core fundamentals of your individual
                  definition of this love - the entire structure of that 'cheap-talk'
                  just crumble like a pile of cards, without even the need to say 'lets
                  break-up'.</p>
              <p>The relationship just got blown off - like how the
                  little pigs who built their house with straws. Think before you decide
                  to equate your love as prefect, wholesome or 'heart and soul' because
                  they are probably just made of straws - easily shattered by her
                  poignant past.</p>
              <p>If you are unable to accept her history, then
                  you might want to consider an exit because you CANNOT change your past.
                  Acceptance is your only bridge to her foolish past. If you decide to
                  love, then you have to walk the talk and learn to build a house of
                  bricks. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="icon_idea.gif"></p>
