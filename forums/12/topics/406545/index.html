              <p>You should go and see a family lawyer.</p>
              <p>A will only takes effect AFTER you are dead. And NO, you can't exclude her totally either.</p>
              <p>If you get divorced half way through " till death do us part", then yes she is entitled to some of your assets.</p>
              <p>C'mon dude.. wat are you afraid of.. you want her to take care of YOUR family right ? Don't you think you should compensate her some too ?</p>
              <p>Surely you are not expecting to f her, make her take care of your family and do good stuff for you all for nothing ? How cheap can you be ?</p>
              <p>If you don't want her to touch your money, then don't marry her lah.</p>

              <p>A prenuptial agreement is useless in Singapore even if she agrees to sign it.  It's not recognized here.</p>
              <p>What you need is a will.  Just get a lawyer to draft up a will and let him/her know how you intend to allocate your property to who.  You can definitely exclude her from getting a single cent of your property.  Similarly, she can contest the validity of your will.</p>
              <p>The thing is, and others also mention already, why would you love a woman until you want to marry her and yet don't love her enough to care for her well-being after you are gone?  Like that, the marriage got meaning meh??</p>
              <p>I'm not a lawyer and other than the part about prenuptial agreement being not recognized in Singapore (this I am very sure of), the rest are just my opinions based on watching too much Hong Kong serial drama.  For as long as Singapore has existed, there's only 1 case where prenuptial agreement is recognized in a court here and this involved 2 foreigners who had their pre-nuptial agreement drafted in their home country.</p>
              <p>See a lawyer lah... You have too much property to risk taking the advice of some monkeys hiding behind a keyboard (myself included).</p>
