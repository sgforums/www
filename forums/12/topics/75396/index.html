            <div class='col-md body'>I wasn't around to read what they wrote in the shoutbox so i'm sorry if i repeat.<br><br>I think this is just a case of over-worrying. You said you never contacted any girl in 4 years. I think it doesn't matter. People who attend boys school from pri 1 to sec 4 likely to not interact with girls other than on the streets as well. And then they proceed to JC or Poly or ITE coping fine with the opposite gender as well as their academics. It's like when you never cycled for 4 years, you just need time to get use to the bike again and you'll feel as natural as 4 years ago. You wouldn't actually forget how to cycle.<br><br>I think you should just wait until term starts and see how things go. If by then, it really happens, it's still not too late to consult others on what you can do to solve it.<br><br>I believe being yourself will be the best option to try to fit in. Just like how you've done it when you graduated from primary school. Don't worry too much. It's always hard to adapt to a new environment. Just know that you're not alone. All the rest probably feels the same way as well regarding the difficulty of 'fitting in'.<br><br>Best of luck.</div>

Maybe at a camp? where u guys meet for only maybe 3 days only but u didn't speak to her much and u asks for her no. on the last day?
