            <div class='col-md body'>Hi nanako,<br><br>After 6 years of relationship comes to an end, you must be feeling terrible. It's really sad and disappointing to know that your partner did this to you.<br><br>There's no point of re-capturing his heart again since he left you. Nor don't ever give him a chance if he wishes to come back to you, if he realise that you are still the better one. You ain't a hotel. Protect your rights, and certainly at this point of time, he doesnt deserve your love and attention anymore.<br><br>At this stage, you have to pull yourself through this difficult time. Time will eventually heals, but depending on how you handle the situation. Do not despair, do not give up faith in love. True love is always out there waiting to land gently on your shoulder.<br><br>Remember, one bad egg doesn't mean the whole basket is rotten. If he doesn't cherish you, somebody out there will. And do not rush into a relationship quickly in order to forget the past! Take your time, re-organize yourself, mingle with your good friends. Face life openly, don't trap youself in the shadows of this failed relationship, this is very crucial.<br><br>You have my blessings. Cheers.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

Let him crawl back to you....why must you still submit to his wimps and fancies by calling him and such. A jerk who cannot commit no matter what is still an ass hole. And paradox in his statement...if he cannot commit to you, why can he commit to another girl and love you at the same time?

That is very natural.<br><br>But let go you must.<br><br>You will never forget him, and in some ways, you will never stop loving him. I am a guy, so I guess I can approach such a situation alot more logically.<br><br>Its gonna hurt more in days to come. When holidays or birthdays, or special anniversaries.. Acknowledge that. Don't bluff yourself.<br><br>Get involved in life. Go out. If you like pubbing. Go. If you like travelling. Go. What YOU like to do, things that were not possible when you were together.<br><br>And one day, the hurt won't feel so painful. And you stop crying, and the day seems just that little bit brighter. You will then know you're on your way..<br><br>Love is like a butterfly, chase it and it flies away. Stay still and it may just land on your shoulder..<br><br>And I echo the sentiments of some the forumers here. Don't let him into your life again. He WILL just hurt you again.

Just remind as friends after that...? Since he's the one who mentioned about the breakup (for some reason), you could just wait to see does his action matches his words after the breakup...? Then perhaps you would know his TRUE INTENTION...? Well... IN A SENSE...?</div>
