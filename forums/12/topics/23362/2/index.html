            <div class='col-md body'>hi nanako, having to let go of a 6 yr relationship in which u loved the guy alot is tough, u must have the constant thoughts that he isn't the best for you, if he was why would he walk out on you like that? u gotta understand that love is not charity, u giving in so much does not mean he will love you back.<br><br>It's good that you had the easy way out, i know of this ex-classmate who's been wif his gf for 3 yrs, and recently i saw the girl wif another guy, surely u wouldn't wanna experience this right? be happy that u didn't have to learn things the hard way.<br><br>Keep in mind that love has no logic, maybe someday you walk down the streets of orchard and you find someone else who catches your eye? truth be told, you might be grieving now, but dun ever give up the hopes of being in another relationship, cos then u'll be unfair to urself as your not giving urself a chance...<br><br>i know i know... it's easier said than done, i jus broke up too, and i felt that she was the most wonderful in ways u guys wouldn't understand cos i'm jus a low life prick wif no ambitions...<br><br>correct me if i have wrong impressions pls....<br><br>Cheers,<br>DoDo</div>

Think of it ..how can you have a husband which give you these bad memories.<br>Forget him..six years or ten years.. he had changed.This is the fact!<br>Are u sure he wouldnt abandoned u again?<br>Are u sure he can still love u the way u love him?<br>There will always be a hole in the plank once u drive a nail in,even though its removed!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey Nanako...i know this really hurts big time man! I went thru such shit before man! As most poeple would said, time is the greatest healer. I guess this is kinda true. Right now start to do something you like, whatever you like! From swimming to clubbin or what ever.<br>For me I will do some sport that is mentally torture and physically torture too. Or better still do something to yourself like havin a better figure or grooming class or what. Make him regret for leaving you. When he sees in as a BEAUTIFUL GAL...she will bang his bloody head!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hm...how come everybody is scolding the guy. Although I do agree that nanako should get on with her life, but we only heard one side story. 6yrs is not a short time.....if he is a filrt, he would have leave her long ago.<br><br>Maybe he really feel stress up being with her. He may took up too much of his time. Remember that age 23 is the time to concentrate on carrear. Plus we are in SINGAPORE. the external stress is too much.<br><br>I think we better don't make any comment before we know the whole story.</div>
