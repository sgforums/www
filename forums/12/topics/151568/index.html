Love/Lust some times tie in with pain but that's another long winded discussion.<br><br>what we do can be related or not related to these states of mind ... but it is not always a representation of that state - ie buy flowers and candy etc. Lots of adulterers buy houses for their mistresses but don't mean they actually "love" them. Some times lust begins because of love and sometimes lust led to love.<br><br>ideally people can live alone till they die but usually people want some form of company or want to produce offsprings - to continue the line. There might be other reasons or needs -ie emotional needs.  In many a times, "love" is an over-rated, overused, overkill and often abused word in the name of lust... However, it cannot be said there is no real love..  Lust sometimes arise out of love but it cannot then be said to be tainted but it does have a negative view. But some times lust arise out of just pure need/wants where there is no emotional attachement.  Just as love can also arise out of simply want/need where it makes a person seek companionship.<br><br>This kind of discussion is very general and lengthy and endless actually. Because there cannot be physical prove. Everything said here is just an opinion you can agree to a certain extend or not agree to a certain extend.  Everyone's experience is different and so drawing on experience and what is presented in this site and everywhere... one becomes an observer and learn/evolve thought for oneself.  Discussion do not do justice to experience and observation ... and the answer lies in oneself<br><br>I guess I added more confusion...<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Valentine's Day, Christmas Day, birthdays, weddings, etc, are commercialised, yes.  Shops are there to supply a DEMAND (go read up basic economics, I can't be bothered to launch into an explanation here).  Sure, shops can do all the advertising, sell the nicest products, but if there wasn't a demand, &amp; people didn't buy into that kinda commercialised nonsense, how would the shops have an opportunity to make a quick buck during such seasons?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Love itself is a feeling.  It's people who make the celebration of Love commercialised.  Hamster (my nick for my guy) &amp; I don't buy each other expensive presents during Valentine's Day.  Neither do we book a table at posh restaurants.  Rather, we relax &amp; cook together (he cooks, I dice &amp; cut very slowly), give each other massages, &amp; maybe a small present.  It's the same for X'mas &amp; birthdays.  We also buy each other "Just because" gifts, which are most precious &amp; treasured.  Some people feel that since Valentine's Day is to celebrate love, why Not celebrate?  Surely you can't begrudge them that.  Afterall, it's a positive thing if they wish to make their partners happy.<br><br>2. Love does Not really exist.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> It does.  If you go by this argument, then you don't really love your parents.<br><br>3. Lust.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Lust is Not chemistry.  I lust after Brad Pitt, but that doesn't mean I'm gonna sleep with him.  Neither do I love him.  But I love Hamster, &amp; it's natural to lust after him.  What the hell's wrong with that?<br><br>4. Are you being a cynic or are your views that of a loser?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Only you would know.  I can't be bothered to ponder over it.<br><br>FeowFeow<br><br></div></blockquote>Dear Feow Feow,<br><br>1)Okay, I accept that.<br><br>2)Peharps I shall be more strict with my post. I am talking about "love" between man and woman. Let's try to make things simple and not too complicated by bringing in other sorts of "love", such as "pet-owner"<br><br>3)I am talking about "Love without Lust". Not the reverse case of "Lust without love". You're over-complicating my point of view here.<br><br>You love your Hamster, but which one comes first, Lust or Love? Just think about it carefully. I don't need your personal input, just objective opinions.<br><br>4)Then why did you post that as a point in the first place?<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Love is already complicated enough without you having to complicate it further with your thoughts, which are at best, irrelevant, at worst, incoherent (pardon me for being blunt, I get irritated when I'm confused after reading a post).</span><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow">I am sorry for confusing you and also how my post felt irrelevant or even incoherent. I am just stating out my thoughts and it is your choice to reply accordingly or not even reply at all.<br><br>I agree that Love is complicated, even though I have not experienced "Love" in my stated definition here. As I repeat once again, it's just my personal thoughts.<br><br>CoolMyth.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
