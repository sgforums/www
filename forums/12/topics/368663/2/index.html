Such pains haunts one forever, and the shadow of guilt never leaves, hindering the very happiness love is suppose to and can bring.</p>

              <p>im not saying im a victim. i was never good at saying no. maybe
                                      that's my flaw. i don't intend to be with him in the end. but
                                      thanks for all of your opinions, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>i should stop this</strong></span> before it gets

              <p>She said she should stop this, not she <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>would</strong></span> stop this. She had known all along that she shouldn't bring this relationship any further, but did she do anything? No. What most of us here will like to hear is a more convincing statement from her.</p>
