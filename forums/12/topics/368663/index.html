              <p>A lot depends on how far you have brought your relationship with this "other guy".</p>
              <p>If he decides to bring up the matter to your bf, odds are are your bf will break up with you ( Though honestly speaking, you deserve it for being unfaithful).</p>
              <p>Flirting in the office is a common thing, but that does not mean it is a right thing to do. You know it is a wrong thing, yet you continue to do it, that speaks a lot about your character.</p>
              <p>The best and easiest way is to quit your job. I highly doubt that guy will let you off so easily if you just talk to him, though you are to be blamed as well for flirting with him.</p>

              <p>Our opinions are not important at all.</p>
              <p>What is important is that you start doing something to stop these foolishness.</p>
              <p>If you truly loved your bf, you will have said no. The reason why you didn't is because you are curious and you wanted to try this out - having another man behind your bf's back.</p>
              <p>You are regretting it now, that is why you are hoping that you will be able to find some support here to "help" you leave this guy. Mark my words, he will not let you go so easily, so you better be prepared.</p>

              <p>Aiyah , in the first place love has never been there lar, sth else lar, as for faithfulness or moral codes - utter crap!</p>
              <p>The biggest betrayal is to pretend to ... to  conform when your heart feels otherwise - of course, just assume responsibililty for what u are. I m not encouraging licentiousness but rather to be what u are, risk all, live  - its for u to know lar</p>

              <p>no need to quit your job, nowadays hard to find job. ultimately it boils down to your heart, no point staying faithful just for the sake of staying faithful. if u think you have found a guy who you love more, then go ahead, better have the pain than have problems during the marriage later.</p>
