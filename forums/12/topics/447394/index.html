              </p><p>Hi,</p>
              <p>i'm really going through a very screwed up time of my life.</p>
              <p>I was rejected by this gal which i thought was the gal of my dreams.</p>
              <p>normally, i could jus move on but i really dnt know why this time i really can't let go.</p>
              <p>I've tried all ways to forget abt her. I've cut contact with her, kept myself busy etc... but she jus keeps coming back to my mind no matter how hard i try.</p>
              <p>it's affecting my social life which i just stay home and stone and emo. even when i'm out, i'm not the same person again.</p>
              <p>it's been 3 weeks since she rejected me. she tld me she's scared of me cause i showed my feelings too soon and she's at a lost also on how to react towards me.</p>

              <p>actually i'm veri confused abt this part. i'm not sure whether she really meant what she said.</p>
              <p>1stly when i ask her for the 1st time, she said "can we be friends 1st and get to know each other better?"</p>
              <p>so i took her literally and just be frens with her lor. aft tht i tried to ask her out a few times as a fren, not even a date but she said no every time, so i just asked her what's wrg and she said "i only treat you as a fren who i can talk to and have common interest and i hope it stays that way"</p>
              <p>from there i just left her alone, nvr contact her.</p>
              <p>aft sometime, a common fren mention to me that she said "it's not possible and i mean it but I'm ok as friends"</p>
              <p>I was pretty unhappy when i heard that cause all this while i've did face the rejection and took her as a fren, it's she think too much and think i'm still wooing her which i'm not</p>

              <p>but i just dnt like it when i'm being wronged and her action of telling some pple really makes me wonder whether her intention was to have pple to take side with her.</p>

              <p>i'm really going through a very screwed up time of my life.</p>
              <p>I was rejected by this gal which i thought was the gal of my dreams.</p>
              <p>normally, i could jus move on but i really dnt know why this time i really can't let go.</p>
              <p>I've tried all ways to forget abt her. I've cut contact with her, kept myself busy etc... but she jus keeps coming back to my mind no matter how hard i try.</p>
              <p>it's affecting my social life which i just stay home and stone and emo. even when i'm out, i'm not the same person again.</p>
              <p>it's been 3 weeks since she rejected me. she tld me she's scared of me cause i showed my feelings too soon and she's at a lost also on how to react towards me.</p>
