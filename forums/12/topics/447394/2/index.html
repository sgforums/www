              <p>The cat is already out of the bag - would you expect her to receive you as a friend? You are now radiating with hidden intention of love for her.</p>
              <p>Put yourself into her shoes.</p>
              <p>Lets say if a girl you don't like is very interested in you. She profess her love in you. Don't you think you would start avoiding her too? And then she comes and tell you that she just asking you out as a friend. Don't you think you would suspect her intentions?</p>
              <p>She just tell you that both of you are friends. Get it? Its SOP for a girl to say that you and her are no longer connected.</p>
              <p>Just stay cool and forget about her. Obviously she would continue to avoid you. But once in a while she may ask you if you are ok to check out on you. Don't misconstrue that as she giving opportunity to you - just answer her you are ok and go on with life.</p>
              <p>The thing that I find unfair is that when a girl rejects a guy - she gets the support from everybody. But when a guy rejects a girl (even if he was trying to do it nicely) - everybody sympathizes with the girl and vindicates the guy as a criminal. Its sexism - unfair.</p>

              <p>thanks man.</p>
              <p>seriously i don't wanna give a dam abt her lah.</p>
              <p>even if she does contact me in the end, i won't take it as a green light but literally as just a "hi" and maybe that she just doesn't wanna spoil the frenship. </p>
              <p>Basically to say, i won't read too much into it.</p>
              <p>it might sound like a foolish statment but I'll leave it to fate abt this, if it's meant to be, it's meant to be :)</p>
              <p>I'm just unhappy that that she miscoomunicated about something that have lead to the situation to be so bad, if she had that time communicated correctly, i would have left her alone long time ago and not even try to ask her out as a fren</p>
