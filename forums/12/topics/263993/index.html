After the 3 years that friend smsed him back.<br><br>Patience, your ex-GF may not be contacting you now, someday she will. As for your birthday celebration: do you really need to call out gals only? Y not make it a 'friends' or family gathering?<br><br>Don't neglect the people around you just for the sake of chasing gals.</div>

Your parents supported you since you were a baby<br>2. You dislike your parents since young because.....<br><br>So how? How can you translate these two realities into a set of behavior that takes both set of realities into account?</div>
