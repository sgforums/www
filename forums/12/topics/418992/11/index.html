              <p><br>those brainstormy and mind mapping are olden day tactics, even today real storm come faster than you think, by the time you brainstorm and map, game over already, do not alway think that brainstorming can create better solution, sometimes it can turn up to be a waste of time, or simply joke and coffee time, and yet do not find any solution. One or two brain is good enuf, make decision more decisive and faster, too many brain can make matter worst ya.</p>

              <p>Dear everybody,</p>
              <p>I have a few question:</p>
              <p>1) Why the girl I like, always don't like me? But they girl I
              don't like always give me attention?</p>
              <p>I like a certain girl but she avoids me so I believe she
              rejected me. But then there is this 24 year old girl at office who
              always want to pester me to go out with her but I am not interested
              in her because of her character. She like to talk a lot of bad word
              and profanity. She also known for sleeping with other men. I know
              some forumer here is going to tell me to go for one night stand.
              Firstly, I am not interested in her, secondly, she is not
              attractive to me, thirdly, I don't want to catch STD, fourthly, I
              got my own ethics.</p>
              <p>2) Why everbody have same taste as I?</p>
              <p>Whenever I like the girl, there is always 3 guys going after the
              same girl. I feel so frustrated. She always take the guy who is
              most aggressive, most rich and most charming. I am not very good at
              charming because I am bit introvert.</p>
              <p>3) Why I never success after 2 dates?</p>
              <p>I never ever success after 2 dates. After that the girl will
              text me sms saying "I am such a sweet, nice and good guy, but
              we cannot go out again because she is not that keen on me. Bla Bla
              thank you for the memories".</p>
              <p>I have 3 dates and all failure. That was 3 years ago. So hard to
              find girl friend.</p>
              <p>Last week, my friend from Malaysia show me a newspaper cutting
              saying more men in Malaysia than women. Censor say 100 men to 88
              women. I wonder how many 100 Singapore men to ??? Singaporean
              women???? Must be fewer. Sigh, so hard to find girl friend.</p>
              <p>I always have to fight against 3 to 5 guys for one girl's hand.
              So unfair.</p>
