              <p>This is what <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">hearing is all</span></strong> about. One agrees perfectly, but one <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">hears only what one wants to hear</span></strong>; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">one <strong>understands only</strong></span> what one <span style="text-decoration: underline;">wants to understand.</span></p>

              <p>It is palpably evident that the above seems to be your predicament. You are free to spout all that comes to you - it is you and u are being u whatever u type here. To reject outrightly, what one knows not or lacks insight is the highest form of ignorance.</p>
              <p>By judging another - u are not defining what another is (in this instance, me or ) . .. but defining what you are. The same goes for and each and everyone posting here. It is only whether one accepts, pretends or simply ignores. However, it does not go away.</p>
              <p>As for being misunderstood or not at, it is fine by me. I post to evoke ''questions'' and have one arrive at one's ''conclusion'' or ''views/opinions''</p>

              <p>Wah "if you love me", I shy shy la wei. Of course la, I neva assume a gal like me or not. Try to discuss ma, find out weak points so I can learn how to disarm a gal and make me more attractive and desirable to the gal I like.</p>
              <p>Try, Try, but for a guy, not so easy. Got one time I ask a gal at a restaurant about her phone number, turn out a guy wuz there, he was unhappy wif my advances. So he stood in front of her and ask me "what is my biz doing here". I say I only want her no. He look angry, like want to whack me. Dunno whether he is fren, bf or brother. But since she look shy shy didn't give, I walk away.</p>
              <p>At least I try, I shouldget an award for braveness. Full Medal of Honor.</p>

              <p>Not really, I met up with some online guys before, it is not the use of words that will be different btw online and real situation, it is more of the physical look and body language that hinder the process, once you overcome it, it will be back to kind of online stuff. Because before meeting a person online, most of us, our mind would had set an imagination of what that person will look like, and that assumption carry with us into the meeting, then, on the other hand, we ourselves also have to relook into our own condition with many question to ask, what if she saw me and run away, or what if she said I am so old or what if she stand far away from me and keep quiet...etc etc.  So, to certain people, it can be very excited but yet very scary for them, provided you have that guts to face it, be open to anything, you can make friends or even bf or gf on Online.</p>
              <p>Fyi, I meet people with open heart, remain humourous, jovious and alway keep the meeting lively, most will laugh and feel so free talking and chatting with me. </p>

              meow meow everyday. Third day, he sucess get the female cat. After
              tat, they go inside the drain, meow meow meow, on top of each
              other. One month later, I saw so many kitten meow meow.</p>
              <p>Why courtship cannot be like cats? Why human courtship so
              difficult?</p>

              <p>Sometimes you dont need such a difficult pick up line to get the girl. It really depends on the girl. And if your pick up line happens to get her attention, even the most simplest and cheesy ones will work.</p>
              <p>There is the total stranger pick ups, and the colleague pick ups... lol The former is actually harder. Cause u are total strangers. Mutual feelings are like u said.. mutual. There must be a starting point from somewhere. E.g u like the girl and you do your own thang, while the girl likes the way you do things. Then.. mutual lol. Sometimes mutuality can hit off hard n fast... some, slow and steady.. builds up. There is no sure win scenario.</p>
              <p>Maybe to the players out there, courtship to them are like cats. But then again, courtship was never something which can just magically work out without certain drawbacks.</p>

              <p>Not really, I met up with some online guys before, it is not the
              use of words that will be different btw online and real situation,
              it is more of the physical look and body language that hinder
              the process, once you overcome it, it will be back to kind of
              online stuff. Because before meeting a person online, most of
              us, our mind would had set an imagination of what that person will
              look like, and that assumption carry with us into the
              meeting, then, on the other hand, we ourselves also have to
              relook into our own condition with many question to ask,
              what if she saw me and run away, or what if she said I am so old
              or what if she stand far away from me and keep
              quiet...etc etc.  So, to certain people, it can be very
              excited but yet very scary for them, provided you have that guts to
              face it, be open to anything, you can make friends or even bf
              or gf on Online.</p>
              <p>Fyi, I meet people with open heart, remain humourous,
              jovious and alway keep the meeting lively, most will laugh and feel
              so free talking and chatting with me. </p>

              <p>No doubt that there are those that online and in real life you can feel that they are the exact same personality. I talk as much crap offline and online. The worst thing I would want is to create a sort of false impression to others about myself.N that is normall a big turn off.</p>
              <p>But at the same time I do not deny the fact that there are those that better express themselves online. Because there is not much fear in being rejected straight out in their face. Like people messaging my inbox asking if I webcam, or ASL that kinda thing because of my avatar. They dont feel anything. The only time they will have reaction is when I reply. lol</p>
              <p>And about the scary feeling about online meet ups, true what u say, the uncertainty etc. But if u have been truthful about urself, there is no reason to fear, because he/she should accept you who you are because of your personality online.</p>
              <p>Anyways, what I meant before about the words and stuff, were the pick up lines to be used online. You cant just for example "You Love Me?" and then explain that you meant "MEE". Come on.. that is more sneaky than actually funny. And it kinda defeats the purpose of using pickuplines that uses words that sounds alike. But if it works for you, then good lo. .... I thought it works for the more teen.. preteen .. xiao mei mei type. heh he..</p>
              <p>Online is way easier than offline. Its like picking up a chick in the clubs vs daytime in the mall or random offices. The former is easier while the latter isnt.</p>
              <p>Just saying.. there are pickup lines.. and there are pick up lines.</p>

              <p><br>It is easy to pick up some gal in starbuck on a broad daylight too, I got guys approaching me when i having tea, asking when i get these pad, these bags or comment that my fashion look chic...i know that they are courting up to something, but if he can do it, out of 10, if one gal can accept him, he gets a gal he likes. It is a matter of your social openness, ang mo guy are very sociable, unlike asian who are very much conservative except for a few.</p>
              <p>If that guy approached me sound ok, i will chat with him and see how thing goes, we need to be open and understand that cyber friends can become true friends, but if you guys go into meeting a gal and expect her to become your gf overnite, that is ridiculous, but sad to say, most local guys have this mentality, and bear in mind club gals go for money, we are not, so there is nothing fancy about getting a club gal by your side, a look only knows money minded liao.</p>
              <p>There is a alway a room for friendship to be built and nurture, got this guy, quite nice looking approached me and say hello, can we share the table, i say, not a problem, then we chit chatted, he is also single, i am also single, why not, we end up even teasing each other with those guys and gals beside us,...."woei, Angel, that guy sitting back of you keep looking at you lah, must be very interested in you....Hey, Mike, those gals 3 oclock beside your chair very chio leh, suit your age too, and i saw one staring at you, want to make a move, as a gal, it is easier for me to go intro myself than let them get to know you. How?", Such kind of conversation release tension and yet able to make more friends, and with more friends, you get more options and chances in life to meet your best partner. I did recommended my cafe fren Mike a galfriend of mine, and they are courting well. So it does not mean that dating or going out with a gal/guy, then getting rejected by either gender, you call it a day and throw the towel liao...end up saying very difficult to find a gal in sg...bullshit</p>

              <p>Still brings back to my original point that you sometimes dont need some pick up lines or what, sometimes the simplest, or just most straigtforward, or cheesy ones can get a conversation going.</p>
              <p>Dont forget that Ang Moh are more sociable also because you are asian. Sometimes these "sociable" Ang Moh cant even pick up thier own women.</p>
              <p>I have done a few of those "nice bag where u get it.. " stuff, but they are genuinely regarding the bag/cute stuff, seldom I will stay for long to keep the conversation going. Especially since I am attached most of the time I keept it nice and simple. My circle of female friends is ever expanding.</p>
              <p>But if you maintain the thought of able to find someome better, you will never appreciate what you have. And at some point I reckon it has to stop. Because you never ever run out of girls.  Same goes for the guys. But as the frequency increases, so does the restlessness.</p>
              <p>I never said it was difficult to find gal in sg.. inf fact Sg is one of the easiest pick up places.  lol! Maybe I shouldnt say that because I have not travelled the entire world yet, but by far...  not taking into account the local locals of Indo,Thai,Philipines ... those type u know.  xD</p>
