              <p>Yes I want to go out but wher? Nightspot bad place to know people. Firstly, nobody invite me there. Second, even if I go there, hard to socialise, so noisy, the music, canot hear wat people talking. Thirdly, would I dare to go to some girl and ask for her phone number? Scary. You may say I got no guts but this is very scary business. Some people get killed in nightspot because of this. Love rivalry.</p>

              <p><br>Everybody got ego, even gal got ego. Many many years ago, I dated a gal with very big ego. She so proud, don't want to lose. Always like to blame me if I forgot direction or I forgot to carry her purse. She always think she is right and I am wrong.</p>
              <p>Ego is a fact of life, we canot avoid ego, everybody got ego, some more, some less. We only have to learn to control ego.</p>
              <p>I don't think ego is bad or disrespectful to oneself. Sometime ego help me, to defend myself and stop other people from walking all over me. Ego is good. We canot sit down there and let people hurl us wif insult after insult, ego is a good defensive mechanism for our self esteem. Ego is not denial, if use properly. Ego wif wisdom help us to see thru other people intentions. When we know somebody want to attack our self esteem for the sake of making us feel bad abotu ourself, ego self defensive mechanism come into play to help us become better person and give people message we are not pushover.</p>

              <p><br>Precisely, I use the ego as my shield. Ego is very important in life. Watch the movie "Anger management" by Adam Sandler. This character was so soft because he have no ego, everybody bully him, his self esteem is all time low, his gf very angry at him for being pushover. One day he over-reacted and got himself into trouble. But luck has his way, he got a good therapist who guide him and help him release his anger and build the ego so he won't get exploited by people and he won't outburst again.</p>

              <p>Dear everybody,</p>
              <p>I have a few question:</p>
              <p>1) Why the girl I like, always don't like me? But they girl I don't like always give me attention?</p>
              <p>I like a certain girl but she avoids me so I believe she rejected me. But then there is this 24 year old girl at office who always want to pester me to go out with her but I am not interested in her because of her character. She like to talk a lot of bad word and profanity. She also known for sleeping with other men. I know some forumer here is going to tell me to go for one night stand. Firstly, I am not interested in her, secondly, she is not attractive to me, thirdly, I don't want to catch STD, fourthly, I got my own ethics.</p>
              <p>2) Why everbody have same taste as I?</p>
              <p>Whenever I like the girl, there is always 3 guys going after the same girl. I feel so frustrated. She always take the guy who is most aggressive, most rich and most charming. I am not very good at charming because I am bit introvert.</p>
              <p>3) Why I never success after 2 dates?</p>
              <p>I never ever success after 2 dates. After that the girl will text me sms saying "I am such a sweet, nice and good guy, but we cannot go out again because she is not that keen on me. Bla Bla thank you for the memories".</p>
              <p>I have 3 dates and all failure. That was 3 years ago. So hard to find girl friend.</p>
              <p>Last week, my friend from Malaysia show me a newspaper cutting saying more men in Malaysia than women. Censor say 100 men to 88 women. I wonder how many 100 Singapore men to ??? Singaporean women???? Must be fewer. Sigh, so hard to find girl friend.</p>
              <p>I always have to fight against 3 to 5 guys for one girl's hand. So unfair.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>1) Faith. Your love has not cross your path yet.</p>
              <p>2) Life is like that. You take first or I take first. Never fair.</p>
              <p>3) Dont give up. Only 2 tried. You more more opportunities.</p>

              <p><br>Maybe just to you. Hellow Miss Bonkers, you are obviously shallow because you haven't read my thread properly. Please wear another set of spectacles lady before you start pre-judging me. Are you lacking intelligence? I never said anything about me liking pretty/popular girls. I never said I wanted a Ms Universe to be my gf. All I just wanted is for at least some element of physical attraction, is that too much to ask for?</p>
              <p>In addition to that, character is most important to me. I like a pleasant nice gal who can discuss and work things out with me.</p>
              <p>Yes I take a good hard look at myself. What do I have to offer? A lot. I am caring, helpful, a good listener and kind as I have earlier said to another forumer. Again you not paying attention and not read carefully, before you start blurting and accusing.</p>
