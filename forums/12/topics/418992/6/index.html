              <p>Sometimes you dont need such a difficult pick up line to get the girl. It really depends on the girl. And if your pick up line happens to get her attention, even the most simplest and cheesy ones will work.</p>
              <p>There is the total stranger pick ups, and the colleague pick ups... lol The former is actually harder. Cause u are total strangers. Mutual feelings are like u said.. mutual. There must be a starting point from somewhere. E.g u like the girl and you do your own thang, while the girl likes the way you do things. Then.. mutual lol. Sometimes mutuality can hit off hard n fast... some, slow and steady.. builds up. There is no sure win scenario.</p>
              <p>Maybe to the players out there, courtship to them are like cats. But then again, courtship was never something which can just magically work out without certain drawbacks.</p>

              <p>Last time I went with 3 sales gals to a client place. One client, a guy wuz interested in my gal colleague. He very direct, say "Helo, are you single? I am 40 years old, I am single, you want to go out with me?". Like that la. My female colleague feel freak out, didn't answer him, only smile smile. This wuz when the client brought us out to treat us lunch. I heared everything, I feel so caught in the middle. Then own our way back home, in the bus, she tell us all how freak out she feel about him.   </p>
              <p>Three day later, he call her handphone and ask her out, she make excuse she not free. Another two day later, he call her again, this time she ask me to act as her boyfren and answer her handphone for her. I say to him in manly voice "Yes? I am her boyfren, if you disturb her again...we must meet...". Then the guy so embarass say "Sorry, sorry, I thot she single...i won't call again".</p>
              <p>So nowaday, tagline neva work wan. I think best way to work is two people know each other, mutual like, slowly, slowly build up the feeling and tempo.</p>

              <p>julian bro. after see you argue so much with some of the gals, let me give u a piece of guy's advice which gals dont like you to hear. never listen to gal advice on dating. dont listen to what they say. look at their actions.  like a gal usually tell u she dont mind a guy without car but all her bfs drives. are you going to take her words for it? there is an invisible checklist they wont tell u. every gal has it. it just a matter how long it is.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>they usually teach u to be a nice guy which doesnt work most of the time unless you are still in sec sch. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>unfortunately, there is no cookie cutter guide to attract gals. different gals appeal to different things/words yet they ultimately juz want love and security. during a date, they will constantly assess your body language and your words to look out for ticks and cross on their checklist items. you need tons of dating experience to know that. you need to date different type of gals. from lawyers and doctors to admin gals and secretaries. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>gals are still gals. they go by feelings and this is a double edge sword to them. they uses this to behave in ways we cant comprehend which leads to fustration. but this very feelings will work against them and u need to know how to use to your advantage. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>remember, everyone has weakness and you just need to find it through listening. the more she talks, the more she reveal to your her emotional weakness. of cuz u need to probe the right questions as well.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>one more thing. having tons of $ helps but u need to know how to use it effectively. gals wont respect u even if u buy them branded goods every month.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> good luck! :)</p>

              <p>dun expect people to like you if you are not open minded, present yourself well and be humorous, And especially for men, especially sg men, i find them very untidy and never groom themselves well, you need to take care of your face, body and dressing, alway see those oily oily face sg uncles/men with poor dressing standard and yet with fat bellies. Hiaz! Like this, how to like you??</p>

              <p>5) We r great survivor - out pace Indon n Msia, even though we hv no water, little land n no minerals. We got one thing, we got brain !</p>
              <p>6) We take calculated risk - We migrate fr China n we show everybody in SEA, we are the best !</p>
