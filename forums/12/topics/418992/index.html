              <p>Dear everybody,</p>
              <p>I have a few question:</p>
              <p>1) Why the girl I like, always don't like me? But they girl I don't like always give me attention?</p>
              <p>I like a certain girl but she avoids me so I believe she rejected me. But then there is this 24 year old girl at office who always want to pester me to go out with her but I am not interested in her because of her character. She like to talk a lot of bad word and profanity. She also known for sleeping with other men. I know some forumer here is going to tell me to go for one night stand. Firstly, I am not interested in her, secondly, she is not attractive to me, thirdly, I don't want to catch STD, fourthly, I got my own ethics.</p>
              <p>2) Why everbody have same taste as I?</p>
              <p>Whenever I like the girl, there is always 3 guys going after the same girl. I feel so frustrated. She always take the guy who is most aggressive, most rich and most charming. I am not very good at charming because I am bit introvert.</p>
              <p>3) Why I never success after 2 dates?</p>
              <p>I never ever success after 2 dates. After that the girl will text me sms saying "I am such a sweet, nice and good guy, but we cannot go out again because she is not that keen on me. Bla Bla thank you for the memories".</p>
              <p>I have 3 dates and all failure. That was 3 years ago. So hard to find girl friend.</p>
              <p>Last week, my friend from Malaysia show me a newspaper cutting saying more men in Malaysia than women. Censor say 100 men to 88 women. I wonder how many 100 Singapore men to ??? Singaporean women???? Must be fewer. Sigh, so hard to find girl friend.</p>
              <p>I always have to fight against 3 to 5 guys for one girl's hand. So unfair.</p>

              <p><br>Then you go for the girl that you don't like and find something that you like about her after you've known as friends and become close friends then you will be able to find out the reason why you will fall in love with the girl which you initially don't like.</p>

              <p>Be grateful that a girl has actually taken liking to you, she have actually given you the golden opportunity to form a potential relationship with her.</p>

              <p>One thing i learn about girls is that you need to be rich....it is not so important that you are tall, dark and handsome...but it is definitely important that you are loaded...</p>
              <p>When i was young i use to think that 2 persons should be bound by love...As i grow older, i realized that it has nothing to do with love but the size of your wallet.</p>
              <p>So if u want the girl of you dream. You are better off trying to get more $$$ first.</p>
              <p>And once u got $$$, you will have tons of girls throwing themselves at you....&gt;&lt;"</p>

              <p>I can go for a girl who I 40% don't like, not a girl that I 110% don't like. You see doesn't mean, I like a girl, I like everything about her, nobody is perfect. For example, there is one girl I like but she got insecure problems because last time she waas hurt by her past bf. So, she became very sensitive but I still like her for what she is.</p>
              <p><strong><em>"Alot of guys also like me, but I don't like them so I never give them a chance."</em></strong></p>
              <p>To be fair, you also don't want to try those you don't like.</p>
              <p>Ahem, the girl in the office don't actualy like me. She is trying to buat kacau at me. Some girl like to disturb single guys. Unfortunately it is the kind of girl I 110% don't like becuase her behaviour make me disgusted. She like to sleep around, very ego, proud - always want attention, play office politics and favourtism, boastful (claim herself is attractive but actually otherwise), say a lot of vulgar words, like to gossip, irritating voice, accuse people without evidence, lazy, always play tai chi in office, blame people no.1, put on a lot of makeup and smell awful full of perfume. </p>
              <p>I don't see that as a golden opportunity more like rusted opportunity because that is one opportunity we guys don't want. We guys want genuine relationship not those who buat kacau in office.</p>

              <p>I can go for a girl who I 40% don't like, not a girl that I 110% don't like. You see doesn't mean, I like a girl, I like everything about her, nobody is perfect. For example, there is one girl I like but she got insecure problems because last time she waas hurt by her past bf. So, she became very sensitive but I still like her for what she is.</p>
              <p><strong><em>"Alot of guys also like me, but I don't like them so I never give them a chance."</em></strong></p>
              <p>To be fair, you also don't want to try those you don't like.</p>
              <p>Ahem, the girl in the office don't actualy like me. She is trying to buat kacau at me. Some girl like to disturb single guys. Unfortunately it is the kind of girl I 110% don't like becuase her behaviour make me disgusted. She like to sleep around, very ego, proud - always want attention, play office politics and favourtism, boastful (claim herself is attractive but actually otherwise), say a lot of vulgar words, like to gossip, irritating voice, accuse people without evidence, lazy, always play tai chi in office, blame people no.1, put on a lot of makeup and smell awful full of perfume. </p>
              <p>I don't see that as a golden opportunity more like rusted opportunity because that is one opportunity we guys don't want. We guys want genuine relationship not those who buat kacau in office.</p>
