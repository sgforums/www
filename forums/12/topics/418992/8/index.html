              <p>Yeah, I am lukcy, more luckier than you ever be.</p>
              <p>I get the impression you are a shallow person who have been hurt by somebody like me in the past. Bcause, you r quick to pass judgement without even looking at the facts and not even knowing me tat well n you are desperately wanting to get cheap attention.</p>
              <p>I have more susbstance than you think, plastic lady. I will not drown because I am an integral part of Sg society, Me like the rest of the sg men contribute a great deal to the social developments of Sg, unlike you Miss Bonkers who is too free but to go around to accumulate post counts (who don't have a social life, spend too much time with your ageing parents) and criticise Men who resemble your past imaginery boyfrens (or guys you used to stalk). We Sg men, keep the island city running with our flair and jazz and we keep the Sg women wanted (Miss Bonkers is excluded bcause it is an inmate at IMH).</p>
              <p>As for you Miss Bonkers, seeing tat your life is so pathetic, Ionely, dull and you're too free to bother other people, you should spare Sg the agony of your presence (spare us the agony of your boring, mindless, garbage and paranoia feedback) and find the tallest HBD apartment in Sg, wear a bag of 50kg bricks and make sure you commit suicide by leaping as high as you can and bring as much pain to your pathetic plastic hollow body, tat will smash into many pieces.</p>

              <p>Obviously we know that money is not the only issue. Unfortunately, it is shallow, bland and mindless ladies like Miss Bonkers choose to accuse us of saying that money is the only issue. Money is the major issue but not all the factor into considering a partner.</p>
              <p>I belief Miss Little Bonkers lack intelligence to pursue a proper factual argument/debate without resorting to little pointless insults to active, mature single men (which have no effect whatsover on me) in Singapore who seem to have offended this pointless insignificant Little Bonker.</p>
