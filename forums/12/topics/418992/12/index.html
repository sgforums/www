No offence dude but i was in your position at one stage and there were few girls that I chased by got the whole "I just want us to be friends" then I had chances but I never took the opportunity and left it too late but my main point is.

              <p><br>Sg gal are abit hypocratic, when they wear low cut, they tends to cover it with bag or their hand, unlike taiwanese, if we dare to wear low cut, we dare to let people look to appreciate. For us in taiwan, when a lady bent down and cover her shirt neck top with her hand is consider rude, it gives an impression that all around you are wolves and rapist. Unfortunately, I see alot of that in Singapore gal.</p>
              <p>And yes, because sg gal are alway labouring in their work, they tends to look and feel more stressful than other country gals. Then they use their hard earn money to do surgery, that expensive comestic and salon etc etc which is a total exploitation by the beauty world. For us, we prefer natural look with light make up.</p>

              <p><br>choke is ok, it is like bottleneck, we need to break bottleneck mah, at least, we taiwanese gal can tell you what we are upfront, so that you can choose, be wary of it or simply break off in the begining, unlike sg gal, courting time all look nice nice, good good, guai guai, then after married, all kind of patterns also come out, then sg guys start to suffer and go pub or hv affair here and there...what a mess.</p>
              <p>we taiwanese believe that in life, be it love relationship or any other things, there tend to be choking here and there, but the more important things is that once the choking is cleared, learn from it and be better, more lovely and understanding.</p>

              <p>Because you like chio bus mah, naturally there'll be competition lor. You don't want competition from other guys, then go for plain janes lor.That's the easiest way out. And also I read from newspaper that Japan has invented an artificial robot woman who can imitate and talk like the way human beings does and most importantly made to look like a real woman and moreover very pretty. You should give it a consideration to import it if you don't like competition. Lolz. :-P</p>
              <p>Competition is really unavoidable and everywhere,be it race, be it finding a job or be it landing a good place in a prestigious school, but what is important and really matters is to stay true to your ownself irregardless of these rejections. And also do not think that there's anything wrong with you and don't take it to heart after the rejections. It differs from gal to gal on what they expect from a guy.  Your road is still long. I'm sure there'll be a day where you'll encounter a gal who appreciates you for what you're and that you appreciate her as well. All the best and Jia you!!!! :)</p>
