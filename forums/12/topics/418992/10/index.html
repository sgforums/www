              <p>May be old man got family but family too busy to visit him. So marry or not marry, no diff la. Important thing is make sure you children dun treat u like tis next time u become old. Take care of family better ok? If neglect, children will end up uncaring like the old man lying in hospital bed. Quality more important than Quantity.</p>

              <p>May be old man got family but family too busy to visit him. So
              marry or not marry, no diff la. Important thing is make sure you
              children dun treat u like tis next time u become old. Take care of
              family better ok? If neglect, children will end up uncaring like

              <p>aiya, marry is only a buzz word to be broadcast to everyone that you already belong to someone, a family, a wife/husband. Customary marriages and ROM are actually going thru a motion to declare yourself that you are bonded to someone else. And as a bride or bridegroom, it is day where you are the most stupid in your life, peoples ask you to kneel, you kneel, ask to smile, you smile, ask you to do this and that, you also do, what a stupid day. The very next day after the marriage day, the guy lost his freedom of movement, the gal lost her admirers and chasers, and when the baby arrive, god bless them, both become more stress and not long, looks like uncle and aunty already see those with toddlers crying and running...aiyo, sian bo.</p>
