              <p><br>Maybe just to you. Hellow Miss Bonkers, you are obviously shallow because you haven't read my thread properly. Please wear another set of spectacles lady before you start pre-judging me. Are you lacking intelligence? I never said anything about me liking pretty/popular girls. I never said I wanted a Ms Universe to be my gf. All I just wanted is for at least some element of physical attraction, is that too much to ask for?</p>
              <p>In addition to that, character is most important to me. I like a pleasant nice gal who can discuss and work things out with me.</p>
              <p>Yes I take a good hard look at myself. What do I have to offer? A lot. I am caring, helpful, a good listener and kind as I have earlier said to another forumer. Again you not paying attention and not read carefully, before you start blurting and accusing.</p>

              <p>Pity? Its a gift that I don't appeal to bonker lady like you. Speak for yourself, unless you conduct a survey that prove that I don't appeat to online girls - must be more than 30 respondents, yuo shut up, uneducated lady. You have no statistical proof. Pity urself, you so fast to judge other people.</p>
              <p>Who say I am desperate? I am eager to want to start a family, I am eager to try relationship I like. Is that anything wrong with that? I am a male, I am interested in gals. You got something against tat? Why? Jeolous ah? I am normal wat.</p>

Be strong and steady lah, dun care what other people think, just go into some pubs or disco, talk to some gals, then watch and see, dance abit with some of them, by midnite, most gals will be quite high already, then get one you like to take care of her, dance with her, take her home and get her contact nos, next day, ask how is she and date her for dinner or lunch lah, from there you can carry on,...if she said she has bf or not interested, ask her to intro some frens.</p>
              <p>LOVE is free, what rivalry are you toking about?? If I love you, who can stop it?? like and love is different hor. when speaking to gal, open your ear and listen properly, dun anyhow assume a gal loves you when she said she likes you ya</p>

              <p>Wah "if you love me", I shy shy la wei. Of course la, I neva assume a gal like me or not. Try to discuss ma, find out weak points so I can learn how to disarm a gal and make me more attractive and desirable to the gal I like.</p>
              <p>Try, Try, but for a guy, not so easy. Got one time I ask a gal at a restaurant about her phone number, turn out a guy wuz there, he was unhappy wif my advances. So he stood in front of her and ask me "what is my biz doing here". I say I only want her no. He look angry, like want to whack me. Dunno whether he is fren, bf or brother. But since she look shy shy didn't give, I walk away.</p>
              <p>At least I try, I shouldget an award for braveness. Full Medal of Honor.</p>

              <p>Fren, everybody is dysfunctional. That is what make us so human. There is no such thing as perfection. The only question is: Is someone more dysfunctional than others in that they turn psychotic? Like Miss Bonkers who suffers from halucinations, panaranoia, schizophrenia and hatred for fair weather men like me? Miss Bonkers suffer from envyness of men like me, who have abundance opportunity to venture and see other women and have the joy of love. While Miss Bonkers is deprived, suffers from low self esteem and a need to ridicule others to boost its female ego.</p>
