              <p>i tot you will help to speak from a foreign wife perspective as you are from taiwan. it not hard for singaporean guys who get gals like you and those PRC working in MNC.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>for example, i have a friend intro a malaysian chinese who work in a MNC as accounts mgt(not accounting). well... she has a beautiful dreamy eyes and seem like a wife material.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>there are tons of foreign ladies who are professionals around who are degree/masters holder. they are willing to accept guys of the same status. on the other hand, sg gals mostly want guys who are better than them. if a gal earn $10k, how many men can beat that before 30? those men do exist but they are overwhelmed by many gals to date.</p>

              <p>who in singapore is not money minded? even men-of-the-cloth are very much interested in money nowadays. monks, priests, pastors are all alike.</p>
              <p>today, there are monks like mingyi who owns overseas properties, bmw etc. Pastors who own multi-million properties.</p>
              <p>would your mum have married your dad if he's unable to earn enough to support her needs? would you?</p>
              <p>even if you (woman) are capable, and make alot, will you be willing to marry a man who makes far less than you? e.g. woman with 10k income, vs man with 3k income?</p>
              <p>chances are, the woman will look for men who earn more than her.</p>
              <p>______________</p>
              <p>and nowadays, you get married too early, you won't have enough money to buy a house.</p>
              <p>if you marry late, you will be making too much money to buy a hdb, and thus have to save up even longer for a private property.</p>
              <p>let say you are a young couple in your 20s, would the woman want to move into the guy's house? and stay with the guy's family, parents, siblings and grandparents?</p>
              <p>even if you are willing, the hdb unit will be too small to house so many people, and yet at the same time to provide privacy for *ahem*.</p>
              <p>so its no wonder that people do not want to get married.</p>

We taiwanese still very much preserve our identity and culture, we still speak mingnan dialect and go thru traditional marriage like old times, respect our oldies and also work together as husband and wife in a more romantic sense, whereas singapore had lost most it identity with a culture becoming a rojak soon, there is no sense in it characteristic, and living is a burden for those lower income, given that with so much foreigners that is said to have helped the economy. Taiwan is good in it economy too, tho a bit of heat up in political, but we stand as one and go for our right with action rather than singapore just talk only. Not that taiwan do not have foreigners, we have less and are really talented other than domestic maids.</p>

              <p>What bring their relatives and families you talking about, if let say you marry a Indo rural area wife, you have to help her village home by building toilets, double storeys attap houses, and generators for electricity etc etc...like my delivery man cum driver, he married a vietnamese wife, not bad looking, better than a normal sg gal look, but he have to take care of her family in vietnam, cos her parents very poor, toilet also dun have, need to buy tractor to plough field etc etc...and his wife will alway nag him for money to send back, and now he got a problem with me, too much annual leaves taken, including MC, thought of sacking him, so called him in and counselled him, he told me he has to go back vietnam once a while and the airfare is not cheap, but his wife alway want to go back, about once in 3 months, also to change visa. I told him I am not running a charity pub, he better settle his problem. So, this are problem having foreign wife, some do not help you financially but only add burden to you.</p>

              <p>Ur contingent plan not very gd la, if China invade Taiwan, then how?</p>
              <p>Aiyoh, u obviously neva meet a lot of Indon gals. I hv two frens marry indon gals bcause they have no time to take care of their family. First one, marry indon christian gal, bcause he got to manage night club, got no time to take care of family due to night shift. Wife don't mind, as long he bring money back. Second fren, work in oil rig industry, many months in sea, marry indon wife he can trust. Good wife, bear two son for him, complain little and very easy to satisfy.</p>
              <p>Indon gals r simple but they r by no means village woman, a lot of them come from the rural city not so metropolitan but they dun come from village, that I can assure u.</p>
              <p>Dunno about yer delivery driver, sound like he is making a lot of lame excuses. Demanding wife is not good reason for overtaking annual leave and MC.</p>

              <p>who in singapore is not money minded? even men-of-the-cloth are very much interested in money nowadays. monks, priests, pastors are all alike.</p>
              <p>today, there are monks like mingyi who owns overseas properties, bmw etc. Pastors who own multi-million properties.</p>
              <p>would your mum have married your dad if he's unable to earn enough to support her needs? would you?</p>
              <p>even if you (woman) are capable, and make alot, will you be willing to marry a man who makes far less than you? e.g. woman with 10k income, vs man with 3k income?</p>
              <p>chances are, the woman will look for men who earn more than her.</p>
              <p>______________</p>
              <p>and nowadays, you get married too early, you won't have enough money to buy a house.</p>
              <p>if you marry late, you will be making too much money to buy a hdb, and thus have to save up even longer for a private property.</p>
              <p>let say you are a young couple in your 20s, would the woman want to move into the guy's house? and stay with the guy's family, parents, siblings and grandparents?</p>
              <p>even if you are willing, the hdb unit will be too small to house so many people, and yet at the same time to provide privacy for *ahem*.</p>

              <p><br>Right said ! Marry early, study and job prospect bad. Marry late, both too old to bear children. I read Strait Times oso scared to see the stat, 35% of men in Sg r single ! scary prospect. Must be because of pressure of capitalistic society bottled up in small island and concrete jungle, sperm want to come out oso canot, how to produce children?</p>
              <p>Money, money, money (ABBA song) is everything. Take transport - pay, eat food - pay, watch movie - pay, buy clothes - pay, buy grocery - pay, tax - pay, everything is pay. Even after we die, our estate oso still paying. For sure, money is important factor woman consider their spouse la. Without money, all starve to death.</p>

              <p>But the problem with you is not tt you can't find one, is tt you don't want to find one. Aren't i right? If you want to find you wouldn't have stay here for weeks typing out your defence against those flaws ppl had pointed out. Even if they aren't true you can take those into consideration and not waste your time saying what not. Money is not everything. You have live for 26 odd years to have know this fact by now. Use those traits tt you say you have. Make those around you be happy with your jokes and give a listening ear to those who need it. In the long run some1 will notice those good things f your and will not look into your wallet to see those wads of notes you have.</p>

              <p>you actually brought up a very good point. i think i understand what you trying to say. this is the reason why korean, japanese, taiwanese and hongkie gals all prefer to stick within their own kind. it is the identity and culture that makes their people feel proud. their gals thinking their men are better than the rest.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>our sg gals are heavily influence by media from either western or other nationalities culture as mentioned above. very often these influences sources which most sg gals are exposed are drama, anime, movies and magazine. there is nothing for the gals to be proud of when they are with a sg guy except for monetary benefit. that is also why when a gal met a sg guy, she judge him based on his networth while when she met a korea, jap or cauasian, it is a total different ball game. suddenly the networth criteria is gone.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>we used to be popular among taiwanese gals in the 70-80s during our training there. we used to be looked upon by the PRC and malaysian chinese. we used to be high demand because we can speak both english and chinese. we are like asian with western culture. all these has since gone since in the 90s.</p>

              <p><br>first, let me put it clearly, I have no intention to marry a sg guy, i find my taiwan guys are more refine in a way of grooming and presentation, and more handsome too. We taiwanese still very much preserve our identity and culture, we still speak mingnan dialect and go thru traditional marriage like old times, respect our oldies and also work together as husband and wife in a more romantic sense, whereas singapore had lost most it identity with a culture becoming a rojak soon, there is no sense in it characteristic, and living is a burden for those lower income, given that with so much foreigners that is said to have helped the economy. Taiwan is good in it economy too, tho a bit of heat up in political, but we stand as one and go for our right with action rather than singapore just talk only. Not that taiwan do not have foreigners, we have less and are really talented other than domestic maids.</p>

              <p>Angel,</p>
              <p>Ur contingent plan not very gd la, if China invade Taiwan, then how?</p>
              <p>Aiyoh, u obviously neva meet a lot of Indon gals. I hv two frens marry indon gals bcause they have no time to take care of their family. First one, marry indon christian gal, bcause he got to manage night club, got no time to take care of family due to night shift. Wife don't mind, as long he bring money back. Second fren, work in oil rig industry, many months in sea, marry indon wife he can trust. Good wife, bear two son for him, complain little and very easy to satisfy.</p>
              <p>Indon gals r simple but they r by no means village woman, a lot of them come from the rural city not so metropolitan but they dun come from village, that I can assure u.</p>
              <p>Dunno about yer delivery driver, sound like he is making a lot of lame excuses. Demanding wife is not good reason for overtaking annual leave and MC.</p>

              <p>Wow, work in oil rig, that is the worst job in the world, all 3D apply, Dangerous, Demanding and Dirty. Now let said he works in the oil rig, married a sg gal of at least a diploma like me, so, he earns 8k and I earn 4k per month as a specialist or chemist, we get 12k, and as time goes on I get promoted, earning 7k and he get older, earning not much change, maybe 9k, and as you know, oil rig do not want older people, so he might retire earlier, but he still have his wife earning and all the saving he kept.  He will grow old gracefully and financially well taken care of. His wife, like me, knows how to invest here and there, get the best of profit and save for him, know how to buy property to make more money and so on. Bore him daughters and sons, given them full education and taught them well.</p>
              <p>Now if another guy working same with him gets a rural Indo gal, do you think he is going to be financially stronger and that his wife knows how to invest, earn money and care for childrens in a knowledgeable ways??</p>
              <p>For every success man, behind lies a successful woman</p>
