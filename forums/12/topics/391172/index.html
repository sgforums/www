              <p><br>Well its a wierd feeling you have I'll try and understand and relate to it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>All I can offer is that at the end of the day my wife became my best <span style="text-decoration: underline;">friend</span> sorta.... except she hates drinking and playing online games.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you spend enough time and effort chatting with your current gf.... she too in time will become your best friend. However whether you allow her that opportunity is another issue because it seems all you can think of is your old "best friend".</p>

              <p>Can understand how TS felt.</p>
              <p>The feeling you have is not like or love, is like worrying that you will lose the  connection with a very important person in your life.</p>
              <p>As we grow older, we lose friends to work, bgr, NS and many other things.</p>
              <p>True friends will allow will each other, time and space to experience life with others and will help each other in times of need.</p>
              <p>I have close gal friends  whom stood by me for 17 years and our friendship is still going strong.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>P.S. Just ask yourself are you interest in your gal friend or not. If not just tell yourself is a phase of letting go for her to experience life. She has her right to put her bf in the first place. Just be there to support her when she is down just like what she had done for you. I believe that is possible to maintain close friendship with gal without any love or liking for each other. </p>

              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"> Grass is always greener on the other side.</p>
              <p>Sometimes it does happen; especially when we assumed that life will remain status quo forever and we adopt an inactive approach towards the flow of life. Best friends may one day become causal friends and causal friends might one day developed into best friends; such impermanence nature of relationship is largely decided by the nurturing of the friendship towards the direction both seek to work towards.</p>
              <p>You probably had a thing for her; just that passiveness took away point of action. Perhaps in the past, the feelings manifested itself as 'best friends' - but your conscious mind choose to stop right there without risking to probe further than just the choice of maintaining a great friendship. </p>
              <p>It was a choice made. But it did not lapse into an issue because your circumstances were different - she was single and you could still enjoy a sizable amount of attention and concerns from her.</p>
              <p>But now the situation kinda evolved. Surely, both of you are still good friends, but your position as a best friend is divided. Perhaps it's a hierarchy lower. But even so, in a social context, it is only natural and pretty much 'justified'. Your frustration stemmed from the fact that you are unable to resolve this internalization in view of such 'naturally justified social position' and your emotions just react helplessly.</p>
              <p>You were undergoing some relationship problems before you found your current gf. And now that you had her, your subtle dissatisfaction and normalization of feelings towards your woman could signify that your love may be dubious. I am not questioning the love that you share with her, rather, I am concerned with regards to the circumstances that lead the formation of this relationship.</p>
              <p>There is always a danger in loving someone and not realizing if there was the love you thought it was when you first acquired it.</p>
              <p>Like what Genie has mentioned, learn to lead a relationship and not stick your head out and observe somebody else's. Such an attempt only seek to reveal the nature of your love towards your partner and upon correction, you might face an inevitable situation of losing them because you don't see a need to develop it. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="icon_idea.gif"></p>

              <p>If not, maybe your BEST friend imaginations are purely one-sided and not mutual. She probably treats you as a brother or just a close friend only.</p>
              <p>But I must admit, doing it or getting raped by your BEST friend brings you to a whole new level than doing it or getting raped by strangers.</p>
