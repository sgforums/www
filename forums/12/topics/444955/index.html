              <p>I wanted to stop jogging, pick up the racquet and throw it over the fence but I didn't want to blow things up, like involving some teacher and him picking a fight with me, and because he can just claim that his hand accidentally slip, so I just continued jogging, with my blood boiling.</p>

              <p>You are only 15, it is normal to feel angry. But how you mature and grow up in life would depend on how you laugh off this incident and just forget about it. Its a one-off incident. Its not as if those two guys continually bully you and you have no choice but to stand up against them. Just forget about it.</p>
              <p>Even if you reported this to the teacher, you would have made yourself infamous in front of your schoolmates, and two more new enemies of those two guys.</p>
              <p>You must know when to stand up for yourself and know when is best to stand down. This incident is best forgotten.</p>
              <p>Trust me, there are more battles for you to make as you grow. Especially when you go out there and work in the office, where's there is a lot of backbiting, backstabbing and office politics. Save your energy and wise up.</p>

              <p><br>First of all, they shouldn't be playing badminton on a jog track.</p>
              <p>They need to go to a badminton COURT to play.</p>
              <p>Second, that guy is a bully. Bullies are actually cowards inside but acting tough outside. They are counting on you to be as cowardly they are so they can get away with being a bully.</p>
              <p>Inform the school authorities the next time you see them playing badminton on a crowded track. They "accidentally" hurt you, they can also do that to someone else.</p>
              <p>If your school authorities don't do anything to shoo them off, then they are also idiots. Maybe you should find another school to study. Principals and teachers are to enforce safety in their school compounds at all times. </p>
              <p>If that same group of bully hit you again, you fight back.</p>
              <p>Go and learn self-defence, build some confidence so you don't let people walk all over you. </p>

              <p>Being a bully myself during my haig's gal sch days,  I had alway picked on weak gals to bully them, like this can show my power and pride, I also found and formed the powerpuff gals gang there, I was the chief, no need to carry sch bag, someone would carry for me, even teachers also have to respect us.</p>
              <p>Weak people like TS are what we are looking for to show our power. If they do not revoke back, we will keep bully them all the way.</p>

              <p>Okay, so the next time something like this happens again, I just grab his racquet and jog to a secluded corner to dump it behind a bush or something and just act blur. </p>

              <p>Yeah then, the two guys will act blur and follow you jogging into the bushes where nobody can see you three, then they will two people pound you like hell.</p>
              <p>Just forget about it. You are playing all your thoughts of revenge in your head over and over again.</p>
              <p>It is a one-off incident. It be different if the two guys are always bullying or targeting you as a victim - when that happens you must stand up for yourself.</p>
              <p>Anyway what are the chances of you meeting those two again playing badminton on the jogging track?</p>

              <p>You are only 15, it is normal to feel angry. But how you mature and grow up in life would depend on how you laugh off this incident and just forget about it. Its a one-off incident. Its not as if those two guys continually bully you and you have no choice but to stand up against them. Just forget about it.</p>
              <p>Even if you reported this to the teacher, you would have made yourself infamous in front of your schoolmates, and two more new enemies of those two guys.</p>
              <p>You must know when to stand up for yourself and know when is best to stand down. This incident is best forgotten.</p>
              <p>Trust me, there are more battles for you to make as you grow. Especially when you go out there and work in the office, where's there is a lot of backbiting, backstabbing and office politics. Save your energy and wise up.</p>

              <p><br>Yes, Marcus should have stood there and demanded an apology from those two guys.</p>
              <p>But it is already past. So, after two weeks Marcus come across this two guys at the corridor or during assembly and he say to them, "hey two weeks ago, you threw the badminton racket at me, I want you to apologise".</p>
              <p>Hmm, interesting although I never seen people do that.</p>
              <p>So, let the anger simmer and next time remember to do that.</p>
