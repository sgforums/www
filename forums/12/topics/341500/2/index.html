              <p>All ur friends are like dat --&gt; ask abt Bf thingy / no common topics?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I do have frenz who are married / getting married --&gt; starts talking abt their current lives, joy of having a hubby, a bf etc --&gt; i dun have the common topic as them, so i jus let things be, but they can be sure, the nx time they meet me will be at least half a yr to a yr later.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But not all friends are like dat, some will talk abt other stuff, including their families, but won't brag ard like some of my friends do.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am sure u have some friends who won't ask as well, but do broaden ur social circle as well --&gt; no harm having more friends.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for work, my boss even had the mentality dat my life is just work and my parents. Didn't bother much abt her comments/remarks, after it's my own personal life.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Dun get too affected by others' comments --&gt; no point.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Mayb I am more of one who aren't bothered by wat others' said / feel, as long as it's not against my conscience, I dun see anything wrong with being single.</p>

              <p>Those who seldom ask are those who are single themselves. But I have friends who are single themselves also keep asking me why I am still single. I didn't even keep on probing them about their singlehood. I find it an irony.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Some colleagues I find them quite bad, keep on asking till the point I feel they kind of look down on me. But I do not want to appear defensive. Because i do not want to give the wrong impression that I am sensitive about this topic.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Of course, this saddens me. I wish I am as strong as some of you guys here, who do not bother about other people's comments. But I am not strong enough to withstand such unkind remarks.</p>

              <p>I mean that it is when i go out and meet people, once they
              know how old I am , they start to assume that I have BF and asked
              when I am getting married. And also this is the time when remarks
              start flying about when they realise I am single. So I
              wonder whether to do actitivities alone can lessen the agony. But
              doing actitivities alone can make things worse I guess.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As friends getting married, their priority will be their
              new family. Sometimes, there are no common topics to talk about. It
              seems that both are from different world. I dislike the feeling of
              drifting apart from friends. But I kind of have to accept it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>At home, work or outside, being nagged about this issue is
              tiring.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What I fear is that I will become a single, old and desperate
              lady in future.</p>

              <p>agree, all gals will be afraid of becoming single, old desperate ladies</p>
              <p>but look on the bright side, it's not dat hard too. dress up, doll up, many of my "ugly ducklings" frens' r/s status had complete turn-over when they started dressing up, and it doesn't matter that they are not the 'super-chio' material.</p>

Let this be a force for you to be brave and to be more conscious of looking out for a partner.
