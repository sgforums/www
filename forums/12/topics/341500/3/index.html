              <p>i agree, i like yr theory abt the master personality among the rest.</p>
              <p>it's like u are actually a introverted person, but over the yrs u realise dat being introverted is too lonely, so u start putting on a chatty and lively front so dat u'll (hopefully) be more accepted</p>
              <p>same for all the "yes-men" out there, who say yes to everything, try their best to be lively n interesting, and helpful as well, only to be seen as "un-cool" and eventually still ignored by the so-called frens. then they will start putting on a cool n selfish front. those who are completely disillusioned might even put on the cool selfish front permanently.</p>

              <p>Maybe I cannot accept the huge differences between online and offline personality. Also, I do find it quite dangerous. I have encountered  desperate guys or even married ones online. Of course, I didn't dare to meet them. That is why I feel disappointed about making a friend online.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is better to know a person as he is in the real world. Then again, I am not so priviledged to have such opportunities. As the years go by, people around you are either attached or married.</p>

I'm in my final year of my uni studies(Medicine) and my frens are always pressuring me to get hitched(coz young doctors are very busy and have trouble finding time to chase girls). I've looked around, but at the moment there's no one I'm interested in who's available. I do have my admirers, though none of them are people I could myself together with. There were times I thought of coupling up with one of them just to seem more 'normal', like the rest of my classmates...but then I realized that this would be unfair to the other person, since I wouldn't be committed into the relationship. Because of that, I'm still single till now.</p>
              <p>There are times when I feel lonely, in fact I'm feeling a little lonely right now as we speak. However, I will not get into a r/s just for the sake of being in one. To me, being in a r/s with someone you truly like is magical. Being with someone you don't is a chore and a bore. Something i will not do.</p>

              <p> </p>

              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"> As much as we all believe that Love must indeed come naturally, our
                      'Self' component must provide the fertile ground for such natural
                      occurrence to manifest into reality. This 'Self' component, namely our
                      personality and what steps we take to render ourselves more socially
                      desirable, not merely in the physical sense, but also as a person
                      emotionally, psychologically and spiritually positive.</p>
              <p>The
                      theory of probability is self explanatory: if you want to find someone
                      suitable, you got to get out of your house and start meeting people.
                      When your social network improves, the chance for you to find someone
                      suitable gets better, as compared to solitary activities that could
                      only drive some meager mileage for you in aspects of Love.</p>
              <p>If you reckon that certain channels are not suitable, it's
                      perfectly ok. Learn to develop interest and expand your social network
                      through the interest you invest yourself with. Also, do not adopt
                      self-defeating mindset because it's very much a vicious cycle - as much
                      as you are pressured socially to be attached, this beget from a
                      negative source: namely pressure. Hence, your attitude towards knowing
                      someone is always about accessing someone if he/she is suitable for
                      you. Then if things isn't what you reckon it to be, you get dejected,
                      you become more withdrawn and whole cycle repeats itself </p>
              <p>Here's a truth: the more negative a person is, the more likely he/she will attract negative mate.</p>
              <p>Your
                      fear produces the negative aura - hence, your disappointment in men
                      that you met online are merely corroboration of reality - through the
                      synergy of both your thoughts and feelings - manifest as latent
                      effect. </p>
              <p>As much as my discipline in my astrology has taught
                      me, I disagree with the fact that some people are destined to be alone.
                      The challenge is not merely to analysis a person and telling them about
                      how doom they are, but the task is to empower one to take corrective
                      steps to overcome their issues. And to change situations, one must have
                      that self awareness to understand the root of problem and for cases
                      like yours, I can tell you, it's very much due to the inability to
                      recognize our own inadequacy and learning to get out of our comfort
                      zone after recognition.</p>
              <p>Some people decides that Love will come
                      naturally, say, after school days. But I can tell you from a
                      sociological perspective, with the elimination of a socializing agent,

              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"> As much as we all believe that Love must indeed come naturally, our 'Self' component must provide the fertile ground for such natural occurrence to manifest into reality. This 'Self' component, namely our personality and what steps we take to render ourselves more socially desirable, not merely in the physical sense, but also as a person emotionally, psychologically and spiritually positive.</p>
              <p>The theory of probability is self explanatory: if you want to find someone suitable, you got to get out of your house and start meeting people. When your social network improves, the chance for you to find someone suitable gets better, as compared to solitary activities that could only drive some meager mileage for you in aspects of Love.</p>
              <p>If you reckon that certain channels are not suitable, it's perfectly ok. Learn to develop interest and expand your social network through the interest you invest yourself with. Also, do not adopt self-defeating mindset because it's very much a vicious cycle - as much as you are pressured socially to be attached, this beget from a negative source: namely pressure. Hence, your attitude towards knowing someone is always about accessing someone if he/she is suitable for you. Then if things isn't what you reckon it to be, you get dejected, you become more withdrawn and whole cycle repeats itself </p>
              <p>Here's a truth: the more negative a person is, the more likely he/she will attract negative mate.</p>
              <p>Your fear produces the negative aura - hence, your disappointment in men that you met online are merely corroboration of reality - through the synergy of both your thoughts and feelings - manifest as latent effect. </p>
              <p>As much as my discipline in my astrology has taught me, I disagree with the fact that some people are destined to be alone. The challenge is not merely to analysis a person and telling them about how doom they are, but the task is to empower one to take corrective steps to overcome their issues. And to change situations, one must have that self awareness to understand the root of problem and for cases like yours, I can tell you, it's very much due to the inability to recognize our own inadequacy and learning to get out of our comfort zone after recognition.</p>
              <p>Some people decides that Love will come naturally, say, after school days. But I can tell you from a sociological perspective, with the elimination of a socializing agent, such as a school compound, your social circle should get smaller unless steps are taken to ensure that it doesn't. And again with the law of probability, your chances, naturally, get worst because, like you have found out, people are either attached/married or their psychographic is entirely off the chart.</p>
              <p>I say, invest more time in yourself and simultaneously develop your social circle.

              <p> </p>
              <p>Back to my problem, many of you have pointed out I should spend them on interest. But if my interest happen to be an activity which can be done alone, so how to expand social circle?

              <p>After reflecting, I do agree I lack a socializing agent. My social circle is very small. My trust and comfort level with other people has hit low point. If you really ask me to go out and meet people tomorrow, I think I will be very uncomfortable.</p>

              <div class="entry">
              <div class="snap_preview">
              <p><em>My girlfriend and
              I actually met in June last year but neither of us remembered it. Not
              until I chanced upon a photo on her blog did I recall she was the
              someone I once sat down and had a drink with. Even chatted for awhile.</em></p>
              <p><em>We were introduced again four months later. By the same friend but
              with different intentions. On another night out drinking but in a
              different place. Under the same moon but maybe, the stars were
              different this time.</em></p>
              <p><em>I believe in the importance of <span style="font-family: 'MS Mincho';">å¤©æ—¶åœ°åˆ©äººå’Œ. </span>The
              right person at the right time. And I know the stars were smiling that
              night in October. Winking at one another. Amused at how our eyes and
              hearts opened to the wonder of each other this time, but not the other.</em></p>
              <p><em>I have friends who are waiting and searching for the right one. I don’t really know what to say whenever we talk about love.</em></p>
              <p><em>I recognise the struggle. How the eyes sparkle with hope. And a
              determination not to concede, not to settle for less. I also remember
              the doubt. How I wondered whether it will ever happen during the seven
              years I was single. Whether I am asking for too much. Whether I am too
              picky. Whether I should actively circulate or just let it happen.</em></p>
              <p><em>Whether I will grow old alone and only then, regret not having
              reshaped my round hole to a square to fit all the square pegs I met in
              my life.</em></p>
              <p><em>I want to tell my friends, “Don’t give up. Believe.” But I stop
              myself. Because what if it doesn’t happen? What if the same stars that
              winked at me, blinked at them? Who am I to tell someone how much
              something is worth to them? Who am I, to tell someone just how long is
              too long. Or whether it’s ever too long.</em></p>
              <p><em>My girlfriend and I laugh about it. How we made no impression on
              each other the first time we met. And I know I’m lucky. To have finally
              found her. For we could easily have passed each other by, as we did the
              first time.</em></p>
              <p><em>And if you are still looking for that someone, I only wish to say this, from the bottom of my heart:</em></p>
              <p><em>May love find you too.</em></p>

              <p>If you think you are not the kind who can socialise easily and are afraid to jump into a pool of total strangers, then you should get someone whom are you at least acquainted with and go to classes or something together with him/her.</p>
              <p>You mentioned that you do have other single friends, why not gather one or two of them and join some fun-filled class purely for the sake of fun? Don't join with the intention of finding a bf. If you do, you will find it very hard to find one.</p>
              <p>For example, myself, I am pretty good with any strangers. I am planning to join muay thai classes for the fun of it. I am single but I am not expecting to find anyone there. But hey, you never know! I can meet a friend there, and that friend might introduce his friend to me and that friend of the friend can have a pretty sister! Who knows? And meanwhile, I am not wasting my time to, I can tone my body with muay thai (thai martial arts).</p>
              <p>I am 24 and single too by the way. I get those questions too all the time. I can chat with any gal and make friends with any of them but never really proceeded to the point of having a GF. Just not able to find a suitable one =) I have my friends asking me "So whom are u meeting up for Valentine's this time?" and when I say "Oh I am sitting at home", they have this stunned look on their face, as if its not possible for me to sit at home on that day. Haha..</p>
              <p>You are always welcome to make friends with me. Do PM me if you wanna chat or a listening ear. I can't guarantee anything but I do make a good friend I believe. And lastly, I am sorry that you encountered the wrong people online. I have met 3 girls online. All of them are among my closest friends now.</p>

              <p><br>On the positive side, you're not married to a useless or abusive man, or struggling to bring up your kids on your own after being divorced from one. And in this day and age, why would anyone be mocked for being single?</p>

              <p>I understand how you feel......although for my case, I have a little bit more allowance time....since I am a guy......</p>
              <p>I think you need to consider your circumstances....if your career is settled....your emotions is settled.....and you are ready to start a family....then you should start targetting it....make it a goal....</p>
              <p>The reason is...if you dont make it a goal....year by year...suddenly you discover you are getting older and older....and you may either panic...or lose even more inner will to get married.....</p>
              <p>And if you are in your late 30s....things will be even more harder for you....you might only get divorcees or widows.......</p>
              <p>Each year as time pass, your chances and your options is getting less.....</p>
              <p>For now, you still have a lot of time, since you have not hit 30 yet.....you are still considered a "young lady" and there are many men in their 30s who are suitable for you.....</p>
              <p>Just start thinking about it....whether you want to start a family, have a husband, have kids...and whether your circumstances is settled.......and if your conclusion is "yes".....then....my recommendation is to start looking...</p>
              <p>Go out more...attend more social events.....it also helps to join dating agencies....Dont talk to random guys from random online sites.....join real dating sites...the ones that need subsription payment...real dating sites.....</p>
              <p>By the way, this is how my own elder sister got married......</p>
              <p>After she dated 2 guys but broke off.....</p>
              <p>Then she started joining dating agencies....both online and not online...</p>
              <p>She has been married for the past 2 years or so....happily married...</p>
              <p>The guy is very suitable for her, very compatible personality, good and settled career, mature man, responsible, love his nephews and nieces, a good family man....</p>
              <p>But one thing I can see and understand is that, if she had not looked and joined dating agencies, she would have never met this person. And I personally can see that this man is better in many ways than the previous 2 guys that she broke off with.....</p>
              <p>My suggestion for you...if you want to start looking....is to join dating agencies....why...because you have many choices...and those people are all serious people who are ready to start a serious relationship with an end goal of getting married.....you can also meet guys who you would normally not meet from your own usual social circle....</p>
              <p>Dont worry about being uncomfortable or not used to meeting strangers....or not used to going out for social events....etc.....just do it...one time, two times, third time you are used to it.....you might even enjoy it....better than staying at home, it's so boring....it will be interesting for you.....</p>
              <p>OK good luck...</p>
