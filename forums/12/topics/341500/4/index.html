              <p>you know, there are lots of reasons why people are single, and there a lot more singles in your age group and older, than you think.  like many others have said, don't get depressed just because of peer/societal pressure, and get to know other single and happy people.</p>

              <p><br>can i just ask ... how?</p>
              <p>i'm in a somewhat similar position as the TS: i'm in my 20s, eduated, well-spoken and good-looking (enough to get free entry/drinks (courtesy of the door bitch) from time to time) - in terms of material possessions, i meet most of the Cs. that said, i find myself at home alone every friday/saturday night. my fds are all attached, and those in r'ships tend to stay with partners, and my <span style="text-decoration: underline;">few</span> single fds never introduce new ppl. i'm not embarassed at being single - in fact, i'm pretty content .. rather, i'm ashamed at being unable to get out of this rut that is a stagnant social life, with the internet being a lifeline. my single fds are boring (like really really really really introverted). also, while i dun want to be in a relationship, it would be fun to go dating - problem is there isn't anyone to take out.</p>
              <p>let's see .. common suggestions put forward that supposedly expands networks, but do not work - taking classes: there's nothing i wish to learn (or pay to pick up) / be more outgoing: i already am very outgoing (but singaporeans are just so averse to strangers approaching them).</p>
              <p>edit: reading my post in the 3rd party, i just realised how ripe for misinterpretation it is - i'm not arrogant or trying to do a self-sell, rather, i'm merely illustrating my point. please take my assertions of myself at face value. but if you do feel the compulsive urge to flame me, there's little i can do anyway.</p>

              <p><br>if shopping was all you ever did, and you enjoyed shopping alone, then indeed, making friends would be the least of your priorities. but that can't be all there is in your life. what about clubbing/pubbling/chilling? you still need company for these activities (unless of course you already have a sizeable group of outgoing fds, in which case i would be envious of you too).</p>

              <p><br>can i just ask ... how?</p>
              <p>i'm in a somewhat similar position as the TS: i'm in my 20s, eduated, well-spoken and good-looking (enough to get free entry/drinks (courtesy of the door bitch) from time to time) - in terms of material possessions, i meet most of the Cs. that said, i find myself at home alone every friday/saturday night. my fds are all attached, and those in r'ships tend to stay with partners, and my <span style="text-decoration: underline;">few</span> single fds never introduce new ppl. i'm not embarassed at being single - in fact, i'm pretty content .. rather, i'm ashamed at being unable to get out of this rut that is a stagnant social life, with the internet being a lifeline. my single fds are boring (like really really really really introverted). also, while i dun want to be in a relationship, it would be fun to go dating - problem is there isn't anyone to take out.</p>
              <p>let's see .. common suggestions put forward that supposedly expands networks, but do not work - taking classes: there's nothing i wish to learn (or pay to pick up) / be more outgoing: i already am very outgoing (but singaporeans are just so averse to strangers approaching them).</p>
              <p>edit: reading my post in the 3rd party, i just realised how ripe for misinterpretation it is - i'm not arrogant or trying to do a self-sell, rather, i'm merely illustrating my point. please take my assertions of myself at face value. but if you do feel the compulsive urge to flame me, there's little i can do anyway.</p>

              <p>You're asking the wrong person. Somehow many of my friends are single. You need to ask someone who's less anti-social than I am. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Actually having hobbies you are very interested helps to a certain extent. Because you'll meet other people who are involved in the same hobbies. If you have none I also don't know what to say <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
