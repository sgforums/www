            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Need urgent advice from all..<br><br>Recently I held a conversation with my best friend. We chatted and he confided in me something which left me in much thought. Till now, I still don't know how to reply him..<br><br>His case:<br><br>He is in his mid 20s..his ex-gf, who was with him for many years, left him last year. Most of the time, he confided to me that it was his fault. Although they never got married, he ex-gf bore him a son, a toddler. His ex doesnt want their son and moved abroard. He was left with a child, and he felt so devastated then.<br><br>A few months later, he met a gal who knows about his past and a child. They began a relationship. However, in the first few months of this new relationship, he was still wounded by his past and was emotional most of the time. In this case, he flared up quite often and sometimes made his gf so nervous when he talked about suicide. His gf told him that if he doesnt change, she cant carry on. That was a wake-up call and he immediately changed for the better. Since then, he has been the perfect bf who does everything that she likes of him and made so much efforts just to make her happy. Both emotionally and financially, he tries to make her happiest gf in Singapore because he sticks to the belief that as long as he loves her wholeheartedly, his conscience is clear..even if she chooses to leave him one day. She told him that she appreciates his change and was very happy.<br><br>Many months have passed when recently, his girlfriend suddenly told him that she needs to re-think the relationship as it is gona face with lots of obstacles from her parents that he has a son and her fear of his past 'emotional talk on suicides' haunts her. She said that if not for the change, she wouldnt have stuck with him for so long. Once again, my best friend was devastated..that despite his change, his past still haunts his gf..she told him that she is going to leave him for a while..and think whether she is going to continue this relationship..<br><br>I was very angry when I heard this. My best friend has loved her so much, and I know the many efforts/sacrifices that he has made just to make her happy. The thing is..how could she just suggest leaving him alone once again despite him not making any mistakes? My best friend even intended to spend all his year-end bonuses to give her the most romantic and memorable Christmas day event. I was told that she was not materialistic and very understanding to him and his child. But to leave him at this time when he has done nothing wrong, is really devastating to him.<br><br>I told him to give her up but he just love her too much and worried that no other girls would love him again as he is with a child and he is without looks. I told him that it's better to leave her now..rather than after spending all the money and in the end, lose both money and girl. But I am also worried that my advice may be too one-sided.<br><br>Any advices to provide for my best friend is appreciated. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

If she can come to terms with it, she'll come back stronger for ur fren.<br>As for ur fren.. guess he can't expect pple to be dat generous &amp; forgiving... to accept his past &amp; ignore their own insecurities. If he wans her to stay in his life.. tell him to get bk on his feet.. let every1 see (gf.. gf's parents.. frens..) dat he's 1 who can depend on.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>1) Suicide can really make the person who love you turned off. It is a mistake and a terrible one. For your friend to initiate such thoughts in the beginning, it is a wrong move.<br><br>2) Initially when they first started out, everything was fine and sweet. But as time goes by, the gal start to realise the commitment of a child in their future marrige. It is not easy for a gal to accept someone's else child.<br><br>Tell your friend to buck up. It is not the end of the world. Morever, he is a guy. He would have more capablity to raise up a child. And give the gal some time. i believe in fate. If it's meant to be yours, it will be yours. Maybe when the gal has straightened out her thoughts, she will bring your friend good news?<br><br>Good luck to your friend...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yep.. put youself in the shoes of the girls.. convincing her family is no easy task.. stigma of a son-in-law with a kid with no related bloodline still exist.. plus his past suicidal tendencies made him look like an emotional wreck.. I supp the guy has to find a way to convince the girl that he is indeed a changed man.. a man who can handle emotions well.. being all depressed isn't a good way of proving to her.. but the most difficult thing is to get her family's acceptance.. in he really loves her.. he would try as much as possible to not make things too complicated for her.. but i must say it's hard on the guy too..<br><br>GOOD LUCK FRIEND..   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>His gf's parents are telling their daughter all that because they don't know your friend and don't trust him at all.<br><br>Tell your friend to have a talk face to face with his gf's parents. If her parents believe that he is dependable enough for their daughter, they would definitely encourage her to go on in the relationship.<br><br>She is afraid of him talking about suicide because she is uncertain whether he still harbours such thoughts or not. Which is why she is in a 'wait and see' state right now. What your friend has to do is to pick himself up and get on with his life, so as to prove to her that it will not happen again. Once she is convinced that your friend has changed for the better, she will get close to him naturally.</div>

Road on a relationship is usually not smooth.. Especially of the one he's having now... I truly doubt it'll be easy even for the future to come...<br><br>I really think his concern is more of how he should be handling it after the break up... And INDEED, as a friend you should be watching closely over him.. As you've mentioned, he has got suicidal tendencies and any 'move' or non-movement now should only push him further towards depression now... The only way 'out' is that his gf accepts him... But 'accepting' just for the sake of 'accepting' would only create problems of its own and is not a permenant solution...<br><br>If they really have to part one day, sooner or later he'll still have to face it.. If he wants to, he can keep his gf as a 'low-profile' friend to slowly get over things... But for his case, I'll better advise for him to have a 'clean break' and concentrate on picking up himself and his life... As much as he might love her, life should never really be totally dependent on a relationship alone...<br><br>I suspect that his gf should have already thought of leaving him long ago... It's just his suicidal tendencies which held her back in the relationship... The unwillingness and natural instinct that things just won't work out carrying on like that has prompted her to leave him... She's probably tired by now... It's only fair that he let her go....? No matter how nice he has treated her, a 'bird in a cage' is just a bird without freedom...<br><br>Ask him to learn to love his life... Treasure it... Before letting another love him again... Only then would he have a better chance of understanding what's really 'love'....<br><br>Handle one thing at a time... Not all of them together... It'll only confuse him...</div>
