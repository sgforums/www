              Hello. Well I went to see a doctor at compass point mall *located near the mrt* around 1-2PM and a lady 30-40 came up to me from behind and asked me if I could speak chinese, so I replied in chinese and she started telling me about she is from Johor bahru and she had a stroke of bad luck as she forgotten her bag in a taxi, she fell down and her arms got hurt.she is 2 months pregant and she is bleeding and she contacted her husband but he said to go find some kindhearted singaporean to lend her some money. At first I was thinking *Scam sob story* and that her arm wounds looks like a 4 day healed wound as she was not bleeding and there were some big plaster. So she said something about internet banking and about lending and transferring the money as soon as possible, but I just said that I have no idea as I'm just a 17 year old student. So she said okay then but then can you lend me some cash for a taxi as I live in jurong west. From compass point to jurong west would be about $20 so I gave her the money. After she said she need more money for a operation conducted by a *reputable indian doctor* and she need about 140 more. After thinking should I trust this women or should I be the bad guy, I choose the idiotic morally right choice and gave her the money. After that she ask for my HP number and she took out a piece of paper and a pen when she is supposed to have forgotten her bag in a taxi but I gave her the benefit of the doubt and told her my number. She then told me that about 7pm she will call me and ask for my address so that she and her husband can return my money, which I know she will never do it and which she never did. She then walk out of the mall and head to the overhead bridge but before she went off, she told me that I was a kind soul blah blah blah may god bless you.
                  TL;DR I got scammed because I was a idiot. So any advise on this? Please skip the you'r stupid part if you would so kindly.

              <p>The longer the time lapse, the greater the notion that you have been scammed.</p>
              <p>You never know until it is certain that you will never get your money back as promised.</p>
              <p>Remember on your part, considering the information received at the time, you did the good deed.</p>
              <p>On the woman's part, we can only speculate as to the quality of her actions.</p>
              <p>On hind sight, you did not trust your instincts, and could have handled the situation better. Next time.</p>
              <p>In time, the money is nothing much, only rememberance.</p>
              <p>I still remember my 13th month bonus, pro rata of $380 taken by my friend, donkey years ago. Still have not pay back, remember but can't be bothered. No big deal.</p>

              <p>Wah you so kind soul.</p>
              <p>Ok, think about this. The woman conned you, so you should be very careful next time. There are other ways to help her. Next time when you encounter this problem:</p>
              <p>1) When her story start not to make any sense, start using your intuition.</p>
              <p>2) Do not give her any money.</p>
              <p>3) Take her to the nearest police station where the authorities will help her or allocate her to some shelter who could help her</p>
              <p>But never let this experience take away your kindness. If it is your character to help, be yourself. Still, you should be more careful in the near future.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks for the replies. Although being kind is nice but being deceived because of it feels kind of bad so I'm questioning myself about morale to be good or just ignore next time, to me the money is nothing as it can always be earned back later on as stated by mancha.</div>

              <p>You should ask her if this is her first time in Singapore and if she knows Singaporeans have no money.</p>
              <p>If she is in real need she can let the police take care of it. Or call 995 for the ambulance, they will settle the bill with her later.</p>
              <p>If something seems not right it is probably not right. You've just walked into an ambush.</p>

              <p>Most important thing is that you have learnt your lesson. Paying $160 to learn this lesson is enough for you to remember this for a life time.</p>
              <p>Never trust anyone especially stange people on the street who ask you for money.</p>
              <p>Next time if someone ask you for money please refer them to the police. If they are truly in need of money the police are in a better position to help.</p>

              <p>This kind of thing has been around for a loong time. I was scammed many years ago by same tactics china women, but only 10 dollars. How I know I got scammed? Coz I bumped into them again and they didn't recognise me.</p>
              <p>It seemed like they attack students coz students are more naive and hence "kind".</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Never give money to strangers who ask for it</span></strong>. If you want to do good, go do charity work.</p>
