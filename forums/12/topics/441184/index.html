              <p>Before I start, please don't flame me or provide useless advice, I am all for ears and I am ready to take your feedbacks and advice. My story starts like this:</p>
              <p>I am in this circle of friends. In this group, there are two girls, Miss A and Miss B. I have a bit of attraction to Miss A but Miss A is a bit irritating. I have no attraction towards Miss B, although Miss B is a nice person.</p>
              <p>Miss A always like to make me jealous. Like she always like to leave with other guys and do it in front of me. Sometimes, she even gang up with the friends, to tease her about this guy or that guy, to make me feel jealous. Is Miss A signaling me to go after her?</p>
              <p>However, I am afraid that Miss A maybe diverting me to Miss B. Because each time I attend the friend gathering, Miss A is always not around and MisS B is around. Miss B has been showing me a lot of attention lately, texting me and facebooking me, even sitting next to me in classes.</p>
              <p>My heart got the suspicion that Miss A maybe looking to lure me and then reject me so that Miss B can make her move on me. I don't know but I feel suspicious. That day when we group of friends organise a birthday gathering, my birthday, everyone turned up, especially Miss B but Miss A went AWOL. So I suppose Miss A don't like me after all?</p>
              <p>Me and Miss A always make jokes and have fun. So one day MissA decided to play the jealous game at me by getting one of her guy friends to always stick to her and then the guy friend would say that he went out movies with Miss A for me to hear. Is this a ploy to get me jealous? So I complain this to one of my senior friends, he then told Miss A not to do this inconsiderate behaviour. Miss A and the guy friend then grew distant, the guy friend even went to apologise to me. But then, now Miss A has gotten another guy to tag along and take her back home, he is from another class. Miss A that night, pretended to be drunk by drinking a lot of red wine and then got this guy to come over and announce that she needs to follow him back.</p>
              <p>So what is the prognosis? I suspect Miss A is trying to lure me to Miss B. Is this a diversionary tactic?</p>

              The only problem seems to be that of fear and suspicion of what may not pan out for u.
              One can rationalize, justify but as long as one plays mind-games when it concerns matters of the heart - there is no winner and one cannot manipulate to make oneself happy.
              It is disrespectul of oneself and disrespecting another!

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Before I start, please don't flame me or provide useless advice,
              I am all for ears and I am ready to take your feedbacks and advice.
              My story starts like this:</p>
              <p>I am in this circle of friends. In this group, there are two
              girls, Miss A and Miss B. I have a bit of attraction to Miss A but
              Miss A is a bit irritating. I have no attraction towards Miss B,
              although Miss B is a nice person.</p>
              <p>Miss A always like to make me jealous. Like she always like to
              leave with other guys and do it in front of me. Sometimes, she even
              gang up with the friends, to tease her about this guy or that guy,
              to make me feel jealous. Is Miss A signaling me to go after
              her?</p>
              <p>However, I am afraid that Miss A maybe diverting me to Miss B.
              Because each time I attend the friend gathering, Miss A is always
              not around and MisS B is around. Miss B has been showing me a lot
              of attention lately, texting me and facebooking me, even sitting
              next to me in classes.</p>
              <p>My heart got the suspicion that Miss A maybe looking to lure me
              and then reject me so that Miss B can make her move on me. I don't
              know but I feel suspicious. That day when we group of friends
              organise a birthday gathering, my birthday, everyone turned up,
              especially Miss B but Miss A went AWOL. So I suppose Miss A don't
              like me after all?</p>
              <p>Me and Miss A always make jokes and have fun. So one day
              MissA decided to play the jealous game at me by getting one of
              her guy friends to always stick to her and then the guy friend
              would say that he went out movies with Miss A for me to hear. Is
              this a ploy to get me jealous? So I complain this to one of my
              senior friends, he then told Miss A not to do this inconsiderate
              behaviour. Miss A and the guy friend then grew distant, the guy
              friend even went to apologise to me. But then, now Miss A has
              gotten another guy to tag along and take her back home, he is from
              another class. Miss A that night, pretended to be drunk by drinking
              a lot of red wine and then got this guy to come over and announce
              that she needs to follow him back.</p>
              <p>So what is the prognosis? I suspect Miss A is trying to lure me
              to Miss B. Is this a diversionary tactic?</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Grow some balls.</p>
              <p>Tell Miss B you are not interested in her being your romantic partner. Since she is not the one you want.. it's best to leave her alone so she may go find someone who can appreciate her.</p>
              <p>Miss A is not interested in you as a romantic partner.</p>
              <p>You can't have the one you love.. and the one you don't love wants you.</p>
              <p>Please expand your social circle.</p>
              <p>It is quite pathetic if you choose B because you can't have A.</p>
              <p>Surely there's Miss C, D, E, F, G - Z out there...</p>
