In fact the females were the ones initiated those meals. And the females colleagues willingly do almost anything for them without being ask twice. So, some of us local guys ask the females why they like the 'ang mohs' so much (that inclusive of those synthetic ang moh kow toolah). Their reply? They speak very charminglyleh.
