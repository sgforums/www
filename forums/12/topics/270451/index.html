            <div class='col-md body'>i've been a victim of a player. he cheats women of their feelings and sex and many of them are unhappy with his actions. u see, all of them have no idea that he's a player and that he's potentially spreading sex diseases around singapore. he's even abusive towards some of these women, like slapping them and hitting them.<br><br>some of the brave girls have set up websites and blogs to expose him, but he has threatened them to sue them for defamation and libel charges, so they have taken down their websites. the fact is that he has no basis to claim that these blogs are making false accusations, but these girls are just afraid that things might get out of proportion and don't want to end up handling a court case.<br><br>a lot of them, including me, need help in exposing his deeds, because he's rich and can afford to walk away freely, but i can't stand the thought of knowing that he could hurt many other young girls. he's already middle-aged, but he tries to cheat girls almost half his age of their chastity and innocence. is there a way to expose him without running into the law?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by allentyb:</div><div class="quote_body">even i will sue you for typing - potentially spreading sex diseases<br><br>the thing is, you are at your own responsible for falling in love with him, and you could have insist on safe sex, unless he has the intention of spreading sex diseases, that is a criminal offence. furthermore, what you want to sue him for, cheating you of your feelings? or money? or spreading sex diseases, if you are safe enough, why not, create a blog at a cyber cafe, then type all sort of scandals or truth against him, don't be stupid enough to put your real name in the blog<br><br>omg, i don't know what is your intention of all this, but i can sense, a bitterness and hatred for that fellow, goodness, at least provide a full name or how are we able to be wary of that guy</div></blockquote>sometimes i agree with your views and sometimes i don't.<br>i will explain why i do not agree with time round.<br>Do you think any women is that stupid to give sex to someone with STD, and speaking about normal sex, yes, most certainly. Women have their needs, all of the adults know that. It isn't abnormal for a woman to give guys sex when she really needs it. Therefore, i conclude this small part that the women are at fault. But please notice of the STD factor, STD is an illness unable to be treated and will bring death and loads of money to treat. By spreading STD, the guy is irresponsible irregardless of whether the woman wants sex or not. This is a responsibility question, why didn't the guy inform the victims that he had STD, i believe if he says that, it will most certainly screw himself because the woman will no longer want sex with him. So he kept it a secret, but he continues to want sex, therefore its like a prey and predator relationship. Some unwilling victims who are poor and not-that-knowledgable, will think that he is rich, it should be okay, until they found out they got STD, by then isn't it too late. Please remember that Thread Starter mentioned about the guy cheating for sex. In singapore, a country with "freedom of speech" and "democracy", the RICH still wins and talk the loudest no matter what they do. Money makes the world go round, heard of that ?<br>In this case, i'm going to side the girls, because recently, there had been alot of girls who created and posted threads here and there, informing about a guy who is very rich and goes around cheating girls feeling and getting them into having STD.<br>And to Threadstarter, you could post his name because if he wants to sue you, it's a civil case, by then, all the women who have been cheated by him can testify against him and his reputation will drop and he can't do anything.<br>Those type of rich man MUST DIE.<br></div>
