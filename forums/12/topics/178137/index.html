Take a huge step backwards and compare your past before you have a girlfriend and currently.<br><br>Love is never enough and has no limits, so there's no way anyone could compare and measure love.<br><br>You are a terrible guy if you are having such thoughts. Love has to be given and received voluntarily. If you're are looking for more love, you could buy them from any of those geylang's love-all-you-can shops.<br><br>If you're serious about her, then I would advise you to be patient as love is reciprocal. And NEVER NEVER COMPARE anything when you're in a relationship or friendship. Cos comparison is a lame stunt committed by insecure individuals and people who have no confidence in their own existence that they constantly need to be assured of.<br><br>Good luck, I hope you can change your mindset before it develops into a bigger and real problem in your future.<br></div>
