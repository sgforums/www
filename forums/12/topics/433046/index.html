              <p>I can't seem to manage my life properly. Everytime I wake up to go
              to a job, I keep thinking 'what's the point' and morever, I can't seem
              to keep a job long enough. It's like they dislike me so much but then
              again, all my life, people has been hating on me for no reason, calling
              me ugly or stupid.</p>
              <p>I need to get this out but when I was through
              late primary's, I started to grow lots of pimples and people keep
              commenting I look really haggard whenever they see me. I also started
              to grow abit fatter but never mind, my studies wasn't as good as the
              others so I was sort of an easy punching bag for them. They would keep
              criticising my appearance and even booed me when there was a time I
              went up a stage to collect my progress award for improvement in my
              studies. I once participate in a sporting event and came in last and
              the class leader was so mad, he made others spat venom at me. He was
              the ambitious type and not surprisingly, he is now at a good place in
              life unlike me.</p>
              <p>So it continued it's downward spiral and I
              hardly have any friends, still I do have one or two but they were like
              me, failing in almost every aspect in life but right now, they are
              trying their best to pick themselves up. But honestly speaking, I think
              they are much luckier in the sense they have a supporting family unlike
              mine, keep pushing me down and even spreading every failures that I
              have to relatives or friends and even accuse me of being a problem
              child but during the time in primary school, I was constantly being
              move to one primary school to another  because of family problems.</p>
              <p>Of
              course my secondary school experience was like a slap in the face and
              because of all these, I became a dull, depressed and permissistic
              person. All in my mind I am constantly thinking of being a shut-in and
              not face anyone out there.</p>
              <p>"Girls have it easier"</p>
              <p>Give me a
              break, I have never had a relationship and being in one is like being
              able to stay in a job permanently which is equivalent to a perfect fit
              for both parties but with my social anxiety/ocpd, depression which was
              developed throughout the years, it's really hard to be feeling somewhat
              satisfied and with the high rising costs of today, I really don't know
              if a species like me would be able to survive in a country, in a world,
              where people would love to see you get beat down and not stand up.</p>

I looked forward to adulthood but now I find that adulthood is also difficult because if u live in SINGAPORE, u need money. There is no welfare here. I have 2 good friends but I enjoy being solitary, reading and going church. Because I was bombarded in childhood and secondary school, I told myself that I am not going to take abuse anymore. That's why i developed a complex where the slightest insult can make me lose my temper and yell in public. I also see a pschyiatrist and take Seroxat/Xanax daily to have a calming effect.</p></div>

              <p>yes think of what u want to do in life. Take that as a point of departure from your past. It should be something u enjoy doing. It can be anything, manga, reading, movies, music, art. Then think of what you can do in that area. You can be a creator, or facilitator.</p>
              <p>The most important thing is to learn to love yourself and what you do. Only then will you be happy and confident. Once you think u have something u wanna do, work towards it. Be brave, don't think that oh im so old already i cant do anything else. If you think that way, when you're old u will have to rob a bank of $1 to get healthcare. ok. ( refer to recent news ) </p>
              <p>So i think that's a good first step. if u need someone to talk to, feel free to pm me. Remember, life is never a one way road. Don't expect things to be resolved without doing anything. even toto you also need to queue up first. </p>

              <p>hi, I just want to let you know that you are not alone in this, I have also the same problem. Thing is I caught this so called "social anxiety" when I was in church. I alwayz feel anxious and stress when I am with the people there.</p>
              <p>My problem escalated when I was pressured to go to a cell group, it was even worst because majority of the people there don't use chinese which I am more comfortable with, they are mostly university grads, eloquent and have sound knowledge of the bible than me.</p>
              <p>I can't say I am truely a believer, and am painfully shy, worst things is you need to fellowship with these people about God, and need to pray aloud. I feel as if there are many pair of eyes infront of me. At first I was uneasy, then I became very timid, at last I became phobic.</p>
              <p>my nightmares didnt end, it just started.</p>

              <p>There was one time I went to Mumbai to help my company set up a booth in an exhibition. I was walking from my hotel to the convention centre when I saw this lady with a tumour the size of a watermelon on her face walking by the footlane. Everybody was staring at her like a monster. My heart sank when I saw her face, I thought to myself, how could someone live through so much hardship? In my heart I wanted to donate some money to her but thought otherwise.</p>
              <p>So you see, there are other people worse than you. When you start helping more unfortunate people, you realise your life is not so worse off (although it does suck).</p>

              <p>hi, I just want to let you know that you are not alone in this,
              I have also the same problem. Thing is I caught this so called
              "social anxiety" when I was in church. I alwayz feel anxious and
              stress when I am with the people there.</p>
              <p>My problem escalated when I was pressured to go to a cell group,
              it was even worst because majority of the people there don't use
              chinese which I am more comfortable with, they are mostly
              university grads, eloquent and have sound knowledge of the bible
              than me.</p>
              <p>I can't say I am truely a believer, and am painfully shy, worst
              things is you need to fellowship with these people about God, and
              need to pray aloud. I feel as if there are many pair of eyes
              infront of me. At first I was uneasy, then I became very timid, at
              last I became phobic.</p>
              <p>my nightmares didnt end, it just started.</p>
