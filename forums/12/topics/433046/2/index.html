              <p>XiaoBunbun: Look, don't let them b@stards get you down. They've got their heads up their arses. If I were already a fxxking genius, then I should go dye my hair blonde and be heralded as foreign talent. You will meet many who compensate for their chip on their shoulder with a superiority complex. The prevaling culture of hypocritical meritocracy certainly does not help those who are unable to to conform to societal norms.</p>
              <p>Bear in mind, non-conformation does not immediately mean abnormality, but because the majority tend to comprise the typical idiots whose bullying you have experienced means life can suck for someone like you.</p>
              <p>Yet, there are many like you who do not conform. But you are not bound for a life of suffering. Success is your best revenge, and you need to stop crying over spilt milk and pick yourself up. Your self-defeated attitude is your worse enemy, certainly wallowing in self-pity isn't going to help.</p>
              <p>You claim you have absolutely no hobbies? Let's be honest, this is bullsh|t. I will concede that you may lack the confidence/incentive to want to do anything. If this comes to the point that you cannot get out of bed and prefer to have the curtains drawn, you need to seek professional help. Otherwise, let me suggest you learn Krav Maga or something similar. It's going to boost your confidence and they should cater to all levels of proficiency. If the kung fu arts are really not your cup of tea, are you able to learn a new skill or attend some course? You got to do something for yourself, because no one else will.</p>
              <p>Focus on the positive that is within reach, we look forward to your update.</p>
              <p>Godspeed.</p>

              <p>hi, I just want to let you know that you are not alone in this,
              I have also the same problem. Thing is I caught this so called
              "social anxiety" when I was in church. I alwayz feel anxious and
              stress when I am with the people there.</p>
              <p>My problem escalated when I was pressured to go to a cell group,
              it was even worst because majority of the people there don't use
              chinese which I am more comfortable with, they are mostly
              university grads, eloquent and have sound knowledge of the bible
              than me.</p>
              <p>I can't say I am truely a believer, and am painfully shy, worst
              things is you need to fellowship with these people about God, and
              need to pray aloud. I feel as if there are many pair of eyes
              infront of me. At first I was uneasy, then I became very timid, at
              last I became phobic.</p>
              <p>my nightmares didnt end, it just started.</p>

              <p>Tinker, Seroxat, the medication, is used by many with social anxiety and approved by FDA. Could u get a referrel to a psychiatrist to prescribe u that medicine. Caution: Seroxat can cause u to gain weight.</p>

              <p>You attract all <em>suay</em> things because your thoughts are always focused on those things.</p>
              <p>When something lousy happens, you think about repeatedly for a extended time.</p>
              <p>When something good happens, you think about it for a few seconds, then it is over.</p>
              <p>You focus on the <em>suay </em>things of your life, so even if your life is average or good, you think it is not good. This has become your habit.</p>
              <p>There are fat and plain looking girls that are cheerful and happy. Thats because they don't think like you do, and also not because life is good to them. But because they choose to be happy. From your post it can be seen that you choose to mope about your life.</p>
              <p>Someone has already told you, focus on the good things of your life, feel lucky, be grateful that you are better off than many others.</p>
              <p>From now on think along this line:</p>
              <p>I want to be____________.</p>
              <p>Fill the blank with something good. Like happy, rich, lucky, good, successful, etc. You must be specific and repeat and repeat in your mind all the time the whole day, not just for twenty seconds 1x and then give up. Do this and you will attract the things your mind dwell on.</p>
              <p>Mope all the time and you will find life unkind to you.</p>
