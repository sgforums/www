I just live it day to day.<br>I used to know this couple.. quite sick really. I don't know if i was jealous or something. both of them were in the same course. Same.. class, same project group. One of those that makes you sicccccccc.. Anyway, point is, she's gorgeous, smart, understanding, patient.. he's smart whatever blah blah. Couples like that just sorta rub it in your face isn't it?
