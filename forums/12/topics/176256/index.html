By right both of u shd have continued with ur own private lives. Yet she continued to ask u to wake her up. It seems as if she is using ur attached feelings to her and use u. Doesnt she have a device called an "alarm clock"? Does she really need u to call her? By right she should have not contacted u and so should u. She broke up with u at the lowest point of ur life with u left wondering what the hell happened. And u still think she's a good gal. A good gal with a good character will not do that even thou she's losing feelings for u.<br><br>No u have not learnt to let her go yet. Inside u still want her back.<br><br>Dude, delete her number and find a new gal. When u find a new one the old one means nothing.</div>
