            <div class='col-md body'>hmmm.. just from my POV kae.<br><br>being angry is inevitable.<br><br>try putting yourself in your gf shoes. imagine u going to chalet after your As and blah blah blah you used to like this girl blah blah almost got together. you think your gf won't be the slightest bit of angry or perhaps jealous?<br><br>you said she values her friends more than you. is it really true? imagine you're out with your guy friends. you think you can accomodate both your guy friends and your gf at the same time? we can't split ourselves into 2 and entertain both parties. naturally being her, she would want to join her friends rather than you. afterall, its her class chalet am i right?<br><br>she asked u along, maybe to show that she wants to be with u. but deep down do you think she really wants you to tag along? you'll be more like an obstacle for her during the chalet because she has to entertain you.<br><br>sorry if i sound harsh here or anything but i just wanna advice you not to go. if you want, probaly find her during the night that is if she has nothing on with her friends. maybe if they want go red house than she don't want go, yes.. this is the time where you should go accompany her at the beach and all. not in broad daylight go what wild wild wet or escape or what. sometimes its about caring for how she feels. this relationship cannot go in your way always. it has to go in her way too  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

But immediately she got 2chalet in 1 week. Of cos i was nt happy. Firstly is.. i cannot spend time v her. Secondly.. The person who open the chalet is 1 who she like last time. And they almsot get tgt. They got hold hand. But they nvr get tgt. I only noe this recently.<br><br>Then tmr i plan to go and ac her @ the chalet and stay v her @ the beach. Then she sayh ok @ first. But say they going wild wild wet @ 10. Then ask me go @ 1+. then i ok.. Then change and change again.. until 6+  i mean who will play inside from 10-6. Then somemore.. i ask her.. i tmr feel like going escape.. then ask her wanna acc me ma. But she say she dun like and her friend dun want also.

            <div class='col-md body'>no i don't think you are wrong but then i don't see it is as a valid reason to get mad over with.. at least for long. Since ur gf does not want you around, then let it be and see how ur relationship goes from here. Relationship don't work by clinging cos love is supposedly free-will. It can come and go suddenly and it can't be protected by being possessive cos girlfriend is a human being, not an object that you own.. means she got feeling, got her own social needs. It is not always about your right and privilege. Trust is built over time and required you to give benefit of a doubt to your girlfriend. Sometime, you also need to trust yourself to trust your girlfriend.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>No point going green over these.<br><br>Give her room. She just finished her most stressed chapter in her life and need to relax and bond with her friends - female and male.<br><br>But do not give room until like you do not give a damn la...show support, care and concern. Be on standby and understanding.<br><br>She needs to know that you are more than looks and 'ownership'. She has chosen the last time so she knows why she chose you. You need to reinforce that in building your character in general. Not being jealous and an asshole. Dun complaint. Share.<br><br>Look for your own programmes (thread carefully if there are MOTS - members of the opposite sex) but her know know so that you can manage each other's expectations. Learn a tune, play the guitar.<br><br>Never use force or ego to deal with these issues. Respect all decisions and growth together with her.<br><br>Even if things dun turn out. You still have a friend and a stronger character.<br><br>All the best!<br><br></div>
