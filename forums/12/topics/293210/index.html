            <div class='col-md body'>same prob bro my ex wholeday neglect me cause of her friends and she really nvr make time for me at all.my prob is the neglecting part. not the boy part. and she always change time like forever.and i mean every single time. anw we broke up alrand from my experience, this means that<br><br>1.her friends come first<br>2.she lost feelings for you<br><br>and this means that if you cant take this, means you are quite sensitive and have a lil trust issue right here. just like me in the past.means that the both of you arent really meant for each other lah. no point continuing. because its like you are sensitive and your girl just nice is that type of girl that doesnt show love or care for the bf.<br><br>IF you still wanna continue the rship,dont show her that you are sensitive to trivial matters like this,show her that you trust her.if not, im afraid i have this feeling you are gonna get dumped soon.<br><br>gdluck<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
