But immediately she got 2chalet in 1 week. Of cos i was nt happy. Firstly is.. i cannot spend time v her. Secondly.. The person who open the chalet is 1 who she like last time. And they almsot get tgt. They got hold hand. But they nvr get tgt. I only noe this recently.<br><br>Then tmr i plan to go and ac her @ the chalet and stay v her @ the beach. Then she sayh ok @ first. But say they going wild wild wet @ 10. Then ask me go @ 1+. then i ok.. Then change and change again.. until 6+  i mean who will play inside from 10-6. Then somemore.. i ask her.. i tmr feel like going escape.. then ask her wanna acc me ma. But she say she dun like and her friend dun want also. Then i ask her. <span style="color: red;">Wad if ur friend like it, and want to go? will u go? she say YES!!</span><br><br>I was like.. i was nt even as compare to her friend. Ask her go escape, she say she dun like and dunwant to go. and if her friend wana go, she wil acc them..<br><br>then y can't she play v them until like 2+ then come out and meet me?? y must she keep sticking to them?<br><br>i mean.. i go there was to acc her de.. but it look as if she was the 1 acc me..<br><br>i was feeling damn angry and sad... should i go tmr??<span style="color: #444444;"></span></div></blockquote>Honestly I'd be rather pissed if my gf were to say the words in red in that way. I'm not the insecure or possessive type, I'd let her club and all but I feel she should know better than to say sth like that to her bf.</div>

It's just another one of those countless relationships founded on <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic;">insecurity</span></span></strong> that is unlikely to withstand the test of time.<br><br>The guy's obviously bothered because he's insecure that he isn't getting the treatment he feels a boyfriend should deserve. The girl, on the other hand, isn't much better considering how much importance she attaches to her friends. There is obviously nothing wrong with having her own social circle; that said, in this case, she's obviously so desperate to pander to her friends to fit in that she is incapable of responsibly managing her time between her friends and boyfriend which prompted the guy to test her loyalty with the question you highlighted. That, perhaps, prompted her to respond in the manner she did to test his patience.<br><br>At the rate this relationship is going, what odds would you give for this to withstand the test of time?</div>
