Why? cause you've been giving in all the way, and you never tell him straight in the face..<br><br>I don't think you should go for a confrontation straight, perhaps just inform the others in your group of your predictament, or just don't invite him to future group outings.

            <div class='col-md body'>i have not confronted him because im still in doubt of whether thats the correct thing to do. but well all the while he absent himself from school frequently (like keep taking MC), so no current problems. and every lesson like chinese he will get called for detention to submit all the HW he owe. then me and my friends at the back will be laughing like "haha serve u right".  it's human nature, when u dun like somehow and he gets into trouble, naturally you will feel happy right?<br><br>apple:lol, i think ur case is diff because u r a girl (or i may be wrong coz i read ur post quite fast lol) and he is a guy. by insulting him infront of your grp of friends does inflict alot damage to him, but in a group of guys, it is VERY common to see people SUAN-ing pple constantly that you don't know whether which is sarcasm and not. it's not damagin and he may just ignore it.<br><br>i have told him " GO AWAY " before, actually many times. but he just ignores it. no matter how many times i say, as long as my friends don't say anything. they just give him the "go away" look, but it is not evident as they don't say anything. which im getting abit irritated also. they want to be straitforward, but don't want to be the bad guy. and im always being potrayed as the bad guy..., then he will give the innocent look like im bullying him. very wtf.<br><br>sorry if this has become more and more like a thread for me to rant about how irritating this guy is and how pissed i am.<br><br>the next time i will INFORM all my friends not to call him for any outing. they said " since it's class outing cannot dun invite him, i think not so nice lah....rite". in a trying-to-persuade tone. anyway that was a movie onli so it was ok. end of the year or something maybe i should organise a gathering in my house and clearly state that he is banned. and if he come i call the police?? lol.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi..haha..yes i'm a girl...<br>my friends dun like him too but they dun dare scold back, so whenever i scold back, i look kinda bad too. but i dun like to be hypocrite ar. like, if i really dun like a person, i will just show it in his/her face and i would refuse to talk to him/her too unless necessary.<br>hmm..another way is to ignore him ba. when he talk to you, pretend you never listen lor...then walk away. many of my guy frens do that to him..so maybe it might be relevant.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>No matter how you clarify now, ScapeGoat Token, you haven't answered the underlying issues I brought out in my 1st reply against you.  As I said, if you don't have a say in the outings, you can choose NOT to turn up.  If your friends wanna invite him to class gatherings, why should YOUR opinion override others'?  Besides, they're right in including him in class outings.<br><br>If you don't like him so much, just don't turn up, pure &amp; simple.  Nobody's forcing him down your throat, or holding a gun against your head, coercing you to go.<br><br>Having said all that, you're also Not completely free from blame.  You took cards from him, did NOT pay your friend, &amp; yet felt completely justified to do so.  That shows your character.  Since you have NO intention of paying your friend, then return him the cards, since you have NO means of proving your allegations that he stole your $.  Besides, circumstances somehow indicated that he did Not steal it.  You sentenced him without giving him fair trial.  Shows alot about your maturity.<br><br>Lastly, if you don't like this guy, then simply don't turn up.  If you wanna whinge &amp; rant, say so, I don't mind leaving you to it.  Right now, I just feel that you've Not been fair to your friend, when you obviously don't have the maturity to deal with things in a grown-up manner.<br><br>FeowFeow<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Scape_Goat_Token:</div><div class="quote_body">somethings to clarify:<br><br>my group of friends, invite him noy because they like him. they invited him because it was a "class" outing, so anyone from the class would be automatically invited. I had NO say in that.<br><br>my group of friends, some are neutral and some don't like him as well. especially from close friends. overall, his relationship is sour with our group of friends. but like times during recess he just comes and SIT WITH US. you don't expect us to move away right. on somedays he keeps quiet and finish his food, we ignore him. like cold war. but on some days he start getting noisy and start telling lame jokes and laugh at what other people say. everyone give him the "cold" look. but he don't care, and just "pretend" to be part of us. he recently start to flirt with girls from another class, and so maybe he didn't want other people to think that he had no friends. hence, making use of us. this is my assumption.<br><br>settle this with a game of darkness? haha, i admire your sense of humour. and it reminded me of one event, when i was sort of his "friend". ( we had the same interest, so obviously i clicked with him, until i found out about his character..., then things turned sour). we took part in a tournament in a small shop. i forgot the location. and somehow we faced each other in the first round. on the 3rd game (deciding game) of our game. he made a BLUNDER himself and wanted to redo it like 2 turns later. of course, it is OBVIOUSLY illegal to do so. he even called the judge over (aka the storeowner), thinking that he will side with him, because he was the one who brought me over to the shop and he was friends with the owner. again, this is an assumption. fortunately, the storeowner was FAIR and declared that my friend could not redo his mistake. i was of course relived. im quite vague about what happened. i remembered that defeated him in the game and he gave me the very PISSED off look. i got knocked out at the later round, and he became sour towards me, and start rambling sarcasticly about things like " see if i beat u in the first round i would have won", traits from a sore-loser. i beat him, whether i lose in the later rounds anot, its MY business. and he MADE A BIG FUSS ABOUT IT. each other time i meet him, i would always win against him, and somehow when among our group of friends we start talking about yugioh, he would get sour and rant about how lousy i am and how good he is..? something is wrong. sore loser, stuck-up...<br><br>about the deck of naruto cards. i admit i din handle it well. i am very SURE he took my 20 bucks, but well. i have no evidence. the reason why i did not take the instruction etc from him is because he claims he is playing it, and claims he knows japanese and wants to translate it. FUNNY, end up he did nothing about it. then he said he is goin to buy the other counterpart deck and play with me. i believed him, but it turned out to be a trap, and i got conned.<br><br>and one more thing, another interesting fact. during his sec 2 days he had no friends at all. and I, (yes me) introduced him to our group of friends. everyone didn't like him, because his like antisocial in our class (last time), and i was the one who goodheartedly persuaded everyone to accept him. but now i wan to kick him out. ironic. i gave him a chance, he ruined it.</div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What's the past is the past. Maybe you should just be more direct with him. Such as when he joins the group without invitation or what-so-ever just purposely move away. That should be obvious enough. Or just tell him off straight in the face.<br><br>But just a note. Your handling of the cards thing wasn't really the best anyway. And not matter what there is no concrete evidence of his being the thief, so don't bring that up again. Not that I don't believe what you said, but since there's no concrete prove, just let it go. Be the gentleman and put him in bad light instead.</div>
