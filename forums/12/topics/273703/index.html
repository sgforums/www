U can take that interpretation as she still interested in u or just real teasing. Are u still young? Why not u take a gamble and give a second shot this time.

We started SMSing each others and got rather close together Eventually, I liked her and we go out almost everyday and stuffs.<br><br>However, recently I told her that I liked her but was rejected. Though we never totally stopped smsing and meeting up, we seems to be drifting apart. Despite the chat we have over msn / sms, it seems that it's getting awkward.<br><br>Recently I started going out with <span style="color: red;"><strong>my other female friends </strong></span>instead. And, few weeks back, she started going out with this guy whom she know. If I'm not mistaken, it's her Primary School Friend. When I was with my other female friend, she will somehow tease me over SMS and stuffs. However, when she's with her male friend, I somehow missed being with her and stuffs.<br><br>I don't know if it's jealousy or envy. Can someone please advise?[/b]</blockquote>Yo, if gf is not changing underwear, then it should be changing bra.<br></div>
