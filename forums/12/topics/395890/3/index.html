              <p>you have feelings, ur friends also have feelings. But i guess the truth is cruel, everyone only wants the best for themselves.</p>
              <p>friends can be made easily but close friend cant. Made more friends is better rather than made more foes. why dont you settle with ur enemy first than with ur close friends.</p>

              <p><br>A guy want to know me, enemy likes the guy. I'm only normal friend with the guy. Enemy spread rumours about me to guy. Guy got brainwashed by enemy. Enemy became guy's girlfriend. My close friend and I used to be friends with enemy and the guy. Guy and enemy stopped becoming my friend. My close friend tried asking enemy and guy why they do such a thing to me, enemy and guy don't want to tell my close friend.</p>

              <p>Well Parn, I've been through much of this kind of situations.</p>
              <p>I have lots of guy friends. Many girls find me a threat. That's why I prefer to keep a few good girl friends by my side who don't share the same taste for guys as me.</p>
              <p>That gal sees you as a threat. And she is insecure, perhaps because of your great beauty or charisma ( just an assumption).</p>
              <p>You are not a victim. In fact you are the benefactor of your 'enemy's" 
              jealousy towards you. A gullible guy best suits a manipulative gal, give
               them your blessings.</p>
              <p>As for your "best" friend, downgrade her to become your "insider" friend.</p>
              <p>The best revenge is to live a better happier life. This "insider" gal friend of yours can be your bearer of news. Perhaps she enjoys being a double agent.. is she a gossipy type?</p>
              <p>Best friends comes and goes, you should be keeping more than one social circle. Never put your eggs in one basket.</p>
              <p>To trust a friend or not, depends not on how loyal she is to you, rather it's her personality/integrity that counts.</p>

              <p>The Enemy really a bitch. No reason to clear the misunderstanding, since she is the one who started all this crap first. Backstabbing people in the back really. And as for your friend. Make it clear to her that you dont like this enemy, however it is fact that you cant stop her from making friends with your enemy, since your enemy did not betray/ bitch your friend in some sorrt.</p>
              <p>If your friend is really a friend, then i guess she will avoid her when she is with you or something. Caring about your feelings, if no, then dump this friend into the dustbin</p>

              <p>Au contraire.</p>
              <p>It is <strong>highly selfish</strong> of you to expect your friend to take sides. While I still stick by saying that real friends care about each other's feelings, real friends <strong>don't</strong> take advantage of each other and <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">respect the fact that their friends are individuals</span></strong> of their own.</p>
              <p>You still don't understand why people here have lambasted you for being selfish. I don't mean to flame you, but you have consistently failed, throughout the whole course of this thread, to be rational and pragmatic about the whole situation. You think that friendship entails the obligation by one party to support another party regardless of the situation.</p>
              <p>Put yourself in your friend's shoes for a moment and stop thinking about your own needs. If you were your friend who has no bad blood between Enemy and you (let's call you OP) and are forced to give up or compromise the friendship with the enemy just because OP has bad blood with said enemy, then what about your own rights and freedom of choice?</p>
              <p>Don't you see that by childishly and selfishly <strong>demanding</strong> that your friends understand you to support you (regardless of anything) "because that's what friends should do", then I'm sorry to say that you, young lady (or gentleman), are terribly naive and deluded.</p>
              <p>You are too blinded by your selfish, superior sense of twisted loyalty that you have failed to realize the injustice of your actions. Before you even judge your friends... have you taken it upon yourself to judge your own character?</p>
              <p>In case you're not aware, there are actually people in the world who 
                          don't take sides out of loyalty. I myself have fallen out of friendship with many people, and still have friends who are friends with those I have fallen out of friendship with. While I am aware that it is to my disadvantage because I am only one person and the people I have fallen out with are aplenty, I cannot possibly force my remaining friends to take sides with me and abandon friendship with the other friends just because I need more people on my side. I have to respect them as individuals- on top of that, I have faith in them that they will not betray me for the other party, and that they will act in accordance with a mutually-beneficial, just manner when it comes to dealing with both sides. And for me, I am happy with such friends. I don't care if they are friends with the enemy, as long as the enemy is mature and doesn't play dirty, I won't resort to harmful or selfish methods to guard my existence and friendships. In a nutshell, I trust and love my friends. Do you?</p>
              <p>And that is why I said to you earlier- if you don't have enough faith in your current friends, then unfriend them. You also mentioned that your so called friends don't want to care to help ameliorate the situation, and that makes it even more logical for you to drop them. If they are true friends, they will care about your feelings and try to work together to a compromise. That doesn't necessarily mean that they have to give up their rights and freedom to friendship with anyone else, though, just so you know. If you still insist on having friends to do that FOR you... then I think people like them are better off without you, and you, better off without people like them. You can also take this opportunity to find your own circle of like-minded people and you guys can go selfishly support each other in vain and blind loyalty.</p>
              <p>If not, take this as friendly advice from someone who will predict your downfall should you continue to approach other people with such a selfish mindset.</p>

              <p>To trust a friend or not, depends not on how loyal she is to
              you, rather it's her personality/integrity that counts.</p>

We have enough shitty politics in this world as it is; we don't need to transform more irate individuals into scheming, manipulative people plotting each other's downfalls or spying here and there.

              <p>Au contraire.</p>
              <p>It is <strong>highly selfish</strong> of you to expect your friend to take sides. While I still stick by saying that real friends care about each other's feelings, real friends <strong>don't</strong> take advantage of each other and <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">respect the fact that their friends are individuals</span></strong> of their own.</p>
              <p>You still don't understand why people here have lambasted you for being selfish. I don't mean to flame you, but you have consistently failed, throughout the whole course of this thread, to be rational and pragmatic about the whole situation. You think that friendship entails the obligation by one party to support another party regardless of the situation.</p>
              <p>Put yourself in your friend's shoes for a moment and stop thinking about your own needs. If you were your friend who has no bad blood between Enemy and you (let's call you OP) and are forced to give up or compromise the friendship with the enemy just because OP has bad blood with said enemy, then what about your own rights and freedom of choice?</p>
              <p>Don't you see that by childishly and selfishly <strong>demanding</strong> that your friends understand you to support you (regardless of anything) "because that's what friends should do", then I'm sorry to say that you, young lady (or gentleman), are terribly naive and deluded.</p>
              <p>You are too blinded by your selfish, superior sense of twisted loyalty that you have failed to realize the injustice of your actions. Before you even judge your friends... have you taken it upon yourself to judge your own character?</p>
              <p>In case you're not aware, there are actually people in the world who don't take sides out of loyalty. I myself have fallen out of friendship with many people, and still have friends who are friends with those I have fallen out of friendship with. While I am aware that it is to my disadvantage because I am only one person and the people I have fallen out with are aplenty, I cannot possibly force my remaining friends to take sides with me and abandon friendship with the other friends just because I need more people on my side. I have to respect them as individuals- on top of that, I have faith in them that they will not betray me for the other party, and that they will act in accordance with a mutually-beneficial, just manner when it comes to dealing with both sides. And for me, I am happy with such friends. I don't care if they are friends with the enemy, as long as the enemy is mature and doesn't play dirty, I won't resort to harmful or selfish methods to guard my existence and friendships. In a nutshell, I trust and love my friends. Do you?</p>
              <p>And that is why I said to you earlier- if you don't have enough faith in your current friends, then unfriend them. You also mentioned that your so called friends don't want to care to help ameliorate the situation, and that makes it even more logical for you to drop them. If they are true friends, they will care about your feelings and try to work together to a compromise. That doesn't necessarily mean that they have to give up their rights and freedom to friendship with anyone else, though, just so you know. If you still insist on having friends to do that FOR you... then I think people like them are better off without you, and you, better off without people like them. You can also take this opportunity to find your own circle of like-minded people and you guys can go selfishly support each other in vain and blind loyalty.</p>
              <p>If not, take this as friendly advice from someone who will predict your downfall should you continue to approach other people with such a selfish mindset.</p>

              <p><br>I can accept the fact that you do not have any true friends in your lives. And you constantly need to suppress your own disappointment by convincing yourself that you cannot be selfish.</p>
              <p>I don't blame you for what you have posted. True friends are rare, and for people who don't have true friends would never experience or know the meaning of ä¹‰æ°”. Not referring to those violent gangster type of ä¹‰æ°” please, but ä¹‰æ°” in the name of friendship.</p>
              <p>It's amusing but also sad to know that it is so possible for a person's biased opinion of another can actually influence and distort his outlook about life itself.</p>
              <p>Many people doing the wrong things or not doing the right things, still doesn't make up to one right thing to do. Many wrong opinions doesn't compares/equal/come close to one justice opinion.</p>
              <p>I am a true friend to all my friends, and they would never misunderstood me like you and many others in here.</p>
              <p>I think you just need true friends in your life that's all. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
