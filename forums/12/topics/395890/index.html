              <p>If you have such little faith in your friend, then unfriend her.Slowly stop hanging out with her or something. She'll get the hint soon enough.</p>
              <p>Otherwise, if you want to salvage the friendship, tell your friend how you feel about what's happening, how it is affecting you and see what your friend says. If she is adamant in getting you to let go of the past, then she's not a real friend who is compassionate enough to care about the situation.  A real friend will take the effort to care about your problem and come to a compromise. to help both parties. <strong>Friends care about each other's feelings. </strong></p>

              <p>It's so easy to say kind words such as "let it go", but how to
              let it go when I'm the victim...silently and quietly bearing with
              all these nonsense from my enemy in the past.</p>
              <p>I'm very nice to all my friends, would do anything for
              them...almost anything. But I'm feeling so sad and depressed that
              my friend would rather allow me to feel worse than helping to find
              out why my enemy did all those things to me and why my enemy said
              all those things about me in the past.</p>
              <p>Rejection from a friend disappoints, but a rejection from a
              close friend killed my heart and it's very painful and sad
              everytime I realised what a fool I have been to treat her like my
              close friend.</p>
              <p>What if she go and tell my enemy or anyone about my secrets?</p>
              <p>I think I will go kill myself if I'm being blackmailed by her in
              the future.</p>
              <p>I cannot defriend her and I cannot bring myself to befriend her
              anymore and I'm really feeling very trapped.....so very trapped
              right now and I really don't know what to do.</p>
              <p>Been crying myself to sleep for the past 2 days ever since it
              happened.</p>

              <p>parn take it easy...true frens are hard to find and there people who appreciate you who what you are. just that you haven't find that person yet.</p>
              <p>And dun ever think of trying to commit suicide. You are quite fortunate to survive one attempt and may not survive another.What would happen to your love ones and those who appreciate you as a good fren? won't they be devastated?</p>
              <p>well...if you cannot friend or de-friend her, why not plot to make ya fren de-friend you enemy..?<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p>Just another words : I am always waiting for you to bare ya heart to me..</p>
