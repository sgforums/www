              <p>Theres some irony in your second paragraph really. Debating too hard there. Stop thinking too much ba. if you are unconfortable seeing her and your enemy, just dont stick too close to her. Anyway to your friend. Both you and your enemy are her friends. So its hard really.</p>

              <p>Stop thinking too much ba. if you are unconfortable
                                      seeing her and your enemy, just dont stick too close to her. Anyway
                                      to your friend. Both you and your enemy are her friends. So its
                                      hard really. Just like choosing do you want your dad or your mum.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway if your friend is sensitive about your feelings, i guess she will avoid your enemy when you are around. Or if you are just too mindful then stick lesser to your friend</p>
