              <p><br>Because the enemy and her boyfriend are also friends with my close friend, so she will invite them to go out with my other friends who don't know my enemy and her boyfriend.</p>
              <p>I just feel sad when I realised that my other friends are also going to be introduced and associated with my enemy and her boyfriend in the future.</p>
              <p>So I hope my close friend can help me to resolve this incident that has happened in the past and I can also move on and accept my enemy and her boyfriend again as my friends.</p>

              <p><br> I can accept the fact that you do not have any true friends in your
                  lives. And you constantly need to suppress your own disappointment
                  by convincing yourself that you cannot be selfish.</p>
              <p>I don't blame you for what you have posted. True friends are
                  rare, and for people who don't have true friends would never
                  experience or know the meaning of ä¹‰æ°”. Not referring to those
                  violent gangster type of ä¹‰æ°” please, but ä¹‰æ°” in the name of
                  friendship.</p>
              <p>It's amusing but also sad to know that it is so possible
                  for a person's biased opinion of another can actually influence and
                  distort his outlook about life itself.</p>
              <p>Many people doing the wrong things or not doing the right
                  things, still doesn't make up to one right thing to do. Many wrong
                  opinions doesn't compares/equal/come close to one justice
                  opinion.</p>
              <p>I am a true friend to all my friends, and they would never
                  misunderstood me like you and many others in here.</p>
              <p>I think you just need true friends in your life that's all.

              <p>Since it's impossible for you to know whether or not I have true friends or not... then what you said has to be construed as either a personal insult, or you are genuinely a deluded person, living in her own world where her rules reign supreme.</p>
              <p>Interestingly, you mentioned 'you cannot blame me for what I posted'. Judging by your previous posts as well as what you've written, I notice that you seem to have great faith in your presumptions of me based on your own twisted perspective of the world, and perhaps, even past experiences.

In that case, I really am dealing with an irrational, genuinely deluded person.</p>

              <p>Bolded red part. Have YOU tried to understand your friends aversion towards taking sides?</p>
              <p>You so EASILY come up with a factory standard reply, citing all this bull about 'motivation from deep in the heart' etc. when all you really are is just a selfish girl who wants her friends to stop fraternizing with her enemy, COMPLETELY forgetting the fact that said enemy has nothing to do with her friends.</p>
              <p>You still are unable to understand the notion that you're trying to control your friends' actions, which makes you a big fat, selfish hypocrite.</p>
              <p>You claim that if friends feel uncomfortable or enslaved doing something for another friend or if there is a clash of interest, a true friend will understand.</p>
              <p>What kind of understanding have <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>YOU</strong></span></span> ever given to your friends who don't want to make enemies with your enemy? What kind of a person are you to demand them to listen to you while you completely ignore what they want and THEN cry bloody murder?</p>
              <p>It's not that they're not understanding you, girl. You're crying foul because they are not FOLLOWING your orders. You're a control freak. You think your opinion is more important than the opinions of others. You think that just because you have legitimate reason not to do something, you expect your friends to do the same, and then you come and cry in a forum because they're not being 'understanding' and 'caring' enough to follow your orders.</p>
              <p>Which is why I said... ditch those friends of yours. With their attitude, they're not going to be useful or so-called "true" friends to you because they're not going to follow your orders.</p>
              <p>You obviously don't need friends. What you needs are followers. Go usurp Obama or something and take over America. You'll find TONS of willing people at your disposal for your orders.</p>

              <p>Bolded red part. Have YOU tried to understand your friends aversion towards taking sides?</p>
              <p>You so EASILY come up with a factory standard reply, citing all this bull about 'motivation from deep in the heart' etc. when all you really are is just a selfish girl who wants her friends to stop fraternizing with her enemy, COMPLETELY forgetting the fact that said enemy has nothing to do with her friends.</p>
              <p>You still are unable to understand the notion that you're trying to control your friends' actions, which makes you a big fat, selfish hypocrite.</p>
              <p>You claim that if friends feel uncomfortable or enslaved doing something for another friend or if there is a clash of interest, a true friend will understand.</p>
              <p>What kind of understanding have <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>YOU</strong></span></span> ever given to your friends who don't want to make enemies with your enemy? What kind of a person are you to demand them to listen to you while you completely ignore what they want and THEN cry bloody murder?</p>
              <p>It's not that they're not understanding you, girl. You're crying foul because they are not FOLLOWING your orders. You're a control freak. You think your opinion is more important than the opinions of others. You think that just because you have legitimate reason not to do something, you expect your friends to do the same, and then you come and cry in a forum because they're not being 'understanding' and 'caring' enough to follow your orders.</p>
              <p>Which is why I said... ditch those friends of yours. With their attitude, they're not going to be useful or so-called "true" friends to you because they're not going to follow your orders.</p>
              <p>You obviously don't need friends. What you needs are followers. Go usurp Obama or something and take over America. You'll find TONS of willing people at your disposal for your orders.</p>

              <p>Omoshiroi. Hontou omoshiroi.</p>
              <p>Allow me to point out the reality to you that you’ve failed to see. I’ll
                          call them… “Points you’re blind to”, or, PYBT.</p>
              <p><em>QUOTE: “Why must people be so selfish because they wanted the best of both
                          worlds by being my friend and the friend of my enemy?”</em></p>
              <p><strong>PYBT #1:</strong> You label your friends ‘selfish’ based on the presumptuous premise
                          that they “want the best of both worlds”. <span> </span>By phrasing it in such a manner, you make it
                          seem as if they never had any choice (to be friends with your enemy) in the
                          first place, which, by the way, is what you really believe in, which of course, is the reason why you've been called selfish/control freak.</p>
              <p>Refer to the
                          following:</p>
              <p><em>QUOTE: “It's not selfish at all, since they are my friends then I expect
                          them to stand by me as I am expected to stand by them in times of need.”</em></p>
              <p>At first glance, it’s even something I personally believe in. However,
                          extremists like yourself enjoy… liberal misinterpretation. You took it a step
                          further to mean that because they are your friends, they are expected to ditch
                          that enemy of yours because it is an act of support, or, as you’ve put it, “standing
                          by you”.</p>
              <p><em>QUOTE: “Then all my other friends will also slowly become the friend of my
                          enemy if my close friend went to invite my enemy to go out with my other
                          friends.”</em></p>
              <p><strong>PYBT #2:</strong> You don’t see it, but this sentence screams of paranoia and insecurity,
                          brought about by a lack of faith in your friends. You talk about not treating this using a robotics analogy. You're treating your friends like chess pieces, as if the moment they become friends with your enemy, you've lost them. Doh. Talk about irony desu... Deny it all you want, but to
                          the rational, discerning mind, it’s as clear as day for all and sundry to see.
                          Not that it’s a terrible thing though. I can empathize with your paranoia and
                          insecurity, because I am only human. I’ve been through that before too, but it’s
                          important that one realises it and acts on it.</p>
              <p><em>QUOTE: “Worse thing is when my friend doesn't want to help me to clear up
                          all the injustice that I have experienced from my enemy and tell me it's been
                          so long ago already and I should just let it go. It's so easy to say kind words
                          such as "let it go", but how to let it go when I'm the
                          victim...silently and quietly bearing with all these nonsense from my enemy in
                          the past.”</em></p>
              <p><strong>PYBT #3:</strong> Let me guess- were you bullied by your enemy? Made use of? Been
                          subjected to evil deeds? It must’ve been really tragic, hmm? There, there.
                          *pats* However, whatever that has happened between you and your enemy is
                          between you and your enemy. It is unfair to bring other people into the
                          equation and expect them to follow what you tell them to do. Maybe you have
                          your friends’ best interest at heart so that they don’t get played by your
                          enemy like you were, or, maybe you’re just selfishly holding on to this
                          vendetta against your enemy and don’t want your precious friends that you would
                          do anything for to be (possibly) brainwashed by your enemy. After all, it would
                          be horrific if your hao peng you all switched sides, no? Which is why I
                          reiterate again- let them go if you don’t have faith in them not to betray you.
                          Sides, you’re such a neurotic nervous wreck yourself, it’s better to save
                          yourself the heart pain caused by your wild imaginations rather than face up to
                          reality and handle the problem like a matured person, yes?</p>

              <p><em>QUOTE: “It's not selfish at all, since they are my friends then I expect them to stand by me as I am expected to stand by them in times of need.”</em></p>
              <p>At first glance, it’s even something I personally believe in. However, extremists like yourself enjoy… liberal misinterpretation. You took it a step further to mean that because they are your friends, they are expected to ditch that enemy of yours because it is an act of support, or, as you’ve put it, “standing by you”.</p>

              <p><strong>PYBT #2:</strong> You don’t see it, but this sentence screams of paranoia and insecurity, brought about by a lack of faith in your friends. You talk about not treating this using a robotics analogy. You're treating your friends like chess pieces, as if the moment they become friends with your enemy, you've lost them. Doh. Talk about irony desu... Deny it all you want, but to the rational, discerning mind, it’s as clear as day for all and sundry to see. Not that it’s a terrible thing though. I can empathize with your paranoia and insecurity, because I am only human. I’ve been through that before too, but it’s important that one realises it and acts on it.</p>
