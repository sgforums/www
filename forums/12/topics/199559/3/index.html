            <div class='col-md body'>I'm sorry to hear that such a terrible thing happened to your loved one. I believe your gf really loves you as she has opened up and told you about the incident. Throughout this one year that you have been with her did you notice anything weird about her behaviour? eg. avoiding certain places/activities, gets disturbed when something/someone is mentioned? Maybe these incidents can help you understand everything better.<br>I think you should not say anything about this until she brings it up again. OR if you see that it is still bothering her. Try to let her open up and tell you about the painful incident. Don't force her. There are many things to consider in such a case.<br>Legal wise, there is a Statute of Limitations. This determines how long a perpatrator can be held responsible and punished in a court of law. It starts when the crime is commited. I believe it is more than 4 years for statutory rape. So if she was hurt by someone she knows/knew, he can still be brought to justice. However, evidence will be very difficult to gather. Afterall, it has been 4 years since the incident.<br>Health wise, HIV infection is just one of the problems you should be thinking about. There are many types of STDs that can affect her (and you, if you have been intimate with her) and many can be transmitted through means other than penetration. (Oral sex, petting)<br>My opinion is that you should speak to her about it when the time comes. Professional counselling is always an option provided she is willing to open up. And one very important thing. Since you have taken the first step and asked for advice, you have shown that you really care about her. So, love her wholeheartedly. Be the emotional support she needs.<br>I hope everyone's advice helps you in some way or another. Best of luck^!<br>(",)</div>
