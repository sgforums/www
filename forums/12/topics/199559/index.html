Rape isn't something to be taken lightly, and no advice on a forum site can ever take the place of professional counselling.<br><br>At the same time, the best thing you can do for her is to be a strong pillar of support for her to lean on. Don't talk to her about the incident unless if she brings up the issue first. And once she talks about it, offer to send her for professional counselling.<br><br>I'm sure there are lots of services out there for these sort of things - AWARE might be a good place to start.

Just encourage her to talk more and more whenever she brings up the topic. You can do that by asking her questions and asking her to clarify and asking her about the details. Just don't tell her shut up about it already. Let her in her own time and she herself will get sick of talking about it.</div>
