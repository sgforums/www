              <p>Hi All,</p>
              <p>I'm contemplating on quitting my job which i have worked for four months. However, i will like to seek a second opinion.</p>
              <p>1) Incident 1: Last week, "A-person" send an email accusing me of something and the way he wrote was very nasty. This incident really make me very angry till today. However, i cannot confront him on the matter or clarify it in email due to several complications.</p>
              <p>2) Incident 2: I have told "A-person" the reason why i didn't pick up his call last Saturday because i was on course. But on last Friday, "A-Person" told me that "he don't care." and expected me to go down to settle this Saturday. In my opinion and in my industry, no one (in my position) actually need to go down for such a trival matter. After the phone conversation, i'm really piss off because according to my contract i don't work on weekend and the way he said "he don't care".</p>
              <p>3) Incident 3: He is very cunning. He never stated things black and white but only give verbal suggestion. So If anythings went wrong, it will still go back to me. The best thing is he will forget what he says and give another direction which is really making things difficult.</p>
              <p>4) He don't trust people and so he insist that i have to go down. Indirectly, I'm overload. Then i start to taichi abit. But i feel i'm already burn-out and losing my patience. I don't have time and energy to do what i should do and he can bit me back.</p>
              <p>I will like to ask : if you are in my shoes, will you quit or will you endure for a few more months? But i have to look for a new job and i'm lost in what i should do.</p>

              <p>Deciding whether to quit depends mainly on how much you like your current job to give a damn, and how much the job pays you.</p>
              <p>Do you like your current job alot? So-so? Anything? Don't know? Think about this first.</p>
              <p>Next, after deciding how much you like your job, whether you like it or not, think about the pay. Is the pay really good? Is it average? Does it satisfy your needs well?</p>
              <p>If you don't care about either points, just go with your gut feeling. And if you still ultimately decide to quit, you might want to bite him back once just so you don't have the remaining feelings that you quit in vain.</p>

              <p>Hi, i'm not really at a higher position than him. We have a different working relationship in a different company but managing the same project. He is client but not at the higher management level. Also I can't treat the way he treated me because he is a client. I have found him becoming unreasonable and pushing all theresponsibilities to me which can beyond my job scope.</p>
              <p>And yes you are right. why should i quit if i'm not fault but i don't want to endure there kind of treatment for the next 15 months because he is a very difficult person to deal with.</p>

              <p>Hi!</p>
              <p>In reality, I think you should get a job before you quit. Why suffer because of such a person.. At least if you can find a job outside already then u won't have to worry about money even if you quit.. I have seen a similar situation in my work place as well.. 'A' is also thinking of quiting because of what her boss is doing to her... but she really needs the money.. so she's also comtemplating whether to quit or not.. as she's under so much stress now.. but well.. sometimes we often do have a choice.. to endure or to quit.. Personally, I think you should endure...</p>

              <p><br>Hi, Im very sure that i don't work on saturday by contractual terms. Sometime, i have to endure his "mood". When he is good mood, he is okay. When he is in bad mood, he can be unreasonable and does not care about other people's position. He already send in email saying that my team and me are incompetent but i feel it is a whole tons of bullshits.</p>
              <p>Basically, i feel very stressful working with someone who can be unreasonable, who push work to me and not letting me to do my job properly. I can forsee that in the future months, things will be progressing into a very difficult situation. I am asking myself: Why do i have to put up with someone like him. I don't deserve such treatment and i don't have to be builled. I know i have to find a way to deal with him. But I have bascially been working from 9am to 10pm for the past few weeks.. and even on saturday.. and i'm burn-out right now and even more furious when "A" said he don't care. wtf.</p>
              <p>And you did mention something that was on my mind.. what about my long-term career objectives.. will it harms if i just quit like this. Will my mentality grow to be i will just quit if i don't  like so and so.... this is what also worrying me.. maybe i will just endure and in the end, be scarred by the whole ordeal or become stronger but is it worth it? i don't know.</p>
              <p>Maybe i will not quit just like that. Maybe i will give it two months or so.. anyway economy is not good now despite reports saying so.</p>

              <p>I think you will get stronger from this incident... Whether is it worth it or not really depends on you.. Go where ur heart tells you to go..<br>If one can be in the management, they literally have low EQ... so as employees, a lot of times, we can just endure just because we need our resume to look good and so that we have the money to sustain in this realistic environment.</p>

              <p>Since he is a cilent. It is very very RIGHT for you to send him an email with all the job input by him and ask him to confirm it via email back. NO verbal. If he said dun want.

              <p>Just wondering is this the first few jobs you are in?</p>
              <p>Well, i know you don't deserve this treatment, but then again in any other job you bound to face people like this. I believe all jobs have their own difficulties and perhaps your job difficulty is to face client's crap.</p>
              <p>Client always changes, so just complete this and get on with another. Just cope with stress till the end of your project?</p>

              <p>Hi All,</p>
              <p>I'm contemplating on quitting my job which i have worked for four months. However, i will like to seek a second opinion.</p>
              <p>1) Incident 1: Last week, "A-person" send an email accusing me of something and the way he wrote was very nasty. This incident really make me very angry till today. However, i cannot confront him on the matter or clarify it in email due to several complications.</p>
              <p>2) Incident 2: I have told "A-person" the reason why i didn't pick up his call last Saturday because i was on course. But on last Friday, "A-Person" told me that "he don't care." and expected me to go down to settle this Saturday. In my opinion and in my industry, no one (in my position) actually need to go down for such a trival matter. After the phone conversation, i'm really piss off because according to my contract i don't work on weekend and the way he said "he don't care".</p>
              <p>3) Incident 3: He is very cunning. He never stated things black and white but only give verbal suggestion. So If anythings went wrong, it will still go back to me. The best thing is he will forget what he says and give another direction which is really making things difficult.</p>
              <p>4) He don't trust people and so he insist that i have to go down. Indirectly, I'm overload. Then i start to taichi abit. But i feel i'm already burn-out and losing my patience. I don't have time and energy to do what i should do and he can bit me back.</p>
              <p>I will like to ask : if you are in my shoes, will you quit or will you endure for a few more months? But i have to look for a new job and i'm lost in what i should do.</p>
              </div>

              <p><br>1) Is A-person your boss? If so, you will have to do your "bestest" and listen to him. When I say your "bestest", make it look asif you're doing your job but you must be smart to cut corners without getting caught. If A-person is not your boss nor big boss but some other manager of a dept or a customer, then can hang him lah, who cares.</p>
              <p>2) You don't have to tell himoff all the things you feel, as long as you have done your job within the time stipulated, you have done your job.</p>
              <p>3) You also can be cunning, if he cause trouble, you just taichi back to him. So as long as he is not your boss or big boss.</p>
              <p>4) Do what you can, do your best.</p>
              <p>After 4 months you quit? That is bad for your resume, in your next job, the new employer will sure ask the former one for reference checking. Use your wisdom. Take the challenge, once you accept a job, commit at least 2 or 3 years. If you still disatisfied or unhappy that the situation haven't change, then it is time for change. Working is no longer an enjoyment, you got to do what you got to do. Take responsibility. If you feel you are troubled by your job, plan ahead what you want to do, while working in your current job.</p>

              <p>TS....</p>
              <p>Goodness your 1st post and 2nd post required 180 degree response.....in the first place i suggest you asked yourself why are you in the industry!!!!  He is your "Client" </p>
              <p>I shall answer your question in 4, 3, 2,1</p>
              <p>4) if your client don't trust other people and insist you to go along that is because he placed his trust on you and your client is "paying you for the service"  You are an idiot to "Tachi" under his noise. instead of looking how to improve your efficiency you waste your energy on how to GET OUT.....</p>
              <p>3) Your client project manager give verbal instruction so you reply by E-mail  as referred to our phone conversation these are your understanding of the instruction bla bla bla............copy your supervisor and his supervisor cover your ASS. protect your Company Interest.  hello.....u got wake up or NOT????</p>
              <p> 2) Solved the problems first before going in to address expectation of scope of services but YOU CAN ALWAYS CHARGED OVERTIME.  How do you turned down a paid client? When you take up a project management post?  There is no such thing as a "Fuck Care" mentality. </p>
              <p>1) never put your emotion in front of others, Coolness will give you political advantage when you need it. You can always response by e-mail in steps and point regards to your client discontent of service and what solution you provide.</p>

              <p>2) If you know that you shouldn't be workin on Saturday, then don't work on Saturday. Why trouble yourself with people who "don't care"? If you have the resolve to quit your job, then you have nothing to lose if you don't turn up on Saturday.</p>
              <p>3) You should worry more about what you want and who you are. Don't focus on other people because they are up to no good.</p>
