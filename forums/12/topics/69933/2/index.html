You guys are doing fine so far! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Okay, seriously.  Hmm - tough one.  The real problem seems to be that he doesn't want to talk about it.  Don't pressure him into saying anything - if he feels that he needs to say something, he will if he has confidence that you will LISTEN to him.  Don't go offering a solution to everything he says, because he may feel that you're cutting him off before he's had the chance to finish what he's saying.  If he gets frustrated because of that, he'll clam up and stay that way for a good long while.  If he gets stuck, one handy trick is to summarise what he's said and tell him your summary.  If your summary is accurate, he may agree and carry on talking, knowing that you're really paying attention to what he has to say.  If your summary is incorrect, he may correct you and carry on talking, and at the same time, by thinking about it, he may be able to clarify his thoughts.<br><br>I'm going to have to read through this thread carefully again, but first, how long ago did his gf die?  What was his reaction at the time and in the week following her death?  You need to get an idea of where he is in the grieving process.<br><br>I agree with choco B's post - your pinning high hopes on him is probably not going to do him any favours at this time because it will just put more pressure on him.  The best thing to do is to let him know that whatever the circumstances are, his positive qualities are still there.  Think about what he's good at, and invent a situation in which you can ask for his help, utilising those skills.  That might help highlight his positive qualities and give you something to get started with, at the same time letting you avoid patronising him.<br><br></div>
