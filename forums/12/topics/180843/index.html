Some places which you hated like pubs, KTV? If yes, just tell them. I have told my friends I won't go to these places, so if they intend to, they will leave me out. If they are going to restaurants, coffee shops, etc, just go. No harm will be done. Besides, going there to just drink coffee won't kill you. Take it as a chance to socialize, to know them. Don't stay at home and rot. Not good for health.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
