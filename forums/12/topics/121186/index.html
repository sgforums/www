Try not to quit and join another company just because they pay better in any temp job. Cos who knows...the company might turn u perm after they see how u work.<br><br>And don't forget...just keep applying for jobs. No harm...try for everything that is in those job sites (online)...<br><br>Best of luck!</div>

I think the economy has not recovered yet, as there is not much jobs at the career fair. There are only hotel, teaching, ministry of home affairs, social worker positions only. The rest are educational booths.  But up till now, no one has called me to go down for interview yet. Now I can only buy newspaper tomorrow and look out for customer service  jobs.
