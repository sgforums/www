A dilemma of both wanting and not wanting to open the envelope, afraid of the contents; fearful of the consequences; aware of the potential heartbreak..<br><br>He refused to acknowledge that his appearance got to do with his retrenchment.. For all the years he served in the company, he had placed the company interest ahead of his.. many times, he work from sun-rise to dusk before he would call it a day..<br><br>Finally he muster enough courage to open up that envelope..<br><br>The luxury of hope was gone.. It was as certain as the sun-set; as surely as the neatly written words he had read over and over again in the past half an hour..<br><br>He let out a sigh that was filled with pain and regret..

            <div class='col-md body'>Woah.... aint you getting a little defensive here, homie.... I mean com'on, as his "best friend", instead of helping him change his image to improve himself, you are actually letting him continue to do wat is considered a disadvantage to him. Some "best friend" you are.<br><br>Cat-walk?? Nobody wans him to do the cat-walk at orchard road. If he cant carry himself right, I tell ya, he'll even have a hard time getting job even if he'd got a doc cert, not to mention getting anyone attention. So think about wat u said, kiddo. And in a courtship, everything counts, and I mean everything. Would you go dating with a guy/gal with bad manners, digging nose, speaking loudly, big, fat smelly stinky, lots of pimples and acenes on his face... and bad breathe. Before you can answer, touch ur heart, THEN answer.<br><br>And if you are really his "best friend", help him get a make over. The quote saying, "making the society fit you instead of you fitting the society" are not meant for us humble commoners, in another words, bull-crap. We have to blend ourselves to the society in order to survive in this hush world, tatz wat makes us strong.<br><br>I'm not saying tat your friend is weak, nobody is weak, itz one's will tat is weak. If wan to help ur friend survive in this world, then help him, open to suggestions, try them out, instead of arguing with everything we "kindly" suggest you COULD DO TO HELP HIM. Geez.... Women.... once you get to know them, they can be terrible creature, messing with your mind man!!<br><br>Forgive me but, from your last paragraph, you describe him as if you worship him, why dun you be his gf for a change. No?? You dun wan to?? Or you are simply not INTERESTED? There you have it, ladies and gentlemen, she's not interested. Then help him for goodness sake. Turn him something tat could turn you on. If it succeed, he'll be thankful, not to us, babe, but to you, his best friend.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by caramon:</div><div class="quote_body">A post to answer all questions.. NO I am not him.. anyway thanks to all forumers who contribute: from those with constructive solutions to the more tact-less, thanks for your time..<br><br>What I am thinking aloud is how could ladies who often lament about the lack of " Nice" guys when my friend Peter, is so "alive" and readily available.. I feel sad not because he's not happy with the way his life is at the moment but a guy like him deserved better..<br><br>To change his appearances in order to get attached is plain absurd.. what does todays girls sees in a guy anyway? Looks? it defeat the whole purpose of being in a dating game, don't you agreed? So models with the ability to cat-walk and flaunt his/her looks deserve a chance to a relationship..<br><br>Peter with a readily smile to almost anyone, is humble, kind-hearted to the extend of being cheated, someone who you would trust but will never get a second look among the crowds, is being shun upon by local ladies.. Lack of assertiveness maybe a flaw in todays society.. being not "man" enough may not sound right.. But, is he a monster, a beggar, or a fearful creature? NO, he's not.. he will always be my best friend, as the heart he carries is more "beautiful" than anyone else..</div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You're a guy!?!? Ouch... sorry.... *salutes*<br><br>Hey... not say every lady judge by appearance, I meant "1st impression", my brudda. Appearance is PART of 1st impression, as it also made up of many things e.g. how one carries oneself, good personality... etc etc etc.<br><br>Not to discriminate fat guys but, I've seen these big bruddas getting model-like babes for gf. They dun look good, their figure is outta shape, they cant show off their bodies in SunSet Bay. But why they still got those babes into their arms? The answer lies not only in their appearance, but how they carry themselves, how they "present" themselves to the ladies, how they humour them, how they interest them. And yes, they are daring, and they are not afraid to fail.<br><br>For married men, "Nice" is not the word to use here, the word to use is "steady-ness". Nice, anyone can be nice, can pretend to be nice, can act nice, talk nice, feel nice, but not every guy can be "steady". "Steady-ness" takes time + cultivation, this watz makes them stand out from the competition.<br><br>You friend is nice, but "nice" is not enuff, my brudda. He has got to learn how to be "steady", like the unmoveable Mount Fuji. I'm too at the learning stage, itz not easy. I think itz time to wake ur friend up. And dun give me tat "the rest can't make it" bull-crap. There's no guy in the world who can't make it, it depends whether he wans to do it and make the change. If he doesn't wan to change, I'm sorry brudda, he dun deserve anyone. No such thing as free food free drinks in this world with no effort made.<br><br>Dunno whether you guys get where I'm going, but good luck to you singles out there!! Time to wake up and have confident to show ur sexy buttocks to the world, eehhh... but dun follow until like Steven Lim like tat lah... a little too extreme. Hee hee!!!<br><br>If I'm wrong in any-way, please correct me. I'm learning to be "steady" too.<br><br>Cheerz my bruddas!!<br><br>Itz Tiger time!!<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by caramon:</div><div class="quote_body">Please lah..
