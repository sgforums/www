Ouch... sorry.... *salutes*<br><br>Hey... not say every lady judge by appearance, I meant "1st impression", my brudda. Appearance is PART of 1st impression, as it also made up of many things e.g. how one carries oneself, good personality... etc etc etc.<br><br>Not to discriminate fat guys but, I've seen these big bruddas getting model-like babes for gf. They dun look good, their figure is outta shape, they cant show off their bodies in SunSet Bay. But why they still got those babes into their arms? The answer lies not only in their appearance, but how they carry themselves, how they "present" themselves to the ladies, how they humour them, how they interest them. And yes, they are daring, and they are not afraid to fail.<br><br>For married men, "Nice" is not the word to use here, the word to use is "steady-ness". Nice, anyone can be nice, can pretend to be nice, can act nice, talk nice, feel nice, but not every guy can be "steady". "Steady-ness" takes time + cultivation, this watz makes them stand out from the competition.<br><br>You friend is nice, but "nice" is not enuff, my brudda. He has got to learn how to be "steady", like the unmoveable Mount Fuji. I'm too at the learning stage, itz not easy. I think itz time to wake ur friend up. And dun give me tat "the rest can't make it" bull-crap. There's no guy in the world who can't make it, it depends whether he wans to do it and make the change. If he doesn't wan to change, I'm sorry brudda, he dun deserve anyone. No such thing as free food free drinks in this world with no effort made.<br><br>Dunno whether you guys get where I'm going, but good luck to you singles out there!! Time to wake up and have confident to show ur sexy buttocks to the world, eehhh... but dun follow until like Steven Lim like tat lah... a little too extreme. Hee hee!!!<br><br>If I'm wrong in any-way, please correct me. I'm learning to be "steady" too.<br><br>Cheerz my bruddas!!<br><br>Itz Tiger time!!<br><br></div></blockquote>What do you mean by steady???</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Different pple may explain the meaning differently but, this is wat a "steady" man meant in my opinion.<br><br>A "steady" man is independent, he is resourceful, thoughful and earns enough to feed both himself and his family. He solves problems maturely and in a rational manner. And yes, he is committed... to his lover. Well, a good example, is ur dad. A good person to ask about him... is ur mum.<br><br>Mayb some of u pple have a better example... like friends getting engaged, u can ask them too.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by SeraphimX:</div><div class="quote_body">What do you mean by steady???</div></blockquote></div>
