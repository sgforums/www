            <div class='col-md body'>I have a friend who must be the sweetest, shyest person in the world.. His name is Peter, his age modestly 27.. He is rather short and skinny, has a thin moustache and even thinner hair on his head.. Since his vision is not perfect, he wears glasses: they are small, round and frame-less..<br><br>In order not to inconvenience anyone, he always walks sideways.. Instead of saying 'Excuse me', he prefers to glide by one side.. If the gap is so narrow that it will not allow him to pass, Peter waits patiently until the obstruction clears.. On the MRT, If he manages to take the seat, he never gives it up to anyone, but the moment he sees a woman with a child in her arms or a weak, elderly person climb on board he immediately stands up..<br><br>He has never interrupted anybody during a conversation.. On the other hand, he can never manage more than two words without somebody interrupting him.. This does not seem to irritate him.. Because he is that " Nice."<br><br>However, he is still single.. All his life, he's never been in love.. Not that he don't want to, but simply because he was never presented a chance by local females.. The sight of him makes a lot of them ran away at the first instance..<br><br>Not that he mind though, he enjoyed the solitude and quiet reflection being single has given him.. Wait a minute, doesn't every girls dream of being with a " Nice" guy ? I can't helped but feel sad for my friend..<br><br>Many of them claim they just want to date a nice guy, but when presented with such a specimen, they say irrational, confusing things such as Â“oh, heÂ’s too nice to dateÂ” or Â“he would be a good boyfriend but heÂ’s not for meÂ”..<br><br>Yet, they continue to lament the lack of "Nice" men in the world..

            <div class='col-md body'>There's a difference between being "Nice" and being "Different".<br><br>"Nice" is never a good label for a guy.  If a woman commented that a guy is nice, most of the time it means that he is just a friend and no more. When a woman commented that you are a nice guy, she's telling you this, "Try harder, you idiot.", or "We are nothing more than just friends."<br><br>When a woman says that she is looking for a nice guy, it means the other opposite. Not a bad guy, or a complete jerk, but someone who knows how to turn her on and keeps her sparks and anticipation going in her attraction mechanism, as well as raising the sexual tension within her, causing her to be attracted to that man.<br><br>Women look out for a few things: -<br>1. Eye Contact<br>2. Body Language<br>3. Verbal Communication (How you tease or make her laugh)<br>4. Anticipation (whether the guy knows about this)<br>5. Character and Personality<br><br>I shall end my briefing here to let you digest what I've mentioned. Of course, there're many more to know and remember but this is only the tip of an iceberg.<br><br>S.H.I.N.</div>
