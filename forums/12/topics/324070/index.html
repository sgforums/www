              <p>TS, learn to be whole first, before you find a life partner. if you enter a relationship without being whole, there will be alot of problems. your needs will suffocate her, and vice versa.</p>

              <p>Fan87, don't think of loneliness, never for once allow that thought to seep into your mind. You are never alone, you have your family who loves you and relatives around you who cared for you.</p>
              <p>You think of what you are feeling now, you can decide what you want to be feeling right now.</p>
              <p>And there's nothing wrong with girls out there :p, girls are also like guys....we're humans too you know. </p>
              <p>I would suggest you to step into a church on a Sunday and you will feel blessed and fortunate that you took this step to break away from your Sunday routine.</p>
              <p>Your life will never be the same again, and it is up to you to make your life exciting, sexy, comfortable, challenging, righteous...and mostly importantly fun and original. :)</p>

              <p><br>No venture, no gain.    Understand that males don't cope that well with loneliness as compared with females.    Go clubbing, do sports, go gym, chat on line, go movies, reading, so many things you can do to pass time.  </p>

              <p>99.99% of the time we are thinking I this, and I that. Why me, and such. " I "  all the time.</p>
              <p>When your thoughts are focused on yourself, and only yourself, very soon your brains will feel stuffed. Think out. Focus away from yourself, your guitar, your duties, your subordinates. Be helpful to others.</p>
              <p>As for relationship, let them come, when they come. No one is pressing you on this, except yourself.</p>

              <p>2 ways la</p>
              <p>1) humans are solitary creatures, they have the instince to live alone</p>
              <p>or if u really want a companion</p>
              <p>2) if u like someone, don't dilly dally and daydream</p>

              <p>Being single is like so cool la. I just broke up recently. Can't say that I am not sad but when you are single comes freedom and more time to do more things and go out with more friends. Making new friends is important. Most of the stuff I learnt like diving la cello la is all when I just broke up then faster go learn de.</p>
              <p>but if you really wanna get a girlfriend, dont be afraid, just wait for the right one to come and then slowly make you way up from as simple friends then close friends etc.</p>
              <p>When you feel lonely be like me. I will go for a 15km run. Force yourself to finish and then you all not have anymore energy to think somemore le. Hope it helps.</p>
