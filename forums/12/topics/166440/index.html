            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Pup,<br><br>First of all, a big hug to you.  I've gone through this before, &amp; at the time, I'd thought that my parents were contradicting themselves.  But after I'd come out to work, I realised how difficult it is to earn money.  You're milked to the fullest for every cent the company pays you, more often than Not.<br><br>So parents wish to instill in you what they've learnt.  To them, $180/- is too big a sum to splurge on computer games, when later in life, you probably will get sick of your PS2 set.  They're also worried that you may splurge in future on unnecessary things instead of stuff you really need, or saving for a rainy day.<br><br>Even up till now, after earning my own money, my parents still nag at me about buying jewellery (according to them, I should save up to buy a pair of 2ct total solitaire earrings instead of buying tiny little things that people can't even see).  To appease them, &amp; now that I understand why they nag at me like this, I've stopped buying that many, that often.<br><br>When you come out to work for real, &amp; you can't rely on your parents anymore financially, you'll understand why your dad is so upset now.  Learn to look beyond the scolding, &amp; the good intentions underneath.  And when your dad has cooled down, tell him that in future, you'll discuss these expenses with him before going ahead without approval, but he has to listen to what you have to say.<br><br>FeowFeow<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by StarPuppy:</div><div class="quote_body">I dun really understand what my parents are telling me...they often tell me..if i enjoy something and if its of a reasonable cost...weigh pros and cons and if pro is better...buy it<br><br>I have learn to take things easy...<br>have..good lor<br>dun have...never mind...dun moan over it/ save up for it<br><br>now i spend $180 just to modify my PS2...and my father is like very upset...<br>i know..its a big amount but i saved it up and i am deciding to earn it back..thats why i am looking for a work<br><br>i dunno why hes so upset about...its not like i am a "pai jia zhi" or wat...<br>most of the times...i control my eating spending...i dunno why hes so upset about<br><br>~+Cheers+~<br>StarPuppy</div></blockquote></div>

To spend it on games which they would think is a waste of time. would be 'heartpain' to them.<br><br>i used to think this way like you too... till i am working n  not staying with them, n you have to pay n buy every single ting you can name it.. from toilet paper to insecticide...<br><br>sometimes, i think back n felt that what i had longed for when i was younger was actually unnecessary...n a waste of $.

Sometimes we say things which we didn't mean to hurt.  Sometimes we don't know how to handle, we end up doing stuff that hurt.  At the end of the day, you know it was meant well but perhaps the approach not so appropriate.  As long as you believe that you dad meant well, I think you can swallow this better.<br><br>Understand us.  It is not easy either.  Just have to learn each day to live harmoniously among ourselves.  Everyday is a learning experience.  Particularly if it is a new experience/matter/issue, sometimes we may not know how to handle.  We all have to work at it.<br><br>Take care and cheer up.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> </div></blockquote>no offence, but parents always make mistakes.</div>
