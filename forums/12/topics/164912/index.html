            <div class='col-md body'>Maybe it's just a song and nothing else? Try not to assume too much, as things might get complicated. Anyways, you have only broken up for awhile, and I think there could be still chances that she's still thinking of you; it's not as easy to really forget about someone as saying it. I guess you just have to work hard to get her back again if that's what you really want =) Jiayou!</div>
