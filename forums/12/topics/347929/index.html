              <p>True that I have not met this woman before. However I am a woman too. I felt that my dad is very inconsiderate. He talk abt having someone to take care of his needs....how abt this woman's needs. She still not aware of his health condition yet. He said, this woman has a child who is getting married. Forgive me if I m making assumption but that child don't want to take care of her own mother. Here come dad, who take pity on her, then both end up my place. He felt sick, she not that young also. So who exactly shouldering responsibilit?</p>

              <p>hmm. my relatives also going through something like this.</p>
              <p>personally i don't think it's a matter of "right and wrong".</p>
              <p>it's only natural that you feel defensive against a stranger coming into your life, and you see her as a threat.</p>
              <p>in a way - yes i agree that in that aspect, you are selfish, but who can blame you for it? since you took care of your dad and your mum for so long, there is an invested interest.</p>
              <p>just like when i suffered quite abit before my parents became christians, then suddenly catholics appear and try to tell my parents catholics are better or "more correct". </p>
              <p>of course i got angry.</p>
              <p>so firstly.. i want you to understand that, it's not your fault for feeling this way. you shouldn't feel condemned.</p>
              <p>there's nothing wrong if your dad wants to get marry, the issue is whether he's marrying a good woman.</p>
              <p>there's also nothing wrong if you don't want your dad to marry, because you have invested your life into caring for him, and you don't want to share, it's only a natural respond.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>hi dumbdumb. thanks for your comment. I do agree partially what you said. I do wish to make clear to you and everyone, currently in my heart I don't have a problem he marry another woman. The problem I cannot accept the fact that he and his new wife staying with me and I as his daughter knowing that his health condition is deteriorating and there is another new elderly in the house. How can personally I accept this? I can foresee what is coming in near future for both them. Why do i wish to burden myself with this catastrophe? I worked damn hard for my whole life until I manage to buy this flat by myself, with one intention, my parents will have a shelter above their head and taking care of them in whatever way till they die. It is really really frustrating.</p></div>

              <p><br>Yes you are selfish.</p>
              <p>Taking care of your parents is not an obligation and neither it is a choice. It is your DUTY to take care of your parents as they have taken care of you since you were brought to this world.</p>
              <p>And the 7 years spent for taking care of your Mom is not a sacrifice because there is no way you can ever bring her back even if you want to trade your 1:1 lifespan for her.</p>

              <p>Seriously, how can one knows she is a good woman. It takes a man many yrs to know his own wife, more so in this case. Another tricky concern that I have, said, he get married but he did not live long, this woman is going to be rich. As a daughter, I have never taken his money. Surprisingly this woman will get and for free. I am not cursing my dad but I look at all angle.</p>

Being the eldest daughter, I am also the breedwinner in the family. Life has not been easy. Both my parents are not educated but my late mom has high hopes to send me to University. Every morning for 25yrs, i helped my mom sold her kueh. When she was diagnosed for heart and kidney prob, i am the one sending her to and fro to hospital for her appointment and dialysis centre. I never complained as I know what I can do to help her is insufficient compare to her sacrifice to make me who I am now. Now she is gone, I take care of my dad as I know how. I went to see his specialist checking on his condition, taking same diet as him, bring him out when I have time.</p></div>

              <p><br>Good, then you deserved to know the answer to your worries.</p>
              <p>Advise your Dad to consult a lawyer to prepare and craft out a <strong><span style="color: #0000cc;">Prenuptial Agreement </span></strong>for your step-mom to sign before or prior to the wedding.</p>
              <p>There is nothing much you can do if your Dad want to have a will to give your step-mom some financial benefits, but that will be into the future and I think you should at least give your step-mom a fair go first before you judge her further. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>there's nothing wrong if your dad wants to get marry, the issue

              <p>Seriously, how can one knows she is a good woman. It takes a man
              many yrs to know his own wife, more so in this case. Another tricky
              concern that I have, said, he get married but he did not live long,
              this woman is going to be rich. As a daughter, I have never taken
              his money. Surprisingly this woman will get and for free. I am not

              i don't see how you are selfish...you have no obligation in taking care of your dad's needs just as you too have your own needs...if your dad wants to marry, then he has to sort out his own future and not lay it all on you....this is not about being chinese, it's plain common sense...
              
              you have your own right to live a life of your choosing too....i would find it acceptable if your dad remains widowed and you support him but if he marries, then he should think how he wants to support his new family...
              
              so don't feel too guilty over wanting to live your own live too....

              <p>Lovey,</p>
              <p>Don't let your father or anyone put you on a guilt trip.</p>
              <p>It is indeed a child's obligation to take care of his/her parents, and what you have done so far has achieved that and way beyond what a parent would have expected of any children of theirs.</p>
              <p>But , you are not obligated to take care of a stranger's mother.So if your father wants that woman to move in, then it is only reasonable that she pay for some expenses or simply call it rent.</p>
              <p>I don't think it fair that she gets to freeload on your expense.</p>
              <p>Companionship doesn't happen only after a marriage. But it is your father's personal choice.</p>
              <p>There's only one wrong.. that I see in your situation .. and perhaps the reason why your father got angry with you.. is that you criticised his personal choice.</p>
              <p>Who gets his inheritance is also his personal choice.</p>
              <p>As a child.. I think it's not right to expect any form of compensation after the death of your parent/s.</p>
              <p>Even if he decides to will all inheritance to a charity or a dog/cat , it is his personal choice.</p>
              <p>If you get a cent.. be thankful... if not.. then so be it.</p>
              <p>Have you discussed with him.. what will happen after his death ? Where will the woman go ? She can't possibly continues to live with you. I know this topic is a hard one to broach.. you may need some good timing and lots of tact.</p>
              <p> If you are worried about the legal implication of your father's new marriage on your personal assets in the event something terminal happens to you, then it is time you go and get your final Will done.</p>
              <p>Another alternative is a family Trust fund.</p>
              <p>I'm not too sure how the laws works in Singapore, and I don't seem to get much information from the internet.</p>
              <p>But it may be worth the while to find out if you can set up a Trust fund and  appoint your sister as the Trustee to manage/oversee the assets you want to leave to your father.</p>
              <p> A Will/Trust fund, can provide a peace of mind. The sooner you get this done.. the better it is for your own sanity.</p>

              <p>Hi jojobeach. Thank you for your advice. I feel that you really understand me. When I mention with regards to his money, it is not something I am wanting or some called it inheritance.  The thing abt his money/asset is just a small issue. I am concerned what will happen in the process he get sick, where money is flowing out for medication and treatments to the point of his death? It is not abt where the woman will go only but how in later part where my dad is sick, how he is going to feed her?</p>
              <p>For your infor, Dialysis treatment is a sickness of the rich. Per haemodialysis cost around $200 to $250 does not include eprex (injection to increase red blood cell) which cost $60-$80 per jap. Most of the time patient can go 2 or 3 times a week. My late mom goes 3 times a week for 7yrs. I have not include the 3mths once to specialist for consultation and collecting medication every mth which mounted to $400 per mth. On top of all this, must put aside extra cost in the event got admitted to A&amp;E due to infection. So you can calculate how much my family have spend for 7yrs during the time my late mom having dialysis. Me and my family able to go thru that period due to me, my sis, my dad are still working and my parents sold of the 3-room flat to help pay the cost. But now is different, my sis is married and she has her own committment. My dad has retired. I am the only person working.</p>
