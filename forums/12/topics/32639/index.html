            <div class='col-md body'>Mooku has a classmate from one of her subject classes.<br><br>The classmate is a girl, mild-mannered, lonely, always with a sad look on her face.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>At first when Mooku got to know her, Mooku was very nice to her because, -apologetically- Mooku pitied her not having friends to talk to.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>But then as days went by, Mooku realized that the girl began to stick to her like glutinous rice. During lessons, the girl would always come and sit beside Mooku.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> (Aiyah.

But then, she ALWAYS comes to sit with me and ALWAYS wants to be in the same group as me. I feel like I have no freedom. I want to group with other classmates so I can get to know them better!! But the girl is an obstacle.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>And also, in class, she always talks about irrelevant matters and things that only she thinks are funny. If she's a bright and cheery girl I wouldn't mind. But she constantly has this depressed look on her face, it SPOILS my day. And her talking is affecting my concentration in class.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>She's queer. She doesn't bring her notes. She skips lectures. And tries to make it sound like "Did you go for lecture? Aiyoh why do you have to go? Look at me! I don't have to go for lectures and I still pass the subject!"<br><br>I know I really sound mean. But I think I've had enough of being nice. Her sticking to me is really making me feel uneasy. I'm not the only one in class who thinks so.<br><br>From the start of the new school term I have been making it obvious by trying to avoid her and not talking to her as much. But she doesn't seem to get the hint!<br><br>I don't want to tell her to go away because, still, I feel a sense of pity because from my observation, she's really lonely and needs some friends.<br><br>How can I stop her from sticking to me, and at the same time, not hurt her feelings?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"></div>

She's the sort of girl who isolates herself from the rest of the world. And also, she doesn't care much about her appearance so it's hard to get guys to like her especially with her eccentric temper. I don't know which friends I should introduce to her because 1) other than during GP class, I don't speak to her because we hardly meet. 2) nobody in my GP class likes her, which means even MORE nobody in my circle of friends will like her because my friends are... well, entirely different from her and are the kind who will not spend time trying hard to get to know someone who's always so depressed and unfriendly, inactive, unparticipative etc.<br><br>If one day she can really find more friends, I would really really be happy for her.

She's always reading a book whenever I see her.<br><br>Guys... She doesn't seem interested. She seems more interested in her novels.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>I don't know anyone else of her kind... That's why it's so hard for me to introduce friends to her.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>I think I am selfish. In this case, at least. I cannot bring myself to really talk to her and find out what is wrong with her because it is very very difficult to find a way into her heart. If it were at other times, I would have at least tried. But I simply cannot at this moment because right now, I have my own problems which I am trying to fix. I don't know where to find anymore energy to help this friend.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"> </div></blockquote>Don't always think about helping her... If she wants to, she probably can 'help' herself... It's an attitude thing... Though she might have been 'disturbed' in the past in some way to have caused her to be like that.... I say if you're interested, why don't you just try to know her better for a start...?<br><br>As for how she's sticking too much to you... Just let her know that you need your own space even as friends.... In a nice way... Don't add unnecessary comments... Let her know that she's not specially treated like that for certain reasons... It's just not you to be mud in like that....?<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Regards~</span></div>

I have a feeling that she looks down on other people also!! Like for example sometimes when she doesn't bring her notes again, she'd be sharing it with me. Then say we're reading some comprehension passage, she'd finish reading and ask if I was done even though there wasn't any page to flip to. And once I asked her how come she so fast, she said "I speed read lor. I always do that when i'm reading novels." -___-" And remember I mentioned that she skips lectures and acts like she didn't need them to pass..?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well i have been in such situations b4...many times...my most memorable is that this guy in my poly came to join our club..then he goes around wanting to perform JUDO stunts and moves (maybe due to hi korean descent)on everyone he meets in the club...ours is like a christian body..so no one really knows about JUDO...everybody avoids him and he irritates alot of pple and some fear that he might just come up behind and perform those moves....<br><br>well i befriended him...got near to him, told him nicely what he did wasnt nice, that not everyone thinks the same way as him, and that there must be a certain amount of respect for each other if we are to stay as friends.  Performing such moves are both a disrespect to the physical and mental and also invading their privacy. well, after a few of such toks, he cut down quite alot..though not totally...<br><br>my suggestion to you, is that be assertive, get ur message across, let her know u are her fren but also let her know how she can be a better fren to you.  Do not worry about hurting her unless you are out to attack her straightaway, she  may feel hurt, buts its really up to her to respond.  Also find out why she may be this way, show some understanding towards her situation but be firm on your stand...<br><br>If she responds well, d o help her along.<br>if she does not, as with many people i tok to and counselled, its better sometimes to leave them alone and let them learn the hard way. really.<br><br>God bless.</div>
