              <p>Hi FusionWave, I was in your situation before. I too had a JieJie who was my collegue. She treated me as her bro b'cos she wanted to be close frens in that way and maybe also i kinda resemble her own bro in a way and I was also less than year younger than her. Anyway, I actually liked the "bro - sis" frenship we had as I was the only child at home. But eventually i started to develop feelings for her. And I tried what i could to stop having those feelings. Used to bang my head against the wall at times. This went on for a year while we were still frens. She sensed my feelings and wanted to distance away from me. At that time, I knew it was all going to end and cant even salvage frenship. I told her my feelings, she got terrified and that was all. My contact with her ended. It was actually a life turning event for me. It happened 3 years ago and until today, i blame myself for losing the frenship with such a nice person. I wished that no other guy shld fall into the situation i had but was saddened you are also facing this. I do wish she will change her feelings towards u but she might not. Follow wat the others said in this thread -  keep your options open, get to know other girls and yr feelings for her will change and both of u can be good frens. Dont worry yrself too much buddy.</p>

              <p>Hi folks, im new to this forum so i guess i'll just post the
              first one of my problem.</p>
              <p>I am 17 this year and like all of u guys out there. i have
              someone i'm interested in. Just one small problem, she is my
              jiejie. Fake one. I always talked to her and we're really close
              frens.</p>
              <p>It came to this stage that i made my feelings clear to her. She
              told me that she likes another guy and always sees me as her DiDi.
              She added that she wants to be there for me always and care and
              concern for me like a special sister.</p>
              <p>I dont want this. I wan her instead. but i know i cant force
              this kinda thing. well to love a person is to let her be happy
              right?</p>
              <p>well she is happy but i dont feel happy still.</p>
              <p>Just to share my story. I believe many people have some similiar
              experience right?</p>

              <p><br>FusionWave, what is more important to you? The happiness of your "sister" or your own happiness?</p>
              <p>If you're a man, show her your love by supporting and respecting her decision in her life. Even if you can make her fall in love with you, do you think she will truly feel happiness when her life has been robbed by your selfish possessiveness?</p>
              <p>However, if she has decided to love you on her own choice, wouldn't that tell you that this relationship is truly blessed?</p>
              <p>If your own happiness is more important to you, then I would encourage you to let her go cos you will end up enslaving her for your own selfish possessiveness.</p>
              <p>Don't feel terribly attracted to her cos she's the only female that gives you the most attention in this moment in your life. You will only end up destroying your current relationship with her.</p>

              <p>Hi folks, im new to this forum so i guess i'll just post the first one of my problem.</p>
              <p>I am 17 this year and like all of u guys out there. i have someone i'm interested in. Just one small problem, she is my jiejie. Fake one. I always talked to her and we're really close frens.</p>
              <p>It came to this stage that i made my feelings clear to her. She told me that she likes another guy and always sees me as her DiDi. She added that she wants to be there for me always and care and concern for me like a special sister.</p>
              <p>I dont want this. I wan her instead. but i know i cant force this kinda thing. well to love a person is to let her be happy right?</p>
              <p>well she is happy but i dont feel happy still.</p>
              <p>Just to share my story. I believe many people have some similiar experience right?</p>

              <p>time heals. when it's time to let go, u should. no point torturing urself over it when she herself is not affected. i've experience it before, i know how painful waiting is.</p>
