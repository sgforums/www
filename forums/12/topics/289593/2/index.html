It is called mothering not loving in the girlfriend sort of way. Now if he does not call you for a few days, he will be in the wrong. However if he does not sms you for a few hours , that is not wrong - he needs space to breathe. Even the police don't start searching for a person unless he/she is missing for at least 24 hours .<br><br>To you , it might seem that what a few others and I are saying are wrong.

It is called mothering not loving in the girlfriend sort of way. Now if he does not call you for a few days, he will be in the wrong. However if he does not sms you for a few hours , that is not wrong - he needs space to breathe. Even the police don't start searching for a person unless he/she is missing for at least 24 hours .<br><br>To you , it might seem that what a few others and I are saying are wrong. That's fine- you came here seeking opinions and we gave you ours.<br></div></blockquote>I understand what you are trying to say. But I too hope that you will understand the kind of seesaw of emotions I am experiencing right now and that my point of view might differ when I am 'ok'.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Anyway it is just an sms - A small thing to get upset with <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>err.. he wants to go out, need to report to u? Got any <strong>real</strong> safety issues when he steps out of his home? Don't u think it is a bit illogical here...<br><br>If u require him to sms u whether he is not home or whether he is with anyone or where he is it is still called.. controlling.. tsk tsk<br><br>I understand that <span style="font-style: italic;"> he has promised u </span> and that why u feel worried when he didn't reply. Perhaps u can hint to him that you were worried for him but do it in a calm and cool matter. However, do not expect him to apologize to u or demand a reply and do not get angry with the matter..<br><br>cos frankly, it is a small thing and guys usually do not take into account such small things. He probably will find you bothersome if u persist on..<br><br>Unless there has been some sort of dishonestly in the past, perhaps, i can understand the insecurities current beneath the relationship.<br><br>But then woman are mostly insecure emotional being..<br><br></div>
