The problem lies when it is forced upon, like sometimes you really really forget, and she kicks a big fuss about it and breaks up with you. Do you do that to your parents? If you do not, they are not important? How about your siblings? IF like that, everytime you go out, you sms your father, your mother, your brother, your sister, you girlfriend, your girlfriend father, your girlfriend mother, your girlfriend brother, your girlfriend sister?<br><br>Ok lah, you're a guy with no problems okay? or those who dont inform their girlfriend are people with problems.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>if i feel like telling i will tell, which most of the time i will if they ask. But sometimes I'm doing serious stuffs as it will affect my chain of thoughts and I just read the sms and told myself to reply later which I would usually forget in the end if its not urgert. So I like that forget = she not important to me? Isit I must report then call good boyfriend?</div>
