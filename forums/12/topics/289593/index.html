But he doesnt seem to be trying AT ALL. He knows that I will be worried, we have argued umpteen times because of this matter. Why cant he just develop the mindset that I will be worried? I would rather he tell me. It just irks me a lot. Is it THAT difficult?</div>

Trust me guys hate these kinds of girls, they call them control b*tches. If you want to stay in relationships I really strongly suggest you stop.</div>

I would continue assuming that he is busy at home when maybe he is already on the way to heaven.  If he's at home, the chances of him falling into a mishap would be much smaller or practically zilch. And if he's not replying my sms, I would know that he's asleep/doing stuffs at home.</div>
