If you try to go ALL THE WAY to help this sort of person or partner, you could be VERY EASILY drained to the MAX where not only would the relationship break down.. But also you would... There're also partners who might not be consciously doing such things... Some of them are just so depressed or sort that it'll not be practical for you to 'go all the way' unless you're really adequate enough to help or unless you're a professional..<br><br>However, it would normally not be advisable to turn a blind eye to your partner's needs as it would be too high a risk to take... There could be some possible solutions to the cases mentioned above, but if in any case where you cannot handle your partner of the above metioned type... It might be advisable for you to just leave them (the mind games and play victim type) or refer them to someone more capable of helping them eg. a professional (in the case where your partner is under depression)...</div>

You see the potential in the person without the drugs and thus the treasuring.<br><br>What the person is really happy about? To be further trapped in the poisons of drugs? Or to leave the world of drugs? This you have to know and then decide which one can make him happy.<br><br>If the person is too hooked unto drugs and you cannot bear to see the pain in that person, maybe... temporary you don't say anything about telling the person to stop drugs or something BUT that is not the solution. To really care for the person's feelings not only involve current situation at hand but also in the future - meaning what's best for the person in life, in spirit and what the person can be at best.<br><br>You may have to harden your heart and be tough on the person because you know drugs is not good and it has to be stamped out.<br><br>2: someone hurt from past relationships<br><br>Understanding the person and his/her/it's past relationships will give you a good insight of what the person has been through. Knowing where to tread and when to stop can help you to detect possible unwanted complications and being sensitive towards the person.<br><br>Normally a person so hurt from past relationships will have hesitations and fears towards the next potential relationship. It is up to you to tell that person that every relationship is different. You also have to tell him/her/it that you are serious about it. You decide this and stick with it. Do NOT just go ahead and in the possible future decide he/she/it is not the one for you for you have already broken his/her/it's heart again and you are guilty for that.<br><br>Once showing him/her/it your commitment and putting faith into this relationship will help to tell the person your seriousness and you want to make a difference in that person's life. There are so many different ways to care for the person. To show concern for the person's well-being and such. You get the idea.<br><br>The only thing the person last want is to read your lips saying on going back on your words.</div>
