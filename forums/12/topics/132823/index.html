            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Mecha,<br><br>You sound quite young from the way you write, &amp; since you're still in school, I shall assume you're in your middle to middle-late teens.<br><br>You need to understand girls at this stage.  Many have just started entering relationships, &amp; they have the idea that everything should be roses, their bf should be like a knight in shining armour, carry their files, wait for them outside school, the standard Taiwanese drama stuff.  It's also a need for them to compete &amp; compare with their peers, are their classmates/friends' bfs waiting for them, showering them with soft toys &amp; silver bracelets, etc.<br><br>However, you're also just starting to enter relationships, &amp; your character is such that you feel "paiseh" to wait for her outside her classroom, you're hesitant to play the "dashing knight".  There's Nothing wrong with that, in fact, I'd say it's normal.<br><br>There're many more experiences you'll have to go through, none of us really stop learning about love &amp; relationships.  However, there's still so much more for you to learn, why settle for someone whose needs &amp; wants are different from yours?<br><br>Some are lucky enough to stay with their childhood sweethearts to the very end, most of us are Not.  Just take life as it comes, don't need to try so hard.  Nobody can ever say what's in store for us.  If I ended up with my teenage sweetheart, would I be so happy &amp; fulfilled today?  It's difficult to say : )<br><br>FeowFeow<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Mecha_bOi:</div><div class="quote_body">haiiz sorie guys..this is quite a long one<br><br>deres this girl i've broken up with after we were together for a few months..when we first broke up..we entered the " awkardness" phase..where i wud siam whenever i see her coming and try not to get in her way or sumting den on msn..we didnt really tok to each other much until these few months( wich iz lyk a yr after our breakup.yaa..i noe i suck )den after much thought i gathered the courage and asked her if she wanted us to be together again...den she said she was afraid it wud turn out juz lyk the last time( im nt sure if she rejected me or not)..n told me the reason she broke up wif mi last yr<br><br>she said i did nt take initiative..yupp i sorta agree..dats wad i felt too..im a shy person in nature la..so i didnt lyk..example:go her class find her lyk most couples do(scared paiseh)..i was wishy washy abt stuffs lyk wich movie to watch n everything..  and all..and i tink its v hard to change dat.. yet..i can try..bt the fear of it happening all over again iz holding me back..i still haf very strong feelings for her n dun wanna disappoint her..so guys..shud i go ahead..or juz let go..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> </div></blockquote></div>
