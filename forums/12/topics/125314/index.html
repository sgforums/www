You depend too much on your bf. But how are you relying too much on him? Financially? Or you're always spending time with him, day and night? You find that this relationship is changing you into something you do not desire? You want to love, yet you want to experience many other things. He has already mentioned that you should not rely too much on him. You want to get back to your friends, but they are busy with their relationships as well. So you find it difficult to resort to any other activities other than spending time with ur bf.<br><br><strong>Moi Suggestion</strong>: I would suggest you call up your friends, and organise some activities with ur friends along with their partners. Going out in only a pair will restrict the level of activity and often than not, you'll end up in the same routine over and over again. Hence, by inviting your friends and their partners over lunch, dinner or a movie, it will allow all of you to have a more interesting and intelligence conversation and interaction. And in this way, you can get to meet the other guys(ur friends' partners).<br></div>

Why don't you give the relationship more time, give your bf to prove his worth and that he can change for you. Let him know how you feel, talk alilttle about the future and hear what he says and comment on those as well. Do heed my suggestion. You do not have to leave him immediately, but at the same time, your options are open, and you can see what is it in other guys that is missing of him. Mayb a new guy will come along, and has better prospects and makes you feel just as comfortable with him, you'll never know.<br><br>At the end of the day, you should decide either to pursue your love for him regardless of the insecurity he gives, or leave him for the better sake of your future.</div>
