Simple Girls are hard to please)<br><br>Its true that most times <span style="color: blue;">Guys</span> give empty promises just to make the Girl happy in the short term(<span style="color: red;">aka get the Girl first, worry about danger later on, thats why most times in a breakup, you see the Girl crying and the Guy shaking his head! Cause, he did'nt realize what he got himself into</span>) but wait till the longer term does he know he is a goner.<br><br>Its true that <span style="color: blue;">Guys</span> tend to have the lower expectations and higher hopes. (Why? Cause if the Girl did'nt meet his inital expectations, Guys would'nt have gotten into a relationship with the Girl in the first place, higher hopes is that the Girl will get prettier and 'grow' bigger =P)</div>
