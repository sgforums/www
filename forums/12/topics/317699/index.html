              <p>just graduated, and my sec sch frens jioing me to go grad trip to US free and easy. But my gf wanted me to go BKK shopping trip with her instead. I'm not keen at all with the BKK trip, cos already went with her in January this yr. I'm more keen on the US trip. so i suggest to my gf to go with me to US. initially she was v reluctant, cos US more expensive than BKK. But i manage to persuade her.</p>
              <p>then after we bought the air tickets and such, problems resurfaced. she told me she actually dun like free and easy. she preferred to sit in coaches and live comfy hotels. but ppl free and easy usually live cheap hostel or 4-5 ppl squeeze one hotel ma.</p>
              <p>then she expect a lot of shopping during the US trip. but the US trip we planned has more sightseeing and adventure than shopping. and she is not happy. and i cant possibly asked my guy friends to change the itenary to a more shopping one.</p>
              <p>so i tried to tell her not to go, as I already foresee that she will be unhappy for the US trip,  but she still insist on going. how ah? what u all think i shld do? this thingy has been putting a lot of strain on the r/s. and aldy made me lose the mood for grad trip..</p>
              <p>how?</p>

              <p>in the first place, you SHOULDNT have agree to bring her along. That's a mistake i feel.<br></p>
              <p>It's a class trip, whats she doin there? GF then? What's more, you already had went with her to BKK earlier.</p>
              <p><br>Hmm.. if it's me, i will persuade her not to go.</p>
              <p>The ticket can be passed to another friend who is keen. That means just buy over her ticket. I also feel that she will be unhappy during the whole trip, hence the trip might turn out to be nasty. Tell her the plans you and your friends have, sight-seeing and stuffs, not just shopping. Make it clear that this trip doesn't involve you and her only, but also your friends. Hence not everything can be control or decided by you. That probably will make her lose the excitement....</p>
              <p>That's what i will do if i were you....</p>

              <p>red_tide,</p>
              <p>Actually hor, your gf is the smarter one.</p>
              <p>Let me tell you why ok ? I travelled many places with big group and small group also backpack everywhere before.</p>
              <p>With such a big group of 13, it is hard to please everyone. best is go tour packaged with fixed itinerary, like your gf says.</p>
              <p>Free and easy is for small group , or couples or singles. Because there are too much options.</p>
              <p>Since you going in big group, best is to rent several transports instead of going one big coach. That way no need to wait here wait there.. when all arrive half day gone.</p>
              <p>If she likes shopping she can always choose to go shopping instead of joining you guys for the rough and tumble, usually is only a day trip. She can always catch up with you guys later. Just try to be flexible, tell her to meet you at the hotel at the end of the day.</p>
              <p>USA is very big, and the options are plenty. I know because I live in the USA.</p>
              <p>Have fun !</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Then you should step up and be a man. Set down the ground rules with her.</p>
              <p>Let her know this is no princess trip, since she wants to go with you , then let her know what is YOUR expectation.</p>
              <p>Let it be known. Don't later regret.</p>

              <p>I think your issue is not simply one of the travelling itinerary - if anything, it's a microcosm of things to come.</p>
              <p>Are you seriously going to be making decisions to please your girlfriend at the expense of your friends (or vice versa) for the rest of your life? If you aren't going to take a stand on such issues and do you know what to be right, it's high time you changed your girlfriend or friends (or both)...</p>
