            <div class='col-md body'>This is my story. A few years ago, I was in a relationship with Miss A. During this time, I got to know Miss B and she was a very fun and attractive girl. Did not feel anything much but slowly B got quite close to me and she confessed she liked me and I eventually broke up with A to try to be with B. I do admit that I was wrong but I didn't really loved A at that time. It was kind of a sudden relationship. B was the kind of "perfect" girl I had in my mind. I tried going after B after I broke up and B protested saying she didn't want to be the a third party. I spent much effort and time chasing her and although she admits she liked me, she did not accept me. In the end she went back to her ex-bf. I hated her for it. It was like being betrayed when all the things I did was because of her. After all this, my reputation suffered and my confidence dropped. And until now whenever I think back, the sense of hatred lingers in me yet I still treasure the happier times together. Until now I think that I am useless and have nothing to offer anymore. I also feel that every girl wants something out of guys be it money or looks. And there are so many guys outside who are so much better. Why would anyone want someone like me? I dun understand why other guys look so normal also can have gf. Pple may not know but I am those kind who live and die for love. Materials are secondary to me but not love.</div>

Everything is relative and since its over, dont bother rationalising it.<br><br>Normal looking guys ca get gfs cos they dont sit at home and wonder this and that.

I am really shallow. Thats why I will die a celibate because the only good things I have going for me have now gone to fat and disrepair.<br><br>I have a question for you though, let say if you fell in love with some gorgeous vixen and found out she went for plastic surgery or even worse, a sex change, would the his/her present self bear more weight than what he/she used to be? And would you stop loving the person then?</div>
