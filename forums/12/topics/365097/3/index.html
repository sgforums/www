              <p>If you feel this way, why bother to call me and waste my time leh? If i hadn't considered helping, i won't have given you my number to call. See who else here would do the stupid thing i did. To think that i even thought you could be trusted....</p>
              <p>I don't see any point in getting people to help you since you don't even accept any help and just waste our time. This is just to show your true colours to everyone so they don't need to suffer the same faith i did.</p>
              <p>You don't want help, don't waste our time by asking for it.</p>
              <p>You said this is your last thread, last thread for this clone before you start a new clone i believe. You cannot be trusted</p>
