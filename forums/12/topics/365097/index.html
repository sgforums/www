I want my life to be meaningful enough.<br>I need some other friends who can play sports with me<br>While spending the day with me.<br>Or maybe going out to watch a little movie.<br>How great would life be if I could ever do so.<br>But nobody really likes me and bother to call me out.<br>So I believe I have become a game addict staying at home.<br>I want to be popular and have much friends with me each day<br>Sometimes when people are so much popular than you.<br>They have the upper hand whether they want to play with you.<br>They can also spread things so much easier and cause you grief.<br><br>Talking about the girl that I love.<br>I know she has a boyfriend and I'm willing to wait .<br>Although I did not tell her that I love her<br>I feel that she some what might know.<br>But we are still friends and I do message her most of the time :)<br>Well I am in a trauma right now.<br>You know that there are so many popular kids around.<br>They go around ruining me .<br>Just like many of my friends do that to me.<br><br>I need a dream and a goal.<br>But what could it really be.<br>My life already had no meaning .<br>Neither will it ever have a dream or a goal.<br><br>Please help me find the real meaning of my pitiful life :(</div>

              <p>Okay guys.<br> This is going to be my last thread.<br> I really hope you guys would help me out.</p>
              <div>Please do listen very sincerely.<br> If not I don't find a point that you would help me out.<br> Thank you very much if you had sincerely help me :)<br> <br> I never led a great life before.<br> I want to lead a happy life like no other would.<br> <br> Well. I have very little friends.<br> So most of the time I would be alone using the computer.<br> I really feel no meaning in my life if I continue doing so.<br> Although sometimes I went out with my friends.<br> I'll just be slacking around with them because that is what they
              do.<br> Actually sometimes I don't mind slacking with them<br> And chatting around with them at the same time.<br> But I need to do something. I want my life to be meaningful
              enough.<br> I need some other friends who can play sports with me<br> While spending the day with me.<br> Or maybe going out to watch a little movie.<br> How great would life be if I could ever do so.<br> But nobody really likes me and bother to call me out.<br> So I believe I have become a game addict staying at home.<br> I want to be popular and have much friends with me each day<br> Sometimes when people are so much popular than you.<br> They have the upper hand whether they want to play with you.<br> They can also spread things so much easier and cause you
              grief.<br> <br> Talking about the girl that I love.<br> I know she has a boyfriend and I'm willing to wait .<br> Although I did not tell her that I love her<br> I feel that she some what might know.<br> But we are still friends and I do message her most of the time
              :)<br> Well I am in a trauma right now.<br> You know that there are so many popular kids around.<br> They go around ruining me .<br> Just like many of my friends do that to me.<br> <br> I need a dream and a goal.<br> But what could it really be.<br> My life already had no meaning .<br> Neither will it ever have a dream or a goal.<br> <br> Please help me find the real meaning of my pitiful life :(</div>

              <p>You complain no friends, ppl wan make friends with you, u complain their age...</p>
              <p>Most kids your age you want find them, you go WOW, DOTA, MapleSEA etc etc not SGForum. There might be kids your age surfing SGF but AA is not a place young boys like to hang out at all.</p>

              <p>Still young threadstarter...wait till u step into adulthood then u realise what's the reality of life.</p>
              <p>Stay focus and enjoy your childhood/teenage part...it'll be gone before u realise it.</p>
              <p>Start on something u like, maybe photography...etc things thatÂ interest u.</p>
              <p>Life is more than feeling low, if you are feeling low/moody/down....how about those who lost their parents, born with defects....</p>
