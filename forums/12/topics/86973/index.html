She n I has seen this drama and recently got a message that "well, who knws, mayb blueprint wuld happen in real life"<br>We enjoyed each others company as we lend each other a ear to listen. We sort of also express that, why both us din take e initiative back then (we were never a pair) and that I told her, I miss me chance, din buck up and some miscom..cox I "tot" she's attached.. of which e true is, she's not back then..<br>She and I share the same phrase of chating which I find is not easy... and shares some same hobbies too. Often we had witty chat but not till very recent I had a stunner question..:"what wuld happen if we get 2gether back then". shes curious to knw n wanted to ask on our last meetup, but paiseh. What prompt her to ask? I asked her back "if given another chance to be together, would u take the chance?" tis her reply "things r complicated and it involves not only 2 of usbut rather 4 ppl.."<br>cox both of us are attached n there's bit of probs here n there... so we confide wif each other.. sigh.. and finally, she asked me this "well, if the situation is tt we r single, would u take the chance?"

            <div class='col-md body'>Why worry so much about it? You got nothing to lose anyway. The question is, are you serious about her? Do you feel love for her or you just have a crush on her. Make up your mind and once you have decided, at least you will know which path you are heading. Never take her for granted and imagined that she would be an easy target to be your potential gf.<br><br>She is probably as curious as you are...but it doesn't means anything. It doesn't means that she like you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>If you really love her, go ahead and love her with all your heart. If she responds, then you know that you are being appreciated. If she doesn't, you should feel happy that you did what you had to do to love her. Either way, you are a winner.

But try not to rush into it. You mentioned she has her attachments and so do you. The best thing you should do is maintain this status quo and maybe one day when there really is nothing to hold you 2 back and you both realise you 2 are suited for each other, that will be the start of a good relationship(I think <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> ) Nothing is good if you rush into it. Things that last usually take a long time to nurture. Imo just take it slow and easy and build it on a solid base.

            <div class='col-md body'>I think all the seniors here have given you very good advices. But in the end, the decision still comes back to you.<br><br>Pondering over such things are quite normal (does that very oftened myself) because i guess that you do not wish to hurt anyone. But sometimes, hurting someone else along the way of relationship is inevitable (but that doesn't mean that i encourage you to hurt everyone just to get your ways).<br><br>The most important thing (in my view) is that whatever decision you come up with in the near future, do not regret about it, Just like what you have done before (not telling her about how you feel and missed that chance).<br><br>All the best to you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree, pondering is a good thing rather than not thinking bout its presence...<br>Recently, we just had our first phone chat...well, we usually just send sms but that night, its bout 1am. That night we were suppose to meet up for dinner but both of us had our own stuffs so had to postphone. Anyway, bout 1am while I was chatting, she send me a sms say she's bored at home, so msg me, and she din have her com, so tot of chit chat with me. I told her before that I din like to talk on phone tat much so she asked me again "eh u don like 2 tok on phne hor?me feel like tokin rubbish nw hehehe" So i asked her if she don mind me calling her place, cox it midnight, scared disturb. She then gave me hse number. We then talked bout an hr or so, and boy, its been awhile since I did that..after I put down e phone, she sms me again, thanking me company and she enjoyed tokin 2 me even its on e phone (cox we meet up before and chat for hours outside)<br>After she asked me that question, it prompt me even more to ask her more.. but then, seems like time doesn't allow me to do that, sigh.... I really wish to find out even though some of u guys may say for what? Since both of us are in a relationship of our own. however, she's takin one step at a time for hers n me, sometimes things wuld jus crop up. We both then confide to each other.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, manage to meet up wif her yesterday and chatted quite abit =), its a nice feeling...<br>I quote this "A few months back, manage to catch up wif a long lost friend bout 6 yrs ago. Initially, its just simple chat n stuffs till we started to have more confiding talks. Well, if anyone has seen blueprints "chase", me story is somewhat similar to that, cept for e ending only. She n I has seen this drama and recently got a message that "well, who knws, mayb blueprint wuld happen in real life"<br>from my first post. The show "chase" is bout this a guy and ger from each different relationship, who decided to choose each other in e end, to start anew. They knew each other for a long time but lost contact and only get to meet up. So, this shows happens at such a time whereby the scenerio of me n her is bout the same.. we chatted out it last night. She mentioned too that she finds it similar too and had wondered is it destined... cause when she asked me that questions, both of our relationship somehow had problems... and that she realie wondered, what would happen if we were to get together? We also agreed that if both of us were single, things might be easier... but, life is always like that, ain't smooth n perfect<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just found out something last friday when we meet up again. We talked bout issues that were lingering on our mind. All I can say is that, I did not take enough initiative back then and she figured tat too.<br>After awhile I finally pluck up the courage and asked "so did u hav interest in me back then"<br>She replied "yes" But I asked again "back then or now" and a soft reply "recently after we meet up"... gosh... well. probably the reason is that after a few meet ups, both our R/S each has bit of problems here n there, though not happen at the same time. We confide to each other bout our sorrows and all...<br>After tat day, we chat on the net and she asked again<br>"but did u consider tt if we did get together in the past..we might turn out well..we might not turn out well"<br><br>but well, now..status quo..i dun wish to jeopardise yr relationship..status quo means remain unchanged ..<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I replied same goes for me too as it'll affect 2 more other people too.<br><br>Partly why we ponder bout this is because not getting together in the past issue n due to the stuff happening now<br><br>Well, shes' happy with the relationship tt we are sharing now..<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> frens but more than tt.<br><br>I reply yes as tat wuld mean less a lover, but 1 more friend =)<br>and she reply "  lets leave things to destiny then..
