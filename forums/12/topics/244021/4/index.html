I didn't make excuses for my past cheating nor did I defend my past faults. If there is a word I must submit to you, let the word me "repentance".<br><br>I'm not a preacher or a holy person. Just some guy who learned a lesson the very hard way, and wanting to share what I've learnt with people. I do not come to gain the pity of others, I do not need sympathy nor charity. So I appeal to you to drop the "pity" part already.<br><br>It wasn't exactly easy for me when I started typing and sharing my account, every word brought me back to reliving the pain. You may call the past me a "bastard" but I take offence in that "he is none other than a bastard."<br><br>You took the pleasure of googling me, and then the liberty of posting my blog address, name and all here. May I ask if that's your mean of rreciprocating my respect and civilities towards you? I do not need a single "sugar-coated" word from you, just pray be kind and not disturb my peace.<br><br>"then i will find more faults in his story to support my arguement."

Alleytyb has explained what he thinks and he took the trouble to explain, so let's leave it.<br><br>But really, alleytyb, I don't mean to criticize you, being direct is ok, but watch the risk of appearing rude.

I was too blunt once, and I suffered the nightmare of hatred and isolation in my secondary school class for 2 years. It was a horrible experience, one that I was in denial for many many years (until my wife made me face my memories and come to terms with it), for I suffered a lot of humiliation during that period, and it affected my personality.<br><br>Anyway, Detached.
