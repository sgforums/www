You think he will cheat you so that you can give him money? I don't see any objective in him cheating us, what is the point?<br><br>Even if he is doing this for fun and laughter, peace and joy, and just making us look silly for feeling sympathy for him, then so be it. He din gain anything.<br><br>But if it were true, then I will tell Detached, that everyone makes mistakes in his life, but you must truly learn from your mistakes. And only you (no one else), will know if you really had learnt from your mistakes.<br><br>My greatest regret is shunning my grandmother when she was close to death. I loved her so much, but I could not understand why I avoided her. In the end, after her death, I realized that I feared death, and I did not want to see her in that state of pain. For my image of her in my mind, was that feisty, and strong lady. I did not want to replace my image of her to that of bags and bones, pain and sadness<br><br>To this day, I regretted my actions, and tears still come to my eyes when I thought of her last days. But my wife consoled me that she was by my grandmother's side as much as she could in place of me. It was no consolation, for what was done, had been done. But I have learnt to cherish my parents more, seeing them as much as I can, and am working very hard to save up to bring them for holidays with us every year. Money can be earned back, but parents are only once in our lifetime.<br><br>The point is, you can curse and swear, and say how ungrateful and evil I was. But ask yourself truly, and you know that all human beings make mistakes. If you had, and you can redeem it, please do it quickly. Otherwise, for those mistakes that cannot be rectified, you will live with regret for the rest of your lives.<br><br>"The greatest problem with growing up is that of cynicism.

I am keen to be taught.<br> everyone has regrets. but what's the point of crying over spilt milk? the best use of the past is the lessons it teachers us for the next lap of our life.<br> we never live behind our past. we carry the important bits of our past with us as memories. we only do not fight lost causes.<br></span></div></blockquote>Even as I might not believe in your story, I believe in the message.<br><br>Work hard. She left an impact on you. That's what's important.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Allentyb, I'm not sure if you saw my post on the previous page... but well, I'm going to point out one mistake that you made and I'm going to do it by writing in point form.<br><br>1) TS and R got to know each another.<br><br>2) TS and R got into relationship. R was serious about it, but not TS. At that game, she's only game.<br><br>3) Since she's only game, he flirts around. Doesn't care for her because he doesn't love her like she loves him.<br><br>4) R gets very upset at the numerous flirts and flings TS has.<br><br>5) TS realises his mistake, FALLS IN LOVE with R and quits being a jerk.<br><br>6) TS stopped fooling around and starts to get serious. From then on his mind and heart were only on R. No other girls had been involved since.<br><br>7) R's mom doesn't like TS. Tried to split them up but failed to.<br><br>8 ) TS starts a business and works very hard to get the mom's approval. R sticks it up for TS.<br><br>9) TS works very hard, but ended up neglecting R very badly.<br><br>10) Due to the neglecting, the two eventually broke up.<br><br>11) Auto accident, R passed into the other world.<br><br>Now, do you see where your mistake is, Allen? I think you read selectively, or maybe you are just too angry at TS' jerka$$ past. You are so pissed with him that you placed no.11 straight after no.4 and ignored the existence of no.5 to no.10.<br><br>They did not split up because of his numerous flings, which is what you believe in. TS did toyed with her, but only at first. But that's the only part you saw, and cared for. You cared not for the fact that the guy eventually turned over a new leaf.<br><br>And now, don't you start saying who-and-who are self-righteous. Do you even have the right to say that, when you yourself is so self-righteous? Let's face it - you are very rude. You lack basic manners. You are rude to TS even when he remained civil with you.<br><br>You claim that you don't believe the story, so why so much anger? Why do you keep raving at TS for being a jerk and all that when you don't even believe what he's typed so far is a true account of his life story? Very contradictary of you, don't you think?<br><br>And to repeat what Soul-Rage and I had said before - you can choose to believe, or not to believe in his story. If it's true, feel free to bash him. However, you do need to make sure it's justified. Yours isn't. Not at all.<br><br>If it's not true, then it's of absolute no harm. Just take it like you are reading 'Cinderella' or something.<br><br>Just because you've stopped posting doesn't mean people can't reply to you. This is a forum afterall, and they have their freedom to type whatever they wish. If you can act like an immature cretin, they can't say anything about it?<br><br>Stop being such an egoistic hypocrite.</div>
