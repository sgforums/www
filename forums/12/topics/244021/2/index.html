            <div class='col-md body'>Sorry bout the typo. I was constantly reflecting the account from a 3rd person perspective and when I was done typing, I was too tired to edit. Thanks for pointing it out.<br><br>Indeed it was what I went through. If you can find similar accounts anywhere, you may submit to this thread and proclaim me a liar. allentyb earlier on did a search and found my blog at www.sparklingdream.blogspot.com<br><br>Although, I wasn't pleased I felt my privacy was invaded when he did that and posted in the thread. Now I shall bring it up to everyone's attention. The last entry on the blog is the last email I sent her. You may use the blog to further validate my story.<br><br>I'm weary about "is this real" questions. All is said and done, I'm here to share what I've learnt.

            <div class='col-md body'>Just something which I read recently and thought of sharing it with you.<br><br><strong>Getting over someone Â… DoesnÂ’t mean forgetting that person</strong><br><br>A story which I received in my email a few years back. Something very true from the story, Â“Getting over someone Â… doesnÂ’t mean forgetting that person.Â” And it is very important to know that we must go on with our life in order not to disappoint them. We must also understand that it is not how we honored them after they were gone but rather how we treated them when they are with us. Never hesitate to show your care and concern to people that you love and to people around you. There might not always be a tomorow to act.<br><br>I never thought I could ever get over the death of Julia. She is everything in my life, and she is even more important than myself. The time she spent in the hospital was the most painful moment in our life. I knew that she feels a great deal of pain incurred by the cancerous cells in her body, but she never once shown the pain in front of me; this, I have always believed that she was trying to prevent me from seeing her suffers so that I will not feel sad. For me, every time I got to see her, I was worried that that might be the very last time I would be seeing her; so I treasure every moment I spent with her. Every time when I visited her in the hospital, I would hold her hand and then we would just chat and act like everything was normal.<br><br>You can read the whole story at: <strong><a href="http://www.symphonyoflove.net/blog/?p=72" rel="nofollow">http://www.symphonyoflove.net/blog/?p=72</a></strong></div>
