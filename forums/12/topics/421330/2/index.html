              <p>maybe i can share, i also have the same experience as ts, cannot let go, and after so many years i saw her on facebook, so i create an fb account and add her as a friend. no response for very long time leh. so i thought forget it already. she prolly still hate me.</p>
              <p>surprisingly after i remove the pending for friend confirm, she msg me one evening saying hello, she told me that she was in china shanghai and have no access for facebook. then i add her again and she accpeted me as a friend.</p>
              <p>she married a ang moh and have a kid. she aged a lot, look like old aunty, lol. that is the time i finally can let go, she ish still on my friend list. really have to thank her for the add.</p>
              <p>so my purpose of facebook is completed, should i let it rot or should i disable it..</p>
              <p>hmmm....</p>

              <p>TS, i will like to share a true story with you. its a long story so please bear with me:</p>
              <p>once upon a time, there was a guy who was good friends with this gal... they started out as friends and click well together and became close buddies, but nothing else. it was not a bf-gf relationship...</p>
              <p>they have a lot of good times together as causal friends.. go makan, go shop, laugh and chat...</p>
              <p>one day, the boy started to have other thoughts about this relationship... he felt that everything was so right about this relationship that they should maybe become more serious bf-gf... the boy started to fall in love with her... everything about her seem right... her laughter, her smile, her personality, their common interests... it seems so logical to the boy that they should be together</p>
              <p>but unfortunately for the boy... when he tried to get serious, the gal started to feel more and more uncomfortable... it was obvious that the gal got the hints.. but it also became obvious to the boy that the gal was acting blur to the hints and refusing to go beyond their existing friendship</p>
              <p>of course with one party pushing and theother party resisting, their friendship start to suffer and start to fall apart.... the boy realise that their times together were no longer the same... the endless conversation they use to have was now replaced with long moments of silence... the laughters were hardly there at all... there were less and less smiles... instead he noticed the pain and sadness in her eyes</p>
              <p>the boy was also sad and filled with sorrow... he started to feel sorry for himself.... and in fact in his mind and in his heart, he started to blame the gal for not accepting him</p>
              <p>then suddenly one day... the boy had a "nirvana" moment... he was all by himself in the same cafe that both he and gal used to hang out. Then he noticed another couple seated in the table next to his... there was laughter from that table and he saw the smiles and joy from the boy and gal next to him... he started to visualise the couple's faces as his face and theother gal's face, and the many happy moments they have in the past..... it was at that moment that he realise what the problem was</p>
              <p>during their time together, he has grown more and more to love her laughter and her smiles.... but the laughter and smile is no longer there now... and he realise that the laughter and smile was not because of him.. he was not the reason for her happiness! her happiness was through the life she has then, which was with her family and friends... friends like him....</p>
              <p>the boy knew then what he had to do... in order to keep the smile that he has grown to love, he has to let it go... because the more if he were to try to keep it.. the more the smile will disappear...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Naive Bayes... do you understand what this story means? i hope you do and i hope that one day, you will find the smile that is truely yours to keep</p>
