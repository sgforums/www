              <p>I have been lurking around for some time here, and I have an issue that has been bugging me for almost a year. I do not have anybody close enough that I can relate to, so I guess this is the next best place to voice my emotions.</p>
              <p>I killed a friendship I had with a lady a year back. This lady was really somebody I truely treasured, but I killed the friendship because I had unwittingly fell in love with her and said things that should have been left unspoken. As a result, she wasn't too pleased with me, and I have been avoided ever since.</p>
              <p>I know that the correct thing for me to do is to move on. I have tried to convince myself that all I am feeling, was just an obsession and not true love. I have tried to push my thoughts away by focusing on my work and trying to participate in activities with other friends. When I am busy, I would not reminiscence about the past and I would try to keep to a cheerful facade. But sometimes, at night, when I am lying down in my bed, these thoughts would come creeping towards me and I would be burdened by regrets of the things I did in the past. </p>
              <p>I believe in freewill, that I have no control about what other people feel about me.  I can't force a person to come back to me nor can I control anyone's action. I also believe that there is no point crying about spilt milk.  But despite all the rules and safe guards I have placed in my life, I turned myself into a victim of my own emotions.  Here I am, crying about spilt milk that has probably turned sour by now.</p>
              <p>I have thought that time heals all wounds. Sometimes it does, but sometimes the wound seems to reopen again. For a period of time, I felt great. But suddenly, my mind is bleeding again.</p>
              <p>I am not asking for any help, probably just a listening ear. I have enough I keeping this to myself, and I am trying to let this post be an avenue to purge out this negative emotions.</p>

              <p>Well, she was aware I liked her. But she prefered me to be in the friend zone. But at that point of time, I was quite affected by the unreciprocated feelings and my work was getting badly affected. So, I made the decision to tell her that I can't be her friend as long as I had feelings for her; I would expect something in return from her which would eventually result in bad blood between us. She didn't take it too well and we went out of touch for months. I managed to focus on my job, and I pushed the whole saga off from my head for awhile. But the pain backfired on me very slowly.</p>
              <p>That's the demon that has been haunting me every night. I would really love to move on, I know I am already not a part of world already. But when I catch a glimpse of her face again, the pain rush back like a venom.</p>
              <p>So, maybe I am not emotionally mature in this respect. There were lessons learnt, albeit a very painful and draining one.</p>

              <p>In a way, you are right, there is something I couldn't let go and I don't know why. Logically, I know it is a waste of my time to mourn over it. So, it is a constant battle between my logical and emotional side.  Communications may be out of the question now. I have to seek closure by myself, and I am finding it hard.</p>
              <p>But you are right, I should be thankful that she had never lead me around.</p>

              <p>Haiz, no such thing as true luv. Why feel so guilty? Did u think u do anything wrong? It is simple math formula. Guy like gal, gal don;t like guy. Answer to math equation? Simple: Move on.</p>
              <p>Why cry over worthless frenship? Had it been lost of a buddy or close guy fren, would u give a damn? More painful because u like the gal, isn't it?</p>
              <p>What u did wuz natural instinct, u r a guy. Guy suppose to be attracted to gal. If u r not attracted, then u r gay. So again what do u feel so guilty about? For acting out of ur natural instinct as a guy?</p>
