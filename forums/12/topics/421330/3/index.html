              <p>Wait until u find out she is actually wif some other guy. The pain is even more painful. Bro, get use to it. The more you experience tis, at the end it feel nothing to u.</p>
              <p>It is only pain n pride not physical pain. Learn to face emotional pain upfront. Face her, give her the poker face. Who care? At the end, life is short, enjoy.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>TS, i will like to share a true story with you. its a long story
              so please bear with me:</p>
              <p>once upon a time, there was a guy who was good friends with this
              gal... they started out as friends and click well together and
              became close buddies, but nothing else. it was not a bf-gf
              relationship...</p>
              <p>they have a lot of good times together as causal friends.. go
              makan, go shop, laugh and chat...</p>
              <p>one day, the boy started to have other thoughts about this
              relationship... he felt that everything was so right about this
              relationship that they should maybe become more serious bf-gf...
              the boy started to fall in love with her... everything about her
              seem right... her laughter, her smile, her personality, their
              common interests... it seems so logical to the boy that they should
              be together</p>
              <p>but unfortunately for the boy... when he tried to get serious,
              the gal started to feel more and more uncomfortable... it was
              obvious that the gal got the hints.. but it also became
              obvious to the boy that the gal was acting blur to the hints and
              refusing to go beyond their existing friendship</p>
              <p>of course with one party pushing and theother party resisting,
              their friendship start to suffer and start to fall apart.... the
              boy realise that their times together were no longer the
              same... the endless conversation they use to have was now replaced
              with long moments of silence... the laughters were hardly there at
              all... there were less and less smiles... instead he noticed the
              pain and sadness in her eyes</p>
              <p>the boy was also sad and filled with sorrow... he started to
              feel sorry for himself.... and in fact in his mind and in his
              heart, he started to blame the gal for not accepting him</p>
              <p>then suddenly one day... the boy had a "nirvana" moment...
              he was all by himself in the same cafe that both he and gal used to
              hang out. Then he noticed another couple seated in the table
              next to his... there was laughter from that table and he saw the
              smiles and joy from the boy and gal next to him... he
              started to visualise the couple's faces as his face and theother
              gal's face, and the many happy moments they have in the
              past..... it was at that moment that he realise what the problem
              was</p>
              <p>during their time together, he has grown more and more to love
              her laughter and her smiles.... but the laughter and smile is no
              longer there now... and he realise that the laughter and smile
              was not because of him.. he was not the reason for her happiness!
              her happiness was through the life she has then, which was with her
              family and friends... friends like him....</p>
              <p>the boy knew then what he had to do... in order to keep the
              smile that he has grown to love, he has to let it go... because the
              more if he were to try to keep it.. the more the smile will
              disappear...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Naive Bayes... do you understand what this story means? i hope
              you do and i hope that one day, you will find the smile that is
              truely yours to keep</p>

              <p>Thanks for relating this story to me. Yes, my story is very similar to yours. And I would like it to end like yours...except that the "nirvana" moment comes through this story and the replies preceeding it.</p>
              <p>Thanks for showing me a purpose let go...I will remember your story with all my heart.</p>

              <p>I have been lurking around for some time here, and I have an issue that has been bugging me for almost a year. I do not have anybody close enough that I can relate to, so I guess this is the next best place to voice my emotions.</p>
              <p>I killed a friendship I had with a lady a year back. This lady was really somebody I truely treasured, but I killed the friendship because I had unwittingly fell in love with her and said things that should have been left unspoken. As a result, she wasn't too pleased with me, and I have been avoided ever since.</p>
              <p>I know that the correct thing for me to do is to move on. I have tried to convince myself that all I am feeling, was just an obsession and not true love. I have tried to push my thoughts away by focusing on my work and trying to participate in activities with other friends. When I am busy, I would not reminiscence about the past and I would try to keep to a cheerful facade. But sometimes, at night, when I am lying down in my bed, these thoughts would come creeping towards me and I would be burdened by regrets of the things I did in the past. </p>
              <p>I believe in freewill, that I have no control about what other people feel about me.  I can't force a person to come back to me nor can I control anyone's action. I also believe that there is no point crying about spilt milk.  But despite all the rules and safe guards I have placed in my life, I turned myself into a victim of my own emotions.  Here I am, crying about spilt milk that has probably turned sour by now.</p>
              <p>I have thought that time heals all wounds. Sometimes it does, but sometimes the wound seems to reopen again. For a period of time, I felt great. But suddenly, my mind is bleeding again.</p>
              <p>I am not asking for any help, probably just a listening ear. I have enough I keeping this to myself, and I am trying to let this post be an avenue to purge out this negative emotions.</p>
              <p>Thanks for reading.</p>

              <p>What you say does make sense..I am gaining perspectives, but I am still kind of stucked in that position. Though I understand that only I can really heal the emotional wounds inside, I am not very sure of the methodologies to cope with it. Perhaps, you could elaborate or give some suggestions on how I can deal with the internal festering wounds?</p>
              <p>Sometimes I feel that it is more of gaining acceptence of myself and trying to forgive myself, rather than to get the person to forgive me. There were also times where I was afraid that there is an underlying latent issue at the back of my head that is much more serious.Sometimes, it could just be a case in which I simply think too much.</p>
              <p>So have I created an illusion that has been fooling my own emotions all this while? If that is the case, how can I get my own subconcience to accept it all.</p>
              <p>I would like to break out of this, and share my experience with everyone else. There are many people like me, who couldn't let go and I would hope that my analysis of myself through here could give pointers to the rest of the world out there.</p>

              <p>Well, she was aware I liked her. But she prefered me to be in the friend zone. But at that point of time, I was quite affected by the unreciprocated feelings and my work was getting badly affected. So, I made the decision to tell her that I can't be her friend as long as I had feelings for her; I would expect something in return from her which would eventually result in bad blood between us. She didn't take it too well and we went out of touch for months. I managed to focus on my job, and I pushed the whole saga off from my head for awhile. But the pain backfired on me very slowly.</p>
              <p>That's the demon that has been haunting me every night. I would really love to move on, I know I am already not a part of world already. But when I catch a glimpse of her face again, the pain rush back like a venom.</p>
              <p>So, maybe I am not emotionally mature in this respect. There were lessons learnt, albeit a very painful and draining one.</p>

It's all good really; just that the problem arises only when our emotions fail to move as fast as our mind and creates a discrepancy within that revealed a huge distance gap that caused this inconsistency.</p>
              <p>Think about your emotion as the speed of driving a truck and your mind as a sports car. Sometimes, the more we push our mind to 'get over and done with it' - it resulted in a severe backlash and we relapse constantly because both entities are basically travelling at two extreme speed and there is minimum effort in reconciling. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ultimately, both entities belong to one body, so like it or not, you got to deal with it.</span></strong>   </p>
              <p>Humans are ritualistic creatures - meaning, we sometimes seek to exhibit irrational actions or behaviours in enabling us for a closure or putting an end to a particular chapter in our life. It is quite evitable that you have yet to come in terms with the way the circumstances has turn out for you, thus understanding what it takes to bring you to your eventual destination is pretty much critical for you to move along.</p>
              <p>There is a reason why I coin this as a 'ritual' because ritual are purely human construct to symbolize certain experience. For example, we perform funeral rites for people who are dead - it acts as a form of closure. Obviously from a scientific point of view, when a person's biological body fails to function, the person is already dead. The funeral, from a pure scientific view, is a redundant act because the 'end' has already ended. </p>
              <p>Hence, what sort of 'ritual' do you need to perform before the chapter can begin to close gradually? You said self forgiveness - so what needs to happen before self forgiveness can take place? If it means doing 'seeming' stupid things like 'needing to say what you need to say to her' - contrary to popular belief, I would say just do it if you know it brings about this effect, which is closer to your goal of achieving self closure.  </p>
              <p>Take it easy when you approach the subject of recovery because the pace of healing is truly relative. It's normal to falter randomly during recovery period - after all, these experiences are there to let us learn something about love, so that we can grow as a person. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="icon_idea.gif"></p>

              <p>Ma'am, when we say we are coping with things in life, arn't we in effect trying to move on? My defination of coping would be to learn from past mistakes and make sure it doesn't get repeated and do things that does not cement me to the point of time that I want to put away. So perhaps we are on the same direction but different defination?</p>
