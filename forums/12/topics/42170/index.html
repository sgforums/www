You don't know her.. she don't know you... And you abruptly approach jus to ask for her number.. And of cos.. any girls out there will blush if some strangers out of nowhere came over and ask for her number.. This means that the stranger wants to know her.. and definitely interested in her...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>I probably think that she wont sms you.. and maybe she ask you to give your number to her.. one thing maybe ask you to back off.. I suggest you don't attempt your second chance.. and if she's really not interested in you.. YOu, like being a "stalker" keep asking her for her number or what.. She will distance away from you.. You will be stated in her "Blacklisted" file!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You should try to make friends with her first.. Now you have approach her.. So whenever you see her.. Smile and walk.. or jus say "hi" or "bye" to her.. then at least she wont feel that you are a nuisance!! Then from there slowly.. you can start talking to her.. in school.. or somewhere where you two happened to meet each other.. Have a small conversation first lor.. Then after try again.. to ask for an exchange number.. This is when you really know her talk to her and she feels comfortable while talking.. Not very defensive type...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Take things slowly.. Actually you shouldn't approach her so quickly lor.. and shouldn't ask for her number too!! Not to pull you down or what... but I tell this is the lousy and the worst method in the world to know a girl like that!!! So now.. jus let it be..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

But if she's really someone who you like SO MUCH, perhaps you could do more? You can start with more casual talks and lunch or something...? But while you're in the midst of doing all this, please take note not to turn yourself into a BUG which she would like totally be DISGUSTED with (and even step on if she have a chance to?).... Afterall, there's like really a CHANCE that she might be TOTALLY UNINTERESTED in you... You can do more for now, but KNOW YOUR LIMITS?<br><br>~good luck?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>As wat many said here, start of wif frens... be more natural like... whenever U see her, ask how she been, how's da lab &amp; such... dun pop da topic like, "Y never sms?". Dun even try to ask for her no. again... slowly build up... if U can approach her nice &amp; easy... (as FRIENDS) then even initially she had 0% interest in U... time WILL change.<br><br>But of coz... wat I said is only a suggestion... U can DON'T follow...

Too abrupt already.<br>That's the first time you spoke with her.<br>The next time you see her, talk normally about normal things.  Keep it short if necessary.  You can say simple things like "Hi, just finished your lab session?"  or "hey, you look great today"</div>
