            <div class='col-md body'>There are 2 girls name Apple and Lorry. There are good friends for years. Been happy together. Apple is a very innocent and guai girl. Lorry is a childish girl who likes to be popular with guys. Therefore, she has change alot of boyfriends. Apple has advised Lorry to find her true love and not flirting with guys but Lorry always nv listen.<br><br>They get to know one guy through friends. One day Lorry told Apple she like that guy Kenny. Apple had expected that Lorry will like Kenny as he's a popular guy among girls. However, Apple did not expect Lorry to love him. Apple also did not realise that she was in love with Kenny.<br><br>Time goes by. Apple and Kenny get to know and talk to each other and went out together happily. Apple then went out with Lorry one day and told her that she had went out with Kenny for a couple of times. Who knows! Lorry was so angry that she did not ask her along. Apple said that she did ask her along but Lorry said that she did not mention Kenny got go if not she will surely go along.. Apple was shocked by her reactions. Lorry then told Apple not to snatch Kenny.<br><br>so frm tat day onwards, when kenny and Apple goes out, Lorry will go. Kenny and Apple always talk alot when they are out then Lorry  will get angry and walk off. Therefore, Lorry said not to ask her along anymore. So, Kenny and Apple always go out together and they are about to go stead then Lorry one day went up to her and scold Apple for snatchin her Kenny. Then Apple denied saying that they are only friends. then in the end, they didnt friend each other. Lorry hate Apple<br><br>Apple love Kenny but she think that friendship is more important, so she do many things which make kenny angry and irritated then leave Kenny.<br><br>but not realising that Lorry lost both best friends.<br>She felt sad without Kenny. Lorry still ignore her like before. So Apple become alone.<br><br>One day,  Apple saw her friends who know Lorry also. Then she realised that Lorry has been telling others that Lorry and Kenny are steadies and Apple is the one who break them apart, meaning Apple is the third party. Apple then realised she got such a lousy friend .... but she did not blame  Lorry and realy wana be friends with her again. and regreted very much of what she had done to Kenny... However, it was all too late..<br><br>What do you think Apple should do ?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>err.... if i am Apple, i won't give up the guy in the first place. For me friendship is definitely more impt than guys.... but in this case, i won't regard Lorry even as a friend. Is this how a true friend behaves? NO! so why should i even bother abt how she feels in the first place? she can spread all the rumours she wants, i dun care! and if those fools believed her... so be it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
