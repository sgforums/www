            <div class='col-md body'>When a guy blackmails his girlfriend for sex, just dump him. He's not worth it. I do not think he's serious about the relationship too! In fact, guys who blackmails sex out from their girlfriends (the common if-you-love-me-then-let's-do-it) are just out for sex, not love. If you give in, sooner or later you will get the boot from him because he's got what he had wanted and you are no more use to him.</div>
