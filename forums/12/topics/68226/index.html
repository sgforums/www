            <div class='col-md body'>Sunday was a normal day for me, booking in at night and it seems like a ordinary day. While taking the train saw this gal which deeply attracts me,  the kind  of love at first sight feeling.

Maybe it is a lack of courage, what i  can do is just see her drop off at her destination.<br><br>Weeks past, not sure whether it is fate or what, i  manage to see her again at a shopping mall. Saw her working at a particular  shop and was damm happy when i  saw her cause i  never thought i  would ever see her again. Maybe i'm  really a coward , i  still do not even dare to talk to her, but i  really wish i  could know her.<br><br>Last week i  took the same train with her again. Even though i'm  reading a book, it just seems too hard to concentrate reading it while she  is sitting oppsite. JUst took a few peep at her whenever she's not noticing. Really don't know what got into me that day, i decide to know her. But without the courage to tell her face to face all i  can do is to write a paper stating that i'm really sincere to know her since the last time i  took the same train with her and told her to sms me the result whether it is a "yes" or "no". After finishing writing, hope to pass her the paper when the moment she alight. THe time seems damm slow during that day, no matter what i  do , i  still feel extremely nervous, maybe it is because it is my 1st time.

Really don't know what the answer but guess the fate of the paper must be in the dustbin of the mrt station if i'm not wrong. People out there, it is really that hard just to reply even if u  are not intrested, or would u  be like her, no answer given.<br><br></div>

Why? Lets study this case in some details.<br><br>I) Lack of confidence - You want to approach the girl, either you do it with confidence (false/real) or you don't approach at all. This greatly increase your chance of knowing her.<br><br>II) Lack of communication and human touch - you pass the note to her at the criticial moment when she is about to leave. This totally cuts you off from any mode of communication and likely - you will fail because her mind will automatically shut you off even if she is single. E.g. Do you respond to the junk mail you have in your email? Chances are, your psychological automatic thought will delete right away even without clicking on the mail.<br><br>You want to approach a girl - don't be wishy washy. Do it properly, or don't. You are sincere, but you don't demonstrate it properly, you appear to be dubious. Train your self-confidence, learn to talk to girls while maintaining decent eye contact, work through your body language and your opening speech. This will increase your chance of succeeding. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>though it is only polite to reply u even if its a no... that's my view too that's why i hate it when friends dont reply... or when i cannot get to the bottom of some issues... but now i know there is no need to always get answers...<br>but i think she is afraid that even if she replies u a 'no' but u will have her number and u may be persist in trying to befriend her and this in my opinion will make her dislike u more and eventually she may need to change number just because she is being polite and replies a 'no' to u. so i guess she will not want to let herself be in such a situation.<br>friebnds can dont reply needless to say strangers</div>
