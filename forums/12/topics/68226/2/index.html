While taking the train saw this gal which deeply attracts me,  the kind  of love at first sight feeling.  Deep in my heart i  really wish i  could know her, but basically it is just impossible for me to know her cause i  have never ask a gal for numbers before. Maybe it is a lack of courage, what i  can do is just see her drop off at her destination.<br><br>Weeks past, not sure whether it is fate or what, i  manage to see her again at a shopping mall. Saw her working at a particular  shop and was damm happy when i  saw her cause i  never thought i  would ever see her again. Maybe i'm  really a coward , i  still do not even dare to talk to her, but i  really wish i  could know her.<br><br>Last week i  took the same train with her again. Even though i'm  reading a book, it just seems too hard to concentrate reading it while she  is sitting oppsite. JUst took a few peep at her whenever she's not noticing. Really don't know what got into me that day, i decide to know her. But without the courage to tell her face to face all i  can do is to write a paper stating that i'm really sincere to know her since the last time i  took the same train with her and told her to sms me the result whether it is a "yes" or "no". After finishing writing, hope to pass her the paper when the moment she alight. THe time seems damm slow during that day, no matter what i  do , i  still feel extremely nervous, maybe it is because it is my 1st time. Finally the moment has arrive, pass her the paper when she is about to alight, she took the paper and left without saying anything<br><br>It's been 6 days since i  gave her the paper but i  never got a reply, even it is a no, i  really wish she could at least reply me that.  Really don't know what the answer but guess the fate of the paper must be in the dustbin of the mrt station if i'm not wrong. People out there, it is really that hard just to reply even if u  are not intrested, or would u  be like her, no answer given.<br><br></div></blockquote>tat day i go shopping with my grand daughter then gt a guy like pian tai lidat keep peeping at her...orhh so is u ahh...i stil tinkin wana dig out ur eyes......wana kinow her come and tell her mah u see see only ur eyes can tok meh...so pai seh for wat....u guy leh...mus gt courage n tok .....<br><br>ya tokin abt tat paper u give her...pai seh cos v hurried that day wana buy 4D so i used that paper go write 4D no then after tat throw away liaoz....aiyo....u got mouth mah..go up to her and tok lar..she v frenly one dn worry...........at least u try liao if canot then sua lor....the most she reject u oni mah..v pai seh meh...<br><br>..no lar...no pai seh lar...a guy mus b thick skin...tis time canot nex time try again......at least u know u try ur best...........better than nw u keep tinkin tok so much write so long one whole paragraph..takes u hw much time.... aso no use rite?,might as welll take this 15 mins go tok to her n sian her mah...kaoz....need me teach u....<br><br>,.,., mus try then know mah...ok huh so remember tok to my granddaughter if u see her in toilet or train again ...remember mus add sincerity..then remeber to relax n smile k..nt like pervert smile...learn hw to smile like Edison....lidat...abit can liaoz...then dn jie ba...be like a guy!!!!!!<br><br>Gd luck!<br>Ah Ma Agony <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
