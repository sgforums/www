              <p>I'm in quite a dilemma right now. My job contract of 3 months in this company is ending by next Monday. However, previously i've worked for 3 months before this contract in the same company. That means I've worked for a total of 6 months but it's not continuous. It's the same job by the way.</p>
              <p>The reason from my boss is that he doesn't need a perm staff at that time, and after that he employed me again because he needs people urgently. And right now, he's offering another contract for me again, which is still not a perm staff contract but rather a long term contract with a few extra staff benefits. I feel like I'm being treated like an extra worker and my salary has not yet increased. I don't see why he can convert other people to perm staff after 3 months while I'm still treated as a temp staff with no staff benefits at all. I felt so cheated. But I quite like the working environment though.</p>
              <p>So, I'm thinking if I should accept his offer or not and I need to give him a reply by tomorrow. Accepting his offer means I still can earn more money, and otherwise I'll be shaking legs at home but not intending to find another job at the near moment.</p>

              <p>Don't think too much.</p>
              <p>You are a contract staff, negotiate for a better deal, otherwise do not accept the job. If you accept the contract on whatever terms that is presented, then you are to blame yourself.</p>
              <p>Contract staff should get sllightly higher pay than perm staff, because of reduced benefits and perks.</p>

              <p>Well, he talked to me again just now. He said my pay wasn't going to increase and the contract is 6 months, but can be reduced if it's too long for me.</p>
              <p>I feel so unfair. He told me the contract he offered to one of my colleagues is the same, but I told him why our pay is so different. He still asked me "got meh?". -.-</p>
              <p>I think I've made my decision. If he's going to give me the same pay as what I'm having now, I'm not continuing to work anymore.</p>

              <p>Start sending out more resumes. Allow yourself to have more choice. It is not to make a decision now but act as a backup plan. And hence, you will feel more secure and that solve your dilemma.</p>

              <p>I think in all fairness you should be entitled to a better pay based on your experience in the company. You may want to remind your boss that you have an asset which is experience in the company which is vital.</p>
              <p>Now about this contractual thing, I just feel that he doesn't want to incur higher overheads especially in the area of contributing CPF so with that amount that he is saving it could be logical for you to ask for a better attractive figure in your pay. I suggest you can speak to him without having to compare pay with another colleague of yours as that is quite unprofessional and may get the other person in trouble as such things are private and confidential.</p>
              <p>Just deal with it from another perspective and I think all should be well in due time.</p>

              <p>I suggested that u can try to look other jobs? i'm sure there're plenty of better jobs out there waiting for ppl to send in their resume. or u can try online jobhunt? i'm sure u deserve better treatments than this!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My 2cent worth of suggestion is that DONT sign any contract yet. Go look for jobs, and when u find a better one, TENDER ur ltr... If your boss really really treasure u or really need you, ASK FOR PAY INCREMENT! Or forget it. in both ways, its either u take up the new job OR u are better paid. :) Contract isn't that bad afterall though, at least u know that your job is stable... just that it really is disappointed after so long that u didnt get any raise... Ask for the raise!!! GO GO GO!!! =) U've my support, that's for sure.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Good luck ;)</p>

              <p>Thanks guys for the replies. :)</p>
              <p>Anyway, my boss talked to me about it again. He finally offered me a higher pay than what I got for now. This new contract is 6 months and has about the same staff benefits as perm staff except that there's no CPF. I don't really mind having no CPF as for now, and I decided that I can work there for a while more and earn a bit more money before seeking a better job future.</p>
              <p>Just wanna earn more experience, so yea.</p>
