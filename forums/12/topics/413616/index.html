              <p>you know what's the diference between a QA engineer wirting a COC and an inspector writing a COC? A sensible engineer will look through and look to all possiblity that the COC can or cannot cover, at the same time providing the customer a satifactory copy. the inspector, well will just go throough moment data entry type and paste from previous COC sample documents.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>you knwo what is a difernt between 2 QA engineers in experience and knowledge? one will quote wikipedia while the other will bring in sensible logical facts to rebute nonsensical customer claims. one will tell you that its reverse tooling setup cause a 'sink' in material while the otehr will tell you that materials actually can 'sink' by itself after solidification. old and i can tell you the inspectors and 'smart' engineers are all malaysians and peearses. they survive so long by remain cheap, fast(inaccurate), maintaining high 'EQ' and chaokeng got mental problem. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p><br>no lah, not all lady like this one lah, I am offended many a time and yet stay cool and happy. In working relationship, a lot of people put too much emotion into it, but in actually fact, in working, no emotion involve is the best, however, as human nature, there tends to have some of it, and especially come from ladies, (tho I am condemning my own gender), ladies are more prone to emotion reaction, they will shout and scream when things do not go well for them, and for those who are having period, can be more worst. But the good news is that tho we ladies may shout and scream, we do not keep it inside and sometime, think of it, we feel very remorseful, working with ladies, you did to know the mentality of lady working style.</p>
              <p>Most of these ladies are either getting family pressure, hubby having mistress, and yet have to struggler in work, just like the fat lady, she maybe under pressure for not getting bf, not getting marry and the pressure of being singlehood can be very stressful to a lady, so bear with it.</p>
              <p>As a lady, or gal myself, my advice is do not get emotional over it, during some function or cooling times, chat with her and let her know your dissatisfaction, buy her a drink or a lunch and talk it over, we lady are dear creature. Get it. You must be a mommy's boy coming here to talk about being abuse and shout at by a lady, a fat lady somemore.</p>

              <p>aiya people shouting at people usually happens at work. what happens at work should stay at home lah. very kp i know. but no point holding on to the emotions.<br><br>i work with this lady last time. she so kp i want to do something revengeful or to just make her stop. she can tell me do assist her do this, then later tell the boss i do wrongly. so its like similanjiao! kp ah.</p>
              <p>in the end i just resign. i very tempted to "HEY HEY! OEI" at her and give a finger but of course not lah siao! cos i know i will get better jobs somewhere else. my advice is just let go loh. why so serious! you know if you think too much, you react to it a lot more. like talk to your friends, you will also become very kp. like cranky lah. so just chill k.</p>

              <p>guys think more of the bigger picture than girls, who worry and fuss about unimportant things, that important things get neglected or never do at all.</p>
              <p>also girls love to gossip behind your back. we guys talk in front one, not behind your back one, thats the difference.</p>

              <p>At end of the day, both of you are just employees of a company.</p>
              <p>Learn to get over nonsense with people that pissed you off.</p>
              <p>Or else you have to endure a long cycle of war with her or her dept.</p>
              <p>Or you can focus your time and energy on some time else like soccer cos she is not worth any of your effort.</p>
              <p>Lastly, there may be some misunderstanding that led to her hair-dryer treatment towards you.</p>
              <p>If no misunderstanding, just take it that it is her bad day and you are just a victim of her anger.</p>
              <p>Full Blown War between you and her will not help matters and may affect your performance appraisal for EQ issues.</p>
