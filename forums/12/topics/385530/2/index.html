              <p>I am able to make basic conversations as a majority of my
              friends are chinese educated, but thats about it, is it advisable
              to take learn chinese before i learn another language, or is it
              possible to substitute it with another language?</p>
              <p>Just the wedding dinner alone, i have no idea how many people i
              will invite, but if held at a hotel or restaurant, each table would
              come up to about 800? On top of that, i must still give ang bao,
              photographers, photo shoot, wedding bands? did i miss anything out?
              i dont really need to know the exact details, but is 30k
              sufficient?</p>
              <p>Probably just renovate as i should be staying with my

              <p>No offence, but you're only 14, and you're already thinking of all this?</p>
              <p>I'm 26, and I'm getting married in early 2011. And only now am I working out all these nitty-gritty details. Go figure.</p>
              <p>There's nothing wrong in having a long-term view of things, but you're looking at things from too far out. You're really sweating the small stuff..... no, you're sweating the microscopic stuff.</p>
              <p>Not everything is in your hands, and there's only so much that you can (and should) be worrying about. Cross the bridge only when you actually get to it.</p>
              <p>Like Rockhound has so succintly said, if you're already seeking all the answers to all the questions in your life, then it's gonna be a really boring life.</p>

              <p>If you want an easy life:</p>
              <p>1) Don't put marriage into your plan. Successful men 'usually' marry later in life.</p>
              <p>2) Try to plan to leave singapore and work elsewhere, evaluate the conditions overseas then see if its beneficial to migrate.</p>
              <p>3) Get all the studies done in singapore. You may want to take masters overseas but in SG, bachelor degree is essential, work for a least 1~2 years to learn real skills from school of hard knocks.</p>
              <p>4) Don't sweat too much early in life, you could still enjoy your 'later childhood' and still able to meet your goals with a definate roadmap.</p>

              So i believe chinese would be the priority followed by jap.  
              
              i do understand that i have to consider the bride's side of the family, but that will come later i guess. i know that, but i think that it would be much safer to have some savings then, regardless of the amount?

              Im not sure why i'am thinking so ahead. but i haven't really planned yet, but i just want to know what lies ahead. what i am afraid is that at the end of all my hard work, I am unable to find a job or able to find a low paying job. i heard from my friend, if you are planning to be a business man, then qualifications is not as important, can anyone clarify this? 
              
              why do you say to plan to leave singapore? every country will have pros and cons, but being the only child, i dont think it's advisable to migrate?

              <p>If you are worried about amount, just keep saving as much as you can. Money is something you will never have too much of.</p>
              <p>There is no point worrying about future jobs because noone knows the economy at the time you graduate and start to find work. During bad economy, everyone has a hard time finding a job and vice versa. Sometimes you can consider taking a lower paying job 1st while continue to search for a better job so that you won't be eating into your savings.</p>
              <p>If you plan to be a businessman, you require experience, knowledge of market etc etc, quite different from what you study in school. Furthermore, all you need is alot of money and not really alot of paper qualifications.</p>

              <p><br>Actually more than just a joke.</p>
              <p>Some insurance companies and their agents (had to generalise sorry).. actually target people who are less confident in life, especially younger peeps.</p>
              <p>Well, older peeps also get sucked into the same old (maybe they volunteered for it but younger peeps have more fantasy xD):</p>
              <p>1) Financial Freedom</p>
              <p>2) Freedom of working at any time you want.</p>
              <p>3) Freedom of owning business.</p>
              <p>4) Sustainable business (esp for insurance).</p>
              <p>5) There is always the need for the product (life insurance xD)</p>
              <p>Basically the idea is that they sell the idea that YOU (I mean YOU) can control your financial life, and the more clients you get during your stint as insurance agent, you gain more money as times goes by!!!!!</p>

              <p>PS. Am i thinking too much too early or is this good?</p>
