              Hi, I am a guy, 14, and currently in high school. I've noticed that there are a number of people out there with diplomas, or even graduates in their 30's are unable to find a stable job and have to scrimp and save up for years just to get married, or get a house. Is this because the cost of living here in singapore is getting higher, or is it due to their personal mindset and are unwilling to change or are being too inflexible, or are all the jobs opportunities being taken away by foreigners(I highly doubt)?
              
              Lets say that i will get my high school diploma in 3years, by that time, i would be 17.  After which, do i have to take NS or will i be able to defer it, as i have plans to enter university thereafter. Would you recommend our local universities or those abroad. With those certificates, what jobs will i be applicable for? Or would you recommend that i further my studies after that(money is not a big problem, it's just the time and whether it's worth it)? Im totally clueless on the procedure. 
              
              Suppose i finish my studies by 24, how long will it take for me to get a job? Im hoping to settle around 28 or early 30's(Is this an average age to get married?). How much would an average wedding cost? i estimate it to be between 20-30k all together, is that sufficient? I believe accommodation is not problem, as i am the only child in the family. Perhaps some renovations and new furniture, how much would that cost(HDB)? What would be the approximate monthly bill inclusive of, electricity, water, h/p, broadband, did i miss anything out? If I were to get a car, how much will the average upkeep cost? 
              
              Really hoping for your valuable  replies, as i am pretty stressed out. Please give me some constructive  answers, as i am trying to calculate how much i need to save by the time i am 30. Thanks
              
              PS. Am i thinking too much too early or is this good?

              <p>Gunner, this are the type of people that will succeed in life if they meet the right people. It's rare for 14 year old people to display such vision. At 14 yrs old there are a lot of mother fvckers in my school still masturbating at Pikachu and anime crap.</p>

              <p>I think this topic is better posted in the Homework Forum where the regular posters can give the TS sound advice.</p>

              <p>Why worried so much ? The whole world is like that.</p>
              <p><br>2 factors that will determine your future - yourself ( hardwork )and the rest is down to luck.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Times changes - thus demands and pay of jobs have change. But a lot have to depend on company and luck - as some still pay super, while other sucks. Also people have cultivate bad spending - which jack up the money they need per month. <br><br>One advice is to cultivate saving, really save whatever you can and buy only want you really need only.</p>

              Exactly, i don't know why i am so worried. Since you  say the whole world is like that, probably thats why i want to know where they went wrong, so i won't follow their steps. I know that the first step is to work hard in my studies, but what if in another 10  years time, the world changes, i am afraid my efforts would be wasted. Sure there will be more foreigners coming, and more graduates to compete with.  
              
              As for savings, i get about $80 a week, inclusive of meals and whatever i want to buy. Im planning to save at least 30k by the age of 30. So i will have to save $6 a day, minimum 40 a week. I don't spend money on clothes, computer games.ect but the problem is i spend about $50 a week on cigarettes. i have tried to quit twice but failed. regardless of that, saving $40 a week is a must, and i can do what i like with the remaining. 
              
              Also what is the average salary need to live comfortably? 
              
              Thanks for all the your replies.

              <p>If you are really concern about your future.</p>
              <p>14 years old. You could be taking on extra courses, work assignments or even church assignments that can take you out of the country.</p>
              <p>This is the time to flex your mind and body muscles.  Meet more people outside your social circle and learn new things.</p>
              <p>Try picking up juggling, clowning and even balloon sculpting.  Ever considered picking the skills to handle audio visuals for church or school events?  Photography to eventually take pictures for events?  Or even video editing?  You can learn these thru Church or Volunteer organisations.  Or even thru CCA?</p>
              <p>Have you considered taking on social and latin dancing classes?  You can eventually open up your social circle and your possibility to create a separate career niche besides the standard, go to university, get a degree and work to earn money as a regular white collared worker.</p>

              Im planning to take up drums as a CCA next year. As school term starts next year, time would be an issue, as there would be CCA as well as extra lessons which should end around 5. Do you think that taking up a second language like spanish, french.etc would be an advantage? What extra courses or work assignments are you referring to?
              
              I have not really considered to take up other courses like photography, and i would say that entertainment like jugging, clowning would be a nono for me. I am not keen on dancing, but i used to take up canoeing previously. Do you know if there are any organizations in singapore that offer canoeing?
              
              What you said is true, my social circle is pretty small now, what step should i take to widen it?

              <p>Yes extra CCA is good.  Drums might get you gigs as drum player during your free time eventually. So is photography and learning how to scuplt balloons.</p>
              <p>Does your canone-ing probably means you might have a chance to become a canoe instructor, full or part time, in future?</p>
              <p>How about swimming and getting the life guard certifications?</p>
              <p>Languages are good.  So you have a wider choice of jobs, positions and even activities in future.  Just make sure your languages you picked up, comes with certifications like 'O' levels at least, to make a impact on your resume.</p>

              <p>If you plan to work in SG, a local degree is alot better than a private degree which is not always recognised and chances are they have an even harder time finding jobs. However you will be required to complete your NS before you can apply for local uni.</p>
              <p>20-30k for marriage is very low i believe unless you intend to skip all the wedding dinner and stuff. However do note that as you grow older, you will start to have more expenses so your savings will not be fixed unless you savings continue to keep rising as well. When you start working, the salary you get should also add more to your savings.</p>
              <p>Additional language is only useful if you plan to work or travel to that country or the company you might want to work for is of that nationality if not its more learnt for interest than really much practical use.</p>
              <p>Taking part in activities outside of school should help widen your social circle rather than locking yourself at home each day after school.</p>

              <p>Magic, clowning, juggling and balloon scuplting, builds your brain, your co-ordination and provide even a alternative carreer to fall back on.  Also, they are highly entertainly to the young and old.</p>
              <p>Even without using it as a carreer option, it helps to build up your social circle and invites friends and admirers.</p>
              <p>Same with dancing. Most dance instructors in Singapore, are usually professional in their day time and teaches dancing or compete in dancing as a part time or hobby.</p>
              <p>As of now.  I can see that you are still the standard teenager looking at your future and planning your future in the generic way.  If you refuse to consider alternatives.  Then stick to what you know best and plan for academic achievements thru the generic way.</p>

              No, i used to take canoeing as a CCA in my previous school, i would say it is just to train up, as i don't have the discipline to exercise regularly with no one pushing me. Also, i might get to know some people there, as for becoming  an instructor, i have no intentions to. 
              
              i am not interested in getting life guard certifications, nor do i really enjoy swimming, canoeing is different because the training is more intense.
              
              As i was exempted from chinese in primary school, i am a little afraid to take on a second language. i believe my school offers courses for other languages, if so, what language is demanded by the world today? It's likely i will stay in Singapore

              <p>If you did not take chinese, i would say that is an important and useful langauge to have since China has 1 of the biggest market and many S'pore companies are expanding into China or working with China counterparts.</p>

              <p>It depends on alot of factors like how much people you might wanna invite for wedding dinner or not have it, planning to buy new house or not, renovate or not, planning to have children etc etc. Everything have variables that will affect the costs quite alot.</p>

              I am able to make basic conversations as a majority of my friends are chinese educated, but thats about it, is it advisable to take learn chinese before i learn another language, or is it possible to substitute it with another language? 
              
              Just the wedding dinner alone, i have no idea how many people i will invite, but if held at a hotel or restaurant, each table would come up to about 800? On top of that, i must still give ang bao, photographers, photo shoot, wedding bands? did i miss anything out? i dont really need to know the exact details, but is 30k sufficient? 
              
              Probably just renovate as i should be staying with my parents.

              <p>When you work with chinese, you might need to be able to read and write chinese as well so its more used than any other language out there. Next up might be Jap since there are a number of jap companies in Sg or maybe Spanish since thats a language that most people in Europe all speak though that is more useful for holiday than work.</p>
              <p>For weddings, do note that you have to consider the bride side of the family as well so its not only yourself. 30k should be enough for most general weddings but do note that 30k now and 30k when you reach 30 has a different value.</p>
