              <p>...<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">But this had subtle results; it made women more independent and more outspoken.</span></strong></p>
              <p>Bourgeois men gradually <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">came to live under a regime of persistent nagging</span></strong> to become <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">"better providers." </span></strong></p>
              <p>To many men, work became a refuge and a relief from domestic revelations of the inadequacy of their performance as economic achievers.</p>
              <p>This <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">growth of overwork, of constant tension, of frustration of emotional life and of leisure</span></strong> began to make more and more men increasingly willing to accept death as the only method of achieving rest.</p>
              <p>Bourgeois men literally began to kill themselves, by unconscious psychic suicide, from overwork, neurotic overindulgence in alcohol, smoking, work, and violent leisure, and the <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">middle class slowly increased its proportion of materially endowed widows.</span></strong></p>
              <p>     One notable change in this whole process <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">was a shift,</span></strong> over the past century, from the male-dominated family to a female-dominated family.</p>
              <p>The locality in which the young couple set up their home had an increasing tendency to be matrilocal rather than patrilocal.</p>
              <p>In increasing numbers of cases, where the young couple married before the groom's educational process was finished, they even lived with her family (but very rarely with his family).</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Increasingly part of the burden of housework was shifted to the husband:</span></strong> washing dishes, buying groceries, even tending the children.</p>
              <p>In 1840 a child could cry at night and would invariably be tended by its mother, while the father slept peacefully on, totally unaware of what was going on.</p>
              <p>By 1960, if a child cried at night, the chances were as likely as not that the mother would hear nothing while the father took over the necessary activities.</p>
              <p>If this were questioned by anyone, the mother's retort was pointed: <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">"I take care of baby all day; I don't see why he can't take care of it at night!".</span></strong></p>
              <p>     Closely<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> related to this confusion, or even reversal,</span></strong> of the social roles of the sexes was decreasing sexual differentiation in child-rearing practices.</p>
              <p>As <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">recently as the 1920's girl babies were reared differently from boys. </span></strong></p>
              <p>They were dressed differently, treated differently, permitted to do different things, and admonished about different dangers.</p>
              <p>By <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1960, children, regardless of sex, were all being brought up the same.</span></strong></p>
              <p>Indeed, with short cropped hair and play-suits on both, it became impossible to be sure which was which.</p>
              <p>This<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> led to a decrease in the personality differences of men and women</span></strong>, with<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> males becoming more submissive and females more aggressive.</span></strong></p>
              <p>     This tendency was <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">accelerated by new techniques of education, especially in the first twelve years of life. </span></strong></p>
              <p>The neurological maturation of girls was faster shall that of boys, especially in regard to coordination, such as in feeding oneself, talking, dressing oneself, toilet-training, learning to read, and general adjustment to school.</p>
              <p>The <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">shift from home to school in the early grades was adjusted to by girls more easily than by boys,</span></strong> partly because girls were more self-assured and gregarious.</p>
              <p>By the age of ten or twelve,<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> girls were developed physically, neurologically, emotionally, and socially about two years in advance of boys. </span></strong></p>
              <p>All this tended to make boys less self-assured, indecisive, weak, and dependent.</p>
              <p>The steady increase in the percentage of women teachers in the lower grades worked in the same direction, since women teachers favored girls and praised those attitudes and techniques that were more natural to girls.</p>
              <p>New methods, such as the whole-word method of teaching reading or the use of true-and-false or multiple-choice examinations, were also better adapted to female than to masculine talents.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Less and less emphasis was placed on critical judgment, while more and more was placed on intuitive or subjective decisions.</span></strong></p>
              <p>In this environment girls did better, and boys felt inferior or decided that school was a place for girls and not for boys.</p>
              <p>The<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> growing aggressiveness of girls pushed these hesitant boys aside and intensified the problem.</span></strong></p>
              <p>As consequences of this, boys had twice as many "non-readers" as girls, several times as many stutterers, and many times as many teen-age bed-wetters.</p>
              <p>     While the outside world was decreasing its differential treatment of children on a sexual basis by treating boys and girls more and more alike (and that treatment was better adapted to girls than to boys) within the middle-class home, the <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">growing emotional frustrations of the mother were leading to an increasing distinction on a sexual basis in her emotional treatment of her children...</span></strong></p>
              <p><a href="http://real-world-news.org/bk-quigley/20.html#75">http://real-world-news.org/bk-quigley/20.html#75</a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"> </span></p>
              <p>In the nineteenth century <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">three things came fairly close together in the fifteen to seventeen age bracket: </span></strong></p>
              <p>(1) sexual awareness;</p>
              <p>(2) emotional readiness for sex; and</p>
              <p>(3) the ending of education and the opportunity to seek economic independence from parents.</p>
              <p>Today sexual awareness comes very early for all, perhaps around the age of ten.</p>
              <p>Emotional readiness to face the fact of one's own sexuality comes earlier and earlier for the girl today, but later and later for the boy, chiefly because the middle-class mother forces independence and recognition of the fact that she is a woman upon her daughter but forces dependence and blindness to the fact that he is a man upon her son.</p>
              <p>And <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">the date for the ending of education and seeking economic independence from parents gets somewhat later for girls but immensely later for men (a process that becomes increasingly extravagant).</span></strong></p>
              <p>     One result of this is that the much greater (sometimes indefinitely postponed) delay for a boy of emotional readiness after sexual awareness leaves<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> the boy emotionally desexed for so long that it affects his sexuality and emotional maturity adversely and to an increasingly advanced age. </span></strong>But the opposite is true for a girl, because of the shorter and decreasing lag of her emotional readiness after her sexual awareness.</p>
              <p>Lolita, who is not as rare as the readers of that novel wanted to imagine, becomes increasingly frequent, and <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cannot be satisfied by boys of her own age; </span></strong>consequently she seeks for many reasons, including financial resources and greater emotional maturity, her sex companions among older men.</p>
              <p>     On the other hand,<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> the position of the middle-class boy becomes even more complex and pitiful...</span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>

                  before the groom's educational process was finished, they even
                  lived with her family (but very rarely with his family).</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Increasingly
                  part of the burden of housework was shifted to the
                  husband:</span></strong> washing dishes, buying groceries, even
                  tending the children.</p>
              <p>In 1840 a child could cry at night and would invariably be
                  tended by its mother, while the father slept peacefully on, totally
                  unaware of what was going on.</p>
              <p>By 1960, if a child cried at night, the chances were as likely
                  as not that the mother would hear nothing while the father took
                  over the necessary activities.</p>
              <p>If this were questioned by anyone, the mother's retort was
                  pointed: <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">"I take
                  care of baby all day; I don't see why he can't take care of it at
                  night!".</span></strong></p>
              <p>     Closely <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">related to this confusion, or even
                  reversal,</span></strong> of the social roles of the sexes was
                  decreasing sexual differentiation in child-rearing practices.</p>
              <p>As <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">recently as
                  the 1920's girl babies were reared differently from
                  boys.</span></strong></p>
              <p>They were dressed differently, treated differently, permitted to
                  do different things, and admonished about different dangers.</p>
              <p>By <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1960,
                  children, regardless of sex, were all being brought up the
                  same.</span></strong></p>
              <p>Indeed, with short cropped hair and play-suits on both, it
                  became impossible to be sure which was which.</p>
              <p>This <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">led to a
                  decrease in the personality differences of men and
                  women</span></strong>, with <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">males becoming more submissive and
                  females more aggressive.</span></strong></p>
              <p>     This tendency was
                  <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">accelerated by
                  new techniques of education, especially in the first twelve years
                  of life.</span></strong></p>
              <p>The neurological maturation of girls was faster shall that of
                  boys, especially in regard to coordination, such as in feeding
                  oneself, talking, dressing oneself, toilet-training, learning to
                  read, and general adjustment to school.</p>
              <p>The <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">shift from
                  home to school in the early grades was adjusted to by girls more
                  easily than by boys,</span></strong> partly because girls were more
                  self-assured and gregarious.</p>
              <p>By the age of ten or twelve, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">girls were developed physically,
                  neurologically, emotionally, and socially about two years in
                  advance of boys.</span></strong></p>
              <p>All this tended to make boys less self-assured, indecisive,
                  weak, and dependent.</p>
              <p>The steady increase in the percentage of women teachers in the
                  lower grades worked in the same direction, since women teachers
                  favored girls and praised those attitudes and techniques that were
                  more natural to girls.</p>
              <p>New methods, such as the whole-word method of teaching reading
                  or the use of true-and-false or multiple-choice examinations, were
                  also better adapted to female than to masculine talents.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Less and less
                  emphasis was placed on critical judgment, while more and more was
                  placed on intuitive or subjective decisions.</span></strong></p>
              <p>In this environment girls did better, and boys felt inferior or
                  decided that school was a place for girls and not for boys.</p>
              <p>The <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">growing
                  aggressiveness of girls pushed these hesitant boys aside and
                  intensified the problem.</span></strong></p>
              <p>As consequences of this, boys had twice as many "non-readers" as
                  girls, several times as many stutterers, and many times as many
                  teen-age bed-wetters.</p>
              <p>     While the outside world was
                  decreasing its differential treatment of children on a sexual basis
                  by treating boys and girls more and more alike (and that treatment
                  was better adapted to girls than to boys) within the middle-class
                  home, the <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">growing
                  emotional frustrations of the mother were leading to an increasing
                  distinction on a sexual basis in her emotional treatment of her
                  children...</span></strong></p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://real-world-news.org/bk-quigley/20.html#75">http://real-world-news.org/bk-quigley/20.html#75</a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In the nineteenth century <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">three things came fairly close
                  together in the fifteen to seventeen age
                  bracket:</span></strong></p>
              <p>(1) sexual awareness;</p>
              <p>(2) emotional readiness for sex; and</p>
              <p>(3) the ending of education and the opportunity to seek economic
                  independence from parents.</p>
              <p>Today sexual awareness comes very early for all, perhaps around
                  the age of ten.</p>
              <p>Emotional readiness to face the fact of one's own sexuality
                  comes earlier and earlier for the girl today, but later and later
                  for the boy, chiefly because the middle-class mother forces
                  independence and recognition of the fact that she is a woman upon
                  her daughter but forces dependence and blindness to the fact that
                  he is a man upon her son.</p>
              <p>And <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">the date
                  for the ending of education and seeking economic independence from
                  parents gets somewhat later for girls but immensely later for men
                  (a process that becomes increasingly
                  extravagant).</span></strong></p>
              <p>     One result of this is that the
                  much greater (sometimes indefinitely postponed) delay for a boy of
                  emotional readiness after sexual awareness leaves
                  <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">the boy
                  emotionally desexed for so long that it affects his sexuality and
                  emotional maturity adversely and to an increasingly advanced
                  age.</span></strong> But the opposite is true for a girl, because
                  of the shorter and decreasing lag of her emotional readiness after
                  her sexual awareness.</p>
              <p>Lolita, who is not as rare as the readers of that novel wanted
                  to imagine, becomes increasingly frequent, and <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cannot be satisfied by boys of her
                  own age;</span></strong> consequently she seeks for many reasons,
                  including financial resources and greater emotional maturity, her
                  sex companions among older men.</p>
              <p>     On the other hand,
                  <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">the position of
                  the middle-class boy becomes even more complex and
                  pitiful...</span></strong></p>

              <p>http://www.sammyboyforum.com/showthread.php?t=185736</p>
              <p>Hor sie liao Bro! U &amp; I are INDEED on the same boat! In
                  fact, I'm beginning to wonder if we married the same wife
                  <img title="eek!" src="http://www.sammyboyforum.com/images/smilies/eek.gif" alt=""><img title="big grin" src="http://www.sammyboyforum.com/images/smilies/biggrin.gif" alt=""> You've just completely spelt out my agony! No sex for a few months,
                  and then when I asked for it, she quoted one of her friends' hubby
                  who've NOT had sex for 1 year, ever since the wife pregnant until
                  the baby now 6-months plus liao. I tulan &amp; said then u go &amp;
                  marry him for a sexless marriage lah! then she flew into a rage
                  &amp; said why must I always kick a big fuss about sex? If no sex
                  will I die? If won't die then stop complaining! My jaws just
                  dropped to the floor ... )<br> <br> Then last week, she suddenly asked from me a full-body massage, so
                  I thought got chance liao, and I gave a a truly sensual massage,
                  &amp; she was feeling so comfortable that she felt asleep. So when
                  I gently flipped her over for the front massage, and threw in all
                  the necessary titillations of the breasts &amp; pussy after the
                  whole thing, she suddenly opened her eyes and said to me:" You
                  pervert! Don't disturb me lah! I need my beauty sleep now! Go turn
                  off the lights &amp; if you still got so much energy, then go out
                  &amp; play your laptop / FB / PS3!" Again, my jaws dropped to the
                  floor ... (&amp; I ended my night by going to the toilet to PCC
                  'cos I already so aroused when I was massaging for her in
                  nude!)<br> <br> &amp; on those days when she granted me with sex, which I can
                  unfortunately count using my fingers, she'd be making the deed
                  seems like a torture to her, complaining that she did it just to
                  satisfy me, why never wash every part of my body thoroughly, no
                  painting, no bbbj, no DATY 'cos all these very unhygienic, &amp;
                  when I tried to suggest some sex-toys or different positions or
                  role-plays to spice up the acts, she retorted that she's NOT an AV
                  porn star, so don't try to demean her by asking her to do "all
                  these stupid things" ... Once again, you've guessed correctly, my

              <p>The blind leading the blind. Even a gay can't teach a man about a woman.</p>
              <p> They have their own private ride.. but had to take the public buses with the bangalas and foreign workers.. amazing.</p>
              <p>Men want virgin wifes.. right ? Serves them right.</p>
              <p>How is a man gonna determine if that virgin is sexually compatible with him ?</p>
              <p>Marrying a virgin wife is like taking a gamble.. it's a hit and miss. Even if it's a miss.. they don't know how to trick up their ride nor figure out why their wifes are not responding.</p>
              <p>It's so sad to read that thread...</p>

              <p>"<strong>Re: Extramarital Affair: Truly in love with each other</strong></p>
              <div class="smallfont"></div>
              <hr style="color: #ffffff; background-color: #ffffff;">
              <div id="post_message_6175054">May I ask, when you find that gaps are widening between you and your 
              wife, did you attempt to do stuff that you used to do for her while you 
              both were dating, to at least remind her why she'd said, I do.... when 
              you both married? <br> <br> Harsh words were used on you, but were there neglects you used on her? 
              Instead of thinking that you'd suffered quite a bit in your 
              relationship, have you seen whether you wife had suffered as much? <br> <br> Have you tried romancing her once again? Leaving kids behind and go for a
               'once again' Honeymoon? Candlelight dinner? Surprise gift? Flowers... 
              and kiss her after you tell her that you love her, right in front of the
               kids? <br> <br> Right here, I'm speaking from the perspective of a wife. Of a woman. And, I was a victim of an extramarital affair. <br> <br> My hubby complained almost the same issue as you. Felt that the gap 
              between him and me and widened to beyond repair stage. Felt that I was 
              violent against him and he was the one whom had taken all the blows from
               me. <br> <br> What he couldn't understand is, I yearned for his touch, his concern, 
              his care... his loving words towards me. A kiss when I'm down, and when 
              I'm almost to a verge of explosion from stress from kids and family.... I
               want him to just step out and hug me. Telling me he's there with me. 
              But, he chose to hide at work, hide in computer room... and eventually, 
              seek solace in another. <br> <br> As for me, I admit that I wasn't that exactly nice to him for a while. I
               had chosen to express my frustration in a very wrong way. I had said 
              harsh words to him when I see him rather spending on dinners out with 
              friends, on his car... and his cigerattes. It's been 7 yrs since I'd 
              last received a present from him. He missed my birthday every single 
              yr... Where for me, I will surprise him on his birthday without fail, a 
              holiday, a gift, or just a surprise party. But none for me.... thus, I 
              chose to give him black face most of the time. Instead of choosing to 
              talk to him what is making me upset. <br> <br> And when he was with her, they went for holidays at his own expense, and
               diamond necklaces, flowers... movies... you name it. I don't wish to 
              think back anymore. <br> <br> You and your colleague had spent too much time with each other. Thus the
               emotional bond happened. Both of you are not staying together, thus 
              everything is still so wonderfully romantic for both of you. <br> <br> What if one day, you start to see how she pluck the hair from her 
              underarm? And wake up to a rather nasty smell from her breath when she 
              tried to be romantic by kissing you good morning. Then eventually, 
              telling you why aren't you both able to enjoy a nice holiday at Europe 
              every once a yr? Does all the stress sets in again? Doesn't 
              communication plays a part in every single sort of relationship? Be it 
              friendship/BGR/Parents and child/In-laws? <br> <br> You just sorely lacked communications with your wife. Thus it pushed you towards her. <br> <br> But, if you still strongly felt that 'she' is for you.... then please do
               not hurt your family anymore. Just be frank with your wife and break 
              things off totally, before you can proceed with your 'showing of 
              affection openly', and 'do everything without public attention'. Don't 
              hurt your kids anymore. They are the most innocent. <br> <br> Good luck to you, from a lady's point of view..."</div>

              <p>Malaysia/Philipines got plenty of land.. lifestyle is very different than Singapore.</p>
              <p>Singapore is competitive/cut throat . Small island.. and high cost of living leh.</p>
              <p>You think you can survive with just the 5A in SG ? Go think again.</p>
              <p>If you want.. you have to move to Malaysia or Philipines.. that way.. your wife and children will remain as "down to earth" as they are because they don't need to live like a Singapore resident.</p>

              <p>Marrying a virgin wife is like taking a gamble.. it's a hit and

              <p>How did you get sidetracked into talking about virgin brides? Firstly nobody here nor there was talking about it.</p>
              <p>Secondly we men don't wait until after ROM to deflower our bride. We find out first about sexual compatibility.</p>
              <p>Looking at all your posts in Sgforums, I would think you are a female chauvinist pig, or a militant butch, swinging an AK-47 in place of a penis, yelling "men are evil!" and shooting at all men in your way.</p>
              <p>Where a marriage is happy you are jealous, where it is unhappy you blame the man.</p>

              Hi, hope my sharing will help.
              
              Firstly, I have to set the record straight before saying anything, " I must confess that I have lots of weakness in my life and I am truly amaze how my wife could put up with me over the years "
              
              And the reason for this sharing is to Â encourage and not to tear down.
              
              Recently, I told my wife that my sexual urge has lessen, may be because I am getting old and her immediate response was "that's great!!!"Â 
              
              When we Â first got married, my parents went through bankruptcy during the asian crisis and were unable to help me with my wedding.Â 
              
              And I remember when we were having our first child, we had to move in with my in-laws to save up for a deposit for a house.Â 
              
              Before the baby came, we had a healthy and enjoyable sexual life.Â 
              
              But after the baby came, she started avoiding my sexual advances and we had lots of arguments Â and quarrels. And I had the same thoughts of leaving her too because I felt that her whole focus is on the baby and not on me anymore.
              
              And to make matter worst, due to our financial constraints, the 3 of us had to squeeze in a small room for 1 year. With my wife sleeping on her single bed and me on the floor and the baby in a cot.
              
              By the grace of God, we managed to push through together. My wife would tease me sometimes of those days when I used to sleep in the car when I got upset with her.Â 
              
              My breakthrough came when we had twins. With the other kids, I use to help her with some of the night feeds.Â 
              
              But with the twins, I had to help her throughout the night and go to work in the day until the twins were old enough to sleep through the night. I was in a daze for a couple of months.Â 
              
              Only mothers will understand the tiredness of caring for a newborn. The baby may take 1 hour to drink the milk, 1 hour to burp, sleep 1 hour and the cycle goes round the clock for 24 hours and until the baby learns to sleep through the night. Â Â 
              
              For once in my life, I understand what it means Â " to give unconditionally ".
              
              I grew up in Singapore having been told not to wash my own cup by my parents and to leave them to the maid. And even after I got married, Â my wife took good care of me, &amp; when the older kids came, my wife still did most of the hard work of up-keeping the house.
              
              It was only until the twins came that I really appreciated my wife. I realize that I had been very selfish and had never really cared for her but was more concern about myself and my needs. I never Â understood how hard it was to care for a baby...
              
              God has blessed us since and we are currently living overseas and I am now Â a senior manager in a company, I leave work at 5 pm everyday Â to go home and spent time with my family.Â 
              
              I help with the kids on the weekends and do the cleanng, vacuuming of the house and the maintainenance of the garden &amp; I am glad I kept my vow.
              
              "I -- take you -- to be my wedded wife. To have and to hold, from this day forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness or in health, to love and to cherish till death do us part."
              
              And may be your wife may also be concern about having another child for various reasons eg: financial worries, work pressures... that is why she may reject your advances.
              
              And child birth is also a very painful experience for most ladies which is why sex may not look as appealing as before.
              
              Your wife is like a flower that needs lots of love and care. The more love you shower on her, the more radiant she becomes.
