              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>I am here because I have no one to turn to so I am sharing my
              story here and hope someone will be listening.</p>
              <p>I have been married for 3 1/2 yrs. Initially I am enjoying what
              I have (Our newly renovation flat, my caring wife, I have a car to
              drive. Although I dislike my job)</p>
              <p>However over this 3 1/2 yrs things have changed, and this is
              what I feel. We have a lovely baby at the beginning of the year and
              because of that, my wife pay a lot of attention to him. She will
              clean the house amount everyday because she want to make sure that
              the environment is clean for the baby. She is a very good mum which
              I don't think I can do thing to that extreme. (still many thing she
              did for our baby but too long to put in word here)</p>
              <p>At time I began to get jealous with my baby (just jealous but
              still I love him like most father do) as most of the attention was
              switch to our baby. Here focus was on him every min and I know she
              always miss him as he was taken care by my in law. I have even
              suggested before that she go to her mother place to stay just to be
              with him but she don't want just because she say she don't want to
              lift me alone at home. (I really appreciate that)</p>
              <p>However when she is at home she is always doing housework,
              watching Taiwanese TV show and we have no time together. The
              worst thing is whenever I request for sex she rejected me, telling
              me she is very tired but she keep watch tv till 12am plus plus.
              Sometime she agree to it but she was always asking me to be faster
              and she mention I just want to get over it. I am really hurt as
              isn't sex part of what a married couple need and yet she is giving
              me the feeling of I am always forcing her?</p>
              <p>I am really lost and I do not know what to do. When I talk to
              her, just 2-3 min she get angry and saying all the bad habit I have
              rather than solving our problem. There no way problem can be solve
              when she do not want to listen and solve them.</p>
              <p>Nowadays there are thinking coming into my mind. I am thinking
              whether have I married the corrrect girl. I have started to look at
              girls on the street thinking whether I can find a better option and
              what I need. I am thinking but controlling as we have a baby now. I
              am not saying I don't love my wife anymore but she is showing me
              that kind of feeling that I am not needed and I do not want to left
              alone and lonely. I am scare of being lonely.</p>

              <p>No. I have not experienced it before. But the stories are all the same. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"> </span></p>
              <p>Three generations ago the<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> bourgeois wife rarely became aware of her frustrations. </span></span></strong>She was largely confined to her home, was kept too busy with children and housework to find much time for meditation on her situation or for comparison with other wives or the outside world generally.</p>
              <p>Brought up in a male-dominated family, she was prepared to accept a similar situation in her own life. This means that her outside contacts and her general picture of the world came to her through the screen of her husband's vision of these things.</p>
              <p>     The <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">decrease in the number of children in middle-class families and the spread of labor-saving devices, from vacuum cleaners to frozen foods, gave the bourgeois wife increasing leisure in the 1920's and 1930's.</span></span></strong> Enterprising editors like Edwin Bok filled that leisure with new slick women's magazines (like the <em>Ladies' Home Journal</em>).</p>
              <p>Popular novels and, to a lesser extent, the early movies, dramatic matinees, and spreading women's clubs allowed women to build up a vision of a fantasy world of romantic love and carefree, middle-class housewives with dazzling homes and well-behaved and well-scrubbed children. By 1925 the average bourgeois housewife was becoming increasingly frustrated because her own life was not that pictured in the women's magazines.</p>
              <p>Her increasing leisure gave her time to think about it, and her more frequent contact with other wives encouraged her to raise her voice in criticism of her husband whose financial inability to provide her with the life she came to regard as her due seemed to her to justify her desire to nag him onward to greater effort in pursuit of money. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">To him this became nagging; to her it was only an occasional reminder of the expectations under which she had entered upon the marriage relationship.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p>     While this was going on, the outside world was also changing. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Women became "emancipated" as a consequence of World War I</span></span></strong>, with considerable urging onward from the women's magazines. Shorter skirts and shorter hair became symbols of this process, but even more significant was the appearance in the outside world of a great increase in the number of jobs that could be done best, or only, by women.</p>
              <p>As part of this process, there took place considerable changes in bourgeois morality, the ending of chaperonage, greater freedom between the sexes, and the acceptance of divorce as morally possible in bourgeois life (a custom that came in from the stage and cinema).</p>
              <p>     <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">As part of this whole process, there occurred a dramatic event of great social significance.</span></strong> This was <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">the reversal in longevity expectations of men and women in adult life. </span></span></strong>A century ago (to be sure, in a largely rural context), a twenty-year-old man could expect to live longer than a twenty-year-old wife.</p>
              <p>In fact, such a man might well bury two or three wives, usually from the mortality associated with childbirth or other female problems. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Today, a twenty-year-old man has little expectation of living as long as a twenty-year-old woman. </span></span></strong></p>
              <p>To make matters worse, a twenty-year-old woman a century ago married a man considerably older than herself, at least in the middle classes, simply because future preference required that a man be established economically before he began to raise a family...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">
              </span></p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">  But this had subtle results; it made women more independent and more outspoken. </span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong>Bourgeois men gradually came to live under a regime of persistent nagging to become "better providers."</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">To many men, work became a refuge and a relief from domestic revelations of the inadequacy of their performance as economic achievers. </span></span></strong></p>
              <p>This growth of overwork, of constant tension, of frustration of emotional life and of leisure began to make more and more men increasingly willing to accept death as the only method of achieving rest.</p>
              <p>Bourgeois men literally began to kill themselves, by unconscious psychic suicide, from overwork, neurotic overindulgence in alcohol, smoking, work, and violent leisure, and the middle class slowly increased its proportion of materially endowed widows.</p>
              <p>     One notable<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> change in this whole process was a shift, over the past century, from the male-dominated family to a female-dominated family. </span></span></strong></p>
              <p>The locality in which the young couple set up their home had an increasing tendency to be matrilocal rather than patrilocal.</p>
              <p>In increasing numbers of cases, where the young couple married before the groom's educational process was finished, they even lived with her family (but very rarely with his family). Increasingly part of the burden of housework was shifted to the husband: washing dishes, buying groceries, even tending the children.</p>
              <p>In 1840 a child could cry at night and would invariably be tended by its mother, while the father slept peacefully on, totally unaware of what was going on.</p>
              <p>By 1960, if a child cried at night, the chances were as likely as not that the mother would hear nothing while the father took over the necessary activities. If this were questioned by anyone, the mother's retort was pointed: "I take care of baby all day; I don't see why he can't take care of it at night!"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: small;">...</span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 20px; line-height: normal;">This tendency was accelerated by new techniques of education, especially in the first twelve years of life. </span><p></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 20px; line-height: normal;">The neurological maturation of girls was faster shall that of boys, especially in regard to coordination, such as in feeding oneself, talking, dressing oneself, toilet-training, learning to read, and general adjustment to school. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 20px; line-height: normal;">The shift from home to school in the early grades was adjusted to by girls more easily than by boys, partly because girls were more self-assured and gregarious. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 20px; line-height: normal;">By the age of ten or twelve, girls were developed physically, neurologically, emotionally, and socially about two years in advance of boys...</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 20px; line-height: normal;">...The <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">earliest feeling of sensual reassurance and comfort any child experiences is against the body of its mother. </span></span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 20px; line-height: normal;">To a <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">boy baby this is a heterosexual relationship</span></strong>, while to the girl it is a <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">relationship with the same sex. </span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 20px; line-height: normal;">In most cases the<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> little girl avoids any undesirable persistence of this homosexual tendency by shifting her admiration and attention to some available male, usually her father. </span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 20px; line-height: normal;">Thus by the age of six or eight, a daughter has become "Daddy's girl," awaiting his return from work to communicate the news of the day, getting his slippers and newspaper, and hoping that he will read her a story or share her viewing of a favorite television program before she must go to bed.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 20px; line-height: normal;"> By the age of twelve, in a normal girl, this interest in male creatures has begun to shift to some boy in her class at school. With a boy baby the transference is later and less gradual...</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"> </span></p>
              <p>...the emotional relation of the wife to her husband is insecure, and the more her husband buries himself in his work, hobbies, or outside interests, the more insecure and unsatisfactory it becomes for his wife.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Part of the wife's unused emotional energy begins to be expended in her love for her son.</span></span></strong> At the same time, because of the emotional insecurity in the mother's relationship with her husband, the daughter may come to be regarded as an emotional rival for the husband's affection.</p>
              <p>This resentment of the daughter is most likely to occur when there is some other cause of disturbance in the mother's psychology, especially if this cause is associated with her relationship to her own father. For example, as female domination becomes, generation by generation, a more distinctive feature of American family life, the daughter's shift of attention to her father becomes less complete, and, by adolescence, she tends to pity him rather than to admire him and may become relatively ambivalent in her feelings toward both her father and mother, sometimes hating the latter for dominating her father and despising his weakness in allowing it.</p>
              <p>In such a case, the whole development of which we speak is accelerated and intensified in the next generation, and the daughter's relatively ambivalent feelings toward her parents are repeated in her relatively ambivalent feelings toward her husband. This serves to intensify both her emotional smothering and overprotection of her son and her tendency toward emotional rejection of her daughter as a potential danger to the relatively precarious emotional relationship between husband and wife.</p>
              <p>     As a consequence of this situation, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">the frustrated wife has a tendency to cling to her son by keeping him dependent and immature as long as possible </span></strong>and to seek to hasten the maturing of her daughter in order to edge her out of the family circle as soon as possible...</p>

                                              that kind of feeling that I am not needed and I do not want to left
                                              alone and lonely. I am scare of being lonely."</p>
              <p>Your wife is not lazy, she takes care of family. She works hard for the family. What else are you hoping to find out there ?</p>
              <p>Are you looking for a super woman? They don't exist. Even if you find one.. you are not good enough for her.. because she wants a superman.</p>
              <p>The only difference between a happy mother/wife vs a disgruntled mother/wife is the amount of support she gets from her husband and/or family.</p>
              <p>Are you trying to make her life more difficult or are you trying to make her life easier. Which one are you ?</p>
              <p>If you are the first type.. then of cors you made yourself unwelcomed. you will end up a grumpy lonely old man. You'd die wondering why no one is happy with you.</p>
              <p>If you are the second type.. you will be needed and required no matter which woman you marry or how many children you have.</p>
              <p>May I ask.. what kind of father are you ? Are you actively involved in your child's life ?</p>
              <p>Do you help her out when she has her hands full ? or do you expect her to be able to manage everything herself ?</p>

              Marriage is not wrong, it is never wrong, it becomes'' wrong'' when one seeks to fulfil oneself or use another thru that marriage to have one's need fulfilled or expecatitions met. Love does not hurt, it hurts cos beggary only exploits but pretends to love.

              TS,
              I could be wrong, but it seems the mutual benefit scheme has come to its end. U were a means to an end and there is nothing left to be ... Of course, on your end, it could probably have been the same, I doubt it was premeditated nor was it understood.
              
              
              It is easy to label her or u but what is true is only u and she knows cos there are some things that we avoid and project what is deemd as desirable as opposed to what could be labelled as deviant or ....
              
              As for this wanting to changer or she trying to change u - sadly, it never works, only understanding transforms and as long as that is lacking, it is a compromise and a compromise is healthy only when understanding is factored in and it frees both parties.

              <p>Hi TS,</p>
              <p>I don't think I can point out to you who's right and who's wrong in this relationship because I'm not there to witness what goes on between you two.</p>
              <p>But I do empathise with your situation. What you feel has been heard of; feeling jealous of the baby.</p>
              <p>It's natural for your wife to be protective of and caring for the baby.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, in some cases, both or one party forget that they are first and foremost a couple, then parents. </p>
              <p>I don't know your wife's thinking, but I feel having a good talk with her to find out what she's feeling is a good first step. </p>
              <p>Hopefully you both are open to whatever might come up during the talk.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Indeed you are right to wonder if you have married the same girl.</p>
              <p>The sex and the impatience are just problems that come from her attitude that everything is for the baby. Domestic duties are important, but there are marital duties too. And a saying that every marriage needs to be worked on.</p>
              <p>Many girls here don't know how to enjoy life. On one of the local forums, someone was complaining about the same situation and several guys jumped in saying they had married the same wife. These girls only know work. There is an order in her life that currently is something like</p>
              <p>Parents</p>
              <p>Baby</p>
              <p>She</p>
              <p>You</p>
              <p>And others may be slotted in between as and when they come (eg Baby II or someone with an illness etc). Similar to the 3SG CPL LCP PTE REC order. I say this because she feels every right to command you and she feels that you should respect the order for her or the baby's sake. Singapore is a command and senority society she has lived under and she feels she has been promoted to some kind of commander level.</p>
              <p>There are hard choices at this point. As others have pointed out, separation is costly and unfair. However, working for her vision of family for the rest of your life is also costly.</p>
              <p>Let me point out that judges in Singapore have expressed a dim view of "taking the easy way out instead of trying to work things out as a couple". You may be far from this stage, but being caught cheating will only make it worse. If you are not thinking of separation yet, you may want to consider male contraception.</p>
              <p>After you try unsuccessfully to change her, I feel that separation is the fair way to go because you only live once.</p>

              Relating is relatively ''easy'' as it bridges two ... when one communicates to another with these understanding(s) that he/she has his/her own fears, prejudices, conditionings. However, it presupposes that one is cognizant and willing to face that which is mentioned above IN oneself, no matter how ''ugly'' or how troubling it is.
               How to listen to another when one can listen to one''s own follies, foibles n nuerosis? Many avoid and situations/cirumstances manifest and the next thing is conflict and emotional turmoil. It does not make anyone wrong or rite but why the unnecessary .... when a different way of looking at living can enhance not only one's understanding but be a catalyst to another.
              
              
              One cannot relate to another if one cannot relate to what one is. Having things, doing things is merely n mostly an escape to see not what one is. It is window-dressing, and to rject it is not wise , we are not islands unto ourselves. Being aware that what we have and do merely adds value but it is not real value of what one is. Real value is that which emanates from one's one understanding of one's lack or not of within (n hopefully) a transformation that would allow for another to be and one is still able to relate to the differing personas and respectul of one's individuality to evolve.
              
              Simply put - a porous ego makes all the difference. by that I m implying that we are so hardened and alienated from ourselves (within) that changes that come or changes that need to be made for one''s well being or another's is nigh impossible cos the ego eclipses love. Well -being cannot be found outside by having ''things'' or  be obtained from ''anyone''. If that feels so then know that it has been   erroneously interpreted as well-being. Well-being is an inward process and it was never meant to be found, only recognized and it has always b een there. 
              
              TS - There is one thing that you overlooked that this baby is borne out of love and your jealousy is unwarranted lah; unlearn and heal youself to your insecurities and also understand that perfection is ''sickness''. Hot and cold/ love n hate, black n white - appears like two but to always choose one and reject another is being unwise. One's negation of that which one rejects or is unaccpeting of does not go away nor does its existence end. Being wise is to accept and understand that living is such. Otherwise, one is either trying to live as opposed ot living. My holding a book cann ot be equated as reading a book.

              <p>Indeed you are right to wonder if you have married the same
                                      girl.</p>
              <p>The sex and the impatience are just problems that come from her
                                      attitude that everything is for the baby. Domestic duties are
                                      important, but there are marital duties too. And a saying that
                                      every marriage needs to be worked on.</p>
              <p>Many girls here don't know how to enjoy life. On one of the
                                      local forums, someone was complaining about the same situation and
                                      several guys jumped in saying they had married the same wife. These
                                      girls only know work. There is an order in her life that currently
                                      is something like</p>
              <p>Parents</p>
              <p>Baby</p>
              <p>She</p>
              <p>You</p>
              <p>And others may be slotted in between as and when they come (eg
                                      Baby II or someone with an illness etc). Similar to the 3SG CPL LCP
                                      PTE REC order. I say this because she feels every right to command
                                      you and she feels that you should respect the order for her or the
                                      baby's sake. Singapore is a command and senority society she has
                                      lived under and she feels she has been promoted to some kind of
                                      commander level.</p>
              <p>There are hard choices at this point. As others have pointed
                                      out, separation is costly and unfair. However, working for her
                                      vision of family for the rest of your life is also costly.</p>
              <p>Let me point out that judges in Singapore have expressed a dim
                                      view of "taking the easy way out instead of trying to work things
                                      out as a couple". You may be far from this stage, but being caught
                                      cheating will only make it worse. If you are not thinking of
                                      separation yet, you may want to consider male contraception.</p>
              <p>After you try unsuccessfully to change her, I feel that
                                      separation is the fair way to go because you only live once.</p>

              <p>Men usually have this delusion that marriage automatically means they can have more sex with their wives on a regular basis.</p>
              <p>The reality is that women usually lose their <span style="text-decoration: underline;">competitive instincts</span> (and hence their appetite for entertaining sex) once they have the security of a marriage.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>It is therefore important you revive that </strong><strong>competitive instinct and the mating desire in her:</strong></p>
              <p>Are you in good shape physically? Do you work out often?</p>
              <p>The birth of your child means she is in an unfamiliar position where she has to take charge in this relationship (the kid, the increase in chores at home). <strong>Women do not like to be in a position where they have to take charge of everything.</strong></p>
              <p>You have to first show her that both you and her are in the same page. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Help her more with the kid situation instead fighting for her attention.</span></p>
              <p><strong>Learn to start taking charge.</strong> Im not saying you have to babysit the kid but you have to learn to be more assertive in this relationship.</p>

              Anything that is done out of duty is a betrayal of onself and an insult to a marriage, to a relationship. 
              
              Please lah, no one is perfect but I lament the dichotomizing n polarizing labels and sometimes one cannot help what one feels. However, being honest about that feeling and communicating it  politely to one''s spouse is essential for growth. Otherwise, this stance being caught in defining (definitive) roles is in manys ways going to in no time negatively impact the ...
              
              I could be utterly wrong but I surmise that TS''s wife is not being honest and worse still deflecting it onto TS to avoid issues which is more than simply sex alone. There are issues that were never resolved within her and within that relationship of marriage. It is now surfacing. 
              
              As for Ts, he could without realisng it himself be in a predicament of sorts that is at odds with his spouse.
              
              One can go on extrapolating or guessing or even offer advice/opinions - nothing doing! It calls for SELF-HONESTY and that is something not me nor anyone; even Ts can elicit it from his spouse. 
              
              PS - Sex appears to be the problem but to me intuitively it feels there are unresolved issues (emotional,social, psychological, situational/circumstantial, grievances of the past) that has been ignored and till both parties are willing to face their fears, anxieties and ... unlearn where possible, this conflict is something even a mediator cannot help. 
              
              Pruning the leaves or cutting off the branches of a tree does not transform, on the contrary it is going to buttress the roots! (problems) cos it is within and not without!

              <p>It's maybe because she has settled into a pattern or a routine.......and maybe there is lack of intimacy because of lack of new novelty...........and also lack of time spent together just the two of you......So gradually intimacy is not in her mind.</p>
              <p>My suggestion is....try to find time.....cut down some other activities......also help her when she is doing house chores.....just insist, or do it when she is not around or is not looking......</p>
              <p>Also you can consider hiring a domestic helper.</p>
              <p>The helper can be a nanny and/ or a maid.</p>
              <p>You can also hire a daily maid (the maid does not live in the home, she just work and then leave)</p>
              <p>You must think of some ways to change the routine and the pattern, basically.</p>
              <p>Also pay attention to what shes saying when shes scolding you about your bad habits. Think about it and reflect on it and think whether you can change it. Because just as much as you are feeling bitter about her rejecting your sexual intimacy, maybe she is also bitter and resentful about your bad habits, and maybe that is part of the reason why she is cold towards you. The resentment is building up. So try to think deeper and change the situation.</p>
              <p>Finally, a good way to change the environment, is to bring her to a vacation.</p>
              <p>Ok good luck.</p>

No sex for a few months, and
               then when I asked for it, she quoted one of her friends' hubby who've 
              NOT had sex for 1 year, ever since the wife pregnant until the baby now 
              6-months plus liao. I tulan &amp; said then u go &amp; marry him for a 
              sexless marriage lah! then she flew into a rage &amp; said why must I 
              always kick a big fuss about sex? If no sex will I die? If won't die 
              then stop complaining! My jaws just dropped to the floor ... )<br> <br> Then last week, she suddenly asked from me a full-body massage, so I 
              thought got chance liao, and I gave a a truly sensual massage, &amp; she
               was feeling so comfortable that she felt asleep. So when I gently 
              flipped her over for the front massage, and threw in all the necessary 
              titillations of the breasts &amp; pussy after the whole thing, she 
              suddenly opened her eyes and said to me:" You pervert! Don't disturb me 
              lah! I need my beauty sleep now! Go turn off the lights &amp; if you 
              still got so much energy, then go out &amp; play your laptop / FB / 
              PS3!" Again, my jaws dropped to the floor ... (&amp; I ended my night by
               going to the toilet to PCC 'cos I already so aroused when I was 
              massaging for her in nude!)<br> <br> &amp; on those days when she granted me with sex, which I can 
              unfortunately count using my fingers, she'd be making the deed seems

              no DATY 'cos all these very unhygienic, &amp; when I tried to suggest 
              some sex-toys or different positions or role-plays to spice up the acts,
               she retorted that she's NOT an AV porn star, so don't try to demean her
               by asking her to do "all these stupid things" ... Once again, you've 
              guessed correctly, my jaws dropped and dislocated when it hit the floor
