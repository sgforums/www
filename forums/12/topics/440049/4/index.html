              Some here have offered suggestions, advice and of course, shared expereinces of their own.
              
              To me, there is no ''solution'' till self-honesty intuits and is communicated or expressed to each other. 
              
              Otherwise, a compromise of any sort without reconciling to one's own pychological hangups or emotional stasis is something that would not go away.
              
              Like I mentioned in my preivous posting here, the so-called sex 'problem'' is an excuse for what is transpiring now. What has been latent has surfaced and it is anybody's guess and to impose or hoist onto them what one feels ought to be or should be is unwise.  
              
              All relationships look the same, all marriages look the same. It is merely on the surface! One has to grapple and juggle that which has been reduced to a thing (rel;ationship/marriage) and be cognizant to the reality of two human beings who are not entities but either regressing or growing. Whatever it is there is no rite/wrong but the understanding and acknowledgement of each''s uniqueness, each's individuality makes all the difference. One has to understand that behind each persona there are lots of prejudices, bigotry, fears anxieties that dominoes one's being. That cannot be ignored and if it is unknown or denied/unacknowledged it is part of one's daily psyychological/emotional terrain and understanding makes living easier. It is not necessarily in a relationship,marriage but awash every moment as long as one meets another person.
              
              Ps - A baby is born and it not here for the parents nor for anyone but to be himself/herself and very sadly that is not what is happening. Parents attachment to the child is so unhealthy ane worse still misconstrued/interpreted as love.

              <p>How did you get sidetracked into talking about virgin brides?

              bride. We find out first about sexual compatibility.</p>
              <p>Looking at all your posts in Sgforums, I would think you are a
              female chauvinist pig, or a militant butch, swinging an AK-47 in
              place of a penis, yelling "men are evil!" and shooting at all men
              in your way.</p>

              <p>So then tell me...in your opinion,  what are/is the marital duty/duties of a man to his wife ? If a man is unable to fulfill his duty/duties.. is that valid reason to boot him out ?</p>

              <p>TS has already came out to say that the r/s b/w him and his wife is already improving. Probably can save the word-lash on him already.</p>
              <p>TS had not and did not mentioned about how old he is and his wife whether they are young or not. Young and old in age is regardless of "young and old" in r/s. Ts is just probably new to marriage life. In comparison to 20-30yrs, 3 years is still considered young.</p>
              <p>TS did behave with the lack of understanding of his wife but that is not and neither a childish display or a childish act. He, is merely some1 who has yet to be accustomed to a new phase of life. Please do not pass judgement on him casually. By openly seeking advice instead of doing other more stupid things, he has already displayed a certain sense of maturity. Incessant scolding and passing of judgement unnecessaryily is not a display of helpfulness, understanding and maturity.</p>
              <p>Whatever that has happened b/w TS and his wife, which seems to be doing better now, is solely b/w the 2 of them. If we are really keen to help, what he needs is objective advice but not something to put him down to a "non adult" "kid level"</p>
              <p>If in due time as you've said that the wife gets bored of him or feels repulsive due to his "child-man" act, it would also imply that in due time whoever thats close to you will also feel repulsive by an incessant word lash dealt by you on whatever issues raised upon whereby a word-lash seems to be your hobby.</p>
              <p>Helpful advice is best given and displayed with objectiveness and not judgemental. For TS, hopefully you've learnt something and always remember to love your wife for whatever she's done for you, and that little gift of god she's brought for you.</p>

              <p>Alot of woman complained about that? How much is alot? And i believe you came in from a female view point and TS came in from a male viewpoint. While "all" the woman complained about the guys? Stand in view of the guy's viewpoint to see the issue instead. I've tried reasoning out on the female's difficulties.

              <p>He has problem understanding his woman. If you think you can , as a man, provide a wholesome solution.. based on your limited understanding of women.. then go ahead.. he only needs to listen to you.</p>
              <p>I concur on most of your advise to TS..but  I also disagree on some. Nobody tells you to shut it, yes ?</p>

              <p>When female get together.. it's gossiping lah. Simi counselling.. we don't even believe hundred percent of each other's story.</p>
              <p>Andrey Randead's book is banned. Even Amazon.com don't wanna carry his book.</p>
              <p>His misogynistic view is based on females less than 30 years old IN THE USA.</p>
              <p>Divorce rate in USA is 50%. So that means a lot of females grew up in households where their fathers are NOT there 50% or more of their growing up life ( depending on divorce agreement). These girls probably has STEP mothers and/or STEP fathers.</p>
              <p>Remarrying in the states is so common.. it's like a nation wide adult swing club here.<br>These girls see how their own father disrespect their mother.. so it's 
                          hard to expect impressionable young girls to respect males.</p>
              <p>Andrey's book is based on his gripe about how females disrespect men in the USA. Given the situation mentioned above.. it's hardly surprising ain't it ?</p>
              <p>Now if you so choose to read his book.. remember.. you don't live in the USA. Andrey is an entrepreneur and he makes money off people's fear.</p>

              <p>Isn't it "fascinating" how you see men consulting other men about women.. then  unanimously declare that they finally figured out the female psyche ?</p>
              <p>Or these men seek counsel with their mother/female family members ( because she is a female), disregarding the fact that she is biased to her son's interest or her own ?</p>

              <p><br>For eons, men have been trying to figure out on female behavorial or psyche, but they fail miserably on each and every attempt. In a fit of frustration, the gay men world is born, more so in today society where women like us are getting more complicated by the days.</p>
              <p>Genetic transfer can be excusable, but gays nurtured out of parenting and society influences can alway be prevented. Given a $$ demanding society and a single son concept of living, every son is treated like a goddamn God of the family, and with father alway outside making money or busy with golf, meeting and mistress, the care is left only for the mother, the maid, the grandmother and sister.</p>
              <p>Since young, every drip of saliva was wiped, every bite by mosquitos was being attended seriously to the extend of seeing a doctor, every cry make was tamed immediately with the blame going toward the father or the maids. All these pampering are the begining of a gay in the making.</p>
