There is another girl who is also not going but that is because she earns much less than us and we all know that.  I have always love to travel and now am very upset and mad they go ahead to make plans without even telling me.  What would you do if you are in my shoes??</div>

              the thing that really hurts is that i think if i am the one who earn less &amp; the other girl earn as much as the rest of us, if the shoes are reversed, i think they will actually ask the girl along.   
              the 5 of us have travel together on short trips like JB, Melacca or KL before.  And I dun think i did anything in particular or offensive that will cause them not to want to travel with me.

              i know they are going when one of them post on facebook :(
                  
                  to be honest if they ask me to go, i will prob see what is the destination first before deciding. The thing is, i don't have many groups of friends to go travel with.  I do have another group of ex-poly gal frens but those are mainly for dinner and drinking the night with.  I dun feel particularly close or itimacy with them and i think they also feel the same. 
                  
                  I got 2 more frens from my part-time degree course and 1 of them has her own travel buddies/frens.  Another one is ok, i did travelled with her to places like NZ, HK etc but she recently change new job after unsuccessfully trying to be property agent. Plus she is getting married soon and just got her new flat.  So I know while she donesn't mind travel with me, i koe she really needs to watch her finances and so i dun think i will ask her to travel anymore, at least not for time being.  And throughout my whole working life, for some reason i have only manage to meet 1 or 2 girlfriends of similar ages whom we can go out for dinner, drinks and movies etc.  But i find that after sometime like i left the company or one or the other change jobs or got married, the meetups got less and less frequent. And it does not help that i tend to work in those companies where there are always foreigners or other type of demographics of people (eg much older women with teenage children).  I think bottom of the line is I am looking for some gal frens to hang out, and have fun.  Other pple seem to find and clique with people easily. In fact, my this group of frens they also have each of their own group of frens and buddies formed by ex-colleagues or school mates etc.  I dun know why it is so hard for me :(

              <p>i know they are going when one of them post on facebook
              <img title="Sad" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad"></p>
              <p>to be honest if they ask me to go, i will prob see what is the
              destination first before deciding. The thing is, i don’t have many
              groups of friends to go travel with. I do have another group of
              ex-poly gal frens but those are mainly for dinner and drinking the
              night with. I dun feel particularly close or itimacy with them and
              i think they also feel the same way too.<br> I got 2 more frens from my part-time degree course and 1 of them
              has her own travel buddies/frens. Another one is ok, i did
              travelled with her to places like NZ, HK etc but she recently
              change new job after unsuccessfully trying to be property agent.
              Plus she is getting married soon and just got her new flat. So I
              know while she donesn’t mind travel with me, i koe she really needs
              to watch her finances and so i dun think i will ask her to travel
              anymore, at least not for time being. And throughout my whole
              working life, for some reason i have only manage to meet 1 or 2
              girlfriends of similar ages whom we can go out for dinner, drinks
              and movies etc. But i find that after sometime like i left the
              company or one or the other change jobs or got married, the meetups
              got less and less frequent. And it does not help that i tend to
              work in those companies where there are always foreigners or other
              type of demographics of people (eg much older women with teenage
              children). I also try to look for some gal frens to hang out, and
              have fun. Other pple seem to find and clique with people easily. In
              fact, my this group of frens they also have each of their own group
              of frens and buddies formed by ex-colleagues or school mates etc. I
              dun know why it is so hard for me <img title="Sad" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad"></p>
              <p>and the fact I know them for 20 years and they just went ahead
              to make plans without even checking in with me</p>

              <p>So you had your travel buddy, but she is no longer available. And when you traveled with your travel buddy did you ask any of your 20 years long friend to come along ?</p>
              <p>Now that you no longer have a travel buddy, you become upset your other friends didn't ask you along. Yes?</p>
              <p>It seem you are not very close with these 20 year long friendships. </p>
              <p>You should be able speak up/out about anything on their mind to a close friend. Like a simple " where are you girls going ? " </p>
              <p>But you don't seem comfortable to do so. Instead u pout and get mad they didn't ask you.</p>
              <p>They are more like 20 years acquaintances.</p>
              <p>It's time to rebuild, restrengthen, re establish friendships with people you care about.</p>

              its not the same, they dun know my travel buddy and vice versa.  I wouldn't mind so much if they travel with their own individual groups.   And i will still be upset even if my travel buddy is available.  But u bring up an interesting point.  Does the scenerio of what i write come across as mere pettiness on my part?

              <p>Pettiness or diva-ish, either or cannot be good for your social life.</p>
              <p>When expectations n reality don't meet, u feel disappointed. </p>
              <p>Perhaps u were expecting more from the 20 years of friendship than what it means to your other friends.</p>
              <p>Expectations can lead to dissapointments. So best not to expect. But only expect the unexpected.</p>
              <p>Perhaps u need to ask yourself what is a friendship to you.</p>
              <p>Are friends only there to meet your needs? To use or be used ?</p>
              <p>I suggest u let the Negativity go, focus on having fun lah. </p>
              <p>You don't get to be young for long, Life is short. Don't waste time pouting in the corner.</p>
