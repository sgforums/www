              <p>Stumbled upon this some months ago, thought it was very meaningful, so do stop for a moment and chew on this. :p</p>

              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,Times New Roman,Times,serif; color: #0994be;">REGRETS OF THE
              DYING</span></strong><span style="font-size: x-small;"></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="color: black;"> For many years I worked in palliative care. My patients were those who
              had gone home to die. Some incredibly special times were shared. I was
              with them for the last three to twelve weeks of their lives.<br> <br> <br> </span> </span></p>
              <div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="color: black;"><img style="width: 319px; height: 210px;" src="http://www.inspirationandchai.com/images/Spring.jpg" alt="Spring.jpg"></span><br> </span></div>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"> <span style="color: black;"><br> <br> People grow a lot when they are faced with their own mortality. I
              learnt never to underestimate someone's capacity for growth. Some
              changes were phenomenal. Each experienced a variety of emotions, as
              expected, denial, fear, anger, remorse, more denial and eventually
              acceptance. Every single patient found their peace before they departed
              though, every one of them.
              <br> <br> When questioned about any regrets they had or anything they would do
              differently, common themes surfaced again and again. Here are the most
              common five:
              <br> <br> 1. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I wish I'd
              had the courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others
              expected of me. </span><br> <br> This was the most common regret of all. When people realise that their
              life is almost over and look back clearly on it, it is easy to see how
              many dreams have gone unfulfilled. Most people had not honoured even a
              half of their dreams and had to die knowing that it was due to choices
              they had made, or not made.
              <br> <br> It is very important to try and honour at least some of your dreams
              along the way. From the moment that you lose your health, it is too
              late. Health brings a freedom very few realise, until they no longer
              have it.<br> <br> <br> 2. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I wish I
              didn't work so hard.</span> <br> <br> This came from every male patient that I nursed. They missed their
              children's youth and their partner's companionship. Women also spoke of
              this regret. But as most were from an older generation, many of the
              female patients had not been breadwinners. All of the men I nursed
              deeply regretted spending so much of their lives on the treadmill of a
              work existence.
              <br> <br> By simplifying your lifestyle and making conscious choices along the
              way, it is possible to not need the income that you think you do. And
              by creating more space in your life, you become happier and more open
              to new opportunities, ones more suited to your new lifestyle.
              <br> <br> <br> 3. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I wish I'd
              had the courage to express my feelings.</span><br> <br> Many people suppressed their feelings in order to keep peace with
              others. As a result, they settled for a mediocre existence and never
              became who they were truly capable of becoming. Many developed
              illnesses relating to the bitterness and resentment they carried as a
              result.
              <br> <br> We cannot control the reactions of others. However, although people may
              initially react when you change the way you are by speaking honestly,
              in the end it raises the relationship to a whole new and healthier
              level. Either that or it releases the unhealthy relationship from your
              life. Either way, you win.
              <br> <br> <br> 4. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I wish I had
              stayed in touch with my friends.</span> <br> <br> Often they would not truly realise the full benefits of old friends
              until their dying weeks and it was not always possible to track them
              down. Many had become so caught up in their own lives that they had let
              golden friendships slip by over the years. There were many deep regrets
              about not giving friendships the time and effort that they deserved.
              Everyone misses their friends when they are dying.
              <br> <br> It is common for anyone in a busy lifestyle to let friendships slip.
              But when you are faced with your approaching death, the physical
              details of life fall away. People do want to get their financial
              affairs in order if possible. But it is not money or status that holds
              the true importance for them. They want to get things in order more for
              the benefit of those they love. Usually though, they are too ill and
              weary to ever manage this task. It is all comes down to love and
              relationships in the end. That is all that remains in the final weeks,
              love and relationships.
              <br> <br> <br> 5. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I wish that
              I had let myself be happier.</span> <br> <br> This is a surprisingly common one. Many did not realise until the end
              that happiness is a choice. They had stayed stuck in old patterns and
              habits. The so-called 'comfort' of familiarity overflowed into their
              emotions, as well as their physical lives. Fear of change had them
              pretending to others, and to their selves, that they were content. When
              deep within, they longed to laugh properly and have silliness in their
              life again.
              <br> <br> When you are on your deathbed, what others think of you is a long way
              from your mind. How wonderful to be able to let go and smile again,
              long before you are dying.
              <br> <br> <br> Life is a choice. It is YOUR life. Choose consciously, choose wisely,
              choose honestly. Choose happiness.</span></span></p>

              <p>Are you sure those are what you will do if you know you are going to die ? Let's say you are going to die today, you still have time to sell your assets and prepare to go on trip? Why bother to slap those that you hate, you know you will not be seeing them.</p>
