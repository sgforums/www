Now is exams time maybe the guy is busying studying that's why never call the girl.. Since she knows that the guy is interested in her.. She doesn't have to worry so much.. Moreover.. he ask her out but she couldn't make it.. and reason is given...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Maybe after exams, the girl can msg him like something "Hey you finish exams already right? SO how was it?? Everything's ok?? Can pass anot??" Start with a conversation first.. and see the guy's reaction and reply.. Then slowly ask him whether wanna come out celebrate and have a dinner together..   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Actually.. i don't really think is a good start for girls to ask guys out.. But since the guy has ask her out but she couldn't make it.. She can grab this chance and ask him out.. Saying a make up for that last time...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>One reminder.. if she likes the guy and the guy likes her... But she wants to know more about him first right.. Tell her.. Be herself when she's with him.. And try to go out 1 v 1 is better.. Don't show or react any signs to him that she is so interested in him and wan to get closer to him... Try not to do that.. Unless she's so 100% confident that this guy likes her that much too.. and having signs of getting her as a potential.. then slowly slowly she can hint him or what... Don't rush things.. Take it real slow!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>CHeerS!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
