              <p>Hi.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is my first time in sgforums, so feeling abit blur on what to do. ALso my first time posting on any forum...so hope that you could pardon my posting if it seems not well written.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am posting on here is because I am facing a big dilemma in my lfe now. I am a guy, but I have been adopting a life of a girl for the past 4 years.</p>
              <p>I started wearing girls stuff at a very young age. It was only until 2004 that I became more and more involved and serious about crossdressing. I have spent easily at least 10k on female clothes, lingerie and s*x toys.</p>
              <p>The turning point in my life came in 2005, when I met a man from IRC. He was the first man who I had intimate acts with, and he taught me alot. He was married, so he eventually had to quit meeting me. At that time, I felt very lost. He had become an important person in my life. I was depressed for a few months in fact. But as I recovered, I met other men and I soon was having intimate acts with men I didnt know.</p>
              <p>The thing is that, as time goes on, I get more and more involved, and I know I have no way of turning back. However, my family has no idea of what I am doing whatsoever. I stay with my mum and sis, whereas my dad is in Hongkong for work. They have no idea about my secret life.</p>
              <p>However, I feel that I can no longer hide it from them. I find it very tiring always having to pretend in front of them, and always having to find excuses for going out. I have to hide all my stuff, which again is very tiring. In fact, my family thinks I am still attending school at a local university...but I actually havent attended classes for almost 3 semesters.</p>
              <p>I want to be truthful with them, but I am afraid they can't accept it. But I really want to be free to lead my life. i know my life now is rotten and shameless, but I don't see how I can go back to being a good child to my parents.</p>
              <p>I really do not know what to do...I want to tell and break free, but I cant bear to hurt them...</p>
              <p>What should I do????? </p>

              <p>I think you are snowballing the issues... so many issues here, which one do you think is the most important to you?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1. Cross dressing?</p>
              <p>2. Having sex with strangers?</p>
              <p>3. Wanting to tell your parents about your life and not knowing if they can accept it?</p>
              <p>4. Wanting to be yourself and not needing to hide.</p>
              <p>5. Not attending school</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I suspect that embarking on what you consider a 'wrong' path had made you gone down the slippery slope since you feel you can't go back on a good path. But making a wrong decision doesn't mean that you have to make other wrong decisions too, i.e. not attending school</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So what are your priorities?</p>

              <p><br>Hmm...</p>
              <p>Actually since you know what you want with regards to your sexual identity, it is a personal choice for you and there really isn't much of an issue that.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But sex with men does not equate to sex with strangers and/or indiscriminate sex. The area for concern would be if you are having sex dangerously.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is hard for others to advise regarding if you should let your parents know because it really depends on how your parents would take it - some may never recover from the shock. On the other hand, an issue like this would not be very easily hidden. I reckon your mom probably already knows, but she don't want to say it out loud so she could still have the illusion of a 'normal' son. It depends on how much you love your family to risk it really - is the price of pretending in front of them more than the price you are willing to pay to be yourself?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So if you do not wish to study anymore, how would you intend to earn your living? From the men you meet?</p>

              <p><br>well I have many gay and lesbian friends whose parents actually already know in the heart, they just don't want to say it out in the open. Some actually live with their partners and their parents will just refer the partner as 'your friend'. But in your case it is different, because you cross dress as well.</p>
              <p><br>I am not sure how close you are with your family but unless you really hide it very well, or else someone who is 'bursting' to reveal your sexual identity would find it very difficult. In mannerisms, in speech, and you say you have so many clothes and all - your mom if she is the one who tidy up for you - are you sure she have never found them?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Gut feel - do you think your mom already know?</p>

              <p><br>What do you think? If I find female clothing (Did she find make up? Clothing still can think maybe is girlfriend's one.. but make up a bit...) and pictures of naked guys in my son's/brother's room - do you think they are completely clueless?</p>

              <p>Silkyworries,</p>
              <p>Since you have not been attending school.. what have you been doing the past 3 semesters ?</p>
              <p>Are your parents still paying your school fees ?</p>
              <p>My suggestion to you is ...</p>
              <p>Find yourself a job.. be self sufficient.. before you self confess to your parents.</p>
              <p>When the time is right.. talk to your mother first.</p>
              <p>But in order not to add salt to wounds.. please MAKE SURE you are already financially independent and able to take care of yourself WITHOUT your parents.</p>
              <p>If you want to live a life OF your own.. you need to live the life ON your own.</p>
              <p>They've already lost a son, no parents in their right mind will be willing to support and finance your kind of lifestyle.</p>

              <p>I'm surprised your school never sends your parent a notice about you being a delinquent.</p>
              <p>Do you think your parents will not be extremely sadden by your irresponsible behavior ?</p>
              <p>You think the money they pay for your fees grow on trees ? It's their hard earned money you are throwing away.</p>
              <p>You are not making matter any easier when you skip school, while they still continue to pay for your absentee.</p>
              <p>Be a responsible adult.. stop making them pay for nothing. You're essentially screwing them over with what you're doing.</p>
              <p>If they save the money.. they could at least use it for their retirement savings.</p>
              <p>Yes your guy friends are supporting you now.. how long more do you think they will continue with the good will ? Until they get tired of you, perhaps ?</p>
              <p>You want a comfy job with no proper qualification and no working experience? Tough luck kid. Why don't you go flip open the newspaper under "Classifieds". See what you can get with your current background. Not very much .</p>

              <p>I think your issues about not studying, not caring how to take care of yourself, depending on other people for your livelihood is a far more serious situation to be concerned about than cross dressing or being gay.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You can be a gay transvestite - but don't be stupid! Start taking care of yourself first - there will be one day you are going to be old and wrinkly you know - then how?</p>

              <p>A secret is NEVER easy to keep. Especially one like yours.</p>
              <p>But to be honest.. you are not ready to pay the price for letting the secret out.</p>
              <p>And you did not put your parents in a easy position to accept who you really are.</p>
              <p>There is a time for everything.</p>
              <p>Do what you need to do first.. before you let the bomb explode.</p>

              <p>silky,</p>
              <p>I think what is happening to you is not a simple occurance and without any reason(s) but whatever it is I think you should not forget your responsibilties to your family.</p>
              <p>I really do not advocate that you throw away your life just because you are a gay and cloud your mind with issues of living out your lifestyle. You may be living off from your b/f now, but what about the future to come.</p>
              <p>You do not simply act as though you will be young forever and come one day you will find these people disappearing from you. Leaving you desolate and no one to turn to - not even your family members and I just hope that day won't come for you.</p>
              <p>Whether you have abnormalities or not it does not give you the right to behave so irresponsibily to your family. You need to take hold of yourself, either to continue with your education or if studies isn't your cup of tea - then go out there and find a job and start learning something and be useful.</p>
