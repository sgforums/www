My ex kept tormenting me. She shouted at me and keep asking me when i will be back and stuff and thus, i can easily relate to you on how she feels.<br><br><blockquote>i've treated her rather badly in the past, restricting her of her freedom..shouting at her n scolding her..we have had some good times together</blockquote>You jolly well should know the reason why she broke up with you  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> One thing a girl hates more than cockroaches is a possessive boyfriend.I think it would be a good bet that there isn't anything that is going to develop between you and this girl, no matter how much you try so as hard as it might be. Maybe it's time to move on with your life and think about your attitude in relationships. Learn how to curb your possessiveness and that may just be the desserts u get for being two-timed.<br><br>I know it's hard when you have the feelings for her that you have, but you have to slow down.Any relationship takes time and needs time to grow into a mature and loving relationship.<br><br>Give her the space that she is asking for and realize that, no matter what, even if she chooses not to be with you, it will be okay. It's hard letting go when you don't want to but, if you really love her, you will go by what she says. You would let her go if she asked you to. That is love.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Regardless of what you think she feels for you, she's still with her boyfriend and if they're still together despite her knowing how you feel than obviously the relationship is important to her, more important to her than you are. You need to respect that relationship and her choices and not try to butt in, and yes, smsing her and calling her up only to bring about the relationship. To do so is inherently selfish.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>If she's taken, she's taken. Until she's single again, she's out of bounds if you care about what she feels at all. Don't mess up whatever friendship you've got with her by trying to force something that won't happen.<br><br>Cheers and goodluck<br><br></div>

Somemore you are her bf.. you should tend to be more caring towards her.. and keepin her all by your side...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You hold too tight until she couldn't breathe.. and then jus one fine day she cant take it.. burst it... and end it...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>She gave you the reasons why she ask for a break up.. Have you guys ever talk about this b4? Any communications on it?? From here.. it seems no to the questions.. But however.. you are upset becos she found herself another love or do you realise your problem here??  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>She knows this guy for 1/2 year.. and this was also when you 2 were still together... She knows that you treat her badly.. And then come this guy.. she get to know him... and realise he's much better than you?? More caring and understanding... But maybe no feelings taken in.. jus purely friends becos the guy knows she's in a relationship now and doesn't wan to come inbetween.. Thereafter.. the relationship between you and her becomes sour... No more feelings attached!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>I'm pretty sure she did told the guy about the break up.. Of cos when the guy hears about it.. He knows that he got a chance to chase after her.. Moreover she may also feels more comfortable with him around.. And then this 1 month feelings developed and they got together.. Well well well.. all these are jus my guesses... True or not.. you should know...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>She only need 1 month to erase the 3-year relationship.. DO you think if given back a chance would you still wan her back?? Will you still be the same?? SO paranoid so possessive??  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>I suggest that for the time being you don't SMS her.. let your mind and your emotions fuction well and stable first.. Cos now you still couldn't get over her.. And you keep on msging her.. asking about the relation.. of cos she will feel irritated (it's already over) and you would get on moving!!! You'll still be living in the world of you and her only..   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Stop contacting her for awhile..even if she contact you.. try not to reply.. get your life back again.. No see No hear No speak is the best way to get over one person.. Then after you are physically and emotionally ok.. maybe try to contact her back.. when this time you SMS her.. you wont feel so miserable like "i cant do without her" this kind of thing.. It will be another new YOU!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>CheerS!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

You said you went for 3 years - so why, during this period which I am sure you knew this characteristic of yours, didn't you have the urge to improve yourself and implement it? Well, only after you lost it right?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>She went with another guy that she knew that than 1/2 a year within one month - this simply shows that he preception of your relations has decline long ago, and is not at the end of the third year. she may have wanted to leave you long ago - but something held her back. Well, things didn't change and feelings are lost forever - she left.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>The reason why you feel so bad and down - is because she moved on far quicker than you, Into a new relationship. At the point of time when she requested for a break, you agreed. Then when she has moved on, happier and someone new - while you are still your same old self - this psychological preception would be a killer. (You drink, smoke, etc)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>So you are asking if you should chase her, etc?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Chances are you wouldn't succeed. A relationship of 3 years - if she wanted to give you a chance, she would have given it many times throughout the course of the relationship. You know why she will get angry every time you mentioned about the relationship? Partially is because she is guilt - finding someone new in such short span of time AND because she is firm about never to go back to the relation again. (To undergo certain stress, pressure, possessivenss, arguments, etc) People get tired over such issues easily - what more a relationship of 3 years.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Don't get too agitated in trying to to get back what originally seemed to be yours at first. She is clear about herself - maintaining friendship without emotional attachment with you and leading on her new life. She is trying to - so must you. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkblue;">You are simply too and still possessive even though you and her are separated. It's obvious from the words and tone you are illustrating here. Give her some breathing space. Don't go and press on her. If she genuinely don't want to see you, then don't go and look for her. You will only make things worst this way.<br><br>In fact, it will be more hurtful to know that the one you love is not at all happy with you THAN to know the one you love is happy with someone else. Sometimes, Love is not possession. If you love her, you will love to see her happy. If you don't, maybe you still don't know what is love. Hence, maybe you both are not meant for each other.<br><br>Don't fret. You are still young, concentrate on what you should be concentrating and your Ms. Right will be appearing soon. Just let nature take its course and remember, don't force her to be in this relationship, because it won't do you or her or the relationship any good, but worst. Just leave her alone for sometime. If she is yours, she's yours no matter where you are. Else, you'll have to face the fact.<br><br>Changes in character don't come and happen overnight. It takes time, courage and determination. If you are genuinely wanting to change and let her know you changes, then give yourself some time too to prove to her that you have changed for the better when that day comes.<br><br>God bless you. </span><br><br><span style="color: violet;">lavender_scent</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wah Lao!!!<br><br>Goblin80.... Game over liao go and play some other game.  You already had your chances, so stop saying that you love her so much this, so much that.<br><br>Be Happy that she's happy now and enjoying her freedom.  Yah, I know I very heartless but that's what some people need.  I am the farker of AA so I will F people when they need to be F-ed.  Oops.... devil not to vulgar hor....<br><br>Also lucky you! She's so clear-cut.  Break off this current relationship before starting a new one.  Imagine how you look with a BIG GREEN CAP on your head.<br><br>I think smoking and drinking is a short-term solution for your bruised ego.  I can feel that to lose a woman is a BIG BLOW to anyone's pride and for them to find a new guy so soon.  I tell you all your pride and ego can throw away liao.  BUT like I always say - Ego cannot be eaten so it's of no use.  Get over it !  Go drink and smoke but remember when to stop because you ARE a MAN!!! Cannot stay down for too long.... You have a new WOMAN to hunt.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
