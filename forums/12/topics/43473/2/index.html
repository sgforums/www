"Possessiveness" is the word that describe you most.. You restrict her freedom shout and socld at her.. how would she feels.. She'll think that you are even worse than her parents.. Giving her so much curfews! Who wanna to be grounded by someone? Somemore you are her bf.. you should tend to be more caring towards her.. and keepin her all by your side...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You hold too tight until she couldn't breathe.. and then jus one fine day she cant take it.. burst it... and end it...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>She gave you the reasons why she ask for a break up.. Have you guys ever talk about this b4? Any communications on it?? From here.. it seems no to the questions.. But however.. you are upset becos she found herself another love or do you realise your problem here??  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>She knows this guy for 1/2 year.. and this was also when you 2 were still together... She knows that you treat her badly.. And then come this guy.. she get to know him... and realise he's much better than you?? More caring and understanding... But maybe no feelings taken in.. jus purely friends becos the guy knows she's in a relationship now and doesn't wan to come inbetween.. Thereafter.. the relationship between you and her becomes sour... No more feelings attached!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>I'm pretty sure she did told the guy about the break up.. Of cos when the guy hears about it.. He knows that he got a chance to chase after her.. Moreover she may also feels more comfortable with him around.. And then this 1 month feelings developed and they got together.. Well well well.. all these are jus my guesses... True or not.. you should know...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>She only need 1 month to erase the 3-year relationship.. DO you think if given back a chance would you still wan her back?? Will you still be the same?? SO paranoid so possessive??  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>I suggest that for the time being you don't SMS her.. let your mind and your emotions fuction well and stable first.. Cos now you still couldn't get over her.. And you keep on msging her.. asking about the relation.. of cos she will feel irritated (it's already over) and you would get on moving!!! You'll still be living in the world of you and her only..   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Stop contacting her for awhile..even if she contact you.. try not to reply.. get your life back again.. No see No hear No speak is the best way to get over one person.. Then after you are physically and emotionally ok.. maybe try to contact her back.. when this time you SMS her.. you wont feel so miserable like "i cant do without her" this kind of thing.. It will be another new YOU!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>CheerS!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> </div></blockquote>dun need mi oso......... wat a gd advisor....... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>&gt;exit&lt;</div>
