Everything happens for a REASON. Firstly, you said this is a 2 years relation and within this relation you broke 3 times, 2 times you initiated it. Like I always tell people when counselling them outside here, NEVER use the word 'BREAK' just to solve an existing problem because thats the start of your eventual fall in the relation. Why? Sorry but to say, it is the most inefficient, most lazy, the most unproductive &amp; undeveloping way to pave for your relation. Look at this cycle below<br><br>Beginning of Problems &gt; Problems exists and lingers &gt; *not enough effort in both party trying to solve problem* &gt; sudden break &gt; regret &gt; patch &gt; BUT, problem still there! People always think patch liao, everything is cleared, such a big and huge mistake and error.<br><br>Ok, before any misunderstanding, let me example about the part of *not enough effort in both parties*. I can tell you lar, most problems can be solve if both parties make the effort and wants to save this relation, but if for the rare cases, then perhaps leaving him/her would be the best thing because there is already no reason why you should stay. Is that in your case? I doubt so. (correct me if i am wrong because you said alot of things happen, which means to me that alot of little small, serious but not fatal things happened adds up together that makes it seemed so alot. If there is something so fatal, you would have type it here or already made the decision to leave him and never to come back, unless you yourself WANTS to be held back)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>You say he is being sick of being attached when alot of things happened. Remember the break-patch cycle? Relation is like climbing infinite steps up to somewhere - when you break, it's where the both of you stops at your own current step and have to come down. That represent the time for healing needed to take place. When you patch, you have to walk the steps again. Think about this, what is the feeling you will feel when this cycle repeats 3 times of walking up and down? TIRED. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>You bf initiated the last time you patch and why not you again? Since last time, it has been you right? So you are hesitating, which means there is an consideration. Are you listening to your own wisdom or just blindly follow your overflowing emotions? He had ask for patch and you accept it, why? Did you actually think about what you want in this relation? Or it is... because the both of you are so used being together that when you walk your own separate path, you feel funny - This fear of venturing into the unknown alone.<br><br>Are you sure the relation you leading involved pure love and not out of habit? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Answer every single question I thrown without much thinking and you will know the answer you seek already, nobody needs to say anymore. You said you want to find a way that could solve this problem and you told yourself that the only way is to break - realise why? because this word 'break' is the way both of you solve your problem and when time pass (like now 2 years already), there is no way you could solve anything else, because the most critical way has already been used. Whats more critical then breaking in a relation? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>I see that both of you are at the stage where you are unable to be lovers, but too good to be friends. So what if you have already gone for 2 years? its high time the both of you should take time to reflect and a decent break - because you both had never had a decent rest, long enough to reflect and think about what you both want instead of forcing a relation to go on - like a fatigue horse. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Prays<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>u know for some really really weird reason none of my relationships ever "patched back" after a break-up. and i've had a number of them too..<br><br>most of the time if both sides really wanna break up, u'll just be trying too hard to get very little by patching back... it's like the path of least resistance becos breaking up would change our whole life pattern and wat we've grown accustom to. it's this change we fear that's why we hang on for a few more months... or even just weeks b4 problems start to arise again.. wat's the point?<br><br>i assume u are still young? time heals nicole... it really does. and the young part comes in becos u have time to not only heal, but to meet someone who u can love and is compatible to. i believe, loosely speaking, these are the two main things that form a strong relationship.<br><br>good luck with it all!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
