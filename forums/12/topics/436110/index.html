              <p> I have a full-time job earning $1600/month. My son will be going to primary school soon and we are not hiring a maid. We are not able to fetch my son at 6.30pm after work. Part-time jobs don't really earn much and they require to to work on Saturday or Sunday.  Should i give up my job to be a housewife instead?</p>
              <p>But I am worried that we will have financial problem if I don't work and will it be a waste of my time teaching him at home as he is quite lazy when comes to study and he is a cry baby.</p>

              <p>if the father is bringing home enough bread then u can be FT housewife</p>
              <p>it is always good to have more time with the kid(s) esp during schooling years<br><br>or u can put him in after school care and pick him up at a later timing (most centres open till 7 or 8pm to cater to parents who had to work late)<br>at least there are teachers and helpers who can take care of the child and oso supervise the homework<br>but then, it's not cheap oso lah</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>if relli need the $, there are PT jobs which are oni for the afternoons (while kids are in sch)<br>just need to look around (need some luck too)<br><br>of cos u cant expect to earn a lot from PT job bcos it's a PT job<br>some mums are bored in the afternoons bcos the kids are at sch and the housework is done and there is nothing good on TV. might as well go out and do something. earn some $, interact with ppl.....at least not so detached from the outside world.....<br><br><br>or u can set up a home-based biz as additional income</p>

It seems like I have to get a part-time job if really need the money or get a job that can leave at 5.30pm with no OT required.  To me, money is still very important. Anyway thanks for your comments.</p></div>

              <p>Being a housewife got pos and cons lah.</p>
              <p>Positive - More flexibility for family. Vacation time, emergency, and doing errands during the week and non-peak hours. Cook at home for better nutritional intake.</p>
              <p>Cons- Financial constraints. Loss of income, boredom and lack of social interaction with other people.</p>
              <p>Financially, here's how many parents justify their decision. Assuming single income is feasible.. financially.</p>
              <p>If your income is equal or less than the cost of extra after school care. And if you are able to tutor your own child instead of relying on tutors. Then it makes sense to forgo income to stay home and take care of your family.</p>
              <p>If your income is much greater.. such that you can afford higher quality care and educational support...and better quality of life.. then it makes sense to stay employed.</p>
              <p>However.. I wonder why you want to make this decision only when your child is going into Primary school... How have you been managing before ( birth - kindergarten ) ?</p>
              <p>Had something happened in your family that you had to forgo family support ?</p>
              <p>Hav you set aside enough money to finance your child's college/university fees ?</p>

              <p>Work out your finances and potential expenses that may come up before you decide to quit your job or not.</p>
              <p>Also, I don't quite understand your last sentance as it sounds really childish and irresponsible as a parent. If your son is lazy and don't want to study as a parent you should find ways to motivate him -_-" I don't see how that can be a waste of time and what has being a cry baby got to do with it. </p>
              <p>How about finding a job that is more flexible like being an insurance agent or property agent? </p>

              <p><br>What? 3 years old, then childcare, then primary school, and now university? How many donkey years is that altogether?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If we are not discussing about TS topic, I would have thought you are rehashing some sickening National Day theme song they play every hour.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Actually TS, if you could think of part time jobs, there are also part time maids too. These are not full time maids that stay with you til their contract expires. What they do is they service your household for a couple of hours according to the schedule you arrange with their agency.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>During that time frame, they can take care of your kids, clean up your house and cook food. So when you come home, your kids are taken care of, your house is clean and dinner is served on the table. It takes a lot of your burden away to cook and clean, most importantly you can still retain your privacy with your family. This is what me and my girlfriend intend to explore when we get married.</p>

              <p>Actually TS, if you could think of part time jobs, there are also part time maids too. These are not full time maids that stay with you til their contract expires. What they do is they service your household for a couple of hours according to the schedule you arrange with their agency.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>During that time frame, they can take care of your kids, clean up your house and cook food. So when you come home, your kids are taken care of, your house is clean and dinner is served on the table. It takes a lot of your burden away to cook and clean, most importantly you can still retain your privacy with your family. This is what me and my girlfriend intend to explore when we get married.</p>

              TS,
              
              The issue of money is always relative to what the ends are. However, giving up one''s career to look after .... should never be the reason. 
              
              Inherent in that statement is that I must find meaning cos i gave up something and i want something from ...  
              
              The child is going to inevitably ''suffer'' cos he/she is not here to fulfil or give meaning to a parent. He/she is here to be himself.
              
               However, giving up cos one wants to give up out of the love for that child or  .. is another thing altoghether. Whether the child fails/succeeds is no longer important. 
              
              Sadly, many overlook this polarizing ''elements'' within themselves and parenting becomes such a chore!

              <p>Aiya, your paid only $1600, anytime also can go back into the workforce again, it is good to be with your kids, for once, I dun even hv a mother 2years old. In the meantime, while being a housewife, not housefly hor, go take up course and upgrade your skill, so when you kids is big enuf to go by himself, (do not over pamper him, otherwise become mommy's boy which I seen alot dating me).</p>
              <p>While being a housewife and not housefly, try to stay connect with the changes, if not later few years, you become a dinosaur, dunno what fashion or style of working peoples are doing, then become a full time confirm.com aunty.</p>

              <p> other than whatever u said, i think there are cases of maid abusing the child also right? guess wherever possible, it wld still be better to look after the child rather than leaving it to the maid.</p>

              him home even if there is a school bus. It seems like I

              that can leave at 5.30pm with no OT required.  To me, money is
              still very important. Anyway thanks for your comments.</p>
