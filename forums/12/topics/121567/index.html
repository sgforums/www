            <div class='col-md body'>Glad that you have finally come to your senses, overcoming the fear of rejection and uncertainty is the hardest part. At least now you are doing something about it. Stop wondering and just go for it. Take it slow and hope for the best.<br><br>Actually, I'm in the same dilema as you except that the girl is not in Singapore which makes things a lot harder. I just can't call her up and meet her.<br><br>Good luck bro............. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i don't think roses is appropriate if she doesn't really know you on a personal level yet... better option would be to just give her s card and a not very expensive simple gift. a soft toy might be ok. but definitely not flowers, IMO. good luck!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

You will probably fail without realising why.<br><br>In my opinion, all 'romance instruments' have a cause and a general pre-requisite before it could be useful in whatsoever aim it's used for. Employing roses in such a case would be overly dramatic and significiant for she will definitely NOT share the same intense feelings as you would to her and 'freak' out.<br><br>You will slip in a dis-advantage mode.<br><br>You should reconsider your method.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>
