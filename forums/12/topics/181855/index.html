Believe me, she will want you to wait, but like her, you have your own life and your own worth. Know your own worth and continue with your own life, and if I were you, to be honest in this situation, I'd be dying to wait for the other person. But, in the end, you'll realise you don't need to be somebody's baby. Just occupy yourself for now and just try to keep your distance. If she's fickle, make a decision for her because she doesn't walk into a shop and you wait for her to buy you while she's deciding between another thing and you. Live up, my friend.</div>

Believe me, she will want you to wait, but like her, you have your own life and your own worth. Know your own worth and continue with your own life, and if I were you, to be honest in this situation, I'd be dying to wait for the other person. But, in the end, you'll realise you don't need to be somebody's baby. Just occupy yourself for now and just try to keep your distance. If she's fickle, make a decision for her because she doesn't walk into a shop and you wait for her to buy you while she's deciding between another thing and you. Live up, my friend.</div></blockquote>eh... i thought you were the one needing advise. so u also pretty levelled headed lah.<br><br>then you should know what to seek and where is the answer.<br><br></div>
