              not play chinese chess (in short, PCC) at the void deck. Wa

              <p>Go CC do what? Join what club? What sort of club will have
              young girls there? Or PCC somemore?   Go CC to PCC

              <p><br>Whatever you like to do, is ok to do it, the problem arises when people do not know the limitation and when to stop. Whatever habits you hv in your young time, do not think that you still can do the same as you grow older, as grew older, if you are still doing the same as what you did in your young time, you are simply asking for troubles. There is a limitation to everything, from eating yr favourite foods to visiting your favourite pub</p>

              <p>(Quote from the article)<br> <br> Dr Adrian Wang, a consultant psychiatrist at Gleneagles Medical
              Centre believes the self esteem of people in their late 20s or
              early 30s would definitely be affected if they have never had a
              boyfriend or girlfriend.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Street poll of 50 single women between 18 and 35 showed that
              more than half would not try SDN activities. One said: 'SDN has a
              bad reputation, it sounds like social engineering. Even if people
              do join, they may not come clean.'</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It doesnt help that many believe only down-on-their-luck singles
              nearing their expiry date join the SDN these days.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There is this perception about SDN that even for relationships,
              you need the Government to give you a hand.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>HR Exec Leong Wai Fun, 23, who attended an SDN event last year,
              says, " I felt sian the minute i reached the venue. Because
              everywhere I looked, the guys seemed to be in their 30s, all too
              old for me.'</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Mr Soh, too, started to despair. He has joined SDN activities
              regularly since his uni days. Yet after 20 outings, and much
              anticipation, he remains single.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He is no longer holding his breath that the SDN will work for
              him, and points out that he notices a lack of people from 24
              to  28 years of age at its events. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Mr Chen, still alone, has had a change of heart and has vowed
              that he will longer be an 'umbrella' - easy and convenient for
              girls to use </p>

              <p>Don't worry you ain't the only one. My cousin first dated a girl
              when he was 33 years old and then dated another at 35 years old and
              now he's 36 years old, he's now engaged to his gf. He's getting
              married in October. </p>
              <p>You should try online dating - if that scared of dating. As
              least you can virtually talk to one another before knowning each
              other. </p>

              <p>Really loh, i will take a 20 + girl over a 30+ yr old auntie anytime of the day.</p>

              <p>If you are not worth it, we guys will not 'invest' in you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I recall sometime ago there was a lady duno by the name of Alice or what, she logged in here to rant about not having a bf and complained after attending a SDN event.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>She mentioned that the guys at the event were disappointing and didnt approach her. She came back and simply ran guys down posting here.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But come on loh, ladies at 30, you are not 20 something years old leh, you are 30 plus, seriously depreciated liao, you still want to å�Šèµ·æ�¥å�– ? Its not as if you got many assets left at 30+ loh, you instead shift the blame to guys not good enough for you. Take some responsibility for your own leh.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now what age already, guys never approach you, you duno how to approach guys yrself meh? Guys cannot be shy meh?</p>
