              well... u question-ed if i am a worm in their stomach to know whether they are really happy anot. Then are u a worm in their stomach to learn if they are tearing inside out? 
              
              And i honestly dun find it anyway really pitiful and pathetic neither do i feel that i am lying to myself. I somehow just feel that you are forcefully trying to impose your own ideas into other's belief. And i do not see why being unable to get married/a relationship at 30 can be a display of any fake happiness which may lead to being patiful and pathetic? So are you trying to say that at the age of 30, r/s is all that matters? True enough that most of us would like to settle down by that age but pls do not generalise the old public. I was just merely trying to point out different ppl which have different ways and views on living their life.
              
              While many of us may not be able to escape the social pressure and norms of the current society, it ultimately depends on every individual on their own take of their current lives. Pls do not claim that anyone who does not comform to the social norms and are yet happy with their lives are merely tearing out inside and are pitiful, pathetic or are lying to themselves. There can be more to a life at 30 than just relationships.
              
              I believe when TS posted such a question, he would have wanted to hear different view points or how different ppl deal with the same issue. Which in that case i believe we shld not jus conform TS to a single viewpoint while dismissing all others.

              <p><br>Well, actually it is up to the individual. I know a few guys now in their 50s still single. Maybe its a lifestyle choice for them. But for me, I cannot stand living without a life partner. Having said that, I think every individual should try to find somebody out there. Give the opposite sex a chance if they r interested in us.</p>

              <p>Thats why lah bro.</p>
              <p>Harlow, imdestinyz, friend, dude, no one ever said it is BAD that you are not married by 30 years old ok..</p>
              <p>It is when you exceed 30 years old and beyond and still DONT get hitched which for sure will pose a problem with your future life.</p>
              <p>I did not deny that there are pple who can live, die and rot alone til their old age. But the question is How Many? Just How Many of these pple are there? And how many within these group of pple WILLINGLY wanna be single all their lives? To how many of such pple staying single til old age is a lifestyle choice?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is exactly the same like you go out and ask around about National Service: How many guys in our nation WILLINGLY serve NS one? I will kowtow 1000 times to you if you can find even a decent percentage of such pple.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I for one would love to see you put the food on your plate and make yourself a sacrificial lamb by staying single yourself til old age to convince pple since you are such an advocate for it. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Like what Dr. Language said, when you see the friends around you get married one by one, and yet you are left behind alone, Those within these group of pple who are trying forever with no luck, the feeling could be very sour and excruciating. Wah lao, that is a real personal tragedy loh. The notion of growing old alone is not exactly something very nice to look forward to ok. It is for 99% of most pple that it is a deep seeded feeling of lost and hopelessness.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Especially for those like what TS said NEVER had a relationship by 30.

              <p>Harlow, imdestinyz, friend, dude, no one ever said it is BAD
              that you are not married by 30 years old ok..</p>
              <p>It is when you exceed 30 years old and beyond and still DONT get
              hitched which for sure will pose a problem with your future
              life.</p>
              <p>I did not deny that there are pple who can live, die and rot
              alone til their old age. But the question is How Many? Just How
              Many of these pple are there? And how many within these group of
              pple WILLINGLY wanna be single all their lives? To how many of
              such pple staying single til old age is a lifestyle choice?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is exactly the same like you go out and ask around about
              National Service: How many guys in our nation WILLINGLY serve NS
              one? I will kowtow 1000 times to you if you can find even a
              decent percentage of such pple.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I for one would love to see you put the food on your plate and
              make yourself a sacrificial lamb by staying single yourself til old
              age to convince pple since you are such an advocate for
              it. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Like what Dr. Language said, when you see the friends around you
              get married one by one, and yet you are left behind
              alone, Those within these group of pple who are trying
              forever with no luck, the feeling could be very sour and
              excruciating. Wah lao, that is a real personal tragedy loh. The
              notion of growing old alone is not exactly something very nice to
              look forward to ok. It is for 99% of most pple that it is a deep
              seeded feeling of lost and hopelessness.</p>

              LOL firstly i am not posting false hope to humour ppl. Like i have mentioned many times which i seriously tink you fail to capture is that i am offering TS different views and different way ppl lived their lives despite being in the same situation. Pls have a open mind to accept more views and opinion which may vary slight or even to a large extent from yours. By asking me to wake up my idea can i request the same of you too? to wake up ur idea and open ur eyes to more opinion rather than harping on the same fact. You keep dismissing my opinions by saying "you know you know, you know so what? You know
              serves no purpose at all that this is exactly the way it is
              loh" and so what i know serves no purpose and only what you know and only what is preceived as correct by you serves a purpose? Please do not accuse others of being hyprocritical when others have different opinion from you. And as wad dr language have said, "actually it is up to the individual. I know a few guys now in their 50s still single. Maybe its a lifestyle choice for them". It is dependent on the individual and what i have been offering are alternative opinions based on what i have seen. Please read and see things with a more open mind rather than to dismiss other's opinion because of a very differing view point from yours.

              <p>I dunno la. I got many 20s friends and 30s friends. But I got friends who are 30s got problem with making babies. Both the husband and wife go to fertility clinic, doctor say it is the guy's fault because his sperm count low. Then I got another friend, the doctor say it is the woman's fault. SO it could be either guy or girl. That is why I say, if we marry late, we got to be open to adoption or maybe just get married but no kids.</p>
