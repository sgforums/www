              <p>Did you make it really clear about your feelings for him? or did you just drop him a hint the first time?</p>
              <p>I would really suggest that you made it really clear about your feelings for him and let him know that you need an answer.</p>
              <p>if you had told him your feelings but he did not response, it is usually a bad sign.</p>
              <p>I am also a guy. I believe his reason of not letting you know is similar to what i had went through.</p>
              <p>There was also a female childhood friend of mine (since we were 7) who told me that she wish to get serious with me when we were about 20 years old. Although I had never thought of her like that before, I could also see that our relationship would be very stable as a couple and we could have grown old together happily as we already have a very deep understanding of one another. Furthermore, I do care deeply for her but i just never thought of her as gf/wife material (most likely due to our familiarity with each other)</p>
              <p>So why did I not agree straight away or disagree if I find it not appropriate?</p>
              <p>The reason is that there was already a girl that i like but still unable to get my hands on yet.</p>
              <p>I did not give an answer to my childhood friend as I know that if i failed to get the girl i like, i would definately like to be with her. I know, I know, I am selfish, I am a jerk and I am a male chauvinistic pig.</p>
              <p>long story short, i lost both girls.</p>

              i know what u mean by u can see a real steady relationship with ur childhood friend, but u didnt want to give up the girl u like. 
              
              the funny thing for me is when we were 12, he told him he liked me, but what do we know when we were 12, and i was kinda "in love" with someone else, and i told him. its like karma, and now the tables are turned.
              
              and u know a year ago, after i told him my feelings, he told a common friend that he was not ready, because he was going for ns soon, and his previous girlfriend was also a good friend of his, and they have broken-up, hes afraid the same will happen. and after that i dont know why the other girl popped out of nowhere.

              <p>anyways, my advise is to give him a deadline to provide you with a yes or a no. Try not to pry too much by asking for reasons if it is a 'no'. if he really wants to tell you, he would have told you without being prompted, as the phrase goes, "ask me no questions and i'll tell no lies".</p>
              <p>from his actions, most likely the answer would be a no or he is extremely shy so pressure him for a response and be happy with the answer no matter what is the outcome.</p>
              <p>if its a yes, then congratulations</p>
              <p>if its a no, at least you know and can plan how to proceed with your life accordingly. dont be too sad as i am sure you will find someone you love who would love you back as much if not more, eventually.</p>

              if i ever gather all my courage to ask again, i will. that is if im really sure i like him that much, cuz sometimes i think its just my stubborness that kept me with this feeling for so long, and i dont really like him as much as i think i do. 
              
              otherwise, i will really try my best and be happy be whatever the ans will be.

              <p>Did you make it really clear about your feelings for him? or did you just drop him a hint the first time?</p>
              <p>I would really suggest that you made it really clear about your feelings for him and let him know that you need an answer.</p>
              <p>if you had told him your feelings but he did not response, it is usually a bad sign.</p>
              <p>I am also a guy. I believe his reason of not letting you know is similar to what i had went through.</p>
              <p>There was also a female childhood friend of mine (since we were 7) who told me that she wish to get serious with me when we were about 20 years old. Although I had never thought of her like that before, I could also see that our relationship would be very stable as a couple and we could have grown old together happily as we already have a very deep understanding of one another. Furthermore, I do care deeply for her but i just never thought of her as gf/wife material (most likely due to our familiarity with each other)</p>
              <p>So why did I not agree straight away or disagree if I find it not appropriate?</p>
              <p>The reason is that there was already a girl that i like but still unable to get my hands on yet.</p>
              <p>I did not give an answer to my childhood friend as I know that if i failed to get the girl i like, i would definately like to be with her. I know, I know, I am selfish, I am a jerk and I am a male chauvinistic pig.</p>
              <p>long story short, i lost both girls.</p>

              know what? i think i really moved on. now im no longer head over heels for this guy. im not very sure what made me so determined, but i guess its not important anymore. he will still be one of my best friends.
              
              and guess what, right after i decided to let go, ive now got another guy asking me out. my friend told me that i was too blinded by him in the past that i didnt see anyone else, now i know its true. you guys were right.
