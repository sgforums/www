              haha, everytime i want to say it, the words dont seem to come out. and i dont know if our friendship wil be like before if i really told him straight. the other time was just a msg, and we pretended nothing happened. this time wil be so much more risky. 
              
              i cant stand myself being so stubborn about him too. i really dont know where to find that courage.

              this was what happened a year ago. i sent him a msg to tell him my feelings, and he just act blur. after that we continued to go out. and i was just waiting for an ans. about 1 mth later, after he sent me home one day, i received a msg, he said he actually liked another girl, and sorry he took so long to tell me. i was fine, and even encouraged him to tell that girl. so he did, and that girl rejected him. 
              
              for the past one year, we just pretended that everything has never happened, and continued being good friends. he was slightly depressed and with my encouragement, he got back on his own feet, he told me he had me to thank. 
              
              im always the one who intiates going out, so one fine day i realised i should stop it so i stopped myself from calling him. a month later he called. during this one mth that we lost contact, he feel back to depression again, and many things happened. 
              
              now we are normal, and all these time i thought i could tell myself to get over this guy. am i just stubborn or what?
