              <p>Why don't you tell us how you think she should have reacted towards you? And we can all help to wake you up from your retarded dream and bring you back to reality.</p>
              <p>Honestly speaking, for guys like you who would posted such posts behind the girl you are dying to know, I can only tell you that you probably deserved it if you have already tried to judge and fault her behaviour even before you really know her.</p>
              <p>If you are interested to know a person, would you fault and blame her for not remembering you if you don't make an effort to go and know her?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yes, she's a liar and she likes to act blur. But she only do that to irritating guy like yourself who don't deserve to become her friend.</p>

              <p>It's definitely not because we're jealous that PRC girls are with SG guys.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>SG guys are just so pathetically wrong if they imagined themselves to be so precious to PRC girls that they might make SG girls upset or jealous over them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But yes, we like to point out and highlight to those SG guys what they are lacking compared to guys from other countries.</p>
              <p>And that's experience of course! SG guys got no social experience when come to approaching or going after SG girls or any other girls. Because they are lacking in that experience department, they prefer their girls to be submissive and be easy to get so that these non-SG girls can lie flat on the bed and fake scream ecstasy to please these SG guys.</p>
