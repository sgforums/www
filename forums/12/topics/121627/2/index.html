And her thinking might be slightly different from urs as both of u have reached different phases of life, and probably aimin for different goals and have different concerns. But as long u like her, who cares. If both of you are willing to work on teh differences, i dun see any problems in it. For your part, u must understand, she have different needs, interests and concerns than urs. what u are willing to give up for her doesnt mean she can do the same. I guess its up to a sound mind vs heart and feelins in the end. Follow what u think is right ba. ^ ^</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There are lots of divorce cases nowadays.  Is age difference the reason?  Not necessarily so.  What are her parents worries?  A relationship with a view to marriage is not just between the 2 of you.  It is important to get the blessings of parents.  Talk to them!!!<br><br>But firstly you have to consider if you really dont mind the age gap.  being 25 and 31 is very different from 35 to 41 and 45 to 51 for that matter.</div>
