Maybe you and her can talk to her parents.. i guess her parents wants her to find someone more mature and can take care of her.. and not the other way.. And also.. maybe they feel that she shouldn't waste her time anymore as she's not young.. time to setlle down..<br><br>You can try to fight.. but both must be determined and go for it.. if there's only one fighting.. soon.. you'll jus give up..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think in asian families the key difference is age - standing in society. By standing in society i mean job, material possesions etc etc. My gf and I are born in the same year cept that she's born @ the beginning and I'm born @ the end. Anyway, her family doesn't really accept that cos her parents are really kampong and they want a guy @ least 8-12 yrs older.. in terms of material posessions and social standing .. her family is way above me and my fam.. but in terms of husband:wife perspective i'm the one with the so called better degree, better job, and better income etc etc.. so it has not become an issue and her family loves me simply because i'm mature and responsible. if you're roughly in my position i say you should hold on.. if you're the one with the shit job, the shit degree, the shit pay, the shit qualifications both paper and heart, then i'd say give up.. BUT.. if you really love her and as mentioned above you want her for certain, never give up no matter what, and disregard all the crap that i said.</div>
