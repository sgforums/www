Remember that no one makes a total mistake as long as the lesson is learnt here.<br><br>No matter how perfect the person can be, he/she will definitely face relationship problems. Its just a matter of working things out. Perhaps you're going through a real lesson now, but when you walk out of this, its definite that you'll be stronger than your counterparts.<br><br>Do not be too quick to be self-critical. Thats what bogs you down and clouds your better judgement.<br><br>I sincerely do hope you will be back to your happy self again  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i think.. it really depends.<br><br>do you feel you are very indecisive? perhaps your indecision doesn't just start from location of new house or whatever, but your subconscious is evaluating if you really DO want to move on to a far more serious relationship with him.<br><br>There are many different types of love. Sometimes, love can be born out of habit. You are just so used to having it around. It is like your smelly little pillow that you have as a kid. No much reasons to love it, but if mom throws it away, you just can't sleep comfortably.<br><br>But we are not talking about a little pillow here. We are talking about a bed.<br><br>And if you want to sleep safely, stably, then you need a bed that you feel secure with, that you don't feel worried that at night after a hard day's work, and all you need is some comfort and rest, you know this bed won't let you down and collapse or something. And if you don't have that, the rest of your life disintegrates around you, and you can lose your perspective of life.<br><br>Maybe you really need to be honest with yourself. Are you really indecisive and vacillating? Do you change your mind a lot? If you really are like that, then I think you need to honestly admit that it would frustrate people when your decisions are important to them.<br><br>BUT if your indecision is due to something far more deep... perhaps it is time to REALLY self reflect before you commit yourself to something you regret.<br><br></div>

We are too individualistic and it's going in circles. Just like 2 children... playing hide and seek, befriending, not befriending each other if we feel that we are being ignored. After he cancelled the house, everything seems to go back to yr 1 again.. where hangin up, walkig away... quarreling threatening...comparing with exs... are occuring again...<br>cumulative effect.. no wonder we feel so frustrated over ever single thing...<br><br>Alleycat...got wat u mean...I have many frens who are still single... and during our many "breakups"... I actually felt peaceful being single with them... however, I still miss him a lot.. so if he calls to make up, we'll be back together...n there were happy times too...though it's always short<br><br>keuriseudo... he feels tat I am the one who is always unsure abt him and everthing else. So the problem lies with me.So I should be the one making the decision.<br><br>If we really end here... could it be that I am not suitable for BGR at all? Perhaps i am just too negative to be in a BGR...<br><br>Regards<br>Timble</div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> You took the patching issue too lightly and created your own current plight.<br><br>It seemed that whenever either initiated the break - he could easily earn it back, simply by asking. I understand that feelings is there, but there is hardly any side thoughts, hestitation, consideration or similar. He ask, he gets it.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>It cheapened the value of your own relationship and created the chain of break-patch cycle, with every periodic relationship-stress.</strong> </span><br><br>You thought the previous problems is solved? Hell no.<br><br>It accumulates and stack like books. And when tension brew and you start ranting about the previous issues, the other is pissed. Shouldn't you NOT bring up the past and damage the current relationship?<br><br>There is no way you can escape this without arguments.<br><br>Then a break in induced and the cycle repeats.<br><br>This is Cumulative Effect - it accumulates ALL problems and gave them strength in unity... to destroy your relationship.<br><br>It's almost guarantee that this phenomenon is irrevocable; meaning once it take place, you can't drive it away. You know fugus living on trees? It sucks the tree's vitality until the day it perish. No problem is worst than problems that comes from within - internal environment.<br><br>P.S: Do not allow this to demoralise you from future relationship. If there is a need to learn from somewhere, you began from here. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>
