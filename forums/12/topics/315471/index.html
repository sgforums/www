Heres the story.<br><br><br>I met this girl who is my classmate in poly. Its kind of a love from first sight sort of situation. I could say i am really interested in her etc. It is rare that i am so interested in a particular someone that i would do lots of stupid things just to see her or talk to her.<br><br>We had lots of interest for each other for the 1st week. What i mean is that, we had lots of eye-contacts, stealing glance at each other. Does it mean anything? <br><br>As she is quite a pretty and cute girl, recently i found out that there is another 2 guys also from my class that is interested in her.I also found out that after the 2nd week she started to lose the ' interest ' shown in the first week. What should i do next ? Really interested to know her more,etc. <br><br>What signs should i show to sort of hint her i am interested in her? <br>What signs would she show if shes interested in me?<br>What signs would she show if shes not interested in me <br><br>For her personality, she is really quite a quiet girl in class. Rarely talks. <br><br>Thanks in advance for any advice.</p></div>

              <p>Hi all in AA, hope you all would be able to help me out and give
              me some advice. Thanks in advance. Heres the story.<br> <br> <br> I met this girl who is my classmate in poly. Its kind of a love
              from first sight sort of situation. I could say i am really
              interested in her etc. It is rare that i am so interested in a
              particular someone that i would do lots of stupid things just to
              see her or talk to her.<br> <br> We had lots of interest for each other for the 1st week. What i
              mean is that, we had lots of eye-contacts, stealing glance at each
              other. Does it mean anything?<br> <br> As she is quite a pretty and cute girl, recently i found out that
              there is another 2 guys also from my class that is interested in
              her.I also found out that after the 2nd week she started to lose
              the ' interest ' shown in the first week. What should i
              do next ? Really interested to know her more,etc.<br> <br> What signs should i show to sort of hint her i am interested in
              her?<br> What signs would she show if shes interested in me?<br> What signs would she show if shes not interested in me<br> <br> For her personality, she is really quite a quiet girl in class.
              Rarely talks.<br> <br> Thanks in advance for any advice.</p>

              <p><br>Both parties are shy and quiet... Why not use msn to ask her to meet you one on one? Say that you have something important to get off your chest. If she agrees to meet you, you can be pretty sure she is interested in you too. That's what I would think anyway. Anyway, I would like to read the continuation to this story. Good luck, bro.</p>

              <p>u handsome anot??</p>
              <p>how tall are u???</p>
              <p>hehe...dun get annoyed by my qns cos i was wondering whether ur low confidence in approaching tat girl is due to u not thinking that u are not physically attractive enough???</p>
              <p>also u mention tat there are two guys attracted to her..................are u worried???</p>
              <p>do u feel threatened????</p>
              <p>if yes then ask urself why................is it because they are physically more attractive than u???? taller than u????</p>
              <p>or richer than u??????</p>
              <p>the poly girls in my class quite superfical ....as they only stick to the most suai 1...and the suai 1 is really suai....also tall abt 1.82cm like tat......................</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>ok...u also mention its love at first sight so ,.....u like her looks ...but dun know her personality.............</p>
              <p>now stop and think .....since u like her because of her looks.........so u must have the looks to attract her rite????</p>
              <p>if u not physically attractive enough then she may not consider u rite?? logical??</p>
              <p>now.....looks is not every thing.......u need to find out her character first......if character not attractive n like shit u still wan???</p>
              <p>of course no .........if character good and looks good then all is not GOOD....................why????????????</p>
              <p>because u going to need fight to the end with the 2 guys...........a lot of effort is needed</p>
              <p>bottom line good luck  ...cuz u will need it</p>

              <p>too many people have depended on msn to talk and when given to talk face to face or on the phone, they go quiet. so MSN is a platform for you and her. since you have got it rolling on MSN, bring it to real life!</p>
              <p>Try out this, paste a funny youtube link and ask her to go watch when you're about to go off, next day go approach her and ask her, was the video funny? and roll the ball on ah.. don't stuck there..</p>
              <p><br>like everyone said, it's about having courage to go for what you want. if you really want her, please gather your courage. if you can't, it means that your pride and ego is higher than what you want. if you lose your chance now, don't regret because you didn't grab the chance when you have it.</p>
