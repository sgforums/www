            <div class='col-md body'>I got a friend same age as me, 22 (my sch mate).<br><br>He asked me a question bcos my gf and me 7 years already and doing fine, and he feel I will be more experience and mature to handle his question. But I am quite stunned by his question and dunno how also. i told him I will need few days to think carefully b4 can advice him.<br><br>Mr A is with his gf, B for 3 years already.<br>Mr A is studying in NTU year 3, and his gf is working.<br><br>He recently know this ger, C through friends. She is our sch mate also but different course. This ger just graduted few months(May 2004) ago bcos she is 4th year already when they got to know each other in March 2004.<br><br>This ger C duno he have a gf. Initially they are just sch mates who have common ECA. Then they started to spend some time together to do some projects for the ECAs and as time goes by, they develop feeling for each other. But they both never admitted. Until got one time, ger C ask my fren "Am I considered your gf?" My friend was stunned, he wanted to say "Yes" but for a moment, he thought of his gfm he hold back his words. He is confused whether he really loved this ger or its only a crush. He just smile and never answer. Can see that Ger C is quite sad.<br><br>For few days they never talk or meet each other. My friend missed Ger C and he sms her to meet for lunch.  Then they met in sch. Ger C asked again. My friend duno why (he tell me he duno why also and thats his biggest mistake, if he answered NO firmly, things will not be like that today) he answered "can be considered ba". And the ger smile. Like this they become bf/gf without ger B knowing. They did everything in sch together, eat, study and prepare exam. Just like what normal BF/GF will do.<br><br>Then before my fren has his last paper. He decided to end the wrongful relationship becos he find that its unfair to ger B. But he cannot find the courage to tell ger C. He say he is scare to hurt ger C if she duno he already have a gf. Even if she know, he is afraid what if ger C still want to be with him even if she know he has a GF.<br><br>My friend seems to have a feeling ger C is also aware he already have a gf. But she pretend duno. (My friend is not sure whether ger C know he have a gf or not until today). After his last paper, he went home while ger C continue to study for her last paper few years later. Ger C is sad that he never accompany her study for her last paper. My friend is also sad, but he is trying hard, endure the pain to end this relationship. But anyway time passed.<br><br>Exam over, ger C failed a module. And had to retake the module this semester. My friend also failed one. Maybe its retribution (my friend say). Although ger C has contacted my friend a few time during holiday to eat lunch or dinner, and they went out a few time, things were not very happy although they never quarrel. They just went out to eat, then go home. Neither speak about how come things sour in between suddenly. They just enjoy each other's company and they can feel they missed each other a lot. For that moments, my friend say he dont care already, he just wan to enjoy his time with her, dont care whether they are still BF/GF or not.<br><br>Then school reopens. Ger C never come to school. She is only required to take exam again. My friend A was busy studying with me (same class). Actually my friend tell me he intended to come clean with the ger C and admit and ask for her forgiveness, but he dont have the courage to approach ger C. Ger C also know that my friend is avoiding her during the holiday, so she also never bother to look for my friend anymore, she is giving up. The last time a sms was exchange is my friend asking her for lunch when school reopen (my fren miss her, wana see her, oh my god!, I dun understand my fren :&lt; ). The ger C replied "thanks for the offer,  I am busy, going gym to work out later on" Then my friend thought she is angry due to him avoiding her for the past few months, so he thought maybe its better to let it be and let her hate him forever. So he never contact her until now. And she also never contacted him.<br><br>My friend is afraid if he tell her that he also love her but cannot be with her due to ger B, she will be moved and might want to come back to be with my friend. Then my friend will be back in the situation whether to hurt ger B by ending the 3 years relationship or hurt ger C by saying the relationship is not possible due to his commitment with ger B. My friend is seriously very confused. So am I.<br><br>Exams is coming again. My friend and I is busy studying this few days throghout the nights in school. He was reminded how he studied thtough the nights with ger C in the school. He is very sad. And it was during one of the supper time, when he expressed his troubles to me. he is feeling very guilty towards ger C now. He feels like meeting ger C. But duno whether he should do it. And if meet, what should he do or say?<br><br>Anyone know how should he solve this?<br>Should he contact ger C and admit everything and say sorry?<br>Or should he let it be and forget everything and be with ger B like nothing happened?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Whoever your friend choose, to avoid this type of problem next time, DO NOT GIVE ANOTHER GIRL ANY POSSIBLE CHANCE ONCE YOU ARE COMMITTED. If not, this will happen again and again. Happens to my friend all the time since he cannot tahan girl being good to him and start drifting. Don't know hurt how many people liao in this process which keeps repeating itself.<br><br>As to who to choose, follow his heart. But, I doubt this will be the end if he continues this way. I had friends who got into this type of trouble all the time, being easily influenced to like another girl.</div>

Truth hurts but lying is worse!.. its better to say it out.. then one day..both girls found out what exactly happen.. and everything jus end so badly.. He will even feel more guilty by hurting both at the same time.. and losing them too.. one as a gf.. or another as a friend.. (whoever it is)..<br><br>Yes of cos.. the girls will be hurt.. will cry.. will hate him.. i don't know.. Let them know the truth better than hiding.. Soon he can't hide also.. since he love ger c.. and be cos of ger b.. who was with him for 3 years.. he thinks that he shouldn't let ger b down.. He must know how to differentiate.. love and repay kindness.. ger b might be with him for long.. but that doesn't mean that she's the one for him.. All the while.. he never mention about ger b.. how much he loved her.. all he talked about is only ger c..<br><br>In this case.. if he keep on dragging this problems.. probably.. friends also cannot be.. It's being unfair not only to ger b.. but to ger c.. settle this ASAP.. don't drag... now is not time whether to think to be still with ger b... or ger c.. now is the time.. to solve this triangled-love.. In the end who will he be with.. it will be after this whole thing when he said out to both of them... At least.. he won't feel so much guilt in him by saying out..<br><br>Cheers..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

So he never contact her until now. And she also never contacted him.<br><br>My friend is afraid if he tell her that he also love her but cannot be with her due to ger B, she will be moved and might want to come back to be with my friend. Then my friend will be back in the situation whether to hurt ger B by ending the 3 years relationship or hurt ger C by saying the relationship is not possible due to his commitment with ger B. My friend is seriously very confused. So am I.<br><br>Exams is coming again. My friend and I is busy studying this few days throghout the nights in school. He was reminded how he studied thtough the nights with ger C in the school. He is very sad. And it was during one of the supper time, when he expressed his troubles to me. he is feeling very guilty towards ger C now. He feels like meeting ger C. But duno whether he should do it. And if meet, what should he do or say?<br><br>Anyone know how should he solve this?<br>Should he contact ger C and admit everything and say sorry?<br>Or should he let it be and forget everything and be with ger B like nothing happened?<br><br></div></blockquote>Now, he got himself in such a state. How could he step on 2 boats at a same time? As a fren, i understand ur view point to help him. I actually suspect whether u ar actually the person involved. I give u the benefit of the doubt.<br><br>1stly, as a fren i think u shld ask him to wake up from his slumpish and sillt tots. As mentioned, why did he say the things he shldnt? He jolly well knows he got a gf and stil can go get another gf. I duno wat is he thinking. Wheres his love for his gf? How could he just abuse the trust of his gf just like that?<br><br>I think he should just be frank with both girl C and girl B. I seriously think he shouldnt bluff both girls like that. Frankly speaking, he dun deserve any of the girls. I may be harsh but thats wat i think.<br><br>From what u say, i suspect ur fren is like wanting someone for company during sch days? (As his gf is working, timetable not the same.) Does he really love either girl C or girl B? Ask him to ask himself this question. If he love girl B, y did he get involved with girl C? If he love girl C, y is he stil hurting girl B by holding on to the relationship? U cant have both sides of the world, u have to make a decision.<br><br>Is it possible for u to love both girls at the same time? Rem that in the world of love, it is not so simple. Cruelty exists at times. If u really love girl B, cut off ur ties with girl C. If u really love girl C, tell girl B frankly. Both ways a girl will get hurt but its better to settle it now than one day they each found out themselves. The hurt will be deeper then.  (Thats my reason for saying u dun deserve both.)<br><br>My advices might or might not serve as help. Or mayb they are not even advices. If u can, y not concentrate on ur studies 1st and then solve this after exams immediately?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>wah laos. your fren ah.... *shake head*<br><br>okie, first, from your post, your fren keep mentioning about ger C, ger C's feelings, ger C's this and that. NOTHING about ger B's feelings. it seems he is more concerned about ger C, due to guilt (he lied) or he just likes her more. i think his feelings for his ger B has stagnanted or died. for it is a very simple logic: a satisfied man will not stray.<br><br>tell your fren to have the balls to face his mess, he is hurting 2 gals at the same time - ger B with his unfaithfulness and lies (i'm sure did push anway time with ger B to be with ger C) and ger C by giving her false hopes. It is better for him and for the gals that he tells them the truth. His conscience is eating him oready and if this goes on, it would not only be bad for the gals but for himself too. i'm sure the gals would be very upset when he tells them, but it is a sooner or later thing. Be a man, face the music and stop being a wimp who only knows how to hide behind lies.<br><br>hope your fren does the right thing ya?<br><br>Don</div>
