I just donÂ’t want you to fall into the latter category. Protect your heart first and foremost.<br><br>Do girls hide their feelings? Sure.<br><br>Is it part of wooing to decipher their feelings? No way. We arenÂ’t programmed to think the way they do.<br><br>And there you are cracking your head and thinking of all sorts of reasons as to why she might be attracted to you but failed to keep in contact all these yearsÂ…<br><br>Seriously, you really think that she can be so busy with her studies or career that she couldnÂ’t even find time to contact someone she is attracted to all these YEARS?<br><br>Read that list you made again. The reasons you gave are rather delusional I feel (we are talking about years here!).<br><br>I have a feeling that the reason for your own lack of action all these years is hiding somewhere in that list.<br><br>Maybe a rival in love who back-stabbed you?<br><br>Please tell me that isnÂ’t the caseÂ…<br><br>For IF it is, you have a much more serious problem;<br><br>Your fear of failure is driving you to make excuses for your lack of action (contacting her) all these years. The battle will be lost before you even contact her.<br><br>But I agree with what you wrote. Which is why I suggested something you can try.<br><br>I certainly agree that it is better to try than regret.<br><br>But just donÂ’t raise your hopes and expectations too high.<br><br>Good luck.<br></div>
