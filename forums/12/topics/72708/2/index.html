When it comes to relationships and feelings, you are not to judge about something that you are not involved in. I've had people commenting and talking about my relationships in the past.. Be it my friends or my family. Even if you are correct, she needs to learn for herself that he is wrong for her. Being hurt is part and parcel of every relationship. And so is happiness and love etc..<br>Anyway. point is... apologise, tell her you only did it cos you were really concerned with her. And butt out.. only butt in when she comes to you for help.</div>
