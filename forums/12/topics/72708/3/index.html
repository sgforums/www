Astrologically speaking, there are possible Pluto connections and other lasting bonds with one another, which you both have in each other and result in an unbreakable invisible cord.<br><br>There are two side of a coin to these effects - firstly, if your both are married, divorce cannot be an option. Secondly, if you two are not together for certain reasons, chances are: it's linked with your love cosmic karma - the villian that always delude people to think that 'this is true love' OR 'The One'....<br><br>... when in fact it's a test to see if you could realise some relationship are never meant to be there in the first place. How we handle our own love crisis will result in either growth or degeneration.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You want to live out your misery, you have to understand the source of your misery - you will realise that it never came from her, but it seeps from your preception, thinkings, emotions and actions.<br><br>***<br><br>If you can't stand having just a simple friendship. Avoid. She can't give you the affection and adoration that a Leo would need in return for your love. You tried so many years to hold onto the moving truck - why wouldn't you try and release the tight grip? I would tell you, it's much easier. Yes, you will hurt yourself when you land, but that's about it.<br><br><strong>Yes, that's about it</strong>.<br><br>Believe in respecting space, freedom, freewill and decision. You will gradually see the bigger picture. Be a driver of your own love, not a thief trying to fit in somewhere. You can't because all is taken up - there isn't a perfect place to put you.<br><br>Cheers</div>
