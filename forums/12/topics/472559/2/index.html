              Anyway would like some more help/advice as too many things happen today.
              We had a exam today which she did not do well as she did not manage to finish the paper thus, she got very demotivated and wanted to quit sch(which she has been thinking to) but I can't convince her not to this time round not only cos of the penalty she has to pay to the govt so how can I convince her not to? I mean like though after this sem, we will be mixed up n hve a new class but I've promised to help her, but she's getting very negative. Just don't want to lose her

              <p>If you regard her a girl worth to be your partner for the whole life, her background or your background is irrelevant, isn't it? If she decline u solely due to your background, she is not worth your love...and what the hell? R u really a young fella??? I thought only old man would be troubled by this kind of idle factor, young man should be more dashing and daring in pursuing love, right? </p>

              <p>With respect to all other comments here,</p>
              <p>I have always felt that being honest is the best. Stop torturing yourself by wondering so much and trying to be someone you're not. Worrying and thinking will not get you anywhere because there is no wonderful strategy that will guarantee success. </p>
              <p>Just be honest with her and tell her how you feel. The right time will be when YOU feel it's right. <span style="line-height: 1.231;">What to say? Well, tell her how your feel about her, what are your thoughts on your parents and hers and what you think the future may hold if she accepts you. </span></p>
              <p>If she says no and decides to stop talking to you, then learn from the experience, move on and find someone who appreciates you the way you are. Your happiness is in your own control, make the best out of it and stay happy.</p>
