(the main issue here aint about the neo-print.. more like she feels tat i very half-hearted in all these things... and shes like constantly trying to heat up our r/s but yet get a cold response from me..)<br><br>from this point.. it then further developed into a bigger topic... its with regards to our anniversaries and dates......<br><br>in my point... i regarded our first time together...our first 100 days... our first 6mths and our anniversaries as of importance to me... but i made her haf the feeling that i didnt care about our mths.. i just wanna calculate days.. which i already lost count by now... <span style="color: red;">btw.. its our mid-7th mth now.. gonna enter to our 8th mth in another 2wks or so..... </span><br><br>hence she really feels tat i dun care less about our r/s... all the testimonials she sent me... all the things she had done for our memorable days... and ive like nutting in return..... which i felt tat i had done them as well.. our first day together.. i booked a place at jack's place.. order flowers.. bought her a necklace..... all that prepartion thing..... then our 6mths.. i bought her a ring as an indication that i really love her and would like to bring our r/s to greater heights... i really do.... our anniversary.. well.. its not here yet....<br><br>i dunno.... did i do something wrong?... or maybe all these things tat i do are just materialistic? but i put in alot of effort in planning and making them happen..<br><br>y is all this happening?? just when i tot that the turbulances are all over... every is peaceful and calm right now.. both of us settled down and such... really... just when i felt this way.... this issue now blows right straight into my face...<br><br>it hurts... im really feeling dam sad now... y.... y so sudden.....<br><br>but ya... she aint initiating anything tat i hope she might..... just tat this 'quarrel' of ours... make me really very sad............. its like so wtf... y so out of the blue...<br><br>really very heartbroken right now....</div></blockquote>To Devil  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow">  eh.. you aint paying attention to his problems ah.. lol.. too many dots dots dots.. until you blur le...<br><br>Well.. personally.. i dun really agreed that pampering your gf ALWAYS will blossom or last your r/s...

And whether they're practical to do... Or practical to maintain of the long run...<br><br>I'm not sure exactly what you meant when you mentioned that your gf likes you to find out about what she's feeling and thinking on your own.. If she's like... Expecting you to just 'know' most if not all of her thoughts and thinkings, now this is one exmaple of being not practical... If she's just hinting that communication is more than just words alone... That is perhaps something you should learn...?<br><br>There have to some basic understanding of what your gf likes and prefers... And from there, you can choose to work out your own poison... Not everything goes by the book in a relationship you know?</div>
