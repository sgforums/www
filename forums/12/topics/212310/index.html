            <div class='col-md body'>Erm.. You can try doing something romantic for your 8th anniversary that's coming up.. Can try to give her a surprise or anything.. Just do something so as to prove that you care about the relationship..<br><br>Well.. You can just request her to tell you straight what she expects and what she actually wants.. She can't expect you to know what she wants if she chooses to remain quiet.. There can't be such telepathy between people bah.. Instead of placing so much hope on you knowing what she wants.. It's better to speak out isn't it..?<br><br>Hope my comment helps..

But I firmly believe that it shouldn't overshadow what the heart truly feels and how u feels towards her. Romance is but a tool to foster better relationship; at the rate you are going, if it is going to create arguments between 'who's giving more', then it defeats the purpose of being loving and end up quarreling.<br><br>Learn as you love - you still have a long way to go man.<br><br>P.S: Wah rao...like that also can quarrel. Don't always take it too hard every time u argue with her. Always take it as a channel to understand the woman you are getting and ways to evolve to a better boyfriend. Nobody is born knowing how to handle their partner, we all learn along the way.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br><span class="small">I won't post this at my side, just in case she check my side. </span><br><br>Cheers</div>
