But conception can take place from a minimum of 3-6 days from the day of intercourse, since sperm can live in a woman's body for up to that number of days.<br><br>If her period missed by a week, take the test after that week.  PTKs are still not 100% proof of pregnancy.  The readings may be  a wrong negative.</div>

This is the time when the hormones(hcg) caused by pregancy is at its peak and is released into the bloodstream.<br><br>PTKs tests are on urine samples since the hcg is present in blood going thru the kidney.  How accurate PTKs can be depends on the sensitivity of the test itself.  Some PTKs test much lower values of hcg present thus providing more accurate results.<br><br>Doctors test blood samples which is  accurate to 99.9% since the amount of hcg contained in the blood is higher.</div>

Eg. if the last period started on 8 Jan, by 8 Feb, if the period does not come, the girl can go pharmacy to buy a pregnancy test kit to try out.  It is 99% accurate (actually 100% one!).  Spoke with a doctor friend on this before.  He said that there is some element in the pregnant woman's urine that will cause the test kit to change colour (forgot what the element called).  The kit will not go wrong.  But for some women who really want to be sure, they buy two or more brand to try.  This is not necessary, just waste of money only.  But if these women really want to be positively sure, no harm trying a few.<br><br>Last time my girlfriend got pregnant and she did not know.

Go to a gynae to get a full confirmation by doing an ultrascan on the tummy to see the shape of the foetus.  By now... it is 100% confirm liao!!!!</div>
