              <p>I am actually quite sad. I have been posting and highlighting the importance of insurance to people but hais... as a result, i been getting alot of crude and really insulting remarks from people and people again</p>
              <p>None of them even mention thanxs nor anything, wat i gt was getting scolded and described as irritating. Am i even wrong to post smething wch i tink is really important? I did not even leave down my contact nor anything. This is my job and to be honest, i am really very passionate abt it.</p>
              <p>Wat i want to say is.....I am really really sad becoz i been criticized like as if i am a pest and i really felt very terrible abt it, not as if i am doing smething very wrong...hais....i noe this is part and parcel of being an insurance agent. But dun u think it is really unfair?</p>
              <p>Dear guys and gals, please give me ur honest comments and dun stereotype me just becoz i have mention i am an agent. Wat i want to know is tat i am just like everyone of u here. Please give me some comments on what you guys and gals think...thanxs</p>

              An Insurance policy is a good thing.
              Its the agent that is the problem. An insincere person peddling a life long product.
              
              Too many agents, drop their prospects after securing the policy. So no after sales service. Many would have left the job after a few sales.
              If and when they do appear again, its only to sell another product. Tell them you need money, and need to cash in or a loan, they dissappear again. I tried that on my long lost agent who sold me an endowment policy when I in the late twenties. Never heard from him after that.
              
              Its the person, not the product.
              
              Rare is the insurance agent who is your financial partner for life, after your first policy.

              <p>insurance by itself is very important.a must have for everyone.throw in unethical agents and supertitions give most agents the pest title..</p>
              <p>a ethical agent will recommend the most suitable insurance product to the client and highlights both good n bad points of the product and not be swayed by the commissions earned. even if it means telling your client a rival company actually has a better product.</p>
              <p>btw TS,try youtube bangkok insurance and save it to your laptop and show to your clients before or during your presentation..it helped for me..hope it help for u too..but being ethical dun really earns u mdrt,tot that kind of awards.</p>

              <p>I know insurance is important.</p>
              <p>However, I cannot stand some insurance agents' faces, display of unprofessionalism and/ their way of speeches.</p>
              <p>Yes, I am shallow-minded I know but I am comfortable with people who can serve me well. :)</p>

              <p>Ah boi, cheer up ok. Same like you, I tried posting post everywhere. Rejection is the biggest thing that we have to overcome if we want to survive in this industry.</p>
              <p>Everyone knows insurance is important, and yet it does not give people the sense of urgency and satisfaction. It is not something that you can see or feel, so it naturally loses out.</p>
              <p>But that does not mean that it is impossible. I got my first 2 client online. and now they are my good friends. I have one referral from them already.</p>
              <p>Products, Knowledge, Service and Sincerity is the key to Success. I am still far from MDRT, but if you believe that you are doing the right thing, then persevere on!</p>
              <p>p/s. anyway, i am not that aggressive for the MDRT. I prefer to do things slowly. LOL.</p>

              <p>Is it something wrong with your sales pitch, or rather, the approach you've taken to educate others? Many insurance agents come across as too "pushy" saying they have the perfect solution to our needs but never really take the time to understand us as individuals.</p>
              <p>Sterotyping isn't just for insurance agents. Previously, I was working in the banking industry as a RM (SME sector for ETS), and whenever I do cold calls to new prospects, people will just think we're telemarketers promoting some credit card/personal loans.</p>
              <p>I understand you're passionate about insurance products, and your effort taken to educate others about them. However, most people generally like to buy things they need instead of "being sold", hence explaining the initial resistance to a salesman.</p>

              <p>Dear Ladies and gentlement, Thanxs for the encouragement you all have given mi. I have reflected upon myself and move on strongly in life. I told myself to fight on despite facing all the discrimination given by ppl. It was not easy, i tried calling alot of cold calls and prospecting outside market.</p>
              <p>i faced many rejections and many really discriminating looks upon me, but i remebered this is part and parcel of my job. However, with my preserverance and endless trying, I finally managned to talk to a couple of people and they are very satisfied with my service and the way i presented my idea and solutions for them. They give me the confidence to move on and try more and knowing that i have done a good job too.</p>
              <p>To those that have encouraged mi and given mi alot of pointers, i am really deeply grateful as it was those encouragement that made mi to spurred on more! I was rreally depressed and sad during that conjecture. Though it is just very simple words of encouragement typing from the computer, but it meant alot to me. Without them, i dun tink i even could have the courage to made more cold calls and doing more roadshows. it was you guys that made mi the happier person today.</p>
              <p>I decide to ignore all this critism and be confident of myself and have faith in myself. I told myself one day i am going to be the top agent in Singapore. And i will defintiely not forgetting this day. thank you guys and gals for gicing mi such wondeful feedback!! Really thanxs!!</p>
