            <div class='col-md body'>Hi TS,<br><br>If i'm u, i will act blur and pretend that i don't know that he like me but i will find ways to hint that he is not my cup of tea. For example, i will tell him that i like this guy or this kind of guy is so cute (the complete opposite of him) blah blah.<br><br>If he confess, then u tell him that u only treat him as a friend.If he is mature enough, he might not deem the rejection too hard and could remain as friend.<br><br>Anyway some guys are smart enough to realize that u don't like him. It might not be u giving the signals to him or/and he interpret it there way. U don't have to distance yourself away but gently help him get his idea right.. well, see how things go, then adjust accordingly.<br><br>Ok i hope i make sense.<br><br>cheers.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Speaking from a guy's point of view.......<br><br>If he does confess, reject him gently..but don't leave any ambiguity. A clean ouright rejection will be the best for all concerned in the long run.<br>If he's not willing to be friends after that, then he was never really your friend to begin with, so you won't have to feel bad over it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>I've been in that guy's shoes before and I can tell you, I'd have preferred being rejected outright but staying friends.

            <div class='col-md body'>i am a guy so frm my POV, i have gotten both ways of rejecting before.<br>i mean it is usually the guys to make the move(and it is not easy) and now i learn that the girl has a job accepting/rejecting the guy( not sure if it harder than the guy's job).<br><br>give him a chance, u may not like every aspect of him, but u also cannot have prince charming.<br><br>i have learnt and felt the most so far in this forum topic.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>By avoiding is by far the best way of a rejection. If u confessed , and she suddenly avoids u. Its a very big hint that.. u been shot down.<br><br>Unless he keeps confronting u , THEN u say it directly that... even if he is the last man on earth u wont be with him.<br><br>If he starts asking why ... blah blah blah..  , just say what u wanna say. But the truth is normally better.<br><br>N maybe , just maybe that he will accept the fact n become normal friends. Its gonna be hard for the dude , its just a matter of how he is able to cope with it thats all.<br><br></div>
