              <p>swiftwinds.......why do you hate your dad just becus he treats you with more importance than your sister? excuse me, a D7 is bad, but getting nothing at all is even worst, not even trying to attend the cca is worst than getting a D7, if you did get a worst grade than your sister, your dad wont be any more angrier to you than if you didn't even have the guts to attend the cca.</p>
              <p>nowadays, its all about school rankings and grade marks, when is any kid going to realize for themselves its not all about the ranks and grades, its about your effort, EFFORT is the most important attribute in your life, not just getting a top grade, going to work, getting thru work, going home to sleep and return to the continued cycle..</p>
              <p>i think your dad really cares of you, do you know how my dad treats me? i never get any form of praise or scoldings at all, sometimes i do things so that my parents would scold me...you should be happy that you got a dad who cares not just about your grades and rubbish rankings(rankings are stupid demoralizing tools) but also about how you grow up.</p>

              <p>To say something such as you will fail for life has shown that your father didn't actually think through before blurting what he said out. </p>
              <p>Just let him be, maybe something bad happen recently and he is unable to handle the stress, and you end up being a "chu qi tong" for him.</p>

              <p>U go to school not only for academic but also for character development etc etc which is where cca comes in. There is no excuse for you to have skip ur cca for whatever reasons since all the ccas would have ended their activities before the exams.</p>
              <p>A fail in cca should mean that you have been skipping all the training/activities all year long. This besides laziness, what other excuses do you have for it and for that, i'm not surprised your dad is angry.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, if you had lied about attending cca to ur family and use that excuse to do other things that they might not have approved of, that would be something as good as committing a crime.</p>

              <p>I chose the wrong CCA. I shouldn't even chose IT Club. I don't
              really have friends there. I'm scared. I'm afraid that i get mocked
              by the people there. If i had chose the another CCA, i would have
              attend every single week. And then my dad says : if you can't even
              attend iT Club, then what about those UG? I want to join NPCC, i
              liked it. But after i got kicked out, i lost my interest in CCAs.
              And my dad says, if i continue like this, he won't let me study
              anymore? What bullshit is this! How bad can CCA reflect on my
              choices for JC and poly?</p>
