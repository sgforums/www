              <p>Today was the meet-the-parents session. The dad that i always loved, screamed at me, scolded me using harsh words, he said i will be a failure in life, just because i didn't attend my cca. The problem is my sis got D7 for her cca, yet my father said nothing. I'm really sad that the dad that i always loved and always cared for me, is no longer there. It's not like i failed my exams, i got 6 As, i'm in the top 40, yet he still screams at me over cca. He's not giving me any rewards, i can go out, but no pocket money. He said if i continue like this, he will not let me study anymore. This is fucked up, i regretted studying hard for my exams. It's not like i failed my exams, shoplifted, or i did any crime, it's just a bloody cca. I cried for so long, i feel so sad, i don't love my father anymore. Dad, i hate you ):</p>

              <p><br>I agree with your father. You will probably be a failure in life.</p>
              <p>Even if you became the first person in singapore to get 11 A1s for O' Levels, with your kind of attitude, you'd still be a failure and a loser.</p>
              <p>CCA helps to build character. You study for the sake of your future, or to make your parents proud, or because you like studying. Studying simply for money instead of recognising that CCA is part of the education system is really stupid.</p>
              <p>Stop comparing yourself to others, especially classmates. You aren't them, and they aren't your father's child.</p>

              <p>Obviously your dad has made up his mind.</p>
              <p>So all that's left to do, is to follow his wishes. The end.</p>
              <p>After all, CCA does build character at the very least, and it prepares you for the fact that you are gonna have many other commitments other than just studies later on in life. CCA also helps you for your O' Level aggregate score.</p>
              <p>Perhaps your father has seen that letting your sister off easy has made her into less than what she is made of, and doesn't want the same thing to happen to you.</p>

              <p>If u can't even learn to work well with ppl in ur cca, how are u going to face the working world in future?</p>
              <p>The reason for ccas are to learn all the soft skills and maybe some technical skills depending on cca which academic cannot teach. In fact u stand to gain alot more knowledge from cca that will aid ur whole life more than any amt of academic success can ever bring since you only can study that many years.</p>

              <p>CCA is not juz to - pts in JC</p>
              <p>U can learn alot of leadership, organisation etc skills from CCA which will serve u well in watever u do in future. When u look for work in future, what ppl wanna see besides ur academic results is ur skills n knowledge outside the books such as ur leadership, organisation ability etc. Results many people can score the same results but its these value added skills that makes each applicant different from the rest.</p>
