              <p>Academics are important but so are cca activities and the best student is 1 who can strike a good balence on both ends without neglecting the other.An active cca will enrich ur life more than not having 1 and as you grow older, you will realise the significance of it more and more.</p>
              <p>Regardless, you are studying for ur future. Don't let this issue make you make stupid decisions that will ruin ur own future. Its too late to start scolding urself for being stupid after things have happened as you cannot reverse time.</p>
              <p>Unless u do not intend to take a science or engineering career in future. U BETTER take pure science. Taking DnT, FnN, art is an absolutely stupid decision even for my tuition kid whose results is worse than urs.</p>

              <p>If thats the truth, it will show some maturity and will give me a better impression of you. U're just 14, going through puberty doesn't give you an excuse to be implusive.</p>
              <p>Never make or say anything when you are agitated cos most ppl live to regret later on. What you did by just posting on forums etc might be minimal and have little effect on ur life etc but this behavior if left uncheck can create problems for you in future.</p>

              <p>to TS,</p>
              <p>allow me to give you a perspective from a parent of two teenage sons, one of whom is doing his 'O' levels now.</p>
              <p>I have never rewarded my sons for results - as a student, your job is to study and study well. getting good results is a given thing! there shall be no negotiations on this.</p>
              <p>I have rewarded my sons for efforts put in - one of my boys received a big present for his effort even before the PSLE results were out - merely because I can see him working hard.</p>
              <p>Getting good grades is only one part of going out. I personally emphasize more on character development, ie, if you are in a CCA, do your best. This principle is the same throughout, be serious and commited in whatever you want to do. This is the same in the working world.... even if you are the best salesmen in the company, most companies will not tolerate poor attitude.</p>
              <p>I cannot comment on why your dad lost it during the meet the parents session. Whether is it because he was unhappy with your attitude or something else, it is best you ask him.</p>
              <p>One thing I told my sons: if you fall down, I expect you to pick yourself up and walk on. Stop whining about what had happened, and most of all stop being disappointed, it's life, if you are mentally to weak to carry on, then perhaps your dad has the right to be unhappy with you.</p>

              <p>go and take fcking sciences. it is much simpler and less tedious than Dnt, FnN or Art.</p>
              <p>believe me, coursework takes alot of your time.</p>

              <p>wow. you have the same subject combinations as me. If you don't like D&amp;T, focus on English, Amath, Emath, Comb humans and sciences. They're the best combinations to focus on.</p>

              <p>The work load of DnT personally i feel is worse than doing double science since the O's project is something all the boys i know taking DnT hates and spent alot of their time on.</p>
