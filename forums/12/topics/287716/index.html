            <div class='col-md body'>Hi MISI,<br><br>In the first place, there's no such thing as someone don't deserve another person just because the other person might not be as good in certain areas.  If you love the person, he or she is what you loved.<br><br>Also, I feel that everyone should be able to excel in something.  You need to find your strength in a certain area and excel in it.  If you can't do sports, what about singing?  dancing?  writing?  dressing?  cooking?  designing? drawing?  I am sure there's something you can do well.<br><br>As for sports, you can look at sports that are more skills-based and not so much those that requires physical strength and stamin.  Sports like bowling, pool might be easier for you than to run, swim or jump.<br><br>Lastly, don't feel bad that you lost a match.  It's not your fault.  Since you were placed in the team, there must a reason for your existence.  If you can't do well in the match, try being the person to link your team together.  Make sure everyone is happy and harmonious and be the person that everyone likes.  This is another way you can contribute to the team as well.<br><br>A Luv Guru<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by MISI:</div><div class="quote_body">Hello.
