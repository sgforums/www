              <p><br> So killing is a bad thing to do?</p>
              <p>You will be honoured as a HERO if you can kill many people in a
                  war, but you will be branded as a CRIMINAL if you only kill one
                  person during peace time.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So Guan Yu and Lu Bu are all MASS MURDERERS? And all your
                  so-called unchristian gods who have also killed many are all mass
                  murderers then?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Only Jesus Christ is the one and only clean and unstain GOD and
                  not a murderer. So Christianity is the one true religion of peace.

              <p>Dear TS,</p>
              <p>Killing your father or yourself would definitely not be a good solution. Have you tried Lawrence's suggestion? Singapore seems to take strong measures towards gambling addictions. They would most definitely try to help you, if you don't mind your father going to jail if all fails.</p>

              <p>I don't want to kill my father. I do think it solves a lot of problems for a lot of people who are unfortunately, just about slightly, involved with him, but i don't want to kill him.</p>
              <p>So i went to the HDB and they say i can't do anything about it.</p>
              <p>My house is barren and empty now. It's ready for sale in a few days time. It hurts me so much to see my home like that. My home is the only place i could relax, and feel warm. I feel "me" when i was there. I could dream and i could hope. I have a goal - to earn money and keep my home - to look forward to. And such a nice home it is too! It really is nice - airy and big. It's real easy to move out, but i don't want to. My mum is there, don't you get it? I could feel my mum there. I could remember my life before everything turned upside down, and everything that was good is gone. All the fond memories. I was lying on the dusty floor in that empty flat wondering if i still love the house when it's like this - dirty, smelly and barren. Strange thing is, i still feel a strong connection to it. I still want to keep it. The furniture may be gone, but told snap shots or them and shortly i'm gonna have a shifu to rebuild them exactly the same for me.<br><br>My father did not care for my mum. Maybe he used to, but then he sure didn't afterwards when he decide to marry his soul to gambling.<br><br>My father planned to downgrade, and his plans include me. You may say at least he still cares for me, but i know better. He just cares for what that is "his" and right now, it includes me. This misunderstanding won't last much longer i can assure you that. Most importantly, i can't live thinking how he sold my home, my childhood, my everything away just to throw everything to the superpowers who owned the casino. I positively feel no kinship to him anymore, especially since he started on this losing streak and now he's become a maniac. I really do not care whatever that may happen to him if he continues on, but i don't want to dirty my hands by becoming the punisher i have no business becoming. I won't let me drag me down like that.</p>
              <p>My sorrow is indescriptible and there are so many words i could use yet i just can't utter them out anymore. I'm going to visit another authority tommorrow to see if anyone can help me. I seriously don't know if i can è¿‡è¿™å…³ or not. I was so close to jumping, the urge is monstrous.</p>

              <p><br>You only tell us the truth only after you think we have fought it out, so that you can keep your little pathetic topic up?</p>

              <p>Hahahahahahhaah!!!!!!! DO YOU THINK YOU ARE THE ONLY PERSON IN THIS FORUM WHO UNDERSTANDS SORROW?</p>
              <p>REAL SORROW DEFINITELY DON'T ALLOW YOU TO TYPE SO MUCH AND TALKED SO MUCH ABOUT IT. REMEMBER IT NEXT TIME FOR YOUR IDIOTIC TOPIC!!</p>
              <p>Hehehe....you also agreed to kill your Dad even though your Mum is already DEAD, and your Dad is going to take care of you by down-sizing the home despite his gambling habits which is none of your business to mind at the moment in time. Why I said it is none of your business is because you cannot even take care of yourself and be independent enough to support yourself without relying on your Dad!</p>
              <p>People who were close to jumping, definitely doesn't talk about it melancholy like you did. They either JUMPED or they recovered their sadness from their fear of jumping and treasure their lives.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway, good luck with your authorities seeking and treasure your lives FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR MUM!</p>
              <p>ALWAYS THINK ABOUT YOUR MUM AND THINK IF SHE WOULD APPROVED OF YOUR INTENTIONS TO KILL YOUR DAD AND HOW YOU ARE CONDEMNING THE ONLY GUY SHE HAD LOVED AND MARRIED!</p>
              <p>Maybe your Dad sought out gambling out of sorrow after your Mum had passed away?</p>
              <p>Talk to your Dad and take initiative to establish communications with him. DON'T ASK ME WHY! BECAUSE YOUR MUM WOULD HAVE APPROVE OF YOUR INITIATIVE TO COMMUNICATE WITH YOUR DAD!!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>IF you tell me "But I know my Mum would not like me to take initiative to talk to my Dad....", then I'll know that you're LYING! and you just want to extend your sorrowful story further!</p>
              <p>Anyway, this is going to be my last advice post to you. I don't know when the others will realised that they are being taken for a free ride, but you are welcome to take them for the longest ride of their lives. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
