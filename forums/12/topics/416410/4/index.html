              Everytime I see angel and parn's comments, I want to laugh. That's why lah, I don't argue with them. Normally I type 1 line say them, WAH, 100 lines response come back scolding me and arguing why my 1 line is so wrong.
              
              Anyway, to the TS, you can ignore angel and parn comments lah, I don't want you to go to jail. If you really no place to stay, you can stay at my office lah, it got a few classrooms, it's an education centre you can temporary take one of the rooms. If you happen to be good at studies, then can give tuition earn some revenue. However, this is merely short term solution. As for long term solution, maybe rent a proper place, I got a couple female friends can move in and share rent. If take the full place, maybe 4-5 person rent each pays about $300. I can arrange that but no guarantee. It just happens my friend ask me if I want to move out and I wanted to but then to move in with female friends abit weird. Coz I am a guy. And I very giam one, spending money on rental makes me heart pain.
              
              But seriously, the best plan is find your relatives help. Now, why is this good is when you get through all these difficult period, give urself 4-5 years to make some money and have savings, then you have a good life and your dad will 100% regret what he did to you. Because he know he won't get a single cent from you. It's totally sweet revenge (without resorting to hurting anyone *looking at angel &amp; parn*).
              
              Just remember 1 very important thing. If you have the willpower, nobody can ever stop you from becoming successful. Nobody can stand in your way to achieve your life goals. It may take you longer, but eventually, you'll get there. Sometimes, God just want to test your faith in the worst of times. In good times, everybody is God's good friend. It's only when life hits you so hard, most people will start and curse God, and that's when God can reveal who are the true ones. Besides, if you can overcome the hardships, once you taste the sweet success, it will taste alot sweeter.

              <p>it is of no use if one you hate is not totally remove, he will come back and haunt you for the rest of your life. I am not saying you need to remove him physically by yourself, since he is drinker, there are many way to get rid of him, just like pushing him into the traffic when he is drunk, act accidentally knock him off the HDB window or walkway over the ledge, or simply make him trip into a large drain during raining day will do, there are so many way of getting rid of him. If the laws catch up with you, the police, prosecutor and judge will definitely look at it from a drunken point of view, and more over to the laws, one less useless drunker, one less problem, why go pursue a case of no evidences. This people like dailyfreegames are just playing games with you, to be frank,  which relatives will accept you, who will care for you, with your father this type of condition, all relatives would had run far far at the first sight of you and your family members.</p>
              <p>As the chinese said, cut grass dun cut root, the wind will make it grow again, you need to remove the problem once and for all, if needed I can get you a good lawyer to defend you, just in case the police charge you, which i guess they will not do it.</p>

              <p><br>Ohh...you're angry. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p>15 posts and you already got so much awareness until you can come up with this 90% number. And why not 85% or 89%? Does your calculator only calculate 90% no matter what you input onto it? It could be zero because your calculator is biased from the beginning. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p>When were you polite then? You only got 15 posts and you can go and trace all my posts and you will find that I got more polite posts than you lor. I'm merciful to you because I also don't want to bring up numbers and put you down like a dog.</p>
              <p>Dog is a male dog and Bitch is a female dog. So in case you don't want to admit your own failure, I will tell you that not only have you insulted yourself repeatedly as a dog, but you were also being insulted repeatedly by others. Not my problem if your english failed.</p>
              <p>Maybe you need to be in this forum long enough then you can tell me whether I really need the self-esteem boost or not.</p>
              <p>And if you are feeling so bad after reading this from me, I will tell you that you're actually the person who need the self-esteem boost.</p>
              <p>Take your time to understand all my posts and my style of help and humour. If you don't, then you may continue to bring forward your anger to me and I don't mind it at all.</p>
              <p>Again, you don't call me Parnie unless you have been in this sgforum for quite some time. So by choosing to log onto your trolling clone account to pick on me, you are a coward in my opinion and many others who doesn't need a clone account to troll and others who doesn't misuse their clone account for trolling and flaming purposes.</p>
              <p>YOU ARE A TROLL AND A COWARD IN REAL LIFE.

              <p><br> Ohh...you're angry. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p>15 posts and you already got so much awareness until you can
                  come up with this 90% number. And why not 85% or 89%? Does your
                  calculator only calculate 90% no matter what you input onto it?
                  It could be zero because your calculator is biased from the
                  beginning. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p>When were you polite then? You only got 15 posts and you can go
                  and trace all my posts and you will find that I got more polite
                  posts than you lor. I'm merciful to you because I also
                  don't want to bring up numbers and put you down like a dog.</p>
              <p>Dog is a male dog and Bitch is a female dog. So in case you
                  don't want to admit your own failure, I will tell you that not only
                  have you insulted yourself repeatedly as a dog, but you were also
                  being insulted repeatedly by others. Not my problem if your english
                  failed.</p>
              <p>Maybe you need to be in this forum long enough then you can tell
                  me whether I really need the self-esteem boost or not.</p>
              <p>And if you are feeling so bad after reading this from me, I will
                  tell you that you're actually the person who need the self-esteem
                  boost.</p>
              <p>Take your time to understand all my posts and my style of help
                  and humour. If you don't, then you may continue to bring forward
                  your anger to me and I don't mind it at all.</p>
              <p>Again, you don't call me Parnie unless you have been in this
                  sgforum for quite some time. So by choosing to log onto your
                  trolling clone account to pick on me, you are a coward in my
                  opinion and many others who doesn't need a clone account to troll
                  and others who doesn't misuse their clone account for trolling and
                  flaming purposes.</p>
              <p>YOU ARE A TROLL AND A COWARD IN REAL LIFE. I don't expect you to
                  suddenly have the courage to admit your own mistakes, but at least
                  you should learn to be more tactful and responsible in your usage

              <p>Everytime I see angel and parn’s comments, I want to laugh. That’s why lah, I don’t argue with them. Normally I type 1 line say them, <span>WAH</span>, 100 lines response come back scolding me and arguing why my 1 line is so wrong.</p>
              <p>Anyway, to the TS, you can ignore angel and parn comments lah, I don’t want you to go to jail. If you really no place to stay, you can stay at my office lah, it got a few classrooms, it’s an education centre you can temporary take one of the rooms. If you happen to be good at studies, then can give tuition earn some revenue. However, this is merely short term solution. As for long term solution, maybe rent a proper place, I got a couple female friends can move in and share rent. If take the full place, maybe 4-5 person rent each pays about $300. I can arrange that but no guarantee. It just happens my friend ask me if I want to move out and I wanted to but then to move in with female friends abit weird. Coz I am a guy. And I very giam one, spending money on rental makes me heart pain.</p>
              <p>But seriously, the best plan is find your relatives help. Now, why is this good is when you get through all these difficult period, give urself 4-5 years to make some money and have savings, then you have a good life and your dad will 100% regret what he did to you. Because he know he won’t get a single cent from you. It’s totally sweet revenge (without resorting to hurting anyone <strong>looking at angel &amp; parn</strong>).</p>
              <p>Just remember 1 very important thing. If you have the willpower, nobody can ever stop you from becoming successful. Nobody can stand in your way to achieve your life goals. It may take you longer, but eventually, you’ll get there. Sometimes, God just want to test your faith in the worst of times. In good times, everybody is God’s good friend. It’s only when life hits you so hard, most people will start and curse God, and that’s when God can reveal who are the true ones. Besides, if you can overcome the hardships, once you taste the sweet success, it will taste alot sweeter.</p>

              <p>Then again, I don't think you loved your Mum and Dad in real life too. That's why you could come up with such an advice for TS.</p>
              <p>Nowadays there are really self-contradicting and hypocrite Christians out there who can talked about GOD but yet still can feel noble about advising TS to turn against his own father.</p>

              <p>Ohhh... I did not encourage TS to kill his own father. I presented the idea to stop him from killing his own father. And I also presented the idea that says killing is bad when it's true that killing will make you a HERO during wartime, and a CRIMINAL during peacetime.</p>

              <p><br>Did you meet the buyer ? Try to contact the buyer and tell him/her that your father is a gambler and has owed loan sharks a lot of money. Lie to them that your family always harass by the loan sharks.They will back out the deal upon hearing this. Do it quick before the deal is sealed.</p>

              <p>Being the TS doesn't necessarily makes him the most important person in his story.</p>
              <p>And you should be wise enough to identify the key actors and then be neutral enough to assess the entire situation as accurately as you can based on the information provided and potentially withheld by the TS.</p>
              <p>If I'm a troll for not supporting TS, then so be it.</p>
              <p>But you would be held accountable for many other kind of names if you realised that you had blindly encouraged and supported TS in his wrong cause.</p>

              Wrong wrong wrong! You got your history information wrong! Let me help you...
              
              Moses say want to eat MacDonald, Muslim prefer KFC, then Jesus said he got popular card, can save money if eat KFC, then Buddha said eat veggie cheaper, then God said, I love mutton curry. And hence, the war never stop until this day, western supporters vs muslim people. Not like me, I am at peace with everyone, because I can eat Macdonald or KFC and I have popular card to save money at the same time I also eat veggie and mutton curry.
