              <p>Hi wakely,</p>
              <p>Sorry to hear abt yr situation. Does yr father think &amp; acknowledge that he has a gambling problem? If yes, he shd go seek professional help for his gambling addiction.</p>
              <p>If he doesn't and refused to seek help and do not see the need to change, u have to seriously consider whether u want to continue to lead yr life subjected to the consequences of yr father's gambling issue. U have a choice. If he doesn't change or see the need to change, then u really have to think whether u want to be dragged down by him, and for how long more, and when/ where will u draw the line. Though he is yr father, but he has no right to destroy yr life and happiness. This is a choice and something u hv to think about.</p>
              <p>Whatever it is, do not do anything silly to yourself. Your father may cause u to be in this situation, but u can choose not to be a victim by taking control of your own life.</p>
              <p>Lawrence,</p>

              <p>There are a lot of questions which come to mind for those of us who are reading this:</p>
              <p>1) Where is your mom?</p>
              <p>2) Do you have any siblings? Are they older/younger? </p>
              <p>3) How old are you? Are you studying/working?</p>
              <p>4) Is the ownership of the flat solely to your father?</p>
              <p>5) How is the general relationship between your direct family like?</p>
              <p>Don't think about dying just because the flat is sold. If you can, go out, seek work and rent a place to stay. It is good to have a place to call home, but if the circumstances force you to be without one, then you must learn to stand up by yourself.</p>
              <p>I can only give you more advice if you answer the above questions, as well as share more information if possible.</p>

              <p>If 100% ownership of the house is under him, then there is no way to block his move directly. </p>
              <p>As law8667 has thoughtfully suggested, you should seek the help of those hotlines. They are more experienced in such things, and they will likely have some ideas of the legal avenues which you can seek to attempt to block your father's move.</p>

              Sorry to hear about TS situation, I hope someone can find a way to help. In this case, it's no longer the dad is good. As I've always maintained, while some parents do care for their kids, this reasoning is not always true, so I always feel surprised when people still repeat the non-factual saying of all parents love their kids. When I read in other topics about family problems and strangers just say, your parents love you, without actually knowing the full situation, it makes me wonder if humans really think at all, or simply just repeating what they heard or passed down information from the elders.
              
              In this case, just my opinion, if I was the TS, I will find a way out, plan A and plan B. Plan A might be some way to stop the sale. Plan B might to find lodging and despite all lifeâ€™s hardships, there is always a way to be successful. Plan B could be thinking up where to stay, maybe friends or relatives place? Then find a way to get income, maybe some job? Then find a way to save abit of money for education?
              
              Just to share with TS, I left home 2 years back, with only $200 in my pocket, which I used to take a Maxi cab and move all my belongings to my friendâ€™s place. That was possibly the lowest part of my life, no job, no money, and heavy bank debts. Slowly, the last 2 years, I forced myself to work a lot harder than others, to pay rental, bills and if others can do it, I have managed it as well, Iâ€™m sure you can get through it also. No situation is permanent and all problems can be resolved if you have the willpower.
              
              In every dark situation, there is always some light, but in times of darkness, it may be hard to see the light. For me, having gone through the worst part of life, I can honestly say, my character has grown to the point where nothing can bring me down anymore. Having gone through the tough times gives you the self confidence and knowledge that you have handled it before, and you can do it again.

              <p>My mom is dead, i have other siblings, but i do not keep in touch with them and vice versa, i'm 19 going 20, still studying, and the house is very important to me. It contains all my precious memories. My father goes overseas to gamble so he doesn't come back often. I want to know if there's any law that prevents my bankrupted father for selling the house. I don't mind if i have to send him to jail if i can get to keep the house for a while longer, because im pretty sure he isn't allowed to gamble when he's bankrupt. But i don't know who to tell to!</p>
