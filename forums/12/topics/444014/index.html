              How should I handle my friend sia?
              
              It's like, everytime we happen to talk about something, she will always, always, always have her own view. People having their own views about things is defo fine for me, I will listen to their side of the story, and input my own opinions, and some facts if possible. Den if they wanna discuss more, I'm fine with it, I will listen. I love calm and logical discussions.
              
              But den this friend of mine, she always insists she is right. Always. Sometimes her 'logic' also doesn't make sense.
              
              She's been my dear friend since many years ago, and she saved/helped me a lot. I don't want to erase the friendship. She means a lot to me. (I'm a girl btw, and straight.)
              
              But recently, something happened and I was just telling her about the incident. No invitation to any discussions whatsoever. Because I really hate having 'discussions' with her, I always end up the one 'backing out' because I don't want it to escalate into a full-blown argument. It has come to the point of her insulting me personally, a few times. Whenever that happened/happens, I just break off the argument by ignoring what she said. I don't even deign to tell her, "hey, don't insult me, the one you're angry at is not me, is it?" because she will surely say something scathing "but you still do/think this way what".
              
              And it ended up with her flaming me all the time about the incident, the authorities involved etc. I was trying to reason with her about y those stuff happened..and there she was flaming me when I am not one of the employees of that co. (it's about the SMRT breakdown last week. I was trapped in the train between orchard &amp; somerset, the one who should be uber pissed off is me!)
              
              I did tell her I wasn't defending the co and all that :C I don't wanna argue. All I was trying to do with put up my logical stand. She always wants to win. 
              
              I always back out to avoid any fallings-out. But I really don't like doing so; I do so because I treasure the friendship and yet, a lot of subjects are taboo because of her reactions to things.

              Hi FireIce,
              
              ya lor I try to accept. That's why I always 'back out'. It's not in my nature to back out like that. 
              
              I really really don't like it that she insults me personally because of these 'arguments'. Really. She ever said, "so-and-so people who do this are idiotic" right after I told her I did it. And my decision wasn't idiotic; it was just a different stand. It was a 'choose A or B' situation.

              <p>I also have friends who is similar to what you mentioned. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif"> Too self-centered to listen to other's people opinion.</p>
              <p>I have a good friend, we both open to discussion and no barrier talks. we frank with our opinions and thoughts. she respects my opinion, and i respect her opinion. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif"> cos both of us like to share and discussion our personal view on a topic.</p>
              <p>Same good friend, sometimes when she scold me, it's like rubbing salt on my wound, and it makes me upset for a period of time, and when I come to think about it, she's just frank and there's a lot of truth in the words she used to rub me. Although it hits me hard, and i appreciate her for pointing out. If you have a friend who scold you, she's a good friend. It's good for me.</p>
              <p>But for your case, she went overboard by flamming you. She isn't a good friend cos she's being too self-centered. I also got another friend who is exactly like what you mention. In every fight also want to win, very strong and tough stand and want to make people to stand on her views and opinion. What I do is to try to avoid that person and let things cool down before moving on.</p>
              <p>I understand how you feel. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"> I also avoid topic that would spark great friction. I have tons of topic I wanna discussion and talk with this friend, but knowing her would spark things and create lots of friction, I choose not to discuss with this friend. Anyway, it's okay. You just need to find somebody who is open to no barrier discussion and committ to intellecture discussions.</p>

              intellectual la, but just don't like when people talk as if they
              know everything. At least get the facts right before flaming

              <p>If going along with her makes her think that you're being hypocritical, why not go against her and speak your mind? If you're backing out every time because you're afraid that a single argument would destroy your many-years-long relationship...something is really wrong there, isn't it?</p>
              <p>I'm not telling you that should just act like her and that's it. What you can try is, instead of disagreeing with her ideas directly (e.g. I hate Elvin Ng), tell her about your ideas (e.g. I like so-and-so-whomever-you-like) along with reasons.</p>
              <p>There might be a chance she's feeling that you're being too passive in the friendship, because you were constantly avoiding discussions and agreeing with her. While you might be tired of giving in to her every single time, she, too, might be tired of being the one to start a conversation all the time. Worst still, she mostly gets apathetic responses from you (precisely because you were trying to avoid conflicts). Try being more proactive: bring up topics that might interest both you and her, whether it's about the latest movie to catch, a newly opened restaurant to try or an interesting hobby to pick up. Let her have a chance to disagree with your ideas, too!</p>

              <p>Thanks for the long and constructive reply. I actually also tried your method before, like instead of outrightly agreeing/disagreeing with her, I'd raise similar topics that we both have interest in. </p>
                  
              <p>=D see, I try :D</p>
                  
              <p>But she will somehow be able to swerve the topic back to its roots, lol. She gets too agitated over small stuff le! If I did show you the conversations, I'm sure you'd go WTF too. </p>
                  
              <p>But yea, meanwhile I'll just continue your way and see how it goes. I treasure her too much =D</p>

              <p>How should I handle my friend sia?</p>
              <p>It’s like, everytime we happen to talk about something, she will
              always, always, always have her own view. People having their own
              views about things is defo fine for me, I will listen to their side
              of the story, and input my own opinions, and some facts if
              possible. Den if they wanna discuss more, I’m fine with it, I will
              listen. I love calm and logical discussions.</p>
              <p>But den this friend of mine, she always insists she is right.
              Always. Sometimes her ‘logic’ also doesn’t make sense.</p>
              <p>She’s been my dear friend since many years ago, and she
              saved/helped me a lot. I don’t want to erase the friendship. She
              means a lot to me. (I’m a girl btw, and straight.)</p>
              <p>But recently, something happened and I was just telling her
              about the incident. No invitation to any discussions whatsoever.
              Because I really hate having ‘discussions’ with her, I always end
              up the one ‘backing out’ because I don’t want it to escalate into a
              full-blown argument. It has come to the point of her insulting me
              personally, a few times. Whenever that happened/happens, I just
              break off the argument by ignoring what she said. I don’t even
              deign to tell her, “hey, don’t insult me, the one you’re angry at
              is not me, is it?” because she will surely say something scathing
              “but you still do/think this way what”.</p>
              <p>And it ended up with her flaming me all the time about the
              incident, the authorities involved etc. I was trying to reason with
              her about y those stuff happened..and there she was flaming me when
              I am not one of the employees of that co. (it’s about the
              <span>SMRT</span> breakdown last week. I was trapped in
              the train between orchard &amp; somerset, the one who should be
              uber pissed off is me!)</p>
              <p>I did tell her I wasn’t defending the co and all that :C I don’t
              wanna argue. All I was trying to do with put up my logical stand.
              She always wants to win.</p>
              <p>I always back out to avoid any fallings-out. But I really don’t
              like doing so; I do so because I treasure the friendship and yet, a
              lot of subjects are taboo because of her reactions to things.</p>

                              <p>You know what your friend is like, don't you.</p>
              <p>You want her to be like you, discuss opinions, except differing
              views objectively? You know its never gonna happen. So why do you
              keep on getting into the same situation with her?</p>
              <p>People want to be important. You included. You want to make your
              statement. She too. But she has a greater emotional need for it
              than you. </p>
              <p>Therefore before you say anything to her, think first. How will
              she react? You should know her well enough to know that. Say things
              that would not be contentious to her. Sometimes don't say anything
              to her. Btw, this ability will come helpful in the corporate
              world.</p>
              <p>She is you dear friend, where you can, give her a good word
              about herself. She needs praise. Lots of it.</p>

              Ok, mancha. Will take note and be more careful...Sometimes she just auto create a topic ma. Like when my train broke down and I was stuck in it, I just messaged her, "oh man my train broke down, and I'm sibei tired why today?!" and den she just created a whole topic to argue with me about.
              <p>but yea lor, silly me why even bother telling her. .shall just keep my mouth shut....</p>

              <p>It's fine if your friend wants her own opinion, separate from yours. But ahe has a very strange world view: she wants to control your mind as well, like it matters to her if you have a different opinion.</p>
              <p>1. She doesn't understand it causes you hurt feelings.</p>
              <p>2. She doesn't understand it will cost <em>her</em> friends if she keeps acting so disrespectful. </p>
              <p>3. If she only treats you this way, it says something about how she sees you.</p>

              <p>LOL, its ok, perhaps you will get used to the idea of not
              getting involved, there is no right or wrong way, just choose the
              method that your heart feel right.</p>
              <p>Try Ambien, it is a good sleeping pill with little side effects.
              However like all drugs, should be taken for short term to avoid
              addiction.</p>
