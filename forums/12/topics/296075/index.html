            <div class='col-md body'>Knew this girl for almost 4 years already. Started as friends but as I got to know more about her, I found myself falling for me. 2 years ago got closer but when I asked her to be my gf she did not respond. Did not pressure her and even avoided her deliberately because I knew she was uncomfortable with me after that. Though I still liked her I only asked about her through her friends and sent her smses only on her birthday and new year, etc.<br><br>Through the last 18 months she was always on/off my mind when I was alone, like on the bus, before sleep. Told myself I would think about her until she got a bf that would take care of her well or I met another "special" one somehow.<strong> I had given up all hope of being with her.</strong><br><br>Recently I went though the greatest tragedy of my life but to my greatest surprise(honestly) she showed the most concern to me among my friends through smses, calling and giving small thoughtful presents. I told her that she was very important to me and her concern had helped me through the tragedy. She did not seem to be uncomfortable in reaction and has in fact asked me on a overseas trip(with mutual friends of course) or to meet her.<br><br>To be honest, I don't know whether if pure sympathy was the cause of her concern. If all she felt for me was sympathy then I rather she just show it more subduedly.<br><br>I am not complaining but if she just gave false hope, then I would have to feel <strong>terrible and hopeless again when the time comes.</strong><br><br>I have never told our mutual friends of my liking for her because I do not want her to be teased or to feel pressured when we are with mutual friends. Frankly I was comfortable with my feelings not being returned through the last 2 years even though I loved her in my heart, I told myself love had no conditions. Prepared to wait 10, 20, 30 years quietly until she gets a bf.<br><br>And no, I do not believe it is irrational or unhealthy of me to refuse to force myself to forget her. I still try to get to know other girls and expand my circle and when the times comes, I will be able to let go....<br><br>Edit: She said yes...</div>

Remember to show your support for her and do hang out (no obligations) whenever possible. You do not have to bent over the back..just support her. Should treat her like your good friend.<br><br>However, do expand your social circle so that you can meet more people.<br><br>Last thing, I think there are some good character building here so do keep up the good work.  Gals are more mature than men in certain aspect so be mature and fun and interesting...<br><br>All the best.</div>
