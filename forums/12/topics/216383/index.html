            <div class='col-md body'>IMHO - there's no such thing as wu hua in an overseas education. It's a luxury, not a necessity - and your parents are under no obligation to give you one either - most of those who are/have received one acknowledge this privilege<br><br>The best thing you can do to "repay", so as to speak, your parents is to go into the top universities (regardless of which country) and do your best. Don't think it's a stride through the park because it sure ain't. Singaporeans tend to over inflate their self worth. If you're entering a Go8 uni in Australia, you're going to be competing amongst some of the very best that the States have to offer - of course, there will be ALOT of crappy internationals, but those who aren't uni material tend to drop out, or get by so marginally that really, you don't notice.<br><br>Having said that, for Australia, the general consensus is that the best universities belong to the Go8  - UNSW, Monash, Melbourne, Sydney, Adelaide, UWA, UQ, ANU<br><br>There are some minor differences here and there - e.g. some people say UNSW engin is better blah blah blah - but seriously, factor in where you'd rather be - as in, Melbourne, Sydney, Perth, Adelaide, Queensland, Canberra<br><br>Melbourne is BORING to me - I reckon Sydney pwns, and Queensland seems to be a really happening place though I've yet to do any "real living" there aside from being a tourist.<br><br>EDIT: FYI: I received my pre-tertiary education in Australia - I actually really wanted to go to CA/UK/US but because of my liability (aka the DUTY  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  )  to the nation, I could not choose to pursue my tertiary education beyond AU - I really recommend going to CA if you can - I've spent time there and it is AWESOME!
