Normally none of these two country are perfect! You may hear a lot about them but they are not as good as you hear. Europe is the best place to live if and only if you are an european, otherwise kille yourself to reach to US (I never be there but I believe is better in terms of everything).<br>Some friends talkes about the weather in Australia, in Sydney the weather is cold or hot (it is windy). It is very hot under sun and cold when you are under a shade, without suncream life is hard or impossible (skin cancer). Vancouver is very green especially if you come from northern hemisphere, just like Switzerland, however is very rainy in most of the times. For sure if the weather was good why there is only 30 million people living there?<br>I believe in most of the science issues the two country are the same, Canada is a bit better than Australia as it is part of G8. I just like to come back to Canada beacause it is cheaper than Australia, (Van than Syd), more high class supermarkets, abit more modern people (dressing like 21st century people than casual shorts or teared up TShits!).<br>Life is Australia is realxed, but I like to work hard when I am young and rest when I need it.<br>I feel myself very far from everywhere in Australia.<br>Canada is near to Europe and US. It takes 2 hours by car to go from Van to two major cities of Victoria and Seattle when nowhere in Australia you go in 2 hours from Sydney (Canb is almost 3.5 hours drive from Syd).<br><br>People are friendly and a bit racist in Australia, people use Emails to do formal things than using Telephone as it is common in Canada.<br>Strangely a lot of people think in Canada that Australia is better than Canada, but I don't think it is.<br>Hope this works,<br>lilian<br>By the way, I love Australia"<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Found a breakdown for someone studying at ANU<br><br>quote: ngyh82<br>"Hi there, i hope my breakdown of cost will be of much help.<br><br>Alright first of all, lets talk about food. Eating out can be quite expensive, meal starts from about $6 and depending on what you eat it get more expensive. Asian food are on average at $9 here, but that doesnt mean you cant find cheaper ones around. Cooking yourself can be quite cheap at times depending on what you want. I spend about $80 a wk on food. Able spend lesser though, now im still trying to stop myself from buyin unecessary things.<br><br>Text Books are damn expensive over here, a book cost AUD$90 here but i can buy it in singapore for about $48. So I actually got my family to send me the textbooks i need and they are stil cheaper with the postage added on to them. But it all depends on the textbook cos some are alot more expensive and some are cheaper as compared to those in singapoer.<br><br>If you ask me about gas, electric and water, there are not much i can tell u cos I am stayin in the hall. Everything is included into the rent which is $136 per wk. Internet in the hall is a bit more expensive costing about 7 cents per mb. I think there is unlimited broadband internet offered by optus, but if there is it usually come with a cap in the download. For example, if you download over the cap your internet access speed will be limited to only 56kps. That is what happened to my fren last month.<br><br>Transport here is $1.30 flat for us, and there is an option for you to ask for a transfer ticket which allows u to transfer to another bus within 90mins.<br><br>I don't know what you still need to noe, but i hope all these helps. I nv been to movie here so can't really tell u the exact price, sorry. What ever things that you feel you want to noe, feel free to ask here! take care!"<a href="http://" rel="nofollow"></a><a href="http://" rel="nofollow"></a>[list=]<a href="http://" rel="nofollow"></a>[/list]</div>
