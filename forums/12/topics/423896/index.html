              <p>as the title says, i really need help for post-pw stress. PW results 
              are coming pretty soon, i dont really know when but should be around 
              April (which is what my teacher says) and i am very very VERY stressed 
              out now.</p>
              <p>Im the leader of my group and we did this project on 
              decreasing fast food consumption using a mob with fast food costumes and
               stuff like that. That aside, what is really stressing me out is my 
              group's view of me since the start. It seems to me that they dont really
               like since the start, and ever since the start of PW, i have been 
              feeling this...ok i cant explain this feeling but its really very 
              crappy, and until now i havent really told anyone about this. Everytime i
               ask them what have i been doing wrong, or how i can improve, they just 
              wont say anything, and still continue treating me like im some sort of 
              burden. Take for instance this one time, i tried to liven up the mood by
               telling a joke because we are closing on our presentation date and 
              everybody was really stressed, nobody laughed. But when another of my 
              group member said the same joke a few days later, they all laughed. So 
              yea, basically they dont like me.</p>
              <p>So i asked my other friends, and
               they said that one guy in particular dont really like me because 
              everytime my teacher shoots our group down, i will give that "emo" face 
              and he doesnt like it because as a leader, im the last person who should
               be doing that. Noted.</p>
              <p>One of the girls, and i dont know why, 
              especially hates me. From what her friends say, once she hates you, she 
              hates you forever. So im like " ok cant get on her bad side", but it was
               too late. AND until now, i still dont know what she doesnt like about 
              me(or whther or not she does not like me, because i hardly talk to her 
              now.). From what i see in the messages we sent(its easy because i have 
              an iphone), everything was okay until like 2 weeks before oral 
              presentation(i actually got the impression that she doesnt like me since
               the start), but yea, we were talking about the video, where she asked 
              me to upload it to youtube so she could download it, then when i went 
              back and uploaded it, she said that she has already edited the original 
              one to suit the computer and is not using mine, and then i replied, "ok,
               nevermind, we will see how first tomorrow, for now you just rest ba, 
              thanks for your hardwork! =D" and her reply was " please stop saying 
              "see how"", so i said sorry, and she replied "yeah wtv". So please 
              please PLEASE tell me if she doesnt like me, and i know my phrasing is 
              kind of bad she it isnt apprpriate. Also, all my other classmates (guys)
               are afraid of her too so yea...but she is okay with them. The last 
              group member is okay, pretty much because she is very smart (yes we only
               have four people). Noted</p>
              <p>So another thing is my classmates(i 
              dont call them friends for a reason), keeps on "pity-ing" my other group
               mate, and keep on talking behind my back about me, and although i know 
              that they are talking about me, i just dont know what they are talking 
              about! And whenever they talk about pw, one of my classmate would just 
              look at the other groupmate and shake his head =(.(i dont know what to 
              do about this)</p>
              <p>AND because of all these, i am kind of worried 
              about the results, because if me group members dont get A, it will 
              definitely be my fault :(</p>
              <p>If anything, i want them to get their 
              As, Their presentations are good, all the other written stuff are 
              definitely better than mine so if they dont get their A, it would be me 
              pulling them down =(</p>
              <p>SO please help me =(</p>

              <p>Hi.<br><br>Cant comment about your problems with your groupmates, I dont think I get enough info from your post. Please dont feel upset about if you had done a good job a not. carrying all the blame is v taxing to anyone. In my option, If they are not happy with your leadership or your pearsonalitity then they<strong> should have</strong> spoke up.<br><br>I believe the girl was expecting a firmer answer. As a leader of the group, they might have expected you to have a direction for the group. "see how" (edited typo) seem alittle wishy washy peharps. And not to mention, when things do not work out, more than often, teammates just turn and look at the leader for the group's next move.<br><br>Please dont be hard on yourself. Leading is never easy. U have made an effort to step up to take the role. That alone makes u far better than them who merely sits and grumple.</p>
              <p>You can talk to your friends or teachers if you are still troubled. Dont be overly worried. PW is over. By the way, if you dont mind me asking. Do you bond well with your class? or is this just with your pw group?</p>

              <p>Forget it, the PW is already over. Focus on your A-lvls instead.</p>
              <p>Just because you are the leader doesn't mean everything is your fault.</p>
              <p>For PW, your own presentation will unlikely affect them much. For the record, there can be A1 and C5 individuals in the same group. Not that it is likely for a group who have put in ample effort to have any individuals get anything below a B4.</p>
              <p>If they don't like you, just bear with them for another year or so, and each of you will go your own path afterwards. Your results will always be your priority, so don't let them affect it. </p>

              <p>Dear uber_troubled,</p>
              <p>After reading your post it seems to me that your friends are unwilling to patch up any misunderstandings, which can be <span style="text-decoration: underline;">easily achieved by just speaking truthfully in your presence.</span></p>
              <p>Show them that you sincerely wish to change for the better, ask them what you did wrong after each practice session, thank them for pointing mistakes out, most importantly <span style="text-decoration: underline;">apologise to them</span> for every mistake you do (might be hard to accomplish but that will go a long way to reduce the hate).</p>
              <p>Hence i feel it is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">entirely not your fault</span> for anything. How do they expect you to change suddenly when they refuse to let you know what they dislike without hiding anything?</p>
              <p>As for those badmouthing people who are not even in your project group, invite them to talk too, respect their views about you. If they only choose to say them behind your back they likely have some <span style="text-decoration: underline;">character problems</span> since their goals are to add salt to the wound.</p>
              <p>Your goal is to show your friends you are willing to put in extra efforts to change for them (of course only reasonable demands should be considered), or what forbiddensinner said, just bear with them for another year and go separate paths.</p>
              <p>Good Luck!</p>

              <p>1. You must understand and note that there is a big differences between classmates and friends hor, so dun call everyone friends, if classmates just call classmates, classmates are not friends, this you have to be very clear. Later in working life, you also must know the different btw friends and colleagues hor, never assume that colleagues or classmates and friends are the same. When you are clear about this, you will be in a better position to deal with life</p>
