            <div class='col-md body'>I would suggest going to your friendly neighbourhood GP regarding this.<br><br>If he feels that you need some more specialised help, he may refer you to a psychiatrist to determine whether it's really social anxiety disorder or something less serious.<br><br>In the meantime, stick with breathing techniques. Go through your anxieties and ask yourself whether you really have a cause to fret over them. Try talking about your worries with someone you trust, or failing which, write them down and keep the list somewhere safe.<br><br>Just remember - don't sweat the small stuff. And it's all small stuff.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Before doing anything big, take slow deep breaths, and tell yourself that you can do it. Hope this helps. If it doesn't, I think you might need to go for some therapy or counselling.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think you are just anxious, try not to focus on the negative. The lack of confidence is the surest way of creating anxiety. I used to suffer from the same problem especially with exams, I one day realised the problem exists only because I am not well prepared.<br><br>So if you want to pass an exam aim to score 70% that way u have a 20% buffer for failure. If you want 90% study to achieve 100%. But take it one step at a time.<br><br>A good way to simulate this is in competitive sports, very often in competitve sports you find yourself under pressure, if you have practiced your moves often enough you will find that your reaction under pressure both motor and mental is instinctive, the unconscious mind takes over.<br><br>The same thing is true in life and in exams, if you are good enough with what you do, everything seems natural. The problem is when you are not quite there.<br><br>So my friend, the root to anxiety is a lack of self-believe. Unfortunately my friend the only way to convince yourself you are good is to work your f_cking nuts off.<br><br>Sorry, no easy solution, go to GP no use, he can't make you smarter and better at what you do, hard work and diligence will though.</div>

In the first place, do u have a negative image of urself? If u have, then u might want to list out a list of ur postive strength and focus on there. i could recommend u to see a counseller or a psychologist to help u..<br><br>Regarding the Pressurizing environment issue, perhaps u was too tensed cos u r too self-focused. Elite athlete don't focus too much into themselves but rather on the motion of the actiivty and playing with instinct. It is a state of mind and the instinct playing come with practise and conditioning. Did u ever try prep-talk to boast ur morale which in turn will improve ur performance?<br><br>Try google: excessive self-focused and self reflection.. there are quite a few good article on it...<br><br>anyway u r not werid! There are many people like u.. very normal and some manage to breakthrough it... if they can, i don't see why u cant  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's not a very big problem, almost everyone get nervous under certain situation.<br><br>Like the first time do a presentation infront of the whole class.<br>fist time to sing a song in KTV with some new frens.<br>before exam/test of any kind.<br>Meeting the girl you like for the first time.<br><br>You mentioned that you are confident that you can do it, you tell yourself you can do it before the IPPT test. Infact telling yourself "you can do it" too much is not a good thing, this will only increase the pressure on yourself, the "you can do it" will become "YOU MUST DO IT!". When it's "you must do it!", you are under pressure already. So next time before you take a test, prepare well like you used to be, but do not think that you must pass it, keep in mind that it's also ok if u dont do well like you expected, u will be less stressed.<br><br>IMHO i guess you are just the type of ppl that expect everything to be very ideal, to be exactly like what you expected. But in real life, we cant expect everything to turn out to be like how we wanted. You study hard, put in real effort, so you are confident that you can get at least 80/100 for an exam paper, that's makes you very sad when you get 75. But for those ppl who put in same effort, but he didnt expect a 80/100score, he's happy with 75 cos it's still A1.<br><br>You feel nervous when you are outside, think that ppl are watching you, that's also the same as wat i said as above. You want to present yourself well in public, you want to keep the best image of yourself in everyone's mind, to your frens, even to strangers. I can tell you, not everyone is watching you, you fall down on the staircase at orchard MRT(or other crowded place) some ppl may laugh at you, but they wont remember this incident for life. You dont have to worry about ppl watching you.<br><br></div>
