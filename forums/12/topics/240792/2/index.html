Perhaps it may shed some light to your concept.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">I am a guy. It's a fact that living in Singapore is a very tough one if there isn't enough money to go by.  What happens if in the choice of a partner, there appears to be many however the dilemmna is who to choose? Someone you love or someone whom you can foresee to have a future with especially in the area of health?<br><br>I am handdicapped &amp; hesitating to go after someone I like the reason being she's healthy, physically complete but most important has a heart of gold. I know many of you will say to go after my love but what happens 10 or 20 years down the road when the realities of life steps in. It's tough for a guy who has to rely on wheelchair to support a family all by himself here in Singapore. My wife will have to slog instead. I am talking about the average family here.<br><br>What would you do if you are just an average disabled guy this choice presents itself to you. Should I wait go for her should I shy away due to my disability?</span><br><br>When it's love you're talking. Regardless whether it's in good times or not, the girl sticks with you. You're sure that you're more wealthier than her. Are you sure tomorrow you still have your entire body intact? By then no amount of money can buy you the loss of limbs or health. By then you could easily be her liability if you are not strong enough in the mind. I am not discriminating against handicapped or sick people as there're many of them with greatness in the mind and heart where even many healthy people cannot match. It is to help you understand the priorities in a relationship. <span style="color: red;"><strong>In a relationship, money may be impt to help sustain the bread. But at times of adversity, it is the true love between the couple which holds the relationship together even when there is no bread.</strong></span></div>
