            <div class='col-md body'>First and foremost Devil, not trying to start a flamewar in here, nor trying to create trouble here.<br>This is just a simple exchange of views though the TS has made a decision.<br>Call it a case study or whatever you want to call it.<br><br>Back to Orange.<br><br>If you actually go back to TS's posts, all four of it, the first 3 post are all about why having more money is essential to love (he pegs it to education) and basically trying to substantiate that to have a happy marriage, you need education and money. He can't even differentiate between love and lust <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> The replies to him within these 3 posts are all telling him that money does not equate happiness. It because a case of majority wins so after all the bs he tells us, he comes back and says he wants to woo the girl coz "in life, choices have to be made but in the name of love, I decided to just do it. It's better to have loved and be loved than never. No one knows the future and if everything needs to be perfect, it's boring."<br><br>If you don't call that flippancy what do you call that? Indecision? (duh)<br>I mean to hell with it. If you truely love a person you won't be putting her under a microscope about her education level and decide if you should woo her. You wouldn't be going on telling people why you are not choosing her because of money and her education level, without putting into perspective that you can upgrade yourself or even put her family situation into perspective. And after a few dozen posts by strangers he hardly knows, he just says that he will go for it in the name of love when it really isn't on his mind in the first place <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> It might just be a crush. If you had strong feelings for someone, you wouldn't hold back, especially if you are just average and not down in the dumps. Heck. Majority of us are average.<br><br>So here he is, armed with some advise from us faceless strangers, he decides to go for her with this mindset at the back of his mind that she is lowly educated (therefore not able to contribute much financially). Do you honestly think that he will be in through thick and thin and not be in the relationship coz the majority thinks so? If you think that is responsible, I have nothing to say.<br><br>Oh please, he was putting so much emphasis on the S11. He might not want to mooch her, but it sure don't speak volumes that he will hang around when there is trouble. It's like you speculating that he is really in it for love. Maybe I'm just a cynical bitch sitting behind the screen like you are an idealist.<br><br>For someone talking about waiting for someone better, it sounds too opportunistic. You know, there are guys who wine and dine intelligent, highly educated women just for the thrill of getting them into bed. They want the woman to be best in everything. It's a thrill they get out of. Not every guy wants a wham bam thank you m'dam coz it is too easy without the thrill. I have to say your quote may hold truth for some part of the male population.<br><br>By your quote itself, you have already formed some form of judgement and ideal about this guy. Just put it this way. You have your own opinions about him, as I do mine and it is nothing good (including his ability to rationalize properly).<br><br></div>

I know when you lay out the facts of the hash life in SG to support a family and to earn the bread and butter is hard, therefore it leads to your hesitation. I would agree, partially. As you said, education seems like a milestone for you in order to get into love. Here's my point, i didn't have much education either. Worst, i was a ex-offender <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> ... but thing is, thru years of struggle i had my chance and for someone i loved no matter what i would strive hard to achieve success not only for myself, her's too. You know the chinese saying whereby happiness is achieved thru the simplicity of life. Don't let the small problem overcome your sight of being happy with her, only if you feel the same way to her. The best guide? follow your heart mate. I believed all guys will do no matter what to support the family he loves, even begging if need be <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
