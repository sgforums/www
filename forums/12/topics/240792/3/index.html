Young Ladies like to be pampered like a Queen.<br><br>But as they are still in their Prime, then they will also be in the game mood, so depending on the maturity level of each lady that you want to wool, it's up to your commitment. As young ladies often will have this thinking - Im still young, i can easily find another bf fast, since I have the qualities (applies to ladies up til 23)<br><br>For ladies above 23, i doubt you're that old enough to wool them, so i'll just stop at young ladies, i believe all these should be enough for you for now</div>

What happens if in the choice of a partner, there appears to be many however the dilemmna is who to choose? Someone you love or someone whom you can foresee to have a future with espcially in the area of finances.<br><br>I am hesitating to go after someone I like the reason being she's not well-educated. I know many of you will say to go after love but what happens 10 or 20 years down the road when the realities of life steps in. It's  tough even for a guy to support a family all by himself here in Singapore. I am talking about the average family here.<br><br>What would you do if you are just an average guy and you this choice presents itself to you. Should I wait for a better one or should I go for it?<br><br></div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> I would say that if the difference in education level do not drastically affect:<br><br>I) Level of frequency (in term of communication).<br><br>II) Lifestyle (in terms of hobbies/interest/etc).<br><br>It shouldn't be a problem at all.<br><br>From your hestitation, I doubt you even have much feelings for her to even begin any relationship in the first place. So I guess you shouldn't ruin people with your kind of mindset... if indeed, in the long run, she's a loving mate but doesn't bring you much cash literally. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>
