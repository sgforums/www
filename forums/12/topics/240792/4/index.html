Of course you dont have to be rich to do all the affairs and stuff, but if you are rich you have better options in life and woman too.<br><br>There is no denying being rich does make life easier married or not.

Love's got nothing to do with it.<br><br>With a mindset like that, the solution is very simple: go find a millionaire's daughter and marry her.<br><br>I also totally disagree with your statment that "No money will lead to a lot of problems when married even though the beginning is beautiful. " <span style="color: red;">The truth of the matter is: problems exist, money or no money, just different sets of problems.</span><br><br>You seem to think that having money is the only way to solve marital problems.... didn't you read about the rich divorcing, or having extramarital affairs etc.<br><br>You know what?

In fact, rich people (especially those who did not make their own money, or in showbiz) are less likely to stick together than poorer people.  Money, or the lack of it, can be a blessing or a curse... it highly depends on the individual.</div>

Your hypothetical argument doesn't hold IMO. While your claims are not entirely unimaginable or impossible, the probability of things turning out that way is just more remote. Afterall, there're tonnes of ways to become a millionaire, but I guess it's equally fair to say more millionaires succeeded through other means than those who did through winning the lottery?<br><br>Assuming we accept the threadstarter views his spouse being well-educated as being important(I mean he's entitled to his views obviously, however unreasonable it might seem to the rest of us) in terms of being able to provide for their common future, I can hardly fault him for wanting a better educated girl. Just think about it : who would be able to provide greater financial stability in a long term relationship (at least, he's frank enough on his part to admit he doesn't deem it feasible to support a family on his own in the long term and doesn't start a relationship irresponsibly without thinking about the practical issues which are bound to afflict them later on) - a girl with low education and a potential low-income job or a well-educated one with a better income? At the end of the day, oftentimes life(and decisions made accordingly) is a matter of probability, isn't it?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>PS : How little education would constitute "low" to threadstarter is another matter.</div>
