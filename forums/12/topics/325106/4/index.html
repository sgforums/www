              <p>Firstly, how come the threadstarter seems to know so much? Is it you or your friend? Because it's seems like something so private, you even know about it. It seems that your friend is really close with you. No offence here.</p>
              <p>Anyway, the situation you mention is really one of a kind. Not something i even chanced upon before. Never knew a girl can be that 'desperate' to this extent but whatever the case, she certainly has gone overbroad. The only thing she lacked is understand. If only she understands that your friend's intention and does what she should, then seriously, nothing of those sort would have happen.</p>
              <p>Whereas on the other hand, your friend should have taken a step to find out all these problems she's having. To me, i find it quite ridiculous of a guy to just break off with a person whom he loves or once loved because of a mistakes the girl commit and forget about the thought that he had once or on many occasions did 'something' with her. No matter what, it's not easy for the girl that's for sure... </p>

              <p>I'm a girl and yet I think you are really naive to make the generalization that "no girls want to have sex before marriage".</p>
              <p>There are girls out there who offer herself to the guys just to satisfy the sexual urges in her (yes, girls have them too, we are humans as well). If both parties are consenting and adults, then that's their own business. It is nobody's fault, be it the girl or the guy.</p>
              <p>And yes I agree this issue is for discussion in another thread. This thread is about the girlfriend being possesive and not about how she feels regarding sex.</p>

              <p>You will need to follow the thread first and understand why the topic was extended into this discussion first before telling me that my posts are invalid to this topic.</p>
              <p>I do not agree with the TS that his friend is the victim in his current situation. And I believed that if TS's friend refused to agree to have sex before marriage, he wouldn't have gotten himself into his current situation.</p>
              <p>Do remember that TS is sharing the story about his friend, and I believed the story is being told to the advantage of TS's friend. So it is always wise to use your own discretion and advise.</p>
              <p>If you only choose to listen to the one-sided story posted by TS, then you are truly naive to hold onto that story as the truth to judge the entire situation.</p>
              <p>People with discretion will seek and question the truth behind every story, and people without it are just naive and easily swayed into giving blind advices.</p>
              <p>You are a girl and you telling me that TS's friend girlfriend is really behaving in this manner for no reason?</p>
              <p>Do you really think that if TS's friend were really innocent and didn't do anything wrong that led to his current situation, would TS even need to seek further advice from here?</p>
              <p>Guilty...and only people with guilty conscience would need to seek further advice to get themselves out of their dilemma. People with clear conscience won't even need to think thrice about taking appropriate actions to resolve this matter as soon as possible.</p>
              <p>If I'm moderator, I will locked this dishonest thread from the beginning. The intentions from posting this topic was already wrong from the beginning, if you can realised you have been misled to believe the details as the truth.</p>
              <p>And what makes you think you can come in and correct me when you did not even tried to analyse the situation genuinely and offers half-hearted advice to TS?</p>
              <p>So do you think you did your best in your post to help TS....or yourself?</p>

              <p>lucky you are not a mod</p>
              <p>Although I agree that the guy is at fault too. I agree that if the guy do not do such things before marriage, things would not grow to such an extent.</p>
              <p>But I do think thats there is a reason to allow this thread to continue. A mod has the power to lock a thread and it should be used well. Closing a thread because you don't like it is not being fair.</p>

              <p>Although I agree that the guy is at fault too. I agree that if the guy do not do such things before marriage, things would not grow to such an extent.</p>
              <p>But I do think thats there is a reason to allow this thread to continue. A mod has the power to lock a thread and it should be used well. Closing a thread because you don't like it is not being fair.</p>

              <p>How would you rate the guy in terms of being a boyfriend? Would you have done better than him? What would you have done in his place?</p>
              <p>I didn't read anyone mentioning about the faults the guy did, and Ohh...maybe it's because I have been reading too many blind advices in the thread?</p>
              <p>Of course there is absolutely a reason for this thread to continue now, cos blind people are slowing getting cured. And TS's friend is definitely not getting an easy way out of this as I expected.</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p> </p>
              <p>You will need to follow the thread first and understand why the
                  topic was extended into this discussion first before telling me
                  that my posts are invalid to this topic.</p>
              <p>I do not agree with the TS that his friend is the victim in his
                  current situation. And I believed that if TS's friend refused to
                  agree to have sex before marriage, he wouldn't have gotten himself
                  into his current situation.</p>
              <p>Do remember that TS is sharing the story about his
                  friend, and I believed the story is being told to the
                  advantage of TS's friend. So it is always wise to use your own
                  discretion and advise.</p>
              <p>If you only choose to listen to the one-sided story posted by
                  TS, then you are truly naive to hold onto that story as the truth
                  to judge the entire situation.</p>
              <p>People with discretion will seek and question the truth behind
                  every story, and people without it are just naive and easily swayed
                  into giving blind advices.</p>
              <p>You are a girl and you telling me that TS's friend girlfriend is
                  really behaving in this manner for no reason?</p>
              <p>Do you really think that if TS's friend were really innocent and
                  didn't do anything wrong that led to his current situation, would
                  TS even need to seek further advice from here?</p>
              <p>Guilty...and only people with guilty conscience would need to
                  seek further advice to get themselves out of their dilemma. People
                  with clear conscience won't even need to think thrice about taking
                  appropriate actions to resolve this matter as soon as possible.</p>
              <p>If I'm moderator, I will locked this dishonest thread from the
                  beginning. The intentions from posting this topic was already wrong
                  from the beginning, if you can realised you have been misled to
                  believe the details as the truth.</p>
              <p>And what makes you think you can come in and correct me when you
                  did not even tried to analyse the situation genuinely and offers
                  half-hearted advice to TS?</p>
              <p>So do you think you did your best in your post to help TS....or
                  yourself?</p>
