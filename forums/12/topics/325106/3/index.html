              <p><br>so how many guys will go and rape their gf if their gf reject dem for sex?</p>

              <p>funny leh, say guys like super weak and moronic.</p>
              <p>some girls USE sex as a WEAPON to squeeze money from guys (if u dun give me money, i will report u to police for rape and tell my mother dat u had sex with me)</p>
              <p>believe me or not, nowadays when a girl and guy want to have sex, girls are not the "disadvantage" party. true, physically girls are disadvantaged (pregnant), but depends on the situation, guys may be disadvantaged too (weapon for money, and the poor guy love the girl too much and give her wadever she wan)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>this is not the olden society, you are not living in the 19th century or wad.</p>

              <p>No, I dun tin the gf will go counselling. She may be emotionally

              <p><br>Simple... From yr thread, if your friend breaks with her, there will be no doubt that he will be a jerk in her eyes or her friend's eyes...</p>
              <p>Different people have different view points...</p>
              <p>And if u want me to elaborate, y do I think he will be a jerk in her eyes??? Coz, her gf thinks that she is very committed and loving to her bf and tat her bf should recipocate his love back... She also thinks that her bf is one and only... if yr friends breaks with her gf, it will be obvious that yr friend will be a jerk in her eyes...</p>
              <p>Hence, if he is a JERK , be a JERK...</p>
              <p>It lessens her pain in the break up...</p>

              <p>so what is the best way? a break up's a break up, it hurts, regardless how you do it.</p>
              <p>sure, if both parties are understanding, they can talk it out, and break up and remain good friends.</p>
              <p>but from the way she acted, i doubt she is capable to participate in a reasonable discussion.</p>

              <p>i like this explanation.   <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png">  If i were that guy, i would want to run too.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think a public break-up is never good.... especially with friends around. She'd probably be 'shamed' in front of ple.</p>
              <p>And during the breakup, he must address what causes the breakup - not that he doesn't love her or he found a new girl.... but her possessiveness and all. At least let her know what went wrong, and not that she lost herself to another girl. (let her know her worth.. but then it's her possessiveness that kills everything)</p>
              <p>And probably she might say she'd change or something, the guy must prepare what to say.... And at the state of her condition, there must be someone with her after the breakup. (Not your friend definitely.... i mean the girl's close friends or somethin)</p>
              <p>As for the sex part, she is trying to tie the guy up with sex/babies/family....</p>

              <p>You really want to help your friend peacefully out of this situation, it is possible but I don't think your friend or you deserves to know the solution.</p>
              <p>Reasons is because people such as THIS are simply not a genuine cases for agony. Your friend created his own agony by choosing to have sex with his girlfriend. And by fishing out the solution will only give people like him, a perfect excuse to destroy more girls and get away from his own fucked-up mess.</p>
              <p>You won't even need to seek any advise if your friend did not FUCK the girl. So make sure you tell him to use his head above his neck and not the other head down under his pants.</p>
              <p>This topic is on it's own now, go figure out the worst possible ways to end this. And you know that nobody here is good enough to provide you with a way out anyway. </p>
              <p>There will be no place in the world for immoral people like your friend. And nobody will survive in this world without morals. </p>

              <p>There are girls out there who offer herself to the guys just to satisfy the sexual urges in her (yes, girls have them too, we are humans as well). If both parties are consenting and adults, then that's their own business. It is nobody's fault, be it the girl or the guy.</p>
              <p>And yes I agree this issue is for discussion in another thread. This thread is about the girlfriend being possesive and not about how she feels regarding sex.</p>
