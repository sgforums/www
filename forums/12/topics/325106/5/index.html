              <p>Before you accused me of forcing my opinions on others. Go trace the thread from the beginning and tell me did I first tried to quote people or people quoted me first just because they don't agree with the opinions that I've shared? You do understand what you meant by "force it down other's throat" right? 
                  
                  If nobody quoted me for the sake of forcing their opinions on me, I wouldn't have bothered replying them.
                  
                  And don't accuse me for things that you're not sure about me, because you do not know me.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Look who's talking about people. You don't force your opinions on others? As soon as I disagree with you, you start to ask many questions. Beginning to imply that other's advise are actually dangerous. I do not know you. But do you know me?</p>

              <p>this lady here seriously cannot understand that something as sensitive as sex needs both parties to willingly agree before it can ever happen, otherwise that would be considered rape which is illegal.</p>
              <p>It is exactly like this situation now, miss parn has her own strong opinion and stand on this issue, and nobody can ever force their opinions down on her UNLESS she accepts their opinions. Same, nobody can ever force sex on a girl unless she agrees to it. Is this such a hard fact to understand?</p>
              <p>If your will to resist is not strong enough and can be easily wavered, dun go and blame the guy, he did not force open your legs. Take responsibility for your own actions.</p>

              <p>waste of time talking to someone who's so stubborn he's right. need something more then just words in this internet thread. but you know, i can't believe you have lived in this world and get your this kind of archiac belief, i accept i can't argue with you on your educated level, (ya im a retard compared to you) but you see what most of the posts have been, they disagree with you. and from experience, i know girls aren't such perfectly pure people you make them out to be. i dont believe that after all these hard facts, you still insist we're all wrong, and your view is correct.</p>
              <p>parn i love you.. too bad you're a guy :(</p>

              <p>Your friend's girlfriend is mentally unsound.   She needs to seek help.   Being mentally unsound and insecure she is affecting the relationship.  From the post, can tell she does not mind sex before marriage.    Now she is using sex to control your friend, pathetic.  </p>
              <p>There are some females who insist all the way that they only want sex after marriage, however there are some who do not mind sex before marriage.   Sex before marriage is  not an issue here because your friend's gf willingly have sex with your friend.      Nobody can force anyone to accept his or her views.  Trolling is not encouraged here.  </p>

              <p>I am pretty new here; apologies if I did say anything wrong; the things I said are based on personal experiences and those of friends.</p>
              <p>In most relationships, there sometimes will come a point where either one or both will get 'tired' of each other and starts finding 'faults' with each other. These faults may jus be the ones they have gladly accepted when they first got together.</p>
              <p>Actually, what's the area/s which attracted ur friend to the gal in the first place? Always remember the first attraction to maintain the relationship till forever. This attraction will seldom change over time.</p>
              <p>There's no right or wrong in any relationship; but by giving a reason of 'can't take it', 'intolerable', 'tiredness' etc doesn't give any one the right to initiate a break off.</p>
              <p>The utmost important point is, is it really because of 'tiredness', 'can't stand the possessiveness' or is it simply because his 'love' for her has just died off?</p>
              <p>If the 'love' has just died off, it's best to leave; have a good talk over a coffee session, inform her best friends beforehand of where d two of them will be. Do inform the friends to have a fully planned schedule; shopping, movies, KTV, anything. Once the guy has left, jus put up a 'show' of coincidence of the friends meeting the gal and asking (plus dragging) her to join in the activities. Let them take over; they will definitely know how to handle her; provided they know her well. It may sound like jus a screenshoot out of a drama, but sometimes, traditional ways do help.</p>
              <p>If he still loves her, find ways to help her. It was mentioned that she had a messy childhood; work from there. Think of when the gal first started being possessive; think of what actually triggered that to occur. Sometimes, the things we do, the words we say, we may feel it's insignificant or may not hurt anyone; but our loved one may not view it the way we do.</p>
              <p>Every action does have its own cause.</p>
              <p>Once the 'riddle' has been solved, it will be easier to actually help the gal.   </p>
              <p>But, bear one point in mind, it may be a long, tedious path to 'recovery' for the gal; she will need support and love from her loved one, family and friends. Once the guy has decided to go this path, don't give up, rather he can't give up, he'll have to walk till the end. Giving up may make the gal worse off than before.</p>
              <p>As for sex, nowadays, in the current society, there are gals who still treasure their first time and will be insistent on only 'giving' after marriage; there are some who will 'give' for fear that their partners will leave them if they refuse; there are some who use it as a means to get finances; and some who plainly has a need to satisfy.</p>
              <p>As for guys, there are some who gladly offer finances to gfs/partners, be it out of 'sex' or out of love; there are some who treat 'sex' as a 'holy' thing to be done only with the one they loved; there are some who demands 'sex' from their gfs because other alternatives may not be that 'clean' and there are some who will really leave or kick up a big fuss if they are refused. </p>
              <p>It's a question meant for 'debating' and there's no right or wrong answer on this 'sex' view; we choose what we want to believe in.</p>
