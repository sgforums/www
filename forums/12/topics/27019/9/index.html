They r naked! Or not wearing clothesÂ”<br><br>For this, they donÂ’t laugh, but get baffled by my vague replyÂ…why?<br><br>Bcos the picture showed children wearing swimming trunks and why is this fella(me) said they donÂ’t wear anything?<br><br>Then they pressed on and asked Â“ why did u  just say the children r naked?Â”<br><br>I replied Â“ bcos they got the same color!Â”<br><br>Then the invigilator got more stumped by my answer, cos they donÂ’t understand my saying, my perspective toward the picutre<br><br>I explainÂ…Â…Â…..bcos at my time, the picture used for oral exam was colorless, no color, only black and white, black outlined the beach, children, white paper formed the skin of the children inside the picture,<br><br>So except the hair of the children, outlines, itÂ’s totally whiteincluding the swimming trunks.<br><br>Since when ur nakedÂ…Â…..ur skin color or THE SAME COLOR except black hairÂ…Â…Â…<br><br>U donÂ’t have the colors of ur clothes on, ur totally skin color<br><br>Since the picture is white thruout, so the children are naked!<br><br>I donÂ’t really like teachers u seeÂ…Â… why?<br><br>Cos I always got picked on by them especially primary school<br><br>Got Mocked at bcos of  my weak  english<br><br>Since they got a lighter job than secondary school teachers<br>They got more time to pick on  students especially fresh graduates who got more self-pride than wits<br><br>Swollen-headed , conceitnessÂ…Â…totally arrogant<br><br>Poly got another rotten assÂ…..lok.<br><br>Proud of his RF degree and lieutenant ranking in the army<br><br>Called himself a lecturer somemoreÂ…Â….lechers<br><br>I got bad impression on teachersÂ…Â….respectable career?
