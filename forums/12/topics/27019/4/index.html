Hey why, they cant traced evrybody loggin on to the net, last time when I was palying  mutliplayer online game, I met a few US americans, they told me some of the ISP is not traced by the US intelligence system. American Online aol is surely traced by the intelligence of theUS government but Exodus is not! Dunno true or false leh? Which means the subscribers of aol jsure to get trace by the government if the order of tracing is invoked of course.<br><br>But I was told some isp or server storage provider services is independent. Not  traced by the government inUSÂ… hey imÂ’ interest in the US lehÂ… maybe I migrate there.<br><br>Hey since Us intelligence better, why they canÂ’t traced oasama bin laden strike plan on the World trade?<br>Singapore napped trhe 13 muslims potential terrorist in time, so in another words, singapoer intelligent better what?

            <div class='col-md body'>Consider my life experience to sound libelous get lost ur not welcome to readÂ….<br>Do not fking get in my nerve with ur ugly replies, or I show u what is hard lifeÂ…Â…<br><br>I donÂ’t understand at all why those rich kids strayedÂ…<br>I mean they r born with riches embracing them, it is only they lacked their parentÂ’s love.<br>Why?<br>Most of situation is becos the parents gotta work, n no time left to their son or daughter, to love them, show them concern, show them tender loving care just like a pet dog, chihuahua.  U cared for them, u help them shit n clean them up, kiss them on the ear, human kids too need the love, the attention..<br>Back to the rich kidsÂ…<br>Their parents not poor, both in knowledge n finance, but they just donÂ’t have much time to spare their children. Remember a kid in my primary 2 cut my fingerÂ’s valley, the flesh between the fingers n never even felt sorry at all, donÂ’t even apologise to me. At that moment, I fking pain like hellÂ….excruciating pain overloaded my nerve, blood flowing like ur urineÂ….  U know what, he come to school, heÂ’s just 8 years old riding in a mercedes benz, not dumb at all, always boast to me about how his motherÂ’s benz can exceed 180km/h on the freeway.. fk him. his name is yue bing DonÂ’t even have the courtesy to fking apologise, fking rich, fking spoilt childÂ…god shall damned himÂ…Â…I shall watchÂ…<br><br>DidnÂ’t I mentioned I got dragged or pushed down the stair s a countless times by the rich kid? I mean, I donÂ’t hate rich kid but some of them are truly assholesÂ… spoilt brat ------pestering cow dungÂ…<br><br>Secondary school , much worse things evolved, with me at the center again..fk my life..<br>The rich kids, some name I could still rememberÂ….a girls sim lay wah, lisa,  duan ting, bernard teo, wei zheng, say beng, desmond real names of course,(I fking donÂ’t care about their reputation), volley player some more, u know what? This is real ok! Pampered kids get lost now! I know they r seeking peer-acceptances, I donÂ’t even have a close friend to turn toÂ…Â….whatta fking life is that?<br>They picked on me to seek peers acceptances, while I donÂ’t even have a close friend to turn toÂ…. What an irony of lifeÂ…<br><br>Ur daddy worked like hell, u squandered their hard-earned money like waste waterÂ…Â….god  shall see you, ur end is nearÂ…Â…Â…<br><br>They cornered me and stripped off my pants, can u feel the humiliation or not? In front of girls some moreÂ…Â…Â…. The females bystanders fking laugh like hell bitchesÂ…Â…. Dman themÂ….<br>The teachers just said IÂ’m a liarÂ…fk those teachers alsoÂ… why bcos IÂ’m always the coward n the shortest in class.. fk. The teacher fking discriminate me..i cannot speak or articulate well  Â… shit.. cannot express myself fully n clearlyÂ…<br><br>U know what the rich kids owned? Nike white school shoes worth 30-40 dollars or even more, I got 12dollars panda shoes to compete..<br>They changed their school bag every month, jean paul gaultier(JPG bag very famous at that time, cost like 200- 300 dollars for a small compartment. I got a $35 body pac from bedok, tattered already, no much desire in appearancesÂ…. Ppl fking laugh at meÂ…. Like hellÂ… u experienced that before? Fking talk about hard lifeÂ….. fking talk about humiliation, u fking open up ur eyes..<br><br>Moreover, they rode in branded cars, branded motorcycles, u know at the age of 16 years old could afford a scambler, the tall motorbike u see youngster riding nowadays, fking jamming it to full throttle n roar away like a ghost is hot on their trail..i hope they crashed their fking skull by the kerbÂ…<br><br>they donÂ’t drive car lah, too young but if singapore law allows, they will drive a car to school just like the US high school rich kid. I donÂ’t even have an expensive bicycle to compete, I got both of my legs which is always got kicked by them( the rich kids lah!).. damn, they still picked on me for no reason, why is that they r always taller n bigger sizeÂ….they got more nutrition, more vitamins supplements or good rich food at their disposal. Look at the adolescents on the streets today, uÂ’ll knowÂ…..(fking big piece of walking lard right?)<br>I got my tau po n vegetables, $5 a 5kg pack white rice to compete. Not much nutrition, I always donÂ’t have the appetite to eat most of the time  maybe is bcos my emotion  is always wrecked by their intimidation. Fk.<br><br>Secondary most of the boys will at 1.65metres and up, 5foot,5 inches, IÂ’m only at 1.48metresÂ… 4,foot  11 inches I thinkÂ…. even the teachers laugh a me for being short.. oooohhhhahhahahahaÂ…Â…Â… IÂ’m underweight alsoÂ… no girls wanna talk to me.. why? IÂ’m quiet like hell, boring lookin, dull face, not humorous enough, shorter than themÂ… even the girls push  me, IÂ’ll fallÂ…<br>Most of the girls are rich family also, or some comes from ok family not like mineÂ…..<br><br>My family is unbeatable at rotten! Aaaaaaaaaahahhahahahahahaa..<br><br>Even the literature teacher hate me for not able to hand in my assignment in computer aided form..<br>I donÂ’t own a computer at 13 years old ! IÂ’m not fortunate see! Most of my friends, girls , boys, in my generation (10 years ago from now 2002), owned or shared a computer at home. I donÂ’t..cannot afford leh!<br>She wonÂ’t accept our hand-written assignment, no matter what the fking hell! Only my friend and me donÂ’t have a computerÂ…. Fk man!<br>Actually, it is not really that important whether with computer aided or hand-written, its all marked by her, she could just close one eye but she wonÂ’t Â…Â….<br>her name: tan mei haw, haw pa villa her home. Fking devoured by her own shitÂ…Â…<br><br>God must have been stingy with me!<br>IÂ’m a stingrayÂ…Â….<br>everybody shall feel my venom.<br><br>Soldier of misfortune, IÂ’m ur nemesis..<br>Youth of misfortune, thatÂ’s meÂ…Â…..<br><br>Lets talk about ur familyÂ….<br>If IÂ’m born in ur family , maybe IÂ’ll be better than you now! Aaaaaaaaahahahahahahahahahah.<br>With all those luxuries at my disposalÂ….u canÂ’t stop me from being successfulÂ…Â…Â…Â….<br>But I know everyone is selfish, u want the best for urselfÂ…..<br><br>One thing about most juvenile delinquents, they r fking rich kids, with a backyard house n a porch, balcony to overlookÂ…..<br>Why is that they still strayed despite they r so loaded?<br><br>I only wish i got a loaded gun to point to my temper, and pull the triggerÂ…<br><br>Hey, u know what, I donÂ’t feel writing now, I cant think properly, my headache is here again, gotta stop manÂ… IÂ’ll continue laterÂ…Â…<br><br>So all u parents or would be parents out there reading this, show ur child (either daughter or son) more concern , do not ever discriminate the siblings .e.g u prefer the son to the daughter, or the brother to the younger brother. UÂ’ll made then turn against each other, tug of war lah, if u know what I mean<br></div>
