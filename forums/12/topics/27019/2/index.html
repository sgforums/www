Maybe the girls remind them of their wife at home or whatever. If you observe the lecturers closely, they fking have that longing and yearning look on their face. But they donÂ’t show directly of course, they still want face, doint want their reputation tarnished.<br><br>Resulting in their bias treatment towards the students, they treat girls nicer and more attention towards them. Fking true. I can proved,  go poly with me, IÂ’ll show you.<br><br>Beautiful, sexy, nice looking, peasant, sweet, charming, girls got more attention.. do you dare to reject a beautiful girls.. fking no right?<br><br>A beautiful girl ask you to help her, u fking cannot reject rightÂ… fking easy to understand right?<br><br>Ugly, simple girls, u fking dedicate ur hate to them. Fking laugh at them, fking mock about their look. U fking burn ueself to hell.<br><br>Fking observation n assumption made by meÂ….<br>Do not deny, sincerely face it and ask urself I fking not a liar.<br><br>1) dirty old man got abit of money visit geylang whores for sex relief.<br>Geyland whores cheap, easy available a range of choice.<br>Student, daring student, first timer, no much money, wanted to try to satisfy crave for sex visit  geyland too.<br>Similarity: both of the above got no reputation to tarnish.<br>Fking understand man.<br><br>2)very rich people like CEO, chief manager, director of big enterprise, old white matsalleh, ahmoh businessman posted working here, very lonely, no wife around or no wife , a lot of fking money, no place to spend, they fking hired personal escort to help them chase away the loneliness. Fking go for high class pro or famous model, tv celebrities u seen on tv, advertise on tv to let them excite one night or simply to escort them around. The fking high class pro ver professional, very discreet, no leakage at all. Fking very safe.. got reputation also cannot tarnished. But fking expensive. Poor guy on the street cannot afford lahÂ…fking wanted to enjoy real life, fking screwed godÂ’s creations, beautiful girls, god must hae spend a lot of time with you<br>Fking understand man.<br><br>4)poly lectuters cannot afford high class or simply donÂ’t want to spend so much money on the 2) girls, high class veri expensive one. They left with no choice but to surf pornographic on the web. Fking consider they geyland whore to be dirty and unsafe this is fking offensive, but fking so what!<br>Fking bespectacle man, fking expose ur fking life, fking sinner.<br><br>From some of them I had came across, they fking show the porno faceÂ…pockmarked on the face, dimpled face, pleasure forehead, lusty eyes wwhen lookin at poly girls..bespectacles, lack of sporting life, exercise, sun exposure to tan the skin, fking look like a greyish person.<br><br>FOR(X=0;X&lt;100;X++)<br>{<br>They are fking technologist people, it savy, people, they always talk about how wonderful it is for a java script, java applet, java visual application, jav webchat to work.<br>substring(Â“fuckuÂ”,23, 23);<br>}<br>Also Fking cannot resist the urge to surf pornographic website, masturbate aloneÂ…..<br><br>Not every lecturers but some of them, mostly no wife, still bachelor, very obvious from their face I can tell..got wife one of course do not dare.<br><br>2) poly girls do part time prostitution to earn extra cash for sheshido, loÂ’real, expensive cosmetic, brand designer clothes, this is true, one of my poly consultant guidances lecturer can verify that. Why? To earn enough money earn more money To have beautiful skin, go for expensive cosmetic treatment u see advertisement all around, fking blinding ur eyes, fking lying to u, u fking fall for it. U fking dumb.. I fking laugh at you. U fking respect this kind of beautified girls? Fking no way man for me to respect not even their shit. externally very nice,very tempting, even studied a lot smart brilliant lecturers can fall for it, fall for their mesmerising look, all formulas to them just fking donÂ’t hold anymore in their so years of studying. The girls fking open their legs, lecturer cannot fking stand anymore, fking give in to everything, their primal instincts, urges. They fking sinner, fking imperfect, fking disgraceful, fking no saint.<br><br>Fking lecturers are human too, they fking made mistakes so is teachers and ministers.<br><br>Girls very beautiful but are their soul beautiful?<br><br>Beautiful, sexy, nice looking, peasant, sweet, charming, girls got more attention.. do you dare to reject a beautiful girls.. fking no right? Fking sweet beautiful, inviting, sxy, charming outstanding voluptous, shapely, curvy girls, u fking must look at her, u fking cannot reject her also. This is fking truth.

I got carried away!<br><br>although IÂ’m only 21 years old, not brain-washed by the government, fk, IÂ’m not a psychological mutants of the government in singaporeÂ…Â…..hahahahahÂ…Â…Â… deemed me as an heretic now, burned me at stakes, cut my head off, charged me with treason, breach of trust  fk, whatever, I donÂ’t care. I not afraid of death, are you?<br><br>HahahahahaÂ…Â…..iÂ’m a childish chap who got nothing to do in life, donÂ’t mind dying, money donÂ’t appeal to me at allÂ… so donÂ’t bribed me, kiss my ass, take ur 10 thousands with you, I cant be brain Â–washed, kid bear the consequences  urself , those reading this lahhhhÂ…Â…Â…Â…Â…Â….foreign expatriates, we dun need you at allÂ…Â… see lang ah moh, staining our world with ur shit,, get Lost now , go back to ur nasdaq, bloomberg, ur stock market in wallstreetÂ…. our economy is as concrete as ever without ur pathetic aid, fk get out of our faceÂ…..singaporean born citizens shall rule over ur silly assÂ… stop going to the stupid pub, ur banned, ur rejected, we repelled ur white-hairy asss, stop wasting our beer, take ur jean beam n cola, budweiser with youÂ….we drink tiger beer, our home-made booster, u hairy six feet tall ass get lost nowÂ….<br>We hate ur hairy ass, u Â‘playedÂ’, fooled around when ur wife is around minding ur brain, u fuked our homely girls, our homemade product, our singapore girls, our conservative soul, proliferated them, bent them to ur wishes, ur outrageous demandsÂ…white hairy ass, get my words, get the fk outtta here, u donÂ’t belong to our society, ur not part of singapore, never mind ur stupid stamford rafflesÂ…Â….folded arms and ur shit .we prefer tau po n tau gay to stand up, IÂ’m not kidding, neither is GOD!<br><br>Damn! I always got carried away, so back to our DEAR MR LEE storyÂ…<br><br>1)Mr lee made a mistake Â‘independencedÂ’ singapore? Make singapore not dependant on any country, survive on itself own ? MaybeÂ…<br>2)If we stay to the malaya fedaration n union, weÂ’ll be better off? No , definitely nonononono NO!<br><br>First, u see why I considered it as a mistake! We lacked natural resources like water n must have products like rice farming, chicken Â‘ayamÂ’ farmingÂ….how to survive ? just like a disable man without his legs and arms, without his limbs, moving around independently could be done but very tough, u understand right? so we gotta open our door to trade lah... cannot be selfish n isolated...must be friendly to other countries e.g malaysia despite their hostile treatment towards us.... no need to elaborate here, u understand hooo?<br>Singapore too ,if we wanted to survive, but for how long? We have survived for 38 years, it is only a small, insignificant age, duration compared to US, china which got like a 5000 years history but full of turmoil of course. We donÂ’t really experienced any turmoil, major conflicts in singapore yet! Right? Just like u donÂ’t got any chicken poxs  before, PREPARED TO GET ONE NOW! If u already had one, ur risk or chances of getting is smaller and  unimportant to you at allÂ….so speaks ur family doctor as ever.<br><br>Second option to reckonÂ…<br><br>No why? becos the malays are not prepare to share their country and everything with usÂ….<br>So chinese in malaysia would get intimidated by the muslims, we wont have any share of educations, businessesÂ…etcÂ…Â…chinese or race other than muslims, malays  would got impartial, unfair , biased treetments of all kind u could imaginedÂ…. We got discriminated in generalÂ…Â…<br><br>Then how?<br>Die lah but u donÂ’t ask Mr lee to die, he got a bright future, actually he can considered migration to other countries but he chose to stay in singapore and develop the fishing villageÂ… maybe  a challenge to himÂ…who knows ? why was that he could migrate to other already advanced country who could compensate a talent like him? HeÂ’s a cosmopolitan, highly educated, brilliant man but despite everything, he chose to stay in singapore and unleashed his talents n dreams, stubborn, one-sided belief, determination<br>To make singapore work unlike doc mahathir incapabilityÂ….. so our MR LEE ruled over us, over your soul, over ur body, over ur mind, over ur thoughts, over ur intentions, over ur belief and ur dreams n last but not least over the next generation childish kid like meÂ…Â….hahahah..<br><br>Still to be continued when IÂ’m back from hell vacation, dinner n dance in infernal pit, inhuman feastÂ…Â….<br>Who is willing to share a carpool with me, the devil advocates, the hellish attorney evolved from the pig abattoir?<br><br>Written by StQwerty lost in the x-demension, the receding horizon, overcasted skyÂ….<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Those not involved in our family feud or turmoilÂ…. Get out now!  As you as came to know me recently from my writings, IÂ’m a somewhat a creative personÂ….but not now. I got serious explanation to clarify to those involved in the feud. ItÂ’s not complicated but it depends on who is reading it, what sort of family ur from to discern the complexity of the problem!<br><br>those u from a responsible, fortunate, good, spoilt, silver spoon, over-indulged family, sorry to say, u wont understandÂ…haha. Want me to kick ur dumb ass? DonÂ’t u try to act cool in front of me. Ur just compelling me to raise up my middle finger n growl a, fuck you! Yeah, singapore discouraged the vulgar n the scumÂ… scum of the earth! scorch the earth! Opps! I got carried away! We donÂ’t have hard-cored in singaporeÂ… so I sought the USÂ….dead bodies in the gutter everywhere, clogging the drainsÂ… bullet wounds, lead filled human carcasses, death stench n rancid smell evaporating! I got ur mind reeling! Haha.<br><br>Those of you from a poor family or being thrown into the society at young age to struggle, to survive, coolÂ…<br>UÂ’ll understand, a portion of it only. Just  a small portion, I donÂ’t need to elaborate, itÂ’s ur problem not mine. See, IÂ’m selfish right? Well, everybody is selfish to an extent to save ur own life! God made us selfish. By the way, please pardon my english, itÂ’s not good, I hope uÂ’ll understand! IÂ’ll try my best! Believe me I wont be able to tell u face to face, person to person as much n as fluent as writing here!<br>As you know, IÂ’m scare of reality, I ruled in my dreams. Everybody around me is reality, so IÂ’m scare of them, but in my dream IÂ’m unbeatable n invulnerable! IÂ’ve fixed, constructed, erected, designed, rendered a beautiful world inside my dreamland with me living in it. Words is inadequate to describe dreams as u all know but enough to form n pieced together the reality we r living in. A utopia is what I mean.<br><br>So here I begin the faultÂ…<br><br>Due to initial woes e.g I saw my father strangled my mum, he squeeshed her neck with both his hand, I saw my mum withered like a helpless dog between his palm. For ur information, IÂ’m already born at the time, sitting on the floor playing with my lego pieces, comeon, imagine a chubby child sitting on the floor playing with his new lego set. Where did I got the lego set, I earned it myself. how? Such young age?<br>Thru the third prize I got in my kindergarden examination, (hey hey hey, this shows that IÂ’m intelligent right!) then my mum will boast the whole present winning to my dad n sister, to show off lah! Of couse lah, the father will be proud of his son, mum too but the sisterÂ… due to lots of attention being paid to me, my sister grew jealous of me! Cruel truth of the stupid society sure was successful in accessing my family n seized in between its crushing grasps. My sister is not to be blamed! She is young too! I understand but my parentsÂ… they failed to realize the danger n failed to rectify the problems promptly n allowed it to evolve into a monstrosity chaos right in the heart of our Â‘warmÂ’ family. Fk. IÂ’m not exaggerating, feel my words with ur heart, uÂ’ll understand the true meaning! Please donÂ’t ever say IÂ’m trying to jerk ur tears ok? IÂ’m not trying to get ur sympathy, IÂ’m explaining the reasons for my hard-hearted n lethargy on life.<br><br>My dad is weak! He cannot be a man, not a father, not even an upright person! Fk. My mum is blindÂ… or desperate. Fk. When a person is desperate, committing mistakes is aplenty n easy. Her mind will tend to overlook n shroud logical thoughts n decisions. My mum is one of the unfortunate victims. Fk the desperate! GOD IS THE CULPRIT! My mum got married to him for a cheap price! He donÂ’t even cherish his understanding wife! Well, IÂ’m goin to make this known to everybody especially, EVEN IF UR FAITHFUL WIFE RAN WAY FROM YOU, U R TO BE BLAMED! Something hideous, ugly u must be committing to repel her away! Fking get this! Well, I do know of a few case where th3e wife is totally at fault! Ok but not in my fmaily lah! My mum is a respectable, upright, strict, faithful, honest, honorable, irreplaceable, unpreceded, meek wife, mother.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br><br>I got kicked into my dreamlands due to the initial woes. This always happen! This is life! When a kid is exposed to the ugliness of the society at a tender n young age, he got kicked into his dreamland to escape the painful, mind-reeling, cruel reality. IÂ’m no an exception! Dream is wonderful, my dreamland is even bigger than singapore itself but lacks the cruel, hostility n darkness of the reality. It is always sunny days in my dream. My dreamland got a few new addition to it a few years back. Who? U know ah! I donÂ’t have to mention whom! ItÂ’s really embarrassing! ItÂ’s a SHEÂ….fkÂ… I miss herÂ….ahahhahahahahhahahahaa! IÂ’m dreaming again! Gotta flush my head in the toilet bowl!<br><br>Hey back to the initial woes kreated by the dumb manÂ…<br>Hey did you ever see a bruise on an arm as big  patch as a knuckle size! Hum?<br>Â…. IÂ’m not joking. I saw the bruise on my mother when I was like five years old, I think my sister remembered! Gotta wrecked her forgotten memories for it! Courtesy from my dumb father, with compliments!<br>Kick his bloody ass! U know what? It really amazed a kid like me, shocked at the same fking time, wondered how my mum got it from! She was weeping at that time, crying her heart out, heartbroken shrieking n moaning, groaning like a dying person! IÂ’m used to it! Sorry dear sister, I know itÂ’s painful for you, neither am I helpful with me refreshing the dormant old haunting past. Ur husband gotta understand n love u more! IÂ’m alright! I only hate life! I donÂ’t get angry any more but if IÂ’m to erupt once again, I swear, not even a bullet is going to stall me ANYMORE! But of course, I wonÂ’t harm those not involved in the  initial woes. I hate fighting! Lets forget everything! I  hate threaten! Not to mention those asshole in the school.. fkÂ…IÂ’m not vindictive neither am I determined to make them payback!<br><br>I just hate life! hope IÂ’m not freezing ur atmosphere n tensing it with my gloom. IÂ’m used to love violent, IÂ’m taught to love, accept violent quietly!<br><br>Now if u ask me how to chase a girl, or how to make her feel good, how to make her feel unique, sincerely n franklyÂ…Â…I donÂ’t know!<br>Now if u ask me how to be a good son, how to be piety, how to be a caring son, how to treat ur old mother, sincerely n franklyÂ…Â…Â…..i donÂ’t know!<br>Now if u ask me how to be a good husband, a good examplary father, a good family manager, a financial managerÂ…Â…Â…Â…Â…Â…I donÂ’t know!<br>Now if u ask me how to make friends, how to associate,  socialize, be a good friend, make whatever contact<br>With human, with pplÂ…Â…Â…Â…Â…I donÂ’t know!<br>But if u ask me how to read a juvenile, a child, a kid, a delinquentsÂ’ mindÂ…..i do know a few tricksÂ….<br>I could advice, answer ur doubt, tell u why they acted this way but u have to execute it yourselves! Since u r the father, IÂ’m not! Give u a frequent asked question FAQ about kids frustration n needs n attentionsÂ… I could help, without a fee, no charge lah, IÂ’m NOT professional what! Or u rather seek PRO help, also can, u pay what not me which is even better than my advice, but IÂ’m faster to give you an immediate answer, but u Â‘ve to execute it urself!<br><br>Sometimes I like to deviate my focus on my personal problems to some other things, not really ground-breaking or compulsive to read! As you know, IÂ’m long-winded n tend to get carried away lah like grandmaÂ….ok? so you wont get boring reading my passage. I know I used to favor long passages but now I tried to cut n distribute it accordingly into shorter passage. Okokokokokokokokok ENOUGH!<br></div>

DonÂ’t bother! Just donÂ’t let me, what IÂ‘ve done, disrupt ur personal life, carry on as usual, nothing happen, u donÂ’t have to believe me anymore but believe what I wrote here!<br>DonÂ’t be impressionable, donÂ’t mind what I Â‘ve done, u Â‘ve to forget the bad past! Dunno how to put in word leh! IÂ’m donÂ’t feel sad, emotional writing this, neither should you! Just carry on with ur life as usual, family as usual, everything as usualÂ…Â…. I donÂ’t know how to repair this trust also,,,,,,,,, never feel a need to do it, sincerely n frankly, I just hope u donÂ’t feel sad or anything or heartbroken! Serious! I really mean it! IÂ’m long-winded againÂ…..u could still trust my sister, my mother of course, but u can choose not to trust me! It is really not that important! I promised, swore not to worsen the trust, just leave it as it isÂ…ok?<br>(Listen carefully! Whatever happened recently, if uÂ’ve discovered something amiss recently, it is just a left-over debris from the past disaster, just like the photograph lahÂ…Â…Â…Â….uÂ’ve misunderstood already!) okokokokokokok simply, donÂ’t have to regain your trust in me, donÂ’t waste time, donÂ’t bother just donÂ’t brood about it! Simple right! Recently n in future I will be doing nothing to cause break of trust, worsening of trust or anything bad in the house, I retired already, very sianz.<br><br>About helping me, actually I hate ppl helping me, I donÂ’t like to be told what to do, just like you or everyone else lah! Okokokok, very complicated now! How to tell you the finer n intricate details of my character n behaviour.. I do it another time, very hard to explain why? Just let u know, IÂ’m caught in between my dream n realityÂ…Â…very hard to solve, very hard to switch, cannot abandon both of my dream n reality eitherÂ…... so IÂ’m somewhat very confused very blurred like sontong, donÂ’t know what to do, just like when ur bios is infected by virusÂ…Â…Â… only thing is to replace the whole mother board, dispose the infected bios away! But can  you dispose me away?<br><br>Â…Â…. First u think IÂ’m like Jack Neo, same low education n got the brain n brawn to be successful!Â…Â…Â…Â….. IÂ’m not, sorry u donÂ’t understand at all!<br>Then I filled u up with all this words, u said I must be coping it from somewhere, I said NO! IÂ’m not angry with you but I need to clarifyÂ…..not some much as to show off or prove to u or anything but I just need to BE MYSELF, ACT MYSELF, THIS IS ME, WHAT YOU SEE NOW IS THE TRUE ME, NEVER SEEN BEFORE IN REALITY..imÂ’ always like this in my dreams all alongÂ…Â…but not in reality.fk it!<br><br>Â…Â…Â…Â…Â….then u got feeling that I shouldnÂ’t have a problem with life since IÂ’m understanding, I could express myself so clearly HERE! Right?Â…Â…Â….but I canÂ’t face reality, I canÂ’t do this in reality IÂ’m caught in my dreams half of my soulÂ…..<br><br>Human brain is so complicate, believe me!<br>U donÂ’t really understand the truth yet! DonÂ’t bother also!<br>Carry on with ur life is the better part of understanding n a good solution now!<br></div>
