So though many of us can AGREE with you that this world's NOT PERFECT and there're FAULTs lying here and there.... It STILL doesn't constitute the FACT that you're seeing things through YOUR BROKEN GLASSES... You NEVER SEE yourself as PART of the FACTOR in the PICTUREs....

I DON'T CARE a DAMN about some worthless SELF-PATHETIC creatures who couldn't even stand up to himself....<br><br>And you THINK people REALLY CARE a DAMN about what BECOME of you...? They DON'T.... They're walking out there... ENJOYING their lives or WORKING their SWEATs out.... Just because you're here in Forum Agony that's WHY you're feeling a little MORE COSY... A little more 'in control'...? THROW you OUT on the STREETS and see WHO would care a DAMN about you....?You're a NORMAL person...

Never a need! DonÂ’t bother! Just donÂ’t let me, what IÂ‘ve done, disrupt ur personal life, carry on as usual, nothing happen, u donÂ’t have to believe me anymore but believe what I wrote here!<br>DonÂ’t be impressionable, donÂ’t mind what I Â‘ve done, u Â‘ve to forget the bad past! Dunno how to put in word leh! IÂ’m donÂ’t feel sad, emotional writing this, neither should you! Just carry on with ur life as usual, family as usual, everything as usualÂ…Â…. I donÂ’t know how to repair this trust also,,,,,,,,, never feel a need to do it, sincerely n frankly, I just hope u donÂ’t feel sad or anything or heartbroken! Serious! I really mean it! IÂ’m long-winded againÂ…..u could still trust my sister, my mother of course, but u can choose not to trust me! It is really not that important! I promised, swore not to worsen the trust, just leave it as it isÂ…ok?<br>(Listen carefully! Whatever happened recently, if uÂ’ve discovered something amiss recently, it is just a left-over debris from the past disaster, just like the photograph lahÂ…Â…Â…Â….uÂ’ve misunderstood already!) okokokokokokok simply, donÂ’t have to regain your trust in me, donÂ’t waste time, donÂ’t bother just donÂ’t brood about it! Simple right! Recently n in future I will be doing nothing to cause break of trust, worsening of trust or anything bad in the house, I retired already, very sianz.<br><br>About helping me, actually I hate ppl helping me, I donÂ’t like to be told what to do, just like you or everyone else lah! Okokokok, very complicated now! How to tell you the finer n intricate details of my character n behaviour.. I do it another time, very hard to explain why? Just let u know, IÂ’m caught in between my dream n realityÂ…Â…very hard to solve, very hard to switch, cannot abandon both of my dream n reality eitherÂ…... so IÂ’m somewhat very confused very blurred like sontong, donÂ’t know what to do, just like when ur bios is infected by virusÂ…Â…Â… only thing is to replace the whole mother board, dispose the infected bios away! But can  you dispose me away?<br><br>Â…Â…. First u think IÂ’m like Jack Neo, same low education n got the brain n brawn to be successful!Â…Â…Â…Â….. IÂ’m not, sorry u donÂ’t understand at all!<br>Then I filled u up with all this words, u said I must be coping it from somewhere, I said NO! IÂ’m not angry with you but I need to clarifyÂ…..not some much as to show off or prove to u or anything but I just need to BE MYSELF, ACT MYSELF, THIS IS ME, WHAT YOU SEE NOW IS THE TRUE ME, NEVER SEEN BEFORE IN REALITY..imÂ’ always like this in my dreams all alongÂ…Â…but not in reality.fk it!<br><br>Â…Â…Â…Â…Â….then u got feeling that I shouldnÂ’t have a problem with life since IÂ’m understanding, I could express myself so clearly HERE! Right?Â…Â…Â….but I canÂ’t face reality, I canÂ’t do this in reality IÂ’m caught in my dreams half of my soulÂ…..<br><br>Human brain is so complicate, believe me!<br>U donÂ’t really understand the truth yet! DonÂ’t bother also!<br>Carry on with ur life is the better part of understanding n a good solution now!<br></div></blockquote>u don't understand this posted a long time ago?</div>
