Never regret n suffer like my father.<br><br>IÂ’ll make it very simple to understand, so I begin<br><br>1) u canÂ’t do something, canÂ’t accomplised a task, I CAN<br>so ur JEALOUS! u wanna drag me down with u, so that u got a companion, FUKEN GET IT INTO UR FAT BRAIN! This is wrong, GOD WILL PUNISH YOU, will meet ur nemesis soon, ur judgment day!<br>Simple e.g<br><br>Son can play guitar, father canÂ’tÂ…Â….heÂ’s not happy bcos he canÂ’t play as awesome, he throw TANTRUM, just like a fat kid kicking on the floor, screaming like a donkeyÂ… uWANNA be a HUMAN DONKEY?<br><br>Father should  be happy Son can do it , accomplised some difficult feat, father SHOULD be proud of his<br>SON and not JEALOUS like my father<br><br>Sister, SIBLINGS, good friends likewise<br><br>IS ur father like this? NO..Good for u<br>YES, God bless you, donÂ’t end up like meÂ…Â…<br><br>The girl came from a broken family featured in the channel U tvÂ…<br><br>True she found happiness after much suffering but I CAN TELL YOU ITÂ”S NOT FOR LONG!<br>Fuken get it! Why is it not for long?<br><br>You see she came from a broken family, her mindset n some portion of her mentality(army like to mention this) could BE DISTORTED seriously! If she is reading, pay tantamount attention!<br><br>She lacked fatherly or motherly love, so itÂ’s not balance at all<br><br>As for MR DARREN case, its not serious! Why?<br>Bcos he got a granny to replace his mother, father is always there to demostrate how a man show be, not like my wimpy father.<br><br>When the abovementioned girl from the broken family START a fmaily herself, thereÂ’s a high risk she wonÂ’t know how to be a good parent, she may over-indulge her children, spoilt them, over-love them than needed! My advice to herÂ…..DONÂ’T GET MARRIED or donÂ’t have more than 1 children, cos she wont be able to educate the second subsequent child as WELL as the first kid, needless to say the third child of the family even her financial allow her to<br><br>First child is easy to educate why?<br>GODÂ’s GRACE, god give to the first as always, made the first child of the family extremely obident n piety, intelligent, or responsible to replace intelli if itÂ’s not presence in the child like my sister.<br><br>My sister ainÂ’t smart but sheÂ’s got a great responsibility so u see why Mr D fell in love with her at first sight.<br>GOD giove my sister to both of my helpless, lost, ignorant parents to AID them later on in their senior years<br><br>IÂ’m not. IÂ’m the extra. My birth is purely decided by both of my parents not GOD, GOD said to themÂ” I gave u a girl to aid both of u, she would be extraordinary I mean Miss YBS, not smart but very responsibleÂ”<br><br>if you want a SON,u ainÂ’t satisfied with a GODÂ’s GRACE daughter, u gotta be fully responsible for his development. If anything goes wrong, the educating parents is AT FAULT totally!Â”<br><br>GOD canÂ’t give you ten son n made them successful without u PARENTs putting in any EFFORT AT ALL. What an easy task u got as a parent! U got 10 succeeful son to feed u when ur OLD.<br><br>When ur hungery, about to die from penniless, no money to buy foodÂ…Â…God will give u a few penny to help u sustain ur life UNTIL U CAN EARN UR FOOD! Jus like Bread Q in the US<br>GOD WONÂ”T SAYÂ” hey u going to DIE, IÂ’ll give you 1 millon dollars to let u live ur life forever whiout  any worry of hunger. U fking dream about it<br><br>Am I right to say that ur parent or even YOU Always think of striking the lottery or SINGAPORE SWEEP FIRST..PRIZE so u donÂ’t have to work forever?<br><br>FUKEN GET IT INTO UR IMBECILE BRAIN, it wont happen! TOO Â‘FREEÂ’ FOR YOU, TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE!<br>So u see I never believe in 4-D, toto, small prize yep but definitely not big bet!<br><br>In the supernark, I used to work<br><br>One fking auntie ask me to buy 4-D machine pick for her, since my luck would be good bcos IÂ’m penniless n IÂ’m hungeryÂ…so maybe u would strike<br><br>Puit it this way, she is making use of me, IÂ’m hungery, I got a great luck, I buy 4d for her, she strikes, she is happy, IÂ’m still hungery..WTFÂ….life sux.<br></div>
