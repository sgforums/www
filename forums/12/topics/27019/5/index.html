            <div class='col-md body'>WhoÂ….u treat me my thread as an information high wayÂ…..how pleasing to know that!<br>IÂ’m the Guru or master of the internet surfing Â…Â….hahaÂ…Â…whatever!<br>Nah IÂ’m just making my observation n assumption, could BE WRONG OF COURSE!<br>IÂ’m human, just like you not perfectÂ…Â….repeat myselfÂ…Â…whatever below are just my observations..OK? GET IT? IÂ’m not GOD, just a plain human like youÂ…..not stuck up, donÂ’t own a car, donÂ’t own a big 3-stories house! Neither am I smartÂ…. I just have the ability to analyze things, happenings! And please donÂ’t ever say I got it from my dad, heÂ’s rotten like hell!<br><br>Obsevation not really accurate or definate answer! Just my observation<br><br>Why is Madonna a pop icon of this decade or this period in US music scene?<br><br>1-------She is a blonde just like marilyn monroe, the skirt fly one! Marilyn DIE liaoÂ…Â…nobody to continue in her footstep, her own white blonde type lah except madonna to fit inÂ…Â…so she of course popular!<br><br>2------pure aryan race, pure ang moh, blood line not corruptedÂ….her eyes is blue in color? I donÂ’t knowÂ….just know her hair is blondle golden color, shimmering in sunlight!<br><br>3-----ppl always said blonde is stupid! Any prove? Pamela anderson like a barbie doll for u to play!<br><br>4------she can dance well, her former genre is dance popÂ…Â…..now is hip-hop! To follow the trend otherwise outdated------I donÂ’t know , never listen to her song before! I Never like PURE ANG MOH ALSO! The man is white hairy assÂ…ok offensive----------I shut up!<br><br>5-----so you see a white blonde girls doing black hiphop music, very popular among the ameris, very fresh very new!<br><br>6----------although she very oldÂ…Â…Â…..40 years still popular in her career<br><br>7-----------show sumting the americans are stupid asses they like blonde hair! They only have style and look only but NO BRAIN! Unlike OUR SUPERIOR CHINESE&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; CHINESE IS THE BEST! We are the smartest of all HUMAN.<br><br>8--------------britney spear, christina agrilera, faith hill, madonna have one thing in common! THEY ARE BLONDE HAIRÂ…..white amreican blonde hair girls right?<br><br>9------------so youÂ’ll see in MTV AWARD where the individual stars show off their singing stuff!<br><br>Christina agrilera is JEALOUS OF faith hill, hate britney spear,  from her look u can tell Â…Â…dunno which year of MTV AWARD..1999?<br><br>TheyÂ’ll fight with each other for the madonna title or marilyn monroe title, female pop icon for  that period after MADONNA DIED OR RETIRED!<br><br>10-----------u never see christina JEALOUS of whitney houston or mariah carey? Why?<br><br>Bcos whitney is black ladyÂ…Â…Â…mariah is mixedÂ…Â…Â….so they are not PURE of PURE ANG MOH BLOOD, not blonde not blue eyes, so how to compete?<br><br>Mixed or black lady sure lost out! Take for instance, did you ever buy a hindus or MALAY singer album or songÂ…Â…Â…Â…Â…did you ever listen to their song and got addicted to it? NO RIGHT! Ur chinese u listen to taiwanÂ….or english! Do you know the name of an hindu great star? Worship him a lot?<br><br>Like michael jackson is trying to say IÂ’m A BLACK MAN&lt; IM STILL THE SAME AS WHITE  MAN, BLACK HAIR IS THE SAME! I CAN PERFORM LIKE YOU&lt; I CAN ENTERTAIN YOU ALL THE SAME just  like A WHITE PERSON&lt; U SAY MY SKIN IS BLACK? I CAN PURIFY IT N BECAME WHITE LIKE WHITE ASS AMERIS, so itÂ’s the same! I can go for skin graft operation to change my black features to pure white! Micahel look frightening under the stage light right?<br><br>So u see mariah n whitney will never be pop icon! They are divas! But not music icon!<br>U see life is unfair right? Just bcos u r chinese or other race, u canÂ’t be crowned!<br><br>Take for instance coco lee in grammy award! She is just a passing trend, meaning, once the americans commoners got tired of her, she is NO MORE! Just like chinese dishes in US..passing onlyÂ…..famous for a period then tide down!<br><br>Jack neo said u go to other country, u r second wifeÂ…..in singapore we r the first wife!<br><br>Americans never like chinese to run the country! How will it turn out to be? Chinese rule over white ass? Or black rule over white ass?<br><br>U see, hollywood shows with black man as the president will never be a block busterÂ…Â…take for instance Â…..Â’deep impactÂ’ with the black actor, whats his name? as the president of the country------not so popular<br><br>Armaggeddon------------very popualr why? Bcos the president in the show is WHITE!<br><br>But COKA COLA IS FOREVER, AMERIS STAPLEÂ…Â…..same as BLONDE HAIR CELEBRITIES!<br>Like leonardo de caprio! Levis jeans also! U mixed blood, black, chinese, impure  already!<br><br>Celine dion is different bcos she is also blonde right? Maybe she would get the icon title!<br></div>
