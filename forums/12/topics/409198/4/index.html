              <p>If that's what you want us to say, then you have your mind made up. You want to end your own marriage. And you want us to validate your actions.</p>
              <p>Know this though. Each person is responsible for his/her choices and the consequences that come with it. </p>

There is another 4 months to go.<br><br>I'm not sure but highly suspect that its due to my loneliness, that I recently found myself thinking of a man who had chosen to depart from my life and discontinue our unusual and illicit relationship, after I told him that my then-bf (who became my husband) proposed to me and I accepted.<br><br>I last heard from him about 1 year ago, when he popped online to ask me how I was. he had "vanished" for many months before that, when I told him that my then-bf proposed to me.

This is in itself, a lie, because actually I was already married by then.<br><br>After I told him that I have accepted the proposal, which today I think was the biggest mistake of my life, this man never contacted me ever again. Before that he was already acting weird and said how he didn't feel that it's right of him to continue our unusual relationship while my real bf and I took serious steps to cement our relationship (through engagement). He said he feels bad towards my then-bf, who did not do anything wrong to him and feels he can't "violate" an engagement that will amount to marriage (as all engagements are supposed to).<br><br>I wonder if its due to my husband not being around, that i've been thinking of him again (prior to my husband's leaving singapore for the posting, I didn't think of that man too much).<br><br>But now in fact, not only do I think of him, I visualise meeting him and us in embrace. I also wonder if the fact that he's still lurking around in my mind, is because there was no proper closure between us.<br><br>I really miss him so dearly and I pray to God that he has found happiness with a girl who makes him laugh like I do, who understands him like I do and who can click with him so well like i do. In other words, I feel that I'd have been this girl together with him married, if we met under different circumstances or in an alternate reality.<br><br>I can't stop thinking of him. and I'm also worried of how this affects my marriage.

              <p>I pity your husband. What kind of woman are you? Forget about tryst and concentrate on yuor marriage. By marriage, you have already consecrated yourself to your husband and vice versa. So quit thinking about having feelings for another man, venture into the unknown and this would qualify you as a slut and society has no respect for you. Biggest mistake of your life? If you go and pursue the affair it would be the mother of all biggest mistakes of your life. Once married never look back.</p>

              <p>I've been married for over one and a half years. My husband's
              posted overseas for work slightly over 3 months ago. There is
              another 4 months to go.<br> <br> I'm not sure but highly suspect that its due to my loneliness, that
              I recently found myself thinking of a man who had chosen to depart
              from my life and discontinue our unusual and illicit relationship,
              after I told him that my then-bf (who became my husband) proposed
              to me and I accepted.<br> <br> I last heard from him about 1 year ago, when he popped online to
              ask me how I was. he had "vanished" for many months before that,
              when I told him that my then-bf proposed to me. He popped up 1 yr
              ago that time, he asked me whether I had accepted the proposal. I
              said yes. This is in itself, a lie, because actually I was already
              married by then.<br> <br> After I told him that I have accepted the proposal, which today I
              think was the biggest mistake of my life, this man never contacted
              me ever again. Before that he was already acting weird and said how

              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"> A woman never forgets the men she could have had; a man, the woman he couldn't.</p>
              <p>Pretty
               much a fantasy constructed entirely from your mind; as you have 
              mentioned, most of your communication with him is within this virtual 
              space, hence it's easy to say that this man could have been part of your
               marriage plan if 'he' were to do something in the past. I am not 
              concerned about who makes a better fit (between your husband or the 
              other guy), but rather, to use ideas of what you think the relationship 
              would be like from a hypothetical point of view can be very different 
              from the reality of being together with him. </p>
              <p>Honestly, there is 
              serious dissatisfaction in your marriage and this is something that is 
              creating powerful push factor/s to rethink into your marriage. This man 
              conveniently served as a tool of escapism, where the line between what's
               real and unreal becomes blur. Surely circumstances would have led you 
              to where you are now and there are higher reasons why circumstances are 
              manipulated into what they are and these are not easily comprehended by 
              our finite mind.</p>
              <p>Loneliness is common manifestation of a dissatisfied 
              relationship and if you find yourself having to retrace your decision 
              (although not entirely acting on it just yet), it probably suggest the 
              perilous state of health your relationship is at. If you perceived that 
              this 'other man' requires a greater status other than just being a man 
              'you could have, but didn't', this is probably where your complication 
              really begins.</p>
              <p>Seemed like the previous attempts of mending the relationship wasn't exactly
               fruitful. There is still much underlying current of intensive emotions 
              hidden at the back of your subconscious. It would truly be fallacious if
               people believe that marriage will dissolve all existing problem in 
              their BGR relationship - e.g, your illicit relationship with the other 
              man. The truth is that it merely burrows itself into our subconscious, 
              waiting for opportunity to screw our mind and heart once again because 
              we fail to recognise the crux of issue.</p>
              <p>It is a common phenomenon for people who are unavailable/unable 
              to commit to find someone likewise because there appear to be 'safety' 
              in 'playing around' with people who are unavailable as it socially 
              'restrain' us from transgressing. But the problem is that if we don't 
              recognise them as part of our mechanism to prevent ourselves from 
              falling deeper, but instead, push the boundary beyond what it should 
              have been, then it is possible to burn down the relationship. </p>
              <p>Although you might have cemented the relationship before marriage, cracks are surfacing. From a longer term perspective, I
               think it might be helpful for you not to look externally for answers 
              (e.g the other man), but instead, introspect inwardly to see if this 
              marriage and love with your husband is something that you genuinely 
              want. Only then, would you be able to build your decision from that 
              point onwards and see how you could safeguard this marriage from the 
              role of a wife.</p>
              <p>P.S: Elbows are close to our heart, but most of us are not 
              physically able to kiss our elbows. Sometimes in love, some people are 
              just not meant to be - we will probably break a bone or two if we force 
              it through. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="icon_idea.gif"></p>

              <p>I pray to God that I will see him some day, hopefully soon. All I ask from God is one day. I will not have sex with him and so I will not cheat on my husband. I just want to see him. </p>

              <p>Turned out the guy I found on facebook is not him. I made a
              mistake. I knew that he would never ever have a blog or twitter
              account like that. Moreover he's such a private man that I don't
              think he even has a facebook account.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So no, what I know of my e-bf is not an illusion in my part. I
              knew that I know him well. But it seems that the timing is not ripe
              for us to meet.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I pray to God that I will see him some day, hopefully soon. All
              I ask from God is one day. I will not have sex with him and so I
              will not cheat on my husband. I just want to see him. </p>

              <p>We are not jumping with joy when you told us about the blog. So the case of mistaken identity is not bad news. It just a correction. Thats good.</p>
              <p>You declared that he is your soul-mate.  I see only a unilateral declaration.</p>
              <p>Soul-mate has reference to previous existence. Everything consumable on earth is recycled. The air that we breathe has been used over and over again since the formation of the earth. That means dinosaurs have breathe the air that we are breathing now. Nothing is added nothing is taken away, whats on Planet Earth remains on Planet Earth. (Only a teeny bit of metal, and hydrogen fuel is lost through space explorations, other than that everything stays on this planet.)</p>
              <p>The water, minerals, chemicals, gases, that make up the various tissues of our body has been used before. In a tree, a fish, another person, an animal etc. etc. These materials they go to the ground, air, water and is recycled.</p>
              <p>This then brings about the phenomenon of unusual attraction to something i.e. an animal, a tree, a person, an object. The attraction is usually a mystery. Could it be that there are cells in that wooden table that had been from the same source as that in your body now?</p>
              <p>Of course the table is just an example, it could be anything, even a person or a pet.</p>
              <p>This is what soul-mate is all about. But because objects cannot express feelings, it is the human that feels the attraction. Some animals do too.</p>
              <p>With humans/animals soul-mate situations the attraction is always mutual.</p>
              <p>But the chance of coming across your soul-mate is extremely rare. As the elements in our body are from diverse sources, and each too minute to have a major influence. But it is also not an impossibility to come across a soul-mate. It is also possible to ressist the attraction. Conversely, it is also possible to declare soul-mate attraction where there is none.</p>
              <p>Be careful you do not deceive yourself.</p>

              <p>I did not mean you jumping for joy when I said 'bad news'. I meant bad news for myself, because I had equated seeing the bad side of him as good news. If the lame guy had been identified to be the man I'm thinking of, I'd have been freed of the bondage of this love. So not everything is about you.</p>
              <p>Thanks for your interesting and unique take on the concept of soulmates. I assure you that your scientific take on it is very unique and not shared by most others.</p>
