There is another 4 months to go.<br><br>I'm not sure but highly suspect that its due to my loneliness, that I recently found myself thinking of a man who had chosen to depart from my life and discontinue our unusual and illicit relationship, after I told him that my then-bf (who became my husband) proposed to me and I accepted.<br><br>I last heard from him about 1 year ago, when he popped online to ask me how I was. he had "vanished" for many months before that, when I told him that my then-bf proposed to me. He popped up 1 yr ago that time, he asked me whether I had accepted the proposal. I said yes. This is in itself, a lie, because actually I was already married by then.<br><br>After I told him that I have accepted the proposal, which today I think was the biggest mistake of my life, this man never contacted me ever again. Before that he was already acting weird and said how he didn't feel that it's right of him to continue our unusual relationship while my real bf and I took serious steps to cement our relationship (through engagement). He said he feels bad towards my then-bf, who did not do anything wrong to him and feels he can't "violate" an engagement that will amount to marriage (as all engagements are supposed to).<br><br>I wonder if its due to my husband not being around, that i've been thinking of him again (prior to my husband's leaving singapore for the posting, I didn't think of that man too much). <br><br>But now in fact, not only do I think of him, I visualise meeting him and us in embrace. I also wonder if the fact that he's still lurking around in my mind, is because there was no proper closure between us.<br><br>I really miss him so dearly and I pray to God that he has found happiness with a girl who makes him laugh like I do, who understands him like I do and who can click with him so well like i do. In other words, I feel that I'd have been this girl together with him married, if we met under different circumstances or in an alternate reality.<br><br>I can't stop thinking of him. and I'm also worried of how this affects my marriage. Last week i even threw my temper at my husband when he phoned, I think its because of my thoughts and feelings for this man. what should I do?<br><br>he chose to cut me off after thinking that I was getting married, yet he had no qualms about having feelings for me all throughout the time when I was attached to my then-bf or attached to previous bfs. <br><br>is there such a big distinction between the status of married and attached, if you're a guy and you have feelings for a girl?</p></div>

              <p>To be married and ''think'' of another man is ok, but remember that if u <span style="text-decoration: underline;">cross the line</span>, then u are being unfair to your spouse and disrespecting yourself.</p>

              <p>Loneliness is a by=product of unloving oneself, unaccepting of what one is, what one does, hence the need for ''things'' or ''another'' to fulfil one. Of course, it may happen but one has to pay the price and most unconsciously do and hence the feeling of being trapped and stultified. Also, once that ''reason'' or ''need'' is fulfilled - whatever one was seeking ends, it dies.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Being self-honest is essential and being human is to err but to drag everything and cause misery to oneself and others close to u is unwise</span></p>
              <p>PS - ''Think'' in quotes is cos only by <span style="text-decoration: underline;">being self-honest</span> will u ever be able to reconcile to and hopefully transcend this and yet be. <strong>Beware cos what the mind thinks and the heart feels are two different</strong> ...</p>

              ''another'' to fulfil one. Of course, it may happen but one has to
              pay the price and most unconsciously do and hence the feeling of
              being trapped and stultified. Also, once that ''reason'' or
              ''need'' is fulfilled - whatever one was seeking ends, it dies.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Being self-honest is
              essential and being human is to err but to drag everything and
              cause misery to oneself and others close to u is unwise</span></p>
              <p>PS - ''Think'' in quotes is cos only by <span style="text-decoration: underline;">being self-honest</span> will u ever
              be able to reconcile to and hopefully transcend this and yet be.
              <strong>Beware cos what the mind thinks and the heart feels are two
              different</strong> ...</p>

              <p>The river flows lah, u holding on to the past and wanting to relive it now is your predicament, not his. As for being ''cut off'' no one is privy to what really transpired bet u and him (or what could have been overlooked in the marriage) and it would be wiser of u to let-go and understand that life comes in all shades.</p>
              <p>It is the <strong>desire</strong> to see him or whatever that is the misery, the sadness.</p>

              <p>This is called sexual loneliness. It usually happens when both my GFs are off-shore.</p>
              <p>It the time i usually 'suddenly' have new partners of 2 months( we do make clear it a short term thing!). It often a sexual thing.</p>

              <p>It is indeed a sign of loneliness. As yr hubby has been away from you for such a long duration, the feeling of wanting to be love comes in. Since your ex has fulfilled the void in your life previously, the feeling of being associated with your ex comes back pretty naturally.</p>
              <p>Since you are married, you can share your inner feelings with your husband when you talk to him each night.</p>
              <p>Imagine your husband is also overseas and all alone. If he also show signs of loneliness and start looking for girls around (guys overseas are more susceptible to such temptations), how would you feel?</p>
              <p>Marriage is a trust between both parties. Your husband gave his word that he will have no other girls other than you. Likewise, you should also give your trust to your husband that there will be no other men other than him.</p>

              <p>Maintaining a long distance relationship is not easy.....Speaking from first hand experience I was seperated from my wify for 1 yr 6 months. It was not easy.</p>
              <p>There are generally 2 area needs address emotionally and physical needs that need to continue to maintain.</p>
              <p>Do you talk to your husband on a daily basis? either by phone or thru internet e-mail and voice conversation these are tools that are available please use them.</p>
              <p>You can explain position and feeling more thru e-mail so <strong>to avoid argument over long distance call. hard to express emotion over the phone.  </strong>Trust me did that.....its difficult to establish conversation and add stress on him working overseas.</p>
              <p>Physical needs......make a date night over the internet....the rest use your imagination!!! No Kidding try it....!!!!</p>
              <p> Oh by the way this is a good time to find your own interest as compare to having an emotional affair with another old flint of yours......</p>
              <p>Pick up a sport....Yoga..... or get together with Girls events.....!!!!</p>
              <p>Focus on building relationship such as spice up the relationship by taking a sexy picture of yourself in Bikini that he has not seemed and send it to him ask him to put on his computer screen.....!!!!!</p>

              <p>No.. I never once took my husband as back-up. In fact, i believe I love my hubby more. hubby and I share so much meaningful experiences and been through more ups and downs together (although hubby and I got together only 3 yrs + ago). I feel that I understand my hubby better also, due to the fact that through the 8 yrs I knew the other man, he (other man) was not in Singapore most of these times. When we first met, he was studying in London and after he graduated, he worked in Dubai instead of coming home. We could never get together for real cos he's not here. At the point of his cutting me off at the end of the 8 yrs, he was still in Dubai. I hardly spent any time with other man doing real activities like shopping, dining, groceries, errands.</p>
              <p>Our feelings for each other (me and other man) are gradually and very steadily built up over this long period of 8 yrs over conversations online.</p>
              <p>Who's to discount feelings and emotions felt in this manner? We certainly do not care for each other any less just because we weren't really physically together much of this time.</p>
              <p>I stress again, that I think I have feelings for this man, but I love my husband more. And whenever I get frustrated with my marriage, when things dun go well, I think about how i wont be suffering that shit if I had married the other man instead.</p>
              <p>There are certain things, which he is superior to my husband in (he has much nicer parents and family, and a better family background), shit thing which I have to deal with my husband. So when my hubby's gross and disgusting family bug me, I think and reminiscence of other man and what could have been.</p>
              <p>It is possible to love two people. Don't you know that? It does not mean I love him more than I love my husband.</p>
              <p>But right now I'm wrack with guilt for loving another man while I'm married to and do love my hubby. I'm afraid other man's someone that I may never forget, or ever completely get over. He'll always have a special place in my heart. And he had been such an important emotional rock through the painful moments of my life for 8 yrs and made me laugh so much over 8 yrs, much of it was conducted online, even though we shared few actual moments in the same country doing things together.</p>
              <p>the fact that he couldn't carry on our unusual "affair" after he learnt that I was getting married, makes me want him even more cos it shows what an upright man he is.</p>
              <p>I know its stupid cos he wasn't even an official bf or someone I ever introduced to my friends as a bf yet when I think of him sometimes it makes me cry :```(  not official doesn't mean our feelings for each other were any less.</p>

              <p>No.. I never once took my husband as back-up. In fact, i believe I love my hubby more. hubby and I share so much meaningful experiences and been through more ups and downs together (although hubby and I got together only 3 yrs + ago). I feel that I understand my hubby better also, due to the fact that through the 8 yrs I knew the other man, he (other man) was not in Singapore most of these times. When we first met, he was studying in London and after he graduated, he worked in Dubai instead of coming home. We could never get together for real cos he's not here. I hardly spent any time with other man doing real activities like shopping, dining, groceries, errands.</p>
              <p>Our feelings for each other (me and other man) are gradually and very steadily built up over this long period of 8 yrs over conversations online.</p>
              <p>Who's to discount feelings and emotions felt in this manner? We certainly do not care for each other any less just because we weren't really physically together much of this time.</p>
              <p>I stress again, that I think I have feelings for this man, but I love my husband more. And whenever I get frustrated with my marriage, when things dun go well, I think about how i wont be suffering that shit if I had married the other man instead.</p>
              <p>There are certain things, which he is superior to my husband in (he has much nicer parents and family, and a better family background), shit thing which I have to deal with my husband. So when my hubby's gross and disgusting family bug me, I think and reminiscence of other man and what could have been.</p>
              <p>It is possible to love two people. Don't you know that? It does not mean I love him more than I love my husband.</p>
              <p>But right now I'm wrack with guilt for loving another man while I'm married to and do love my hubby. I'm afraid other man's someone that I may never forget, or ever completely get over. He'll always have a special place in my heart. And he had been such an important emotional rock through the painful moments of my life for 8 yrs and made me laugh so much over 8 yrs, much of it was conducted online, even though we shared few actual moments in the same country doing things together.</p>
              <p>the fact that he chose to end our unusual "affair" and relationship with each other after he learnt that I was getting married, makes me want him even more cos it shows what an upright and good man he is.</p>

              <p><br>The interesting part of a lady's perspective. A man who is upright is someone they are attracted to, yet, he becomes not upright if he decides to be with you. How paradoxical is that?</p>
              <p>Anyway, I once fell head over heels in love with a girl, that had a hot and cold relationship with me for 4 years, until I met my wifey. However, because it was hot and cold, there was always this strange yearning to see this girl again. I thought carefully to myself, and reasoned that it is closure that I needed, and told my wife that I needed to see this girl one last time.</p>
              <p>And so I went to meet this girl, and my heart finally shut down that yearning. It's like a chapter closed. It was just something about "What might have been?", and once I saw her again, and understood myself better, I never thought of her again.</p>
