              <p>Hi. A quick update.</p>
              <p>I am no longer interested or give a damn about this man.</p>
              <p>I managed to track him down through facebook. And found out he's a lying cheating scum. he's lame too, with a blog that has spelling mistakes and also found that he has a twitter account which is lame to the max with the most spastic tweets.</p>
              <p>I can't believe I fantasized about leaving my precious husband for this lying creep.</p>

              <p>I jus wonder if you had a kid with your hb, would things have been different? Imagine ur kid looking at you, bearing the same look as ur hb, would that make u crave for ur hb more? Im just wondering aloud because if u have something that reminds u of ur hb constantly, u probably wun have time to think of the other man.</p>
              <p>The other man always forms the solace grounds esp when thgs get negative/lonesome on this end of ur marriage, ie, the distance separating u and hb.</p>
              <p>i hope to encourage you on in ur marriage... jus think... out of so many people out here... u chose hb to be The One. Dun back out bcos of some trivial matters... these days, distance apart is compensated by internet. Control the mind and all would be well.</p>
              <p>There, you have my maiden post...the very first <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png"> Dun take life too seriously...its too short to be going backwards...onwards i hope you will go from now.</p>
