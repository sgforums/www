              <p>the guy sort of occupies a convenient place in your life,never

              <p>I would like to correct the following said: "For whatsoever reason, you didn't choose to have an exclusive
              relationship with this guy. He wasn't good enough for you on his
              own for you to take the leap to choose him - heck, you would only

              maybe you aren't that big a bait for him too!)"</p>
              <p>I did not have the choice of having an exclusive relationship with him. We were never in the same country physically. I'd highly dispute against "wasn't good enough" because he was most definitely was. We have a lot in common and I do believe if we met under different circumstances, we would be married.</p>
              <p>Yes I always tell and question myself, that if he had felt more for more, he would have "fought for me", and told me to not accept or to rescind the proposal back here and he would have agreed to meet me and flown back here and swept me off my feet. And he did not do that. Instead, he stood by and was ready to back off and let me get married.</p>
              <p>If I had meant more to him, he won't have minded or cared that we met in unusual circumstances or that he would have to explain to his friends how he met this girl whom he knew for so long but did not really meet.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>If I know the person is attached, I will be asking her to make a choice on who to choose. <br><br>I have worked many years overseas and have seen my japanese and korean colleagues having a wild time while their spouses are back in their home country. Due to the MCP nature of Japanese and Korean societies, the guys have their say. <br><br>I have given my commitment to the girl I love, from time to time my previous girls will look up for me. I will just chat with them for a while but I will not go any step further, such as meeting one-on-one with them or having too deep emotional attachment with them. It's dangerous. Once we get emotionally attached, it's easy for us to make the wrong moves once we are feeling down (e.g. having quarrels with our spouse). <br><br>Relationships have become more complicated in our modern society. It is even more important for us to keep our promise and trust to our another half. 30% of marriages in Singapore ended up in divorce and this is an upward trend. Will reach 50% just like the European countries in a few years. <br><br>In a relationship we will have to give and take, sometimes accommodating another half. Since we have to see through it till the end. If we bring in a third party, it will always end up in disaster. It is especially bad for ladies (as compared to men). Normally people are more forgiving to guys having affairs than to ladies. So before you give your promise to accept the other party and no one else, choose and decide wisely. Once you have decided, it's hard to break the commitments especially if there are children involved.</p></div>

              <p>I really don't know what you are thinking from your replies.</p>
              <p>On one hand, you say you love your husband, on the other hand, you say you have feelings for the guys. Accepted that we do have that circumstances where we fall in love with 2 person, however, you must keep in mind that you are already married. Unless you want to head for a divorce, then please do it quick.</p>
              <p>If you really love that guy, I believe you would have left your husband and went after him instead. </p>
              <p>Right now, you have already acknowledged all the "if he had done that" scenarios, you would have fled to the other end of the world with him. Please wake up, he did not do all these.</p>
              <p>Whether you want to start anew in your marriage with your husband or not, it all boils down to personal self-control. If you want, please cut off all contacts with that guy since you know he would be interfering your process of mending your love for your husband. If you don't, then please release your husband from being a future-cuckoo. </p>
              <p>Presently, if you husband knows about this post. He will be quite aware that he have married a shell without fillings. Not very fair to him since he have invested his future in you. Spare a thought for your husband. If you are selfish, then accumulate merits and separate from your husband.</p>
              <p>I might be harsh with my words, but from what you have posted, you sound as if you are using your husband as a back up for your emotional needs. </p>

I didn't like it either."</em></p>
              <p>This is what <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">hearing is all</span></strong> about.

              <p>This view should give you a clue to what you are
                  experiencing.</p>
              <p>You have been on that grass on the other side, and you saw that
                  the grass on this side is safer. So you chose this side and now
                  yearn for the other side.</p>
              <p>If you spend as much time with the other man as you spend
                  with your husband, you will also begin to quarrel with him (the
                  other man), and start thinking of the other man (your 
                  present husband).</p>
              <p>The feeling you have for the man is an erotic desire. And
                  this comes about when you are frustrated. Frustration comes about
                  when you do not get what you want. And this erotic desire present a
                  sensual pressure on your body and triggers your desire for
                  gratification, which is met  in the form memories and fantasy.
                  But it is not enough, you desire reality. This is compelling you to
                  act in the direction of re-living your unusual affair.</p>
              <p>Er... I suggest you indulge in some self gratification until
                  your husband comes back.</p>

              <p>Thanks for your advice. You made the most sense in the whole thread. I have been told by friends that I am revisiting the fantasy of this man due to my loneliness.</p>
              <p>Is it really? Perhaps. I believe other man and I are soulmates. he may be ashamed of his looks and thinks he's ugly but my feelings for him are so beyond appearances. we have the same faith and sense of humour and he's the only guy I know who recognises the breed of my pet immediately through a picture (I have a rare and unique pet), which none of my 'real' bf do, and he's a sagi (while I'm a leo) and we even have the same favorite number.</p>
              <p>I pray that I will run into him one day (perhaps in a work or social meeting) and achieve the closure I need. when I think of him now, I do feel quite hurt that he chose to forsake me the way he did and just ended our contact and "relationship" when he believed I was getting married.</p>

              <p>Thanks for your advice. You made the most sense in the whole thread. I have been told by friends that I am revisiting the fantasy of this man due to my loneliness.</p>
              <p>Is it really? Perhaps. I believe other man and I are soulmates. he may be ashamed of his looks and thinks he's ugly but my feelings for him are so beyond appearances. we have the same faith and sense of humour and he's the only guy I know who recognises the breed of my pet immediately through a picture (I have a rare and unique pet), which none of my 'real' bf do, and he's a sagi (while I'm a leo) and we even have the same favorite number.</p>
              <p>I pray that I will run into him one day (perhaps in a work or social meeting) and achieve the closure I need. when I think of him now, I do feel quite hurt that he chose to forsake me the way he did and just ended our contact and "relationship" when he believed I was getting married.</p>

              <p>I would like to correct the following said: "For whatsoever
                          reason, you didn't choose to have an exclusive relationship with
                          this guy. He wasn't good enough for you on his own for you to take
                          the leap to choose him - heck, you would only 'CONSIDER" choosing
                          him if he 'Fought for you'. (but he didnt! So maybe you aren't that
                          big a bait for him too!)"</p>
              <p>I did not have the choice of having an exclusive relationship
                          with him. We were never in the same country physically. I'd highly
                          dispute against "wasn't good enough" because he was most definitely
                          was. We have a lot in common and I do believe if we met under
                          different circumstances, we would be married.</p>
              <p>Yes I always tell and question myself, that if he had felt more
                          for more, he would have "fought for me", and told me to not accept
                          or to rescind the proposal back here and he would have agreed to
                          meet me and flown back here and swept me off my feet. And he did
                          not do that. Instead, he stood by and was ready to back off and let
                          me get married.</p>
              <p>If I had meant more to him, he won't have minded or cared that
                          we met in unusual circumstances or that he would have to explain to
                          his friends how he met this girl whom he knew for so long but did
                          not really meet.</p>

              <p>I've met people who met online living in different countries who decided to just take a risk, meet up, genuinely get to know each other and finally get married to each other.</p>
              <p>So both of you chose the safe and convenient option because what was more risky was not worth it enough for either of you to take the risk.And now that you have chosen a safer more convenient option, the allure of the risky choice doesn't get diminished because its the 'road not taken'</p>
              <p><br>You  have never been in the same country? That explains a lot about the perfection of your memories with this person. Less you meet, less conflict. You don't need to hear his snores, smell his farts, see him dig his nose or scratch his crotch. You don't need to live with his mother, put up with his sister, get pissed off with his pet dog.</p>
              <p>I'm not saying this person isn't a good friend. We all meet people whom we have chemistry with whether we are single or not. Doesn't mean everyone one you meet must end up being your life partner! (else really no time). Just because a person share your thoughts, your sense of humour or your interests, or your hobby - doesn't mean you got to LURRRVVEE him u know? millions of people out there - statistically speaking - soulmates aren't that rare. You can enjoy their company without thinking about infidelity ma.</p>
              <p>I mean, heng your soulmate happen to be a guy right? All you are worrying about is infidelity. Imagine if you meet a soulmate who happens to be a girl! then what? Consider being a lesbian too?</p>
              <p> I think you need some perspective in your 'relationship' with this person. To you, this 'relationship' is like a little secret romantic treasure, you cherished it, groomed it, fertilised it, invested emotions in it until it becomes something so important to you that you forget it never truly existed in 'real life'.</p>

              <p>do u know that 90% of the guys who is married still go to KTV, dates with other girls, ONS and so on after the so-called marriage is "stable"</p>
              <p>they relised that they only live one, so why don't go screw around.</p>

              <p>Marriage is not boring lah, people are, they go into it hoping to find somehting.  Of course, there is nothing there excepting what two persons bring in. When the emotional deposits and the emotional withdrawals dont <strong>balance</strong> there is bound to be chaos.</p>
              <p>It is only whether it is a question of quantity or quality. To cite egs is too much.</p>
              <p>Suffice to assume that the intelligent ones know what I am implying.</p>
              <p>As for this lady - I do not emphatize her husband but i do feel sorry for her that she utterly caught up in self-delusion game of so-called love when it is not love.</p>
              <p>As such, the inexorable is bound to happen - this is not wishing ill upon ... but how can one who is being accidental expect or wish to sustain a marriage with so many inner conflicts that are divisive. Also, the insidious habit of comparison is neurosis. Things can be compared - they are dead. How to compare a person - unless he/she is an entity, to be used and put aside and used again. If the latter is the case, then two persons are using each other - a buziness transaction. love is not business, life is not business.</p>
              <p>Like I mentioned earlier, many here have in many ways and via views/opinions offered suggestions, advice. To me, it gets filtered, it gets screened, it gets blocked - hearing what ONLY one wants to hear lah, reading ONLY what one ones to read.</p>

              <p>Thanks for your advice. You made the most sense in the whole thread. I have been told by friends that I am revisiting the fantasy of this man due to my loneliness.</p>
              <p>Is it really? Perhaps. I believe other man and I are soulmates. he may be ashamed of his looks and thinks he's ugly but my feelings for him are so beyond appearances. we have the same faith and sense of humour and he's the only guy I know who recognises the breed of my pet immediately through a picture (I have a rare and unique pet), which none of my 'real' bf do, and he's a sagi (while I'm a leo) and we even have the same favorite number.</p>
              <p>I pray that I will run into him one day (perhaps in a work or social meeting) and achieve the closure I need. when I think of him now, I do feel quite hurt that he chose to forsake me the way he did and just ended our contact and "relationship" when he believed I was getting married.</p>

              <p>Of course you would like to meet him again, thats quite natural. But take note that he did no wrong. From what you discribe him as, he seem to be an accomodating guy and humour you very well. If any, that is the fault.</p>
              <p>Your hurt stems from feeling like a fool. After sharing personal details, you feel you have a charge on him, and he owe you at least an explanation. That is on your part. On his part, he'll have to tell you himself. I think he will apologise and wish you well.</p>
              <p>Don't dwell on this matter too much. Your mind blowing it out of proportion.</p>
              <p>If you do meet him, try not to establish contact for future correspondence. Leave any meeting again to chance. Let your "unusual affair" be  just a pleasant memory from the past.</p>

              <p>Personal details?!</p>
              <p>From just what you said, I know in a second that you don't have the slightest handle over the extent of our interaction or entanglements with each other over the past 8 - 9 yrs.</p>
