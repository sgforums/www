              <p>You are your thoughts.</p>
              <p>What are you thinking of all the time? (Go ahead, think about your thoughts, what are they, how would you classify them etc)</p>
              <p>Are they not the cause of your "depression"? Aren't you thinking lousy thoughts about yourself automatically?</p>
              <p>When your thoughts are repetitive it will make you believe.</p>
              <p>To believe means to feel. When you believe in something, it show how you feel about that something.  Eg. When you sincerly believe a grand old tree can give you good fortune, you actually feel that that tree can give you luck. If you don't feel it, it means you really don't believe in it.</p>
              <p>What do you believe about yourself, that is another way of asking how do you feel about yourself. Depressed?</p>
              <p>It is how you think about yourself.</p>
              <p>It is difficult to change the way you think about yourself right away. You have had years of practice on the unhappy way, therefore it will take sometime to reverse the thought pattern. </p>
              <p>You don't kill an undesirable habit, you replace it with a good one. Repetition creates habits. So practice constantly in in thinking about your successes, however big or small. </p>
              <p>Your are a child of the universe, no less than the trees and the stars. You have a right to be here. Be kind to yourself.</p>
              <p>There is actually more good in you than bad. Dwell only on the good in your life. Till it becomes a habit, and you believe in it.</p>

              <p>If you can no longer take control of your situation, it is time you go see a psychiatrist. He would likely recommend some anti depression prescription. It works, I have seen some of my friends in depression undergo medication. So as long as they are in medication, their suicide and depressive thoughts are gone. At the same time, you should undergo therapy with a psychotherapist to find out the underlying reason for your depression and help you to tackle this. Talk to your parents about this and arrange for financing to pay for your medication.  </p>
              <p>This period is a crucial time for you. You will soon go to college and you can ill afford to do badly in your studies. Don't let your depression eat into you or else it would destroy your future. If you don't do well in your studies, it will affect your vocation in the future and you will end up one of the low earner in singapore struggling to make ends meet due to high prices and high competition from foreigners.</p>

              <p>In my mind there is only sad and misery of flashback in my life,i did not cherish the happy one.Why?</p>
              <p>i ask myself why being so unhappy why why why,there is simply no reason.Everyone life is their own life.Why why look at others,even though she is your twin so what.When she die or i die would it make any differences.No ,carry on with ur own life.</p>
              <p>Today my depression gotten over me again,i went to my granny house ate a bowl of noodle and walk off back home. embrassed myself and my family ,my mother.left them to explain my behaviour to everyone in my granny house.</p>
              <p>Horrible but staying over there pulling a long face i cant bear to show to everyone whom is so happy when they also have they own problem to face in life. i choose to walk off home. i choose i choose this kind of childish,self-centred decision.</p>
              <p>i think that having pimple on my face since sec 4 till now is part of the reason of my early stage depression.My face is like galaxy map ,like the world map.while my twin face is as clear as porcelain.</p>
              <p>it hurts me it hurts me when ppl asking the obvious "why is yoru face like that"</p>
              <p>WHOELSE CAN I ASK "WHY"</p>
              <p>i went to visit the doctor which prescibe me hormones pill to take.My face improve tremodously but teh side effect is depression and many ppl took the pill put on so much weight.I stop taking those pills.and hope to stay calm in teh mind and soul and that my face would heal naturally.</p>
              <p>i dont know why im writing silly long story of this.i just feel so miserable.</p>
              <p>i used to be such a happy person.Used to make sacarstic funny joke,but now everything come out of my mouth and heart is truth sacarstic thinking.It is like a demon is controllung me,when i know im the demon myself.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>should i stay away from my twin? i have not been sleeping  and eating. i feel so tired. i dont even know my reason of being sad.Everything Everything ,anything triggle my temper.</p>
              <p>when my twin talk about her love life i got so jealous,mad.when i see my sister art is amazing i go berserk.i lose my mind.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>.i wrote all you guys advises in the previous thread in a book to remind myself.I would really liek to thanks you guys for listening.</p>
              <p>i just want to write out my feeling to feel better.Happy chinese new year to everyone here.</p>

              <p><em>In my mind there is only sad and misery of flashback in my life,i did not cherish the happy one.Why?</em></p>
              <p>You have a concious mind and a sub-concious mind. The concious mind is the upper mind where you think out things  and do things. The sub-concious mind are those things that are at the inner level. This is where your automatic actions arise from. Your fear of snakes originates from the sub-conscious. Also your belief about yourself.</p>
              <p>The way thoughts go into your sub-consious mind is by repetition, and by emotions.</p>
              <p>Repeating a thought thousands of times, that thought will eventually sink into the sub-concious mind.</p>
              <p>It is much easier by emotions. A thought that rides on an emotion, get easy entry into the sub-concious.</p>
              <p>Therefore when your think about sad and miserable events of your life, it rides piggyback on the sad emotions  into your sub-concious.</p>
              <p>Thats why I ask you to focus on the good things of your life. Things that make you happy. The happy emotions will carry the thoughts into your sub-concious. It will take time. That is whats happening to your twin sister. Its her thoughts. You are your thoughts.</p>
              <p>One way to alter your thought pattern is to see the good points in others and comment on them. Give praise to others. No need to praise grand things, simple things will do. See someone with a nice dress, just say hey thats a nice dress. Hey you did a good job. Thank you, you are very kind. You will feel better for it. Go and apologise to your grandma, and thank her for the noodles. Being sarcastic or rude will make you  feel bad. Don't be affected by other people's rudeness, they are unhappy themselves. You don't have to join them.</p>
              <p>Don't get too upset about the pimples on your face, its a phase you will grow out of. Try a simple facial wash twice a day, and eat healthy food in moderation. Todays food are full of artifical stuff, and chemicals, and we are always eating them a little here a little there, at the end of the day we consume  quite a lot of chemicals.</p>
              <p>Eat more vegetables, fruits, and if possible take multi-vitamins supplement.</p>
              <p>Simpy put, get out of the habit of sad thoughts. Replace it with happy thoughts.</p>

              <p>You are going yoyo up and down. The only thing you can do is to talk to your family about your problem and ask your parents to arrange you to see a psychiatrist. Hurry there is no time to lose. The meds work in keeping your depression at bay. But you must go see a psychotherapist too, to discuss your problems.</p>

              <p>You cannot afford a psyhiatrist. The meds are very expensive. This is why you must talk to your parents so they can arrange a dr to talk to you. You need your parents help to finance your medicine.</p>
              <p>Your problem is too serious and you can no longer handle this yourself. The depression will come back.</p>
              <p>I don't think you will laugh off this situation when you are old because this illness will surely come back. At every moment of disappointment or unhappiness, will surely trigger your depression. You need medical help and professional consultation to tackle this illness. Depression is an illness and you need to treat it now ! Do not keep all this in your heart because this illness will surely eat you. You must tell your family and tell them that you need to see a doctor before it is too late. Do not be scared to share, be brave and let your family know.</p>

              <p>This is good news.</p>
              <p>The first step is understand yourself. Always remember you cannot undo years of negative conditioning in a few days or weeks. It may take months or years. Always be aware of your thoughts, don't let it run away uncontrolled.</p>
              <p>Sometimes you need to hold your thoughts, like you hold your breath. Stop the mind for a few seconds, and be rational, not emotional.</p>
              <p>You have only yourself to rely on, don't rely on others to praise and uplift you.</p>

              To think that I am clever does not make me clever, When i know that I am not clever, there is hope - most suffering is adding to what is not and of course it is not real
              In other words, one's  image of oneself has collapsed, outside people things, situations are mere excuses

              <p>You cannot heal yourself. You can only accept  yourself as you are and be at peace with yourself. You can be aware of your thoughts are check your reaction to them. At present your thoughts are  uncontrolled and invoke an unpleasant emotional reaction. With practice you can be in a state of awareness, with controlled thoughts.</p>
              <p>You need to check for tense muscles, and relax them, especially the shoulders and neck. Some how if these muscle group are relaxed your tend to be more in control of your thoughts. You will be more aware of your eyes seeing and your mind processing  the information received than having your thoughts running away amok.</p>
              <p>You cannot stop thinking, but you can use your mind productively. Thats why you should not be idle, for an idle mind is the devil's workshop.</p>
              <p>Do something, take up something, and don't mind the criticisms.</p>
