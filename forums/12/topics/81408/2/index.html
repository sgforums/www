Until one fine day, i give up totally.... The debts seems to never stop ending.....<br><br>But wat i feel that this guy doesn't appreciate what the gal has done for him. Think the gal should teach him a little lesson.... like ignore him for a while till he's really at the end of the road, then suddenly  returned and help him.... haha.. like a godsend from heaven... then he will learn.. ur friend must let him learn....<br><br>He's just way too pampered.....</div>

Luckily he came to his senses,  Became taxi driver to support the family. At least for her, it was worth hanging on &amp; supporting him cos basically he is a good husband.
