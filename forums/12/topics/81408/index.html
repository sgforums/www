The reason why he didn't cease gambling is because he wished to fuel and return to his 'original world' - where his ego is high beyond the current level he is in. The only method of showering and demonstrating love in his dictionary, is only to spend money on his gf.<br><br><strong>He knows nothing about simplicity</strong> and how love could still foster strongly without such act of expression. And the best part is that he never realise his gf had such good qualities - in which, if he has the wisdom to handle this crisis, this personal hurdle is one stage where their relationship would soar much higher and the bonds will steel stronger and deeper.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>The man started picking arguement with the girls over minor issue because he would have thought that she would mind his current status and became very sensitive with regards to her change in mood and character. But he didn't realise why because when a girl has to firm up and maintain the mascline role in the relationship temporary - she will be drained emotionally and spiritually. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ONLY APPRECIATION</span> can recharge her. He didn't gave her that battery - sparks will be common.<br><br>The one that suppose to fight the financial battle retreated, leaving his right-hand woman to fend for him - if his cash flow is already shaky, why does he still have his car?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> If he can't make the money - he could have reduce expenses to ease financial tension.<br><br>***<br><br>Love can be material pleasurable - love can also be simple. This guy stayed too long in his world of wealth that he never knew how fulfilling a relationship can still be when it is simple.<br><br>They always quarrel because of money? Two possible reasons:<br><br>I) If the relationship is born from money, it will end at money.<br><br>II) If both never realise the fruit of love is through the intention and behavior to overcome challenge as a couple - it will fall.<br><br>Now feelings has died and he has learn his mistake - does she wants to give him one final chance? Or move on with life after imparting the skills of appreciation and simplicity to him? She can only chose one of these options and not move and try to pull the truck - it will <strong>only</strong> hurt two parties.<br><br>Cheers</div>
