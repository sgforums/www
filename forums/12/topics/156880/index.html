            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>Im 18, and have left school this year after finishing 6th Form. My problem is that wherever i go, people get the inmpression that im a bit 'dosey' or dumb. I'm always mishearing things and making myself look stupid or clumsey infront of other people (this is especailly embarassing where i work)<br><br>I worry that people take the piss behind my back, as i know they take the piss out of other people behind their backs...<br><br>Its like im constantly having to remind myself, 'dont do anything stupid' all day long, but then my mind drifts and i forget and make myself look stupid again <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>I know its probably nothing really much you can do to help as its not your 'normal' everyday-problem, but can anyone advise me how to play it cool?<br><br>Would really appreciate some tips!<br><br>Thanks!<br><br>EDIT: Forgot to mention, i've only ever had this problem at work though...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hey can understand how you feel man. when I first came out to work in the society, I am always look stupid and blur because I am so afraid to talk to people and when people explain something to me, I was so afraid that I cant remember all and have to ask them again and again to repeat themself. I guess it all the nerve in my cells, too nervous and afraid to make mistakes. Giving ownself too much stress that decrease your working capability.<br><br>Its pretty normal to be like that because you are afraid to speak out for yourself. Being too tensed up could make you so stress that concentration on the day work became difficult.<br><br>Try to be yourself and relax. Appearing confident and being able to speak out for yourself will make people give more respect towards you. Dont be afraid to make mistakes cause everybody do that to learn more and more. Dun use words like Maybe, I think, its should be~~ etc. Be sure of yourself by saying That is, it is. When you give the impression that you know what you want, people wouldnt try to "bully" you.<br><br>And also nobody would talk behind your back, dun think too much ok. the reason for all is because you tend to think overmuch also. which cause all your stress and nervousness.</div>
