            <div class='col-md body'>give her time since she isn't ready.<br>Singlehood , at times is much better then being inside a relationship.<br><br>Maybe , to her , being in a relationship doesn't give her freedom , take things easy always.<br><br>If you trying to bind her , the more you try to bind her to your will , the more i think you should let her go , do note that you are chasing her back because you like her , but if she really doesn't wanna be with you ..etc , you should re-evaluate yourself , sure , it ain't easy to move on , but gradually , you should begin to discover those around you who truly deserves your love instead of her.</div>
