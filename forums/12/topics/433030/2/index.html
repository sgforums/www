              <p><br>Sure, u can go into xbox live, meet lots of friends to challenge, then when meet up, got lots of thing to talk about, so is playing PS on line, so exciting. Study also shown that Games are good for health and also good for people to be active and engaging, it also teach people to think wisely and outwit each other in a friendly manner.</p>

              <p>You r not what you are, you are merely an illusion fated in a way that you are here and figure your way out of here. The laws of relativity determine your future in relation to you action and the enviroment condition. Moving in one direction in life can be diseastrous if that is the only direction you choose, i recommend you choose a few direction more or less in a way similar and move along, in life, you must allow option and choices, many who chose one direction and when failed to reach, end up suffer from deep depression. Let your life be given a choices, be optimistic and allow failures</p>
