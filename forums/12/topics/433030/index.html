              <p>Hi. im sorry if this type of problem becoming cliche but im just want to let it out and need some of your advice. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4 years ago i was quite lonely. I only have my school friends which is normal but we dont really hangout, Just a hi and bye situation.</p>
              <p>3 years ago was the best year ever. I started to get to know my friends from work and he intro me to his friends and sooner or later, we all are like big family. We all hang out here and there almost everyday. Totally best. As time pass by, few of our groups starts to fall. 4-5 of them went to NS. another few of them got into r/s and some into overseas studies. And we're left like with only 3 people. Due to the numbers, we met like once every 2 months or so and i started to get this lonely feeling again.</p>
              <p>2 years ago was the last year i met up with those 2. As one of them going overseas and another went to NS. I was at home for like more than 4 months. It was really awkward and i feel sad inside. I went across some of my old friends blogspot and all of them have their group of friends and have their own life. I feel envy and sad. </p>
              <p>A year ago, my school friends sent me an invite for a old time gathering. Obviously i go and i never felt so joyful and free. one of them actually ask me out to go with them for a movie and meet up with other of her friends. I accepted it. We all hang out once a week. As months go by, we didnt hang out anymore because she stop msging. So i msg her that she wants to hangout and she replied she's now busy with her project and relationship. I cant hang out with her friends anymore because it be awkward if i go there without her around. </p>
              <p>And now... now i feel lonely again. Is this sort of thing is fated? am i really destined to be alone?</p>

              <p>Mate, finding a "partner" might not fill that void. It can make things worse. Two lonely folk coming together means more problems, not less.</p>
              <p>Life can suck, but you are not alone in your predictament. That you'd come forward and make yourself vulnerably on this forum takes courage and I applaud you for that. It also means you would have enough courage to do volunteer work - find a local orphanage, old age home, donate bloot etc - there are folk who desperately need you, believe it or not, and for good reason too.</p>
              <p>As for your fair weather friends, they can go fxxk themselves. You're nobody's booty call and in your volunteer work you should be able to meet sincere, selfless like minded folk - these would make better birds of feather.</p>
              <p>Godspeed soldier.</p>

              <p>As what Loor say, friends come and go. When all our friends get married and have kids, they surely don't have time to hang out with you. That is the cycle of life, if you are left out from the cycle, you have to find new friends. It is not so easy because if you are 27 and all your friends are already married, you have to go back to your old cycle and mix with people who are 24 or 25. Where are you going to find people like that? Your school friends are same age with you. Your work colleagues mostly are married. So that is why important not to miss the cycle.</p>
              <p>Nothing wrong with finding a life partner. It is a journey worth the risk. Boyfriend can hurt but eventually will find the right one. If sit on it, no use, person will find it hard to find someone.</p>
