            <div class='col-md body'>Not sure if I should post here. But here goes.<br><br>Wanted to organise birthday dinner few weeks before my birthday. Was initially set, confirmed. With A, B, C. Then suddenly 2 days before the date, A said she was busy. 1 day before, B said he was busy. The bloody 15 mins after the supposed meeting time, C said he was busy. So in the end? All pang seh. Nvm... lucky I was in a forum outing. So had dinner with the forum people.<br><br>Earlier this week, wanted to org again. So one again sms same people. Once again, all said busy. Except A. So nvm, I sms other people. D comes into the picture. As A and I were close friends.. She wanted to "celebrate" on the BBQ our organisation was planning. I said, I rather have a small quiet dinner with close friends than a loud event with many people I'm not close with. She said okay. So she called me, and said her bf will be coming, since she thought will be only 2 of us. I said no, there will be someone else. Then one day, suddenly she said she and her bf would be able to make it for the dinner. Even set the date for me? I was like "wtf" liao, since I don't know the bf very well. I had already told her i wanted a close dinner. Then I hinted A &amp; D not to bring xtra people. Since i wanted to spend my special day with close friends.<br><br>Our grp had BBQ few days ago, but I missed it because I overslept (didnt sleep previous night). When I woke up, still blur blur, I suddenly remembered the bbq. If I were to rush down immediately, it would had ended, so i smsed her, said I'm sorry, I cant make it.<br><br>Groggily, I saw the msg, she asked me what I meant by bf can't come. But I deleted it. few days later, I asked again, since D and confirmed and I wanted to reserve seats liao. Then suddenly she got angry "y shld i reply ur qns when u didnt reply mine".<br><br>Then... die liao. Small arguement. She sounded angry, ask me why bf cant go. Then I said very clearly i wanted to spend dinner with close friends, since I considered it very important, for me, to spend special day with my close friends. Didn't reply for few hours, until I got a sms, said she'll "think about it".<br><br>Well, I really don't know how to settle this case.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i just seriously feel that there's a communication breakdown over here.<br><br>i know you may find the bf an obstacle because the bf doesn't know anyone besides A and A may be spending the night entertaining him instead. but even if this may be the outcome, what really matters is their presence am i right?<br><br>sometimes we just got to give and take. because you wanted to have a 'close friends' gathering so badly, you screwed up badly. and don't think that A wouldn't hold any grudges against you for not turning up during the BBQ with a simple sorry because you already left a bad impression on her recently. overslept is an excuse yes. but the main point is that you didn't turn up.<br><br>why don't you try calling A to clear this mess up. i believe if its just friends you're asking for, she wouldn't be so 'ji jiao'.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Some friend I have.<br><br>I ask her for grp dinner, then suddenly become she org for me? Its like I already told everyone about it. Then she suddenly organise or me with the bf? Say want to treat me, so I kindly rejected, said wanted dinner with close frens. Then kena scolded, say why i treat the bf as stranger, and go personal attack me. Never reply for like more than 24hrs when i wanted to reserve seats, so sked her to call me, confirm asap. Then said I ws pestering her. If you're reading this let me get this clear. I already told u countless times I wanted dinner with close frens.  Like, once our friend's wedding, he invited you and your family, but not me. I didn't make any noise because it's for colse friends. And it's bloody fvcking rude to force someone to invite someone to dinner. Basic etiquette.<br><br>Some friend I have?</div>
