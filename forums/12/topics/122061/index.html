Pretending that someone gave you a jigsaw puzzle when you in fact made it yourself is erm, quite sad.<br><br>Maybe you should talk to her about it? Or better yet, find her a bf.  </strong><br><br>I kind of agree with what Shimmer said. I think your sister is suffering from some acute attention deficit. She's craving for attention.<br><br>Lets see, she pretends she has an imaginary bf(to let others know she's attached.) There are a few things i can guess here...<br>1) She's trying to avoid the attention of her persuers (40%)<br>2) She's trying to let pple know she's cool, and has a bf. (70%)<br>3) She really thinks she has a bf (30%)<br>4) She idolises you, and wants to do everything you do.<br><br>Anyways, do have a good chat with her, spend an hour or two to talk out the problem you have with her, and the problems she's facing. I think its something only a big sister can do...<br><br>Good Luck<br>Aaron<br></div>
