            <div class='col-md body'>given the benefit of doubt i assume that you and your sis give your mum due respect and all. your mum might be cursing your sis <strong>maybe</strong> because she was an accidental child?<br><br>than again maybe your mum has to face "sh!t" at work everyday and has to face more "sh!t" when she comes home such as cooking for the family, doing the housework, etc. and life goes on and on as a routine for her. or maybe she's just fustrated thinking why hasn't the good karma come yet? or maybe it could be some weird reasons tts running through her mind that we might not know? since the age gap between you and her are pretty big.<br><br>and judging from your financial status, your dad fetches your mum from work ( i assume your dad owns a car ). i assume its going on fine and furthermore with you supporting yourself. just take time off to talk to her and ask her if she's facing any problem at work or perhaps talk to your granny! well.. as the saying goes, mother knows best!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
