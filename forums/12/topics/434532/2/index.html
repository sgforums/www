              <p>I do not agree wif your opinion. There are good girls and not
                                      very good girls. I have met girls who want me to chase
                                      after them, until so little progress, but I have also met
                                      girls who like me so much that we just match so perfectly - I don't
                                      have to work so hard, just one phone call, and we both become
                                      bf/gf.</p>
              <p>Question is: do you want to chase an exhibitionist? or do you
                                      want to chase someone who likes you?</p>
              <p>The first is a waste of time because she is not interested in
                                      you. She just want to draw you in to chase after her to
                                      increase her market value.</p>
              <p>The second is priceless. Because she will swoon all over you,
                                      and all you have to do is to make a phone call. The rest...you
                                      leave it to fate. Most of my girlfriends fall in this category...I
                                      only go after those who are interested in me.</p>

              <p>I used to be good at courting girls at school. I've come across many who just want to be chased after. However, after some time, I felt the relationship is not surreal. The relationship is not have strong foundations. Now I have matured, I instead seek more serious relationships that is build up from friendships.</p>
              <p>I somehow don't think the girl is really interested in TS. She looks like she wants TS to go after her and she wants to make it look so revealing for everybody to see. If she really likes TS, she would give him serious thought and consideration, not playing hard to get. I think if TS go out in the open to be pursue her, she is going to make TS beat around the bush with no credible results. In the end, she just feel better about herself, her market value up at TS's expense.</p>
              <p>Sometimes even when pretty chio bu really really like the guy (of course he is financially stable, hansom, etc, etc), she would give him a lot of cues and make it more easier to go after her. If the pretty chio bu not very like the guy, she just place him under WIP and make it a lot more harder to chase after her, without rejecting him outrightly, as this help boost her market value and also there are other reasons such as maybe she doesn't want to hurt his feelings or maybe she want more guys to chase after her.</p>
              <p>Over the years, I changed my approach. Instead, I go after the ladies who truly like me for who I am. How? Usually it be someone whom I befriended. We build up our friendship from there. And then when the feeling is strong enuf, we agree to move on our relationship to more serious one.</p>

              <p>What is going on in the head of the girl, is that of a girl in a class. She is on her own.</p>
              <p>TS  is just one of the boys in her class. Nothing special.</p>
              <p>Its just that TS is over excited by ordinary happenings in a class, and start imagining and blowing things up.</p>
              <p>Nothing wrong with that, except that every idea must be followed by action. Otherwise the idea is just a dream.</p>

              <p>I think the problem with your past failures are due to maturity in the girls you chased after.</p>
              <p>Your reluctance to accept failures, prompts you to take the safer route... via your "friends pool". While you up your success rate this way, you are also taking a bigger risk of losing your other friends if the relationship does not work out.</p>
              <p>Typically I don't date within my "friend pool". If a guy falls under "friend" category.. it's very much because there was no chemistry between us.</p>
              <p>I'm not saying you are wrong, just saying the safest route only ensures less chance of failing.. you are also missing out on better potential mates out there.</p>
              <p>IMO. You're settling within a safe zone. After a while, you'd be looking outside for greener pastures.</p>
              <p>For young people like you, don't be afraid to be adventurous. Trying and failing is part of the learning process, you will eventually learn to discern who's genuine and who's playing you.</p>
              <p>Besides, there's a reason why you like a girl.. so go live it.</p>
