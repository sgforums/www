              <p>There is this girl, who is my classmate at school. I grew to like her. During recess I take opportunity to try to chit chat with her. Recently there is this other guy, who always go around and mix with the girls. He give this girl, I like, a lot of attention; he is very helpful, like to help the girls carry book. One day, I ask her if she would be interested to discuss homework with me, she said yes. But then, we never follow through, because she never brought it up and me, just to shy to continue. But this guy, when we were in the class, he said he is going back home and wanted to escort her back home. To my surprise, she said "yes". I was there and heard everything.</p>
              <p>What should I do? Should I also pursue her? But I don't want to make a scene. I don't want to fight this guy for her hand. Is she trying to make us both compete for her? If this is true, I just don't feel good about it because I don't feel it is genuine. I want to be with someone, I like and she like me too. Not somebody who look at relationship like a "sports".</p>
              <p>So what should I do?</p>

              <p>the girl is trying to act like the big sister/most popular girl in school.</p>
              <p>by being a wimp and want things to happen in shush shush quiet no one knows way, she will never ever consider u.</p>
              <p>in my opinion, this type of girls are more interested in those guys that are as popular as her, and also loud or joker types that will get people's attention in school to make her feel like she is on top of the world.</p>

              <p>Then you should ask her for her opinion.</p>
              <p>Make things clear once and for all so you do not need to make any more wild guesses.</p>
              <p>She agreed to discuss hw alone with you, but on the other hand agreed to be escorted by another guy home. Too confusing to predict anything, just ask her.</p>

              <p>I do not agree wif your opinion. There are good girls and not very good girls. I have met girls who want me to chase after them, until so little progress, but I have also met girls who like me so much that we just match so perfectly - I don't have to work so hard, just one phone call, and we both become bf/gf.</p>
              <p>Question is: do you want to chase an exhibitionist? or do you want to chase someone who likes you?</p>
              <p>The first is a waste of time because she is not interested in you. She just want to draw you in to chase after her to increase her market value.</p>
              <p>The second is priceless. Because she will swoon all over you, and all you have to do is to make a phone call. The rest...you leave it to fate. Most of my girlfriends fall in this category...I only go after those who are interested in me.</p>
