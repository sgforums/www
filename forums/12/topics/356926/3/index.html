              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Just to clarify, I am 22 this year, in a local uni.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I got to know this girl in <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">January</span></strong>. She is in one of my weekly classes but we take <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>different</strong></span> but equally demanding courses. We are groupmates.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Some basic facts/problems:</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span><span>1)<span>     </span></span></span> She is <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>most likely single</strong></span>( her facebook profile) and from conversations with her and her frens, there is nothing to suggest that she is attached. And we shd proceed on the assumption that she is not.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt 0.25in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span><span>2)<span>     </span></span></span> I noticed that in many one on one photos that she took with guys, the guy had his hand on her shoulder. However, the problem is that the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>guy in the photos are always different</strong></span>. In other words, perhaps(fortunately) she does not have a superb close relationship with any guy yet.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span><span>3)<span>     </span></span></span> She has many frens(both guys and gals), both within and outside sch. <span> </span>I noticed that sometimes one or two guys tend to tease her by pulling her hair when they spring from behind. She did not seem to object.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span><span>4)<span>     </span></span></span> Currently, on a scale of 0-10(0 being total strangers and 10 being the best of friends), I would rate the level of closeness between us as 7. <span> </span>During exam period, I do join her for study sessions with her group of frens (both guys and gals included). I even had the opportunity to have lunch with her on a couple of occasions. We talk about almost everything, but mainly sch work, mutual frens and family.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span><span>5)<span>     </span></span></span> We do not really exchange smses on a daily basis. But <span> </span>I try to sms her occasionally iust to keep in touch. But sometimes I noticed she may not reply my smses( I do not ask qns that intrude on her privacy though).</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span><span>6)<span>     </span></span></span> I am not aware of any competitors as of yet. But this might be due to the fact that I do not spend enough time with her to know who is always with her (different courses, timetables and schedules). Recently though, <span> </span>when I chanced upon her in sch, she mentioned that she was on her way to meet a male fren(for reasons unknown). She even told me who that guy was but perhaps that was because I also know that guy although not very close.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">7) Recently, i faced some pressing personal issues. I called her to talk to her and she did say that I can call her anytime to talk about them. But I am quite sure that because of her very nice character, she would have told any other relatively good guy fren the same if they were faced with similar problems.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span><span>8)<span>     </span></span></span> As mentioned before, both of us are quite busy students but I will definitely find some time for her if I do commit to this relationship.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span><span>9)<span>     </span></span></span> <span> </span>I have not been in any previous relationships before and I think the same can be said of her( facebook and Friendster testimonials/comments). The reason why I am attracted to her is because I think she is quite attractive but most importantly she has the qualities that I would like in a potential gf/spouse.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">So now, I am hesitant about going all out to go after her. This is due to the fact that I am not very comfortable with points 2 and 3. But then again, could I be too old-fashioned and conservative? Does points 2 and 3 mean anything? Or just the guys trying to get fresh? On a side note, is it a trend for guys to do that(teasing and placing arms on shoulder) in a 1 on 1 photo, even when the girl is not their gf ? And would most girls just consent to such actions?</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I would appreciate any sensible and well-intentioned advice on whether I should make my move. Thanks in advance!!</span></p>

              <p><br>Actually she doesn't mind guys pulling her hair right now because she's still young.</p>

              <p>I would have loved to ask her face to face too, bit unfortunately there is no opportunity for me to do so. As alluded earlier, I am still facing some personal issues, hence I will not be going to sch soon, on vacation now. So no chance to see her and ask her personally.</p>
              <p>Well, where to go? Good question.  Lol. Initially I thought I won't ask u all this question but since you mentioned, I  would gladly welcome any good suggestions since my idea of a first date would be a movie followed by a meal? Which is rather boring I thought? But I mean that is the typical first date right? Then subsequently can do other stuff such as sports? Then when more comfortable then like walk in the park/beach? Any one can offer a better suggestion for a first date?</p>

              aware of any competitors as of yet. But this might be due to the
              fact that I do not spend enough time with her to know who is always
              with her (different courses, timetables and schedules). Recently
              though, <span> </span>when I chanced upon her in sch,
              she mentioned that she was on her way to meet a male fren(for
              reasons unknown). She even told me who that guy was but perhaps
              that was because I also know that guy although not very
              close.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">7)
              Recently, i faced some pressing personal issues. I called her to
              talk to her and she did say that I can call her anytime to talk
              about them. But I am quite sure that because of her very nice
              character, she would have told any other relatively good guy fren
              the same if they were faced with similar problems.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span><span>8)<span>     </span></span></span> As mentioned
              before, both of us are quite busy students but I will definitely
              find some time for her if I do commit to this
              relationship.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span><span>9)<span>     </span></span></span> <span> </span>I have not been in any previous relationships
              before and I think the same can be said of her( facebook and
              Friendster testimonials/comments). The reason why I am attracted to
              her is because I think she is quite attractive but most importantly
              she has the qualities that I would like in a potential
              gf/spouse.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">So now, I am hesitant about going
              all out to go after her. This is due to the fact that I am not very
              comfortable with points 2 and 3. But then again, could I be too
              old-fashioned and conservative? Does points 2 and 3 mean anything?
              Or just the guys trying to get fresh? On a side note, is it a trend
              for guys to do that(teasing and placing arms on shoulder) in a 1 on
              1 photo, even when the girl is not their gf ? And would most girls
              just consent to such actions?</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I would appreciate any sensible and
              well-intentioned advice on whether I should make my move. Thanks in
              advance!!</span></p>

              <p>I would have loved to ask her face to face too, bit
              unfortunately there is no opportunity for me to do so. As alluded
              earlier, I am still facing some personal issues, hence I will not
              be going to sch soon, on vacation now. So no chance to see her and
              ask her personally.</p>
              <p>Well, where to go? Good question.  Lol. Initially I thought
              I won't ask u all this question but since you mentioned,
              I  would gladly welcome any good suggestions since my idea of
              a first date would be a movie followed by a meal? Which is rather
              boring I thought? But I mean that is the typical first date right?
              Then subsequently can do other stuff such as sports? Then when more
              comfortable then like walk in the park/beach? Any one can offer a
              better suggestion for a first date?</p>

              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">Yah, as I mentioned in my first thread, I have not been in a relationship before. First time I am trying to date a girl, so inevitably will have almost no experiences. Haha, so really need some suggestions from all those who are experienced.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">Well, I am actually not very confident. Somehow I think although she definitely does not dislike me, I very much doubt she has a liking for me as well. Although I think now she probably suspects that I am interested. But so far she has not really given me any obvious indication/hint whether the feeling is mutual. <span> </span>Maybe a conservative estimate of my own chances are like 50%?</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">Thanks to Lorry', Earlneo and Man that can't be moved for your suggestions. Actually I tried calling a few times but there was no answer. I also discovered that she is very active, the type of  girl who does not mind the sun. So means I should like ask her to go for sports activities? </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">Fugazzi, can you kindly elaborate  on what you mean?</span></p>

              <p>simple eg, u are having a plate of chicken rice in a coffee shop A <span style="text-decoration: underline;">NOW</span>, u are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">thinking</span> of the chicken rice that tasted so good in coffeeshop B that u had <em>a few days</em> ago(the past), or comparing or <em>yearning for</em> char kuay teow on another plate nearby to ur seat and wondering if it will taste better(<span style="text-decoration: underline;">looking into the future</span>), Now the chicken rice in front of u - though its being consumed lacks taste, lacks .... its an expereince that is adulterated by the past/future lar.</p>

              <p><br>Hi, BotaHead, I appreciate your well-intentioned caveat. But I think you may not have read my first thread thoroughly enough? While we may not be good friends yet, we are definitely more than just hi-bye friends. Perhaps somewhere close to good friends stage?</p>
              <p>Anyway, I did try asking her out for a movie when i called her just now and she agreed in principle(details not finalised yet), but i think it is a good start. Will call her next week to confirm details. Really hope she would not have any last minute stuff.</p>

              <p>.........how bout a call?</p>
              <p>1. Can get to listen to her voice.</p>
              <p>2. Get more confirmation.</p>
              <p>3. All in all, I still think it's better than asking over msn or through sms lor.</p>
              <p><strong>SMS</strong> - good for shy people, just type type type will do, but then she might miss it (as in replying), or dilly-dally in replying, etc.</p>
              <p><strong>MSN</strong> - good if you want instant replies, but then she might be talking to other people at the same time too and might not be thinking much about your invitation (thats what i think), like paying much attention. And as far as i could rem, shes prob a very friendly and open girl, so i guess she must have many chatting partners at the same time too, and not just to you alone. So many ple to entertain. </p>
              <p><strong>Phone</strong> - good as in, she pays attention to you more (if she isnt doing anything at that point of time la.. and is free from everything) .... and also, you can get to talk to her about other stuffs, not just regarding the invitation only.</p>

              <p>Well, as already mentioned, she has agreed in principle to a date.  But for the follow-up to confirm details, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>should I still call or sms will do</strong></span> since she has already agreed? Cos my sis cautioned that calling someone may actually put a lot of pressure on that person, esp if she is busy, thus annoying that person.</p>
              <p>Furtheremore, I thought a call would be weird. clos if i call and straight away ask " remember that we have a movie date" etc, isn't it like very abrupt? How do I avoid this? By asking how have she been the past few days and other random stuff and then towards the end remind her about the date?</p>
