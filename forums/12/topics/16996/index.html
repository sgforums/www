Anyway you wouldnt believe me till you try it out yourself.  E-mail me weesiong.oh@astralmag.com if you are keen.</div>

Hmmm..maybe u cant make it and gave up in your previous attempt in other network marketing company just becos u faced some minor problems like....cant close deal and feel that u wont succeed??<br><br>There r pple who can make it and similarly there r pple who cant make it.  But i can say that those who cant make it r those who gave up and quit, that's why they cant make it.  If they can overcome all the obstacles, they can be successful.  U know why? becos there r pple who can succeed.  Why cant u?<br><br>Just go and imagine, let's say Devil1976 get to know a network marketing company and he wanted to join the company.  But becos of your posting/words, he gave up this idea...and similarly, let's say Devil1976 has got a fren who join another network marketing company and 10 yrs down the road, Devil1976's fren succeed in life, he got what he wanted in life that what normal job cant offer him nor the $ he can earn.<br><br>Obviously Devil1976's dreams r being shattered by what u have done.  And guess what u will say??? "i was only joking mah, why u take it so seriously" What i wanna say is....comments r free..but opportunity is not.  some pple didnt even encounter such opportunity b4...and some dun even know its an opportunity when they encounter.<br><br>Ever wondered why some pple who only been thru pri sch or didnt have proper education can actually earn 5 figure income per mth? Becos they believe in themselves.  They believe they can succeed in life and achieve what they wan in life and know what they r heading for.<br><br>For me, i strongly believe that my company, Astral Mag can offer and provide me what i wan in life...which i can never get at any other places.</div>
