She could be giving you serious hints, on the other hand she might also be just playing you out for it... There could be MANY reasons WHY a woman would wanna do that. But from the way you'd described her, I won't be surprised.<br>The FACT that you're IN LOVE with her DRAG you in DEEP... Don't be CONFUSED by your emotions, learn to control it a bit... (Well.. Earlier said than done? ~Sigh...) Your LOVE would only be MEANINGFUL if the other party APPRECIATES it... IF the other party ACCEPTS it, it MIGHT turn out to be FRUITFUL... IF the other party REJECTS it, it would not be in all sense that 'meaningful'.... BUT if the other party PLAYS with it.... That's a TORMENT.... WAKE UP my friend...<br>It's OBVIOUS, you feel the TORMENT.... It's OBVIOUS, you SMELL the FISH.... It's just your own UNCERTAINTY... And ALOT of BLIND HOPE toying you around.... You're FLOATING around... You need to SETTLE DOWN just like Klactovak had suggested...<br><br>ALOT would depends on yourself... I can OFFER you a ROUGH GAUAGE of the SITUATION if you're really that DESPERATE and INTERESTED.... E-mail me at Devil1976sg@yahoo.com But back to SQUARE ONE.... ALOT still depends on yourself...?<br><br>PS. Other than SURFACE INCOMPATIBILITY mentioned in my earlier post, your INDECISINESS also render you a 'HANDICAP' for this relationship... If you step into it, MOST PROBABLY it's NOT gonna be a WISE choice.... DON'T keep indulging yourself in the SAME SHIT of how much I LOVE HER and such... But this is LIFE... LOVE is just a part of it... I told you MOST PROBABLY there's gonna be a WALL in front of you... IF you INSIST on BANGING into it, I've got NO CHOICE... To say the least I won't be bother, it's YOUR LIFE... I'd SAID ENOUGH... Unless there're gonna be some MAJOR CHANGES in the SITUATION or UNDERSTANDING of the SITUATION (which is UNLIKELY...), TURN AROUND... DON'T be a FOOL... You'll face GREATER CHALLENGES in your life....<br><br>------------------<br>In LIGHT I shall FEAR NOT. FOR what I AM is CUT so DEEP inside of ME.<br>I LIVE my FLESH and SOUL ONLY to BLEED for the OTHERS.<br>FEAR ME NOT. FOR I AM YOUR 'MASTER'. GIVE YOU STRENGTH. FOR YOU ARE MY 'ENEMY'.<br>DEVIL PHRASE I<br><br>I have no 'friends' nor 'family'.<br>I hold no past and see not future...<br>These are just samples of illusions....<br>I don't exist, but I shall live ETERNITY.....  DEVIL PHRASE II<br><br>Though NOT the RIGHT thing to do,<br>This might be the ONLY NATURAL thing to be...<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Just like heat</span> is produced when work done...<br><span style="font-style: italic;">EVIL</span> is the GENERATION of SYSTEM FLAWS... <strong>DEVIL PHRASE III</strong><br><br>In DREAMS you CAN NEVER DIE.....<br>For YOUR LIFE is about the EXISTENCE of....<br>Your Happiness.... Your Sadness... Your Pain.... Your Pleasure....<br>Like a painted sky, when it rains... All CEASE to BE...    DEVIL PHRASE IV<br><br>When Law &amp; Rules are there,<br>they are NOT about JUSTICE.<br>While reality &amp; dreams are there,<br>they are NOT about SURVIVAL..<br><br>And Life &amp; Death NOT about LIVING...<br>Good &amp; Evil NOT about definitions....<br><br>IF truly there is EVIL, it is NOT just one of its kind......<br><br>DEVIL'S SEVENTH PHRASE<br><br>ÃŸe COOL, NOT sÂ¢rrÂ¥....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>She hint me all sorts of questions again yesterday night, &amp; I know that she will come out with the final question soon. True enough she asked me:"Don't tell me you have likings for me??". I drag the answers abit but finally gave her a YES!! She claims to be shock, but I know that she realised that long time ago. She also asked me is it since last time?? I did not answer her question.<br>However she did not tell me much things &amp; says that it will remain the same. Before she come out with the questions, she also mentioned that she prefers to talk to someone purely as friends &amp; no intention of wooing her &amp; she feels more comfortable that way. She said that when she talks to guys on the phone &amp; the guys has got intentions, she will avoid him &amp; will not talk on the phone so much.. to avoid misunderstanding..<br>Anyway I am right that the answers I get at this moment is a negative answer. I wasn't disappointed at all because I already had the answer in my mind. I asked her just to get myself convinced. Anyway, I will not give up just because she rejected me. I am going to climb to the end of the ladder to see if she comes to me.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Went out with the girl the day before, &amp; things seems to have changed.. She tends to tell me more things which she don't previously do. &amp; no one around us does know that we chat through the night everyday without fail.. I felt more relax &amp; relieve after letting her know that I like her.. &amp; I feel that communication is much easier between us. She even tell me things that no one knows about it, &amp; she told me the reason why she didn't tell anybody about it..<br>However, one problem is .. that whenever her BF called when I am out with her &amp; some friends, my mood will change.. even her friends can smell the jealousy.. She knows that I am jealous... She asked me: " Isn't it terrible for you, listening to me talking about me &amp; my BF? If it is so, then next time I dun tell U lor.. dun wanna u to feel like that mah." Though it breaks my heart when she talks about her BF, I still want to know where the go, what they do. There  are times where it really breaks my heart terribly but I still listen to her talks.<br>Now after confessing to her about my likings for her, she didn't avoid me though. She still wants me to treat her the same way which I do... She is rather afraid to make me angry even though I do not get angry with her... Seriously, I do get disappointed in her sometimes...<br>You guys must be thinking that I should just let go of her &amp; get someone else. But to me, it's rather difficult to find a girl of the same hobby, lifestyle as me.</div>
