Until I realised that there's more to life than just BGR....<br>Why do you think I'm discouraging him...? Hmm... Because he might be too young to handle this relationship, he might be too inexperienced to handle this relationship, she might be too childish to handle her relationship with him, he knows he can't handle the relationship &lt;- So he's either that or not confident enough to handle the relationship, chances are she's just out to play him around (while he's there to be played around...), he's in pain, there're most probably no future to this relationship... Even if by slim chance there is... It's gonna happen not in the near future, meanwhile he should go get something better to do... Because she's not really what he wants but just what he thought he wants (he can't take things easily...)... This is NOT a LOVE RELATIONSHIP... This is a SINGLE-SIDED WILLINGNESS... Sooner or later he would have to wake up.... Or RISK facing MORE SHIT and IF he really gets into the relationship... Congratulations... RISK facing the NIGHTMARE....<br><br></div>
