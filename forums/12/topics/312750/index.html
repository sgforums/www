              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">- Not exactly. If you have common topics to talk about, at least it couldn't turn out awkward.What i could do, is send occasional humourous sms to tell them that they are rememebered.</span></p>
              <p>2)Tried toking to them on msn but nvr reply sometimes. Realised nth much to say le. I always start off wif ''how's life'' and the standard responses are like ''fine'', ''ok lah, as usual''.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">- Working life is really tiring. Don't expect too much sometime.</span></p>

              </div>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">- Yes. Friends or lifewise, people come and go. There is a renewal friendship cycle. For friendship that remain dormant for years, can be resparked again. As you move on from another stage of life, you will also meet new people and make new friends.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">It always take two to play a game of badminton. If the receiver does not want to continue, then you shouldn't waste too much energy and time on it.</span> <span style="color: #3366ff;">How to be popular ? I think having the confidence and sincereity is very important. At the end of the day,  just be yourself.</span></p>

              <p>yup. face it, friends come and go in life. during the time of friendship, it might feel like you guys are gonna be friends for life. but thats might not be the case.</p>
              <p>we all walk through this journey of life alone. but its the people we meet along the way that keeps us company. some might choose another path from you at some point or some might just fall behind. but there will always be someone walking by your side as your friend and every once in awhile, someone new will come along. so just suck it up and accept it.</p>
