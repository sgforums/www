            <div class='col-md body'>its loss that makes u hurt, not love.<br><br>I think everyone will go through the kenna dump feeling. But if you also one day realises you are in a failing relationship and you can tell regardless of how much this person loves you, you can't stay together - AND you still feel affection for that person, even when you know it isn't working.

Forced to accept the fact that one could become heartless or cruel when he thinks that the feelings have faded.  Left alone to fend for myself.  No one knows, no one understands.. the fear, the period of suffering in silence, the feeling of being deserted by someone I love at the times when I needed him most.  The darkest days of being helpless and hopeless.. and made to believe how worthless I am.  And it's so silly of me to cover up everything for him and live with the pain...till today.. </span></div>

I just said that when you get hurt, and then you hurt people, you just grow to accept and handle the pain better. No one says you deserve it. You cannot order love to come or to go, you can only learn to handle it as best as you can.<br><br>A long time ago when I was feeling the same type of pain, i came across a korean poem.<br><br>"If you cannot forget, let it be unforgotten, one day  you will forget<br>If you cannot forget, let him go unforgotten, some part or all will go one day<br>But you will say, how can I forget? When this flame still burns in my heart?"<br><br>And Life is more than about rejection, about disappointment, it is much much more than your own broken heart. It is also about the things you have the duty to do, and the people who love and care about you. Towards these, you have your responsibility to heal. As for future love, when it happens it happens.<br><br>The heart is like that I guess. It heals the best when you don't think about it.</div>
