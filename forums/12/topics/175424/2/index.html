I just said that when you get hurt, and then you hurt people, you just grow to accept and handle the pain better. No one says you deserve it. You cannot order love to come or to go, you can only learn to handle it as best as you can.<br><br>A long time ago when I was feeling the same type of pain, i came across a korean poem.<br><br>"If you cannot forget, let it be unforgotten, one day  you will forget<br>If you cannot forget, let him go unforgotten, some part or all will go one day<br>But you will say, how can I forget? When this flame still burns in my heart?"<br><br>And Life is more than about rejection, about disappointment, it is much much more than your own broken heart. It is also about the things you have the duty to do, and the people who love and care about you. Towards these, you have your responsibility to heal. As for future love, when it happens it happens.<br><br>The heart is like that I guess. It heals the best when you don't think about it. </div></blockquote><span style="color: indigo;">Dear ShrodingersCat,<br><br>that question was not directing at u.

I still have my family and frens.. people who loves me.. and things to focus on.. and they are my motivation to look ahead.<br><br>It's such a headache.. when your heart and your mind dun think the same way.<br><br>Cheers! </span></div>
