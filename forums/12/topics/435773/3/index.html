              <p>Now.. why is it you left her here.. while you went home to meet
                  your family ? It's kinda strange you don't have her tag along with
                  you.</p>
              <p>Friends aside....Is she so insecure in this relationship.. that
                  she does not even want any of your family to know of her existence
                  ? Does her family knows of your existence.. have you met her family
                  yet ?</p>
              <p>Have you both talked about the long term plan at all ? Is this a
                  friends with special benefit kinda thing from the beginning ??</p>
              <p>Try pushing this relationship to a different level... if she's
                  still hush hush.. something is wrong.. perhaps its time you cut
                  your losses.</p>

              <p>She had her scheduled work during the week as she was saving her AL's to go to her hometown as well, those were times she wasn't into me, not like the days when we really did mean to each other.</p>
              <p>Since its secreted, a few of my people back home know and so does her mom, i even remind her once in a week to talk to her mom just in case she forgets to do the usual family talk. Thats just about it</p>
              <p>six months ago i performed in a event and she became more interested in talking to me, thats how our relationship grew. Sometimes we did share our moments of love not verbally but physically so its not that friends with benefits thing.</p>
              <p>Topic's of long term relationship has always been a turn off for now i guess.</p>
              <p>I don't want to push her too much in a way where i would cause emotional pain, I think i have to give up on her, She does not respond to me anymore in anyway and i think she feels i am dead or something.</p>
              <p>Like they say " If you love someone let them go if they come back to you they were always yours if they don't they never were"</p>

              <p>Ts,<br>Why are u concerned whether she loves you or not and such a stance belies the insecurity(ies) within you.</p>
              <p>Of course, she is also in the same predicament as you are in. Both of you want to change each other to fit each other’s ’’agenda’’ – needs, expectaions and so on so forth. Calling it love is a misnomer. The sooner one reconciles to such an incongruity, the better one sees things as they are.</p>
              <p>Considering the age(s) it is ’’normal’’ but it is essential that if both of u can unlearn that no one can fulfil another. When two peopl purport to love but in reality try to change or see another as a means to one’s end(s) – it is no longer relating. it is no longer a relationship. It is a tacit agrreement to use each other n prop each other up. Of course, it is nigh impossible to sustain such a ’’relationship’‘</p>
              <p>If not this person, it could be another, – but belies this – mutual benefit scheme!</p>

              <p>so what if she is... using you as a personal assistant ?</p>
              <p>You cannot change her, neither can she change you.</p>
              <p>Only time can change a person.</p>

              <p>I agree, that changing for somone for their cause is a total BS</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You are what you are, if need to change the way you are for someone else, thats set to ruin too</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Unless changing in the way that you quit bad habits then its good</p>
