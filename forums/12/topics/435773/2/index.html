              <p>A Relationship should always be mutual, it should involve task done by the two in a fun and exciting way in which they take turns in doing what they want to do.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Even for the money issue, i know some women wish they want to pay for my dinner when i went with them, they highlighted me its their turn to pay, i was  surprised!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Actually this builds confidence in a relationship, when one side tries to do all the work than the other, its more of sea-saw ride, imbalanced, and set to ruin.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Communication is key, and also doing interesting stuff is important too!</p>
              <p>I learned a bit of guitar and played for her once, it was sweet! the most memorable time of my relationship, I still remembered how she looked so different and happy as compared to angry and rude as she thought i would suck at playing it haha.</p>
              <p>Try to impress her sometimes with your best skills in your inventory, women always liked to be impressed, its sometimes our duty too!</p>
              <p> Not everthing with money will do you know?</p>

              <p>Really depends on what you expect from the other. And how you feel about this relationship lah.</p>
              <p>You'd know if she cares about you or not.</p>
              <p>I gift you this... you gift me that.. in the end.. it's really just an exchange of objects.</p>
              <p>If you care for her.. give her what she wants.. not what you want to give.</p>
              <p>If she care for you.. you'd feel it in little things she do for you. Text you mushy stuff... let you know she thinking of you for a split second... send you emails about how she's doing.. know what I mean ?  Girls are emotional and social creatures... so just because she did not buy you presents or bake you a cake.. doesn't mean she don't give a damn.</p>
              <p>You are still young.. and she also very young... don't expect anything like National day parade celebration in your relationship.</p>

              <p>Investment means... the more you put in.. the more you demand back later. As your expectations ballooned over the years.... towards the end .. it pops when it can no longer hold the pressure. All you get is broken bits of memories and shards of pain.</p>
              <p>But when you look at relationship as a journey.. to discover yourself and your partner's being.. ... putting in effort, time, resources - as merely paying your toll along the way.. so you can enjoy this relationship longer....and perhaps reach your final destination together...there will be no need to be so calculative... even when the journey ended abruptly... at least you have walked as far as you can go....there will be no regrets nor remorse....</p>

              <p>I am not sure, but do you think a secreted relationship is successful then an open relationship? in which posting pictures of ourselves on vacation to our friends than keeping them a sceret and not letting anyone know that we're actually in a relationship?</p>

              <p>From what you've mentioned; I'd leave her.</p>
              <p>The issues that r bugging u don't seem like they'll be going away easily and will only get worse if things continue the way they are. If u get in further, you'll find it harder and harder to get out.</p>
              <p>If she only take no give, but you're happy to keep doin it.....then what's the problem? If it is a problem then tell her. If no change, then bye bye lor. Otherwise u stress and even if u do, it doesn't mean she'll understand or even care by the sounds of it.</p>

              <p>If your girl ask you to keep a low profile or "secret" relationship.. you should respect that request. Especially when the relationship is still brand new.</p>
              <p>She may fear the relationship will not last .. if it does.. good, then it will progress into the next phase...... if not.. she won't look like a failure in front of friends or family, since no body knows anyway.</p>
              <p>Once the relationship becomes stable.. and the future is in sight... she will change her mind.. and desire to be recognised/validated as your other important half. If you insist on keeping it secret by then... she'd be mad and think you are not serious with her...then you will see a downward spiral towards the end.</p>
              <p>So.. it's all in the timing.. and how far along the relationship is at the moment.</p>
              <p>Most important..always seek her opinion when you want to post photos with her on your facebook. Girls will dump guys who disregard their request.. because it shows how insignificant their girl must be in their eyes... no girl wants to be so un-important to their men.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>The way i see its more like, at the start it was great! we were getting to know each  other and i still remember how she would even help my lazy ass get to work by putting an alarm even if she doesn't have work. she really i mean REALLY loved me alot. days of meet ( 3 times a week) if i don't meet her she'll be angry so i better go!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>at the mid, it was a series of ups and downs, I am the one to blame i made alot of mistakes in trying to keep her up expectations but ofcourse i did all i can and made sure i was there for her as per plan for going out, etc, and i slowly had a feeling where she wasn't liking it, roughly once in a month this type of issue occurs, i become late or do something stupid she will be angry, and i make sure i comfort her, she then does it vice versa, but make sure i am not angry that much. days of meet (Once a week)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The end, this was the time when i felt i was all alone, the only times when i really had a chance of meeting her was when i actually had to buy something, such as products, worth a 1/4th my pay, i was happy atleast to meet her that was okay enough for me. days of meet ( Once in 25 days),</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I went to my hometown for a week, so i got to meet her before i set off, it was a good where she kissed me goodbye etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I returned with gifts from my hometown so i got a chance to meet her again!</p>
              <p>And then she talked differently, yes i can feel her now, she is not interested anymore in hanging out,she wants me not to spend money for her anymore? haha really?thats nice of her actually she really does care after all. She never metioned as a breakup, otherwise i would just smile at her and be happy that it has ended.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So i thought she was still in this and i called her once, never picked up, then i waited for a week for her to call, no response, i didn't want to spend money as she did not want me to, but alteast can she answer? Hmm, i waited.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After trying for nearly days i became angry and replied a bit agressive, first time, then BOOM! i got an instant reply, she wants to argue with me, and i had to break up.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Money isn't always a thing in a relationship, you can support your relationship  through love, if she really loved me in the end she would actually help me save money and still continue having relationship with me through love, but she has the mentality that she wants to save my money so she better quit, I never really uttered a word to her that i am spending too much and i need to stop, but i believe she feels guilty a bit. who knows whats in a womens mind these days.</p>
              <p>am i sounding like an ass with a tit for tat mentality?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Guys if so i want to change</p>

                                          relationship with me through love, but she has the mentality that
                                          she wants to save my money so she better quit, I never really

              <p>Although i generally follow the concept of, "if the relaionship
              needs to be secret, then it's not worth being in", I think there
              are exceptions in some circumstances.</p>
              <p>We all have our ideals, but should compromise at times

              <p>I agree, secreting sometimes can cause alot of social related problems, you can't get to socialize with her friends and she doesn't get to socialize with mine.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Socializing helps boost confidence too, the guy and the girl will not feel restricted and they will feel more open to people who they meet and somtimes you feel great that you show the world that you're in a relationship to be proud of</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Again don't take relationships as a status. i know some people who just want to show off haha</p>

              <p>REPOST</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The way i see its more like, at the start it was great! we were
                  getting to know each  other and i still remember how she would
                  even help my lazy ass get to work by putting an alarm even if she
                  doesn't have work. she really i mean REALLY loved me alot. days of
                  meet ( 3 times a week) if i don't meet her she'll be angry so i
                  better go!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>at the mid, it was a series of ups and downs, I am the one to
                  blame i made alot of mistakes in trying to keep her up expectations
                  but ofcourse i did all i can and made sure i was there for her as
                  per plan for going out, etc, and i slowly had a feeling where she
                  wasn't liking it, roughly once in a month this type of issue
                  occurs, i become late or do something stupid she will be angry, and
                  i make sure i comfort her, she then does it vice versa, but make
                  sure i am not angry that much. days of meet (Once a week)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The end, this was the time when i felt i was all alone, the only
                  times when i really had a chance of meeting her was when i actually
                  had to buy something, such as products, worth a 1/4th my pay, i was
                  happy atleast to meet her that was okay enough for me. days of meet
                  ( Once in 25 days),</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I went to my hometown for a week, so i got to meet her before i
                  set off, it was a good where she kissed me goodbye etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I returned with gifts from my hometown so i got a chance to meet
                  her again!</p>
              <p>And then she talked differently, yes i can feel her now, she is
                  not interested anymore in hanging out,she wants me not to spend
                  money for her anymore? haha really?thats nice of her actually she
                  really does care after all. She never metioned as a breakup,
                  otherwise i would just smile at her and be happy that it has
                  ended.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So i thought she was still in this and i called her once, never
                  picked up, then i waited for a week for her to call, no response, i
                  didn't want to spend money as she did not want me to, but alteast
                  can she answer? Hmm, i waited.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After trying for nearly days i became angry and replied a bit
                  agressive, first time, then BOOM! i got an instant reply, she wants
                  to argue with me, and i had to break up.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Money isn't always a thing in a relationship, you can support
                  your relationship  through love, if she really loved me in the
                  end she would actually help me save money and still continue having
                  relationship with me through love, but she has the mentality that
                  she wants to save my money so she better quit, I never really
                  uttered a word to her that i am spending too much and i need to
                  stop, but i believe she feels guilty a bit. who knows whats in a
                  womens mind these days.</p>

              <p>All she wanted was .. you stop making the same mistakes which are pissing her off...she needs conviction.. not false gratification.</p>
              <p>Yet.. you think you can BUY your way out of trouble.</p>
              <p>The bigger/more mistake .. the bigger/more expensive the gift.. is it not ? that's where you went wrong bro.</p>
              <p>When you went back to your hometown.. did you forget about her ? Did you call her ? Did you send her your thoughts ? Or were you too busy entertaining your homies ?  Then you expect her to be all excited because you bought her a 10 carat diamond necklace ? No dude... just be prepared she club your head off with her 4 inch heels. You were lucky she only gave you the cold treatment.</p>
              <p>When the visits becomes lesser and lesser.. it's not time to whip out your credit card or hit the shopping center... it's time to bring her on a trip.. to RE-INVENT the already boring relationship..</p>
              <p>When you give her no good reason to be excited about meeting you... why bother ? You're not THAT interesting as a person are you ? Like you're not Elvis Presley re-incarnated you know.</p>
              <p>So, you gota learn to ENTICE her.. and you will get more loving.. that's how women are... believe it..</p>

              <p>Yep! thats what striked me alot, but based on my history of trying to do interesting things for her at the start and all that have worked... i wanted to try to see if she can try to do something interesting for me? thats mutual isn't it? I don't want to sound like a selfish guy, but you know my mind tells me to give her a chance if she really cares, If i keep doing all the stuff for her, am i like a clown, an entertainer? Everytime i meet her i can sense her mood, If she's happy i can make the meet  interesting, if she's angry oversomething, i still make sure i tell her jokes etc? What happens if i become angry or sucidal? will she help me?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And about the bragg part haha i never did that, she told me our relationship should be kept secret so i did : ), I just got feeback from my buddies when they attended parties.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I guess i did all i can for her, and i know that you can find fault in me i am not the perfect guy but i tried to be, lol this sounds like a rap</p>

              to bring her on a trip.. to RE-INVENT the already boring
              relationship.."</p>
              <p>Aye i wish i had my thoughts up too, This is where i went blur
              really blur, she wouldn't want to even give me a chance to share a
              song or in turn she can try to help me give feedback, again i am
              not forcing her to listen to it am i ?  but prefers to buy the
              cute bunnies that she saw at Sembawang shop the other day OMG?!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"When you give her no good reason to be excited about meeting
              you... why bother ? You're not THAT interesting as a person are you
              ? Like you're not Elvis Presley re-incarnated you know"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yep! thats what striked me alot, but based on my history of
              trying to do interesting things for her at the start and all that
              have worked... i wanted to try to see if she can try to do
              something interesting for me? thats mutual isn't it? I don't want
              to sound like a selfish guy, but you know my mind tells me to give
              her a chance if she really cares, If i keep doing all the stuff for
              her, am i like a clown, an entertainer? Everytime i meet her i can
              sense her mood, If she's happy i can make the meet 
              interesting, if she's angry oversomething, i still make sure i tell
              her jokes etc? What happens if i become angry or sucidal? will she
              help me?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And about the bragg part haha i never did that, she told me our
              relationship should be kept secret so i did : ), I just got feeback
              from my buddies when they attended parties.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I guess i did all i can for her, and i know that you can find
              fault in me i am not the perfect guy but i tried to be, lol this
              sounds like a rap</p>

              <p>Now.. why is it you left her here.. while you went home to meet your family ? It's kinda strange you don't have her tag along with you.</p>
              <p>Friends aside....Is she so insecure in this relationship.. that she does not even want any of your family to know of her existence ? Does her family knows of your existence.. have you met her family yet ?</p>
              <p>Have you both talked about the long term plan at all ? Is this a friends with special benefit kinda thing from the beginning ??</p>
              <p>Try pushing this relationship to a different level... if she's still hush hush.. something is wrong.. perhaps its time you cut your losses.</p>

              Ts,
              Why are u concerned whether she loves you or not and such a stance belies the insecurity(ies) within you.
              
              Of course, she is also in the same predicament as you are in. Both of you want to change each other to fit each other's  ''agenda'' - needs, expectaions and so on so forth. Calling it love is a misnomer. The sooner one reconciles to such an incongruity, the better one sees things as they are.
              
              Considering the age(s) it is ''normal'' but it is essential that if both of u can unlearn that no one can fulfil another. When two peopl purport to love but in reality try to change or see another as a means to one's end(s) - it is no longer relating. it is no longer a relationship. It is a tacit agrreement to use each other n prop each other up. Of course, it is nigh impossible to sustain such a ''relationship''
              
              If not this person, it could be another, - but belies this - mutual benefit scheme!
