              <p>My girlfriend and I have been together for 10 months, shes 22 and I'm 21. As she's staying in hostel (just started), she will come my house and stayover every weekend (fri night to sunday evening). I used to wanting to meet her as much as possible by meeting her under her block or nearby shopping centre but she refused, saying it's troublesome to wash clothes that wore for afew hours just to meet me (yeah, she does all the washing herself). So I have to agree with meeting her only on weekends.</p>
              <p>Being with her for so long, I know what her priority is. Family (I understand this) &gt; Friends &gt; Bf. She's ok with not meeting me for over 1 week and postpone our meeting just to meet her friends. (Although not ok for me). In the end, I also have to agree with her.</p>
              <p>Now heres the big problem (it's big to me), she always take and seldom give. Over the 10months, i feel like i have always been the 1 giving. I cook for her for the first few monthly anniversaries (she did nth but eat and of course diff food/cuisine everytime), prepared her a surprise valentine gift with decorations (she did nth, only receive and no gift for me or anything) and a special day afew days ago, i cook for her again (I stopped cooking for afew months after my last cooking for her. and yes, she did nth again). As for the valentine's gift I gave her, she put at my house since valentine till now. Her reasons were no place no put at her hse. I helped her do her things/work whenever she asked or have problem with it. When I said no, she will get unhappy and all sorts, in the end I have to help her.</p>
              <p>Recently I asked her to help me do something (i'm independent, don't really need to ask people for help unless needed), she refused to. I asked afew more times, she refused all the way and tried to change subject. I'm really disappointed and angry with her. Shes those "the more you want her do, the more she refuses. the more you don't want her do, the more she wanna do". She likes to play mind games too. Don do, she will go act crying, wanna go home etc.</p>
              <p>Should I leave this girl for good? Yes, I'm happy with her when we didn't have any issue. But these problems has been going on for very long time. I tried to talk to her about it, she gave me attitude and said she is like this.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>P.S: Sorry for making you all read essay!!</p>

              <p>Everyone of us love our partner in our own way.</p>
              <p>Just because she is not loving you the way you want her to love you.. does not mean she doesn't love you.</p>
              <p>She cannot read your mind.. neither can you read hers.</p>
              <p>If you prefer that she spend some of her money on you.. just to make you feel good and loved.. then let her know... that's what you expect of her.. and that's the only way you can feel loved back.</p>
              <p>If you want her to love you the way you want.. she can do so.. just to make you feel happy.. even though the action has no meaning to her.</p>
              <p>You have this pre-conceived notion that love must be I give.. so I expect.. so I take.</p>
              <p>That's not how it works.</p>

              <p>Everyone of us love our partner in our own way.</p>
              <p>Just because she is not loving you the way you want her to love you.. does not mean she doesn't love you.</p>
              <p>She cannot read your mind.. neither can you read hers.</p>
              <p>If you prefer that she spend some of her money on you.. just to make you feel good and loved.. then let her know... that's what you expect of her.. and that's the only way you can feel loved back.</p>
              <p>If you want her to love you the way you want.. she can do so.. just to make you feel happy.. even though the action has no meaning to her.</p>
              <p>You have this pre-conceived notion that love must be I give.. so I expect.. so I take.</p>
              <p>That's not how it works.</p>
              <p>I have no idea what kind of "uncomfortable" things she wants from you.. so I can't comment on that.</p>

              <p><br>Actually, I don't mind whether she has ever spend $ and buy me gifts or not. What matter me most is having her to help me do something is like wanting her life.

              <p>Yes, I have sort of what you mention I give, so I expect, so I take. Isn't it really unhealthy for a relationship to have unbalance give and take? I don often ask for anything. In a month, the number of times I asked can be as maximum as 1 or 2 times.</p>
              <p>Could you tell me how relationship works? Love her the way she is. Give and don't ask anything in return despite she has no actions done for you. Isn't all these like one-sided? If this was treated to a girl instead of guy, many will said the guys fault instead of girl.</p>

              <p>You are being vague.</p>
              <p>You expect me to read your mind ?</p>
              <p>You want her to do stuff for you.. like what ? Why is it SOOO important that she must do it for you ?</p>
              <p>If you know she doesn't like doing it.. why force it ? Arn't you just being controlling ?</p>
              <p>Agreeing and then not doing is a form of passive aggression. When she felt forced to do stuff against her will... yet is afraid to speak out against it... that's how she will act out.</p>
              <p>Sorry to say this.. but it seems you are an ego centric guy.. and she is a passive aggressor... two of you together will be a disaster.</p>
              <p>Yes, it's best to call this off. This relationship only breeds resentment and discontent. So end it soon.</p>

              <p>I agree with mutually breaking up with her. Once you realized her flaws and up to the point that it irritates, you cannot help but develop a growing resentment as time pass. I guess it's natural to think "What an ungrateful bitch!" despite all the nonsense about relationship's give and take.</p>
              <p>Besides, you're going to serve NS soon, that oughtta keep you occupied.</p>

              <p>So, the way I behave is controlling and the way she did the same thing to me is not controlling. The way she forces me to do everything she asked despite I'm not happy about doing it is not egocentric but I am.</p>
              <p>Do you know what happen if I don't do what she asked? Did you read what I posted? She will act crying then say want to go home, don't wanna stay at my house, taunt me by saying she could go find other people(guys) that could do it for her. If I still don't do it, she gets unhappy and angry at me. Lastly, ignore me and don't talk to me. It's not she doesn't know how to do it, I'm not that unreasonable, is she lazy to do it herself.</p>
