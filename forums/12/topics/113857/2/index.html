How could you ever trust that person again?<br><br>I guess we all have different tolerance levels for such things.  I'd find it hard to forgive cause at the back of my mind would always be the lingering reminder of the betrayal.  How can I be sure that the next time we hit a rough patch in the relationship, he wouldn't find solace in the arms of another woman again?<br><br>To have it happen once is bad enough... if I somehow loved him so much to forgive him and it happened a second time, then that's it, goodbye, ta-ta, The End.<br><br>So, think about whether you have the capacity to really forgive and not hold her mistake against her in the future.  Not everyone is able to stomach betrayals like that.  It's not gonna be easy.  </div></blockquote>It is not easy all right...<br>At this moment, i am trying very hard to take it easy without the though of her betraying me again...<br>Sure isn't easy...<br>Sigh...<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>dear Marmalade Boy<br><br>ask yourself 2 questions :<br><br>1. will you be as happy as before if you get back together with her after all the sagas?<br><br>2. what's your deepest feeling right now?<br><br>to be honest, no amount of advices can influence your decision. ultimately, you'll have to decide for yourself. it's a matter of choice - to stay or to let go. you have to know what you want, really. you may be in a confusion stage right now. give yourself some time. you'll be able to think clearer.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i was just thinking abt what i'd do if my BF did the same.<br>I think i'd freak out. but i really do love him, and if he apologises sincerely, i'd PROBABLY forgive him. if it's cheating (as in not 1-nite-stand) then i'll really need to think longer.<br><br>any of the above happen twice then that's it for me too. I'll just cut off all r/s clean. and gals can sometimes be very cruel with it, and be quick and extremely clean abt it too.<br><br>but seriously though, think what u'd do without her. think far. be open to all sortsa options.</div>
