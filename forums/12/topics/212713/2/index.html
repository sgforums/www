            <div class='col-md body'>If she's stressed because of work.......that's the fundamental issue which need to be addressed first......<br><br>Try to suggest to her to calm down a little, perhaps by cutting her work hours a little bit. Slow down the work pace a bit.<br><br>Other than that, it's a bad idea to take sleeping pills for a long time, because dependancy can set in.<br><br>For medication help, instead of hard sleeping pills, suggest to her herbal sleeping pills, like the ones available OTC on pharmacies. Melatonin, valerian roots, camomile, etc. Many pharmacies carry herbal sleeping pills.<br><br>Also a good idea to drink a cup of full cream milk, at night. Full cream milk hor. It will produce natural sleep inducing reaction.<br><br>But I believe the best method is to relieve the stress.....so it's best to take a short leave from work, maybe a little vacation.</div>

But they always prescribe sleeping pills.  My friend is having sleeping disorder and at the same time, she is planning for a baby (or might already be pregnant by now).  So she cannot take those medication.<br><br>Where can she go to have her problem healed without any medication?  She is looking for a specialist doctor or hospital. </div></blockquote>I was just browing this forum and when I saw this post actually joined so that I could reply.  I actually suffered and sometimes still suffer from nasty insomnia (ie. go to bed at 11:00 pm and don't get to sleep until 5:00 am).  It was really getting nasty.  I'd get three hours of sleep and then would feel like crap at work all day, and the following night it would happen again!<br><br>Finally I did some reading and found that a very common cause of insomnia is anxiety.  With this type of sleep disorder we actually cause it ourselves.  Anxiety causes us to release chemicals that wake us up.  So if we can't get to sleep, we get anxious, the chemicals get released, we can't get to sleep, the chemicals get released etc.  It's a vicious circle that will have you awake until 5:00 am!  I know!<br><br>So they key with this type of insomnia is to avoid the anxiety in the first place.  The key to this is not *trying* to get to sleep but to wait until it happens by itself.  Because if you try and fail then you get anxious about it and the cycle starts.  So don't go to bed at the "normal" time but go to bed when you are tired.  If that's not until 2:00 am then fine.  I found that if I did this then I would go to bed (say, at 2:00 am) at I would go to sleep straight away.  But if I tried to go to bed at 11:00 am because that's "bedtime" then I would be kept awake (by my own anxiety) until 5:00 am!<br><br>So following this advice I found that my sleeping hours gradually creep back to normal (which for me is midnight - 7:00 am).<br><br>Anyway, there are different types of sleeping disorder/insomnia so this advice may be of no use whatsoever for your friend.  However, it helped me so much that I felt the need to share it.  Best of luck to your friend.<br><br>madcoder.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>like u said, if ur friend is stressed at work, then tatz e root of her sleeping problem.<br><br>even if she seeks help, she doesnt help herself, there is no way she will recover and get a regular sleeping pattern.<br><br><span style="color: red;">she has to learn to relax. </span>she can read up on relaxation techniques.<br><br>one thing bout aromatherapy is tat its may not be suitable for her condition if she is pregnant. e.g many mothers will avoid lavender, which is a very common scent in e market.<br><br>alternatively, she can leave her job. if that is not a solution, then i guess too bad then she has to cope w her working stress.<br></div>
