Things are getting more 'economical' nowadays, and often even doctors can't offer you too long a time for counsultation unless you're paying them by the rate...<br><br>She should direct her concern upfront and suggest no sleeping pills. And as suggested by the others, there're other methods which may work.. Unless you're able to get your hands on a good doctor. But a general reminder is that like what Fireice has suggested... Other therapies like TCM often takes quite a while to see effects... And no, they're no 'miracle pills'. That means you might need to do some adjustments to your life style to reduce stress and maintain your condition once you've 'remedy' for it...<br><br>Another piece of advice is that... If you're in no hurry... It's better to treat your body and life style 1st before you actually go for the baby... Otherwise it might be unwise both for the mother and the baby....?</div>
