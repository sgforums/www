            <div class='col-md body'>from your observations, one may make this observation... you've done it to him....<br><br>this begs the question: how many times were you wrong, yet you waited for him to pacify you when you had no right to lose your temper?<br><br>after a while, some will figure that no matter what, they're going to get the blame, so they don't care anymore...<br><br>when they don't care, the heart becomes calloused and unfeeling...<br><br>here's my observation:<br>you know why the man tries to pacify the woman?<br>BECAUSE HE LOVES HER and will give his right arm to make her happy!<br>women sometimes take advantage of this.. and it tears apart the heart of the man.. don't take advantage of your man.. if you do, what kind of respect are you showing him?  how much respect do you think you deserve in return...<br><br>hope you and your guy work things out and are both happy...<br></div>

However when times goes by - its more of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Who is right and Who is Wrong kind of thing</span>. If you are truely at fault, I believe its right if you were to initiate the apology and stuff. Guys are still human - <strong>TRUST ME</strong>, its damn tiring having to pacify your gf when she is at fault or its always on small matters.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Guys look far and seriousness into matter - when major things take place, most guys will truely protect, pacify and cheer their gf up even though they may feel sh|t too. However, its the small, ridiculous things that at times being the bf couldn't be bothered with. I am not saying you are, but - what about PMS? Unconsciously you affect him and expect him to 'hong' you?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Take a deep breath and review your situations - its ain't destruction or end of the world. When you try to compromise and look into things and he as well - things will be better.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>
