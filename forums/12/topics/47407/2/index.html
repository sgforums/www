            <div class='col-md body'>Basically, it's not the guy's 'task' to pacify girls all the time. I believe it's more of not wanting their gal to be sad and angry, hence the pacifying. Never take things for granted, perhaps you're too used to be pacified all the time, doesn't matter who's at fault. But as long as you're unhappy, he'll pacify you that kinda stuffs. Put yourself in his shoes sometimes, dont you think it's abit tiring and unfair?<br><br>Forgive me for being blunt, no offence intended. But I'm a girl, I know how you feel when your guy suddenly leaves you on your own.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> No more coaxing and stuffs, but probably he's too preoccupied to notice that you need to be pacified now? Ultimately guys are much more straight forward than us girls. That's not a weakness of theirs, it's their strength. Go have a talk with him, sometimes letting him know what you want is better than to leave him to guess on his own. If you read up 'Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus' you'll noticed the general behavious and characteristics. *Note the word used is general*<br><br>Take it in your stride, think positively. If you tell yourself you can, you can. Don't walk towards darkness.<br></div>
