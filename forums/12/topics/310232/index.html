              <p>well, today, sort of chatted with her again. i know im a retard, doing this kind of thing. but, couldnt control myself.</p>
              <p>wanted to be at least frens with her. close frens even.</p>
              <p>but after i stated to her that, she replied no, sorry.</p>
              <p>asked her what was it that was holding her back, she couldnt explain.</p>
              <p>wanted to ask millions of questions, wanted to know the very truth. but couldnt have the courage to even type it out to her.</p>
              <p>she flared up the next moment, using caps and all. making it clear it was impossible for us to have anything else anymore.</p>
              <p>i stated that i wasnt trying to have any relationships wif her anymore. and she said she wasnt implying i was.</p>
              <p>those words, they strucked me like a satanic blade, deep down my heart. and the feeling of being slapped again and again was back.</p>
              <p>words that were flowing around in my mind, couldnt muster up the courage to type them out. whereas i could, to others, instantly.</p>
              <p>i am like an object of resentment to her, an object she despised, greatly. an object she never wants to see again.</p>
              <p>she went offline after that. without looking at what i have to say about all this.</p>
              <p>now, i feel like a loser and a shameless bastard, keep on sticking to her. i kept on trying to chat with her and all, holding onto any hope available. kept trying to infer from her words, looking for a hidden meaning to every one of them; like a stray dog rampaging through a rubbish dump. knowing that there isnt any food no matter how hard he try.</p>
              <p>im in deep shit, i really am. i will be seeing her again on monday for class.</p>
              <p>how am i going to face her? how is she going to treat me? what will i react upon meeting her?</p>
              <p>thousands of question, none answered.</p>
              <p>what should i do? i have tried all those that you kind souls have given me, but all failed upon meeting her online just now.</p>
              <p>i really suck, im at wits end now. i can do nothing, totally nothing to stop this kind of feeling for her. this special place in my heart, specially for her....</p>
              <p>forumers, kind forumers, please advise me what i should do now. thanks...</p>
