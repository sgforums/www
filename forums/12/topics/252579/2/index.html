Cause she tells my friend that she has a good impression of me as well but he is rather close with another guy in her own class.<br><br>As in a project that is coming up, he and first girl are doing absolutely different topic while I'm doing the same with the girl.<br><br>And the first girl told me that she is gonna go do research with the guy, Which is totally pointless except wasting his time because we have to take pictures and research from real life.<br><br>Sigh, Then I really don't know liao.. One of my friend is also interested in the same girl but she has kinda rejected him off liao, So now it leaves me and the other guy.<br><br>My chances are slim because I don't get to interact with her much as we are different class and when I hang with their clique, The guy sticks to the girl so I don't want to spoil our friendship by going up to "steal" her off lor..<br><br>Really confused now..<br><br>Then yesterday my friend was in the lab with me, Her friend came in.. Her friend is kinda cute la.. And we have somewhat the same music taste..<br><br>I did tell my friend that her friend is cute, Then she was like, Go talk to her lar..  Kinda like supporting me..<br><br>I now very confused.. I don't whether is this the real me..

It does not apply to you cos you do not have any relationship with anyone of them yet.<br><br>2) When you say you like 2 girls at a time = you like 2 gals and they like you at the same time. It still does not apply to you cos the 2 gals never say they like you.<br><br>From my point of view the first girl already showed her answer but just that she did not say it out loud.<br><br>Lets do a simple test.<br><br>If you like a girl would you like to be closer to her then anyone else?<br>She is choseing to be close to the other guy which means the other guy has a higher chance.<br><br>Since the first girl asked you to go forward to know the other girl why not try?<br>Knowing her as her friend will give you more choices instead of one.</div>
