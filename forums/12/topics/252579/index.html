It is impossible 2 like 2 people at once, unless you are undecided, or simply a flirt.<br><br>Don't be mistaken that just because she takes the initiatives in starting MSN conversation, or that she reply long messages would mean that she like u. Who knows, she may be just extremely friendly, and she do that to other people too.<br><br>I would say, make up your mind, which girl u like, and then chase that one. Do not try stepping two boats at a time, only 2 find urself capsize later on. Even if u are currently not attached to any of them, it is kinda wrong and stupid to try 2 chase both at the same time, because the girl will feel that u are not really liking her by chasing 2 at the same time, and that she may be a back-up for the other.</div>
