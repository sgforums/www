              <p>Hi all,</p>
              <p>Its been over a year since I last posted and I thought I just want some closure (whether you as the reader remember/care or not, that's another thing lol):<br>http://sgforums.com/forums/12/topics/394624</p>
              <p>I'm not sure if people still remember what went on but I'll summarize. Basically, I had a very difficult time finding a engineering job in the US before and after graduation, in spite of doing pretty everything "right". If you read my older posting, I wasn't very mentally stable then either, given the pressure I was feeding myself at that point in time. Since then, I did graduate in december last year and still couldn't find a job (once again came close but was ultimately rejected), hence I returned back to Sg.</p>
              <p>Not surpisingly, I had a far better response, although strangely none of the engineering MNCs responded to me with an interview. I was however "well accepted" in other fields. I eventually settled on a banking/finance position which on retrospect seems a better opportunity than what I had going for me in the US (bcz I was only applying to engineering jobs there). I felt very relieved that after 3-4 years of searching, I finally have something to show for my efforts. <br><br>I'll just like to end off with thanks, especially to the posters who gave me advice in my "darkest" hour. And... if anyone is in the same predicament, needs encouragement, or have questions, feel free to shoot.</p>
