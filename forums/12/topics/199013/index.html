            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br>I actually have some problem working with my colleague. We totally cant get along but on the surface it seems that we are working hand in hand. He likes to Sabotage me and always say things indirectly to ruin my image and reputation. I really cant stand him. He always like to pretend to be a good person in front of the men. Although my position is higher than him but there is nothing that i can do to him. He also like to boast and the worst part is his work attitude sucks and he knows how to wayang... Others have the impression is that he is hardworking.<br><br>If i had the choice i would rather not work with him. Imagine working with him for another 9 months B4 i ORD. Can anyone help me think of a way to pay him back what he did to me or any sort of ways to tekan him. I also intend to let the men knows that he is lazy.</div>
