              <p>To stop communication is not a rare thing to have. Sometimes, you do or say something, which the other party finds it annoying and you may not realize it. Hence he/she completely reject your call. The other party may not want to befriend you at all. So you should wait for the other party to response accordingly. Wait for her/he to call you. </p>
