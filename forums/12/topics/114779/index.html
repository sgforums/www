Because only our new life can truely speak for themselves - if we are truely leading a far much better life than before and if the emotional release has truely benefited us.<br><br>It's about time to work on yourself in four aspects:<br><br>Physical<br>Emotional<br>Spiritual<br>Psychological<br><br>P.S: Strengthen and improve - you will find yourself evolving into something new gradually.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am good in planning and often did things or make decisions to go in flow with my life's plannings or designed up plans that will cushion in case I fail in what I do; sometimes these decisions are not happy ones and often I chose to do things that I am not willing to. Sometimes, we just wished that we took an alternate path.<br><br>We all wonder if our decisions in life was correct or whether our current decisions now will prove to be right for us.. It's life, I supposed. IMO, there is nothing wrong in being lazy, lie back and think about life issues once a while.</div>
