            <div class='col-md body'><br>Im am 24 years old and im considered quite pretty . In the past i had many relationships which did not work out well so my friends told me to be more cautious in the future.<br><br>Recently i met somebody who i feel very comfortable with and he is very nice to me. After a while he professed his love for me. I was very happy but i play aloof and told him that i would like to stay for friends for now despite every part of me wanting to tell him that i feel the same way maybe lesser but definitely more than friends.<br><br>So i told him , lets just be friends and see how it goes, this went on for another month of so and i felt it was the right decision. I was contemplating telling him soon i start to have real feelings for him and i would like to consider him as a bf and more than just a friend.  But my good friends say hold on .<br><br>One day , we were just talking casually over the phone, and i mentioned i have cravings for some fruits. He said really? and i said yes. Then he said "okay". Then he said call me later. I sort of knew what he will do, he has always been this considerate.<br><br>But he didnt call me back, two days later - i found out he died in a car accident in johor, apparently he sped all the way there to buy some fruits and crashed and died.<br><br>I am very sad about his death, really i am. But i am sadder that he died without knowing my true feelings for him. I really wish i have told him that i do love him but its now too late. This i feel will be one of the black marks or scars in my life.<br><br>So in conclusion, sometimes in life, there is no laters. Look to the person at your side, tell him/her how much you appreciate her. Life is cruel and sometimes short. There may be no next time.<br><br>Thank you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br>I felt very sorry 4 u...... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  But girl, live wif it, take tis as a lesson learnt. My philosopy is treat everyday is ur last day, so u will cherish everything u hv....<br><br>I also hv a story to share, while maybe some hv already read it in email or sms, but anyhw, i feel it is worth sharing again...... hope u guys don't mind. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>After 21 years of marriage, my wife wanted me to take another woman out to dinner and a movie. She said I love you but I know this other woman loves you and would love to spend some time with you.<br><br>The other woman that my wife wanted me to visit was my MOTHER, who has been a widow for 19 years, but the demands of my work and my three children had made it possible to visit her only occasionally.<br><br>That night I called to invite her to go out for dinner and a movie.<br><br>"What's wrong, are you well," she asked? My mother is the type of woman who suspects that a late night call or a surprise invitation is a sign of bad news.<br><br>"I thought that it would be pleasant to be with you," I responded. "Just the two of us."<br><br>She thought about it for a moment, and then said, "I would like that very much."<br><br>That Friday after work, as I drove over to pick her up I was a bit nervous. When I arrived at her house, I noticed that she, too, seemed to be nervous about our date. She waited in the door with her coat on. She had curled her hair and was wearing the dress that she had worn to celebrate her last wedding anniversary.<br><br>She smiled from a face that was as radiant as an angel's.<br><br>"I told my friends that I was going to go out with my son, and they were impressed, "she said, as she got into the car. "They can't wait to hear about our meeting". We went to a restaurant that, although not elegant, was very nice and cozy. My mother took my arm as if she were the First Lady. After we sat down, I had to read the menu. Half way through the entries, I lifted my eyes and saw Mom sitting there staring at me. A nostalgic smile was on her lips<br><br>"It was I who used to have to read the menu when you were small," she said.<br><br>"Then it's time that you relax and let me return the favor," I responded.<br><br>During the dinner, we had an agreeable conversation - nothing extraordinary, but catching up on recent events of each other's life. We talked so much that we missed the movie.<br><br>As we arrived at her house later, she said, "I'll go out with you again, but only if you let me invite you." I agreed.<br><br>"How was your dinner date?" asked my wife when I got home. "Very nice. Much more so than I could have imagined," I answered.<br><br>A few days later, my mother died of a massive heart attack. It happened so suddenly that I did to not get to do anything for her.<br><br>Some time later, I received an envelope with a copy of a restaurant receipt from the same place mother and I had dined. An attached note said: "I paid this bill in advance. I wasn't sure that I could be there; but nevertheless, I paid for two plates - one for you and the other for your wife. You will never know what that night meant for me. I love you, son."<br><br>At that moment, I understood the importance of saying in time: "I LOVE YOU!" and to give our loved ones the time that they deserve. Nothing in life is more important than God and your family. Give them the time they deserve, because these things cannot be put off till "some other time."<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Here's hoping today is better than yesterday and tomorrow.</strong></span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>"Life is not measured by the number of breaths we take, but by the moments that take our breath away!?</strong></span><br></div>
