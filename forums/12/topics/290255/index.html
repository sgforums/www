            <div class='col-md body'>haiz.. i am better than u in the way that i dun really kena ostracize by my class and didn't hear anything bad like "u so loser also wanna jio me" from the one i confessed.<br><br>Now i learned from u that:" i just wanna focus on my studies and nothing else" is a rejection line <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>Well dude, don't be depressed over bad result and being average ok. Y am i saying so? I am ugly but i am good at study though... i don't kena ostrasize by people, i ostracize those i dun wanna make friend with.<br><br>A good example is i love the companion from my NTU group (4 girls to me) but hate one of the girl in my tutorial class (like to stick to me like glue in class).<br><br>Fail today doesn't mean u fail forever unless u behave that way. Score badly this year, work hard and retake. Worst come to worse go poly for another 3 years, won't die one. Look average, go make urself LOOK BETTER!<br><br>i look ugly in the past, doesn't mean i will remain that way forever, i am desired to look like Wu YanZu, so i will work hard to look like him (i mean the style).<br><br>I am now training my abs and arms so as to look more muscular and style my hair like his and eventually go to Skin centre for scars treatment. [when i look like Wu Yanzu, i will go japan to look for my soulmate. U know y not Singapore?! Because i kena 4 rejections and never a r/s in my 21 years of life, so i won't give Singapore girls a chance provided she really moved me.]<br><br>Hope my belief helps u tide over this lousy period.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Usually the first impression you give people will stick for a long time. You need to start afresh. Build up friendships with other people- CCAs etc. Just accept the fact that you've already screwed up your relationship with these classmates and make friends elsewhere!! Showing that you're desperate and pitiful only makes them treat you worse. (which is somewhat what you've done)<br><br>Work on your confidence and self-esteem. I don't believe they singled you out if you carry yourself very well.<br><br>And for your own sake, do well for your exams! Stop playing neopets la. Childish. (I saw your post about selling neopoints) Get A^5 for your A levels and laugh at them when you collect your results next year.</div>

Btw activities do not change you but it is you who make the out of it and allowing yourself to grow through it. I could also suggest that you talk to a counselor and see what she can do to help you get through yourself..<br><br>Do you love yourself ? I think many problems come about when we do not treat ourselves like our best friend. We don't forgive as readily as we forgive others. We aren't have enough patience with ourselves as we are towards others. Loving yourself is about accepting yourself unconditionally and even your flaws. So tell yourself that you love yourself even if you are imperfect. Realistically, this is an imperfect world where all of us are imperfect.<br><br>So from today onwards, learn to care and listen to yourself more cos you deserve to be happy. Tell yourself, no matter what has and will happen, the door of my heart is always opened.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Try it. When you are at peace, people can tell from your facial expression, body language and they will be curious what had happened to you. Don't look for external acceptance first, accept yourself first.<br><br></div>
