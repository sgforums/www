Still calls her regularly, showed his concern, listen to her problems. He didn't get jealous even though he knew many guys were wooing her. Managed to get her to slowly go out with him. In the meantime, he started getting involved in other activities so he don't get so obsessed with her. They have fun together  &amp; she realise what a caring  guy he was.<br>It took him almost a yr. to win her back.<br><br>This case senario can only happen if the breakup is mutual &amp; both remains as friends.

            <div class='col-md body'>Its.. quite impossible... Relationship its not what we all watch in mushy sentimental romance movies with things like "... and they get back again and live happily ever after".....<br>Once u breakup or she/he initiates breaking up... Each of u have no more respect on each other. What's left maybe images of her/him naked.. sex.. gettin intimate...thats why broken up couples still can miss each other..... but at the end.. even if get together again, also wont last longer... And more things will come out when there are arguments like "if u do that again or if i see u doing things like last time... we'll break up again!" So there will be more black mails and anger as both has lost their respect towards each other.<br>I got  some friends case who broke up.. then get together again.. then broke up again.. then get together again... like no ends after their first breakup... things keep coming up everytime there're minor little problems.</div>
