            <div class='col-md body'>Ok, sometimes I go out with my friends to shopping. But most of friend, they can shop anywhere and everywhere. They really don't care about brand and stuff they just buy what they like. They can even shop at their house downstairs those clothes shop. And they can even bear to wear $10 watches also bought from their house downstairs.<br><br>While I, although I usually, come to think it, never bought any clothes for myself before. Usually my mother buy for me, but she usally buy branded 1... Not those VERY branded lah, I suppose those are just normal brands, bossini, giodarno, adidas, OP, converse those kind lah... not those expensive, expensive type. And I dun tink I will wear non branded stuff also. I dun tink I spent more than them on clothes also... coz I seldom buy new clothes de.<br><br>Am I leading an average lifestyle or are my friends just more causal?</div>
