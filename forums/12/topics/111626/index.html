The existence of cca is not about winning awards but about the opportunity to fulfill your passion and interests, gainning useful knowledge that some can't be learnt through books, and valuable experiences and interests that may benefit you all now and in future. Ask for any other valid reasons if he/she still insists. If you all don't find the reasons sufficient enough to close down the media.com. Tell the teacher you guys will write a letter to principal not to close down the club.</div>
