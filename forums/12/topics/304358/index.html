You can still maintain a decent line of communication with her as a normal platonic friend just to make sure she does not forget you lar. In the mean time, go on and date other girls. One fine day, when she breaks up, you will know abt it. And by then, you assess if you have chance or not.<br><br>It sounds bastard-ish but its all about the PURSUIT of HAPPYness.</div>

Saying is easy but doing is not.<br><br>3) Do you seriously and honestly think she will like you?<br><br>4) Why must she chose you? I mean are you rich, handsome or better then her current bf ? I other words why you and not someone else?</div>
