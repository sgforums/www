I have come to be glad and happy cause I too avoid all the unnecessary issues that comes with these things.<br>Keeping in touch takes effort. You can try to contact your NS friends or school mates out for a coffee or whatever.  I do still email now and then a friend who went back KL a year back..  Don't expect others to take the effort or initiative if you don't.<br>I am a very introved person and I had to take a lot of effort and courage to go make friends. I dislike all that nonsence talk so my circle of people are very limited cause many people definitely cannot stand me. I am sure you can do it much better.<br></div>

Its better to keep quiet if u hav nothing good to say abt urself than to say things that wil let others have a negative perception of u.

            <div class='col-md body'>U are not anti-social, but ur problem is quite common among people who seems to have lots of friends. During my JC days, I have 2 friends who are really well-known in school. They seem to know tons of people, everywhere they go is 'Hi, XX!' or 'Hi YY', but they somehow don't seem to have 1 particular close friend with them. And on some occasions, u will spot them eating alone in the canteen.<br><br>I used 2 be anti-social. During my sec school days right up to my NS days, I will reject 70% of invitations to me to go out. Sometimes, I just don't feel the need to go for some class gatherings, some BBQs, some Birthday party.  As a result, except for my really close friends, I lost touch with many of my former classmates, and some 'friends'. Prior to entering Uni, I told myself to change, to be more sporty. I take the initiative, by organizing a few gatherings, and made a point to make it for gatherings when invited. As a result, I can't say I am Mr.Popular now, but rather, my social circle has widen, and I had made a great deal by having new/great/wonderful friends in my life now.<br><br>Sometimes, all it takes is for someone to break the ice is to take the lead and ask people out. I can see u are the friendly type. So why not take the lead, and ask someone/a group out? Things will happen from there. And even if u don't succeed in having a large group of friends, at least u will make 1 or 2 close friends, and u can ask them out next time.<br><br>Hope this post helps</div>

I wana relocate to either UK, AUS, US or even MALAYSIA n am saving for e purchase of a simple n cheap apt of my own. N lots more goals like waiting patiently for my soul-mate to appear (luv cant b rushed..wen cupid hits u, no matter wer u go, u wil meet dat fated 1. so while waiting, go do stuff u always wanted to do or switch jobs if u hate ur job, go travel on urself..u might hav some nice encounters)<br><br>My destination for 2006 is UK, london n Manchester. If u keen to join mi, feel free to let me noe.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> although im goin there for a 6mths course</span>.<br><br>My guide to PEACE n serenity n joy in life is: TO Appreciate e Things u have Now, e world is already perfect on its own now..u cant change anything or anyone ard u, e ONLY thing u can change is ur thoughts n perception...work on it , a positive thought a day keeps e negativity away!<br><br>Trust me..u will xperience a wonderful carefree feeling like wat i hav now. This feeling came onto me recently n I no longer take pills on a regular routine for my migraine, anxiety prob, Bipolar disorder (incurable, but can b controlled) and insomnia. (worse off rite? so many psychological probs..but who gives a damn ..as long as Im takin steps to make myself a better person n enjoying my life in everyway I can.)<br><br>I can go without them even for months, but for some days, its realli bad esp e extreme downs in moods which is out of my control n e mania periods realli make me more productive n euphoric though..haha<br>So not so bad after all to be diagnosed with BD<br><br>My fren, now dat u get e gist of life..hope u b e best u can b, but always be soft n kindest to urself. If u dun feel rite or extremely uncomfortable abt doing certain stuff, then diss it away. Find other means to attain ur objective, hav a goal in life n work towards it from e nearest route. A small step a day wil lead to bigger steps n bingo! u reached e peak..jus like climbing a mountain..climb it at ur own pace, dun get swayed / envious of pple.<br><br>. </div></blockquote>Hey it's great that u seem to be having lotsa of plans in the makin for the near future... &amp; it's reflective of ur generally upbeat &amp; enthusiatic outlook now... such motivations, i realized, is esp important for ppl like us (sorrie 4 lumping us together)..<br><br>Generally, i realized ppl like myself tend to be discouraged easily &amp; have a tendency to be moody, nostalgic abt past relationships &amp; wallow in self-inflcited misery easily..<br>Hence, it's quite gd when we hav some inspiring plans in the near future...<br><br>Like i go to mediacorp studio every weekend lately to watch e recording of superfunkies... allows me to immerse in the pleasure of songs i like, my superstar idols &amp; great experience compared to watchin tv at home...<br><br>I used 2 dread weekends cos i feel envious of my peers having exciting plans whilst i'm always alone... I find it so difficult to find company even jus for dinner or movies... Hence i gradually learn to make plans ... that allows me to enjoy myself w/o necessarily depending on others' availabilty...<br><br>I also enjoy driving by myself along ECP, the road to Changi Airport... my sat nite is sometimes spent crusing along the roads... jus enjoyin e breeze, the music playin etc... it sounds pathetic if i tell my peers this is my past time but ultimately, i'm learning (thou it's difficult) to be myself...<br><br>My exams wld be over in 2 weeks time... ur msg was timely in reminding me e importances of plan &amp; inspiring myself ..... Hopefully i can improve step by step .... it's difficult but i'll try...</div>
