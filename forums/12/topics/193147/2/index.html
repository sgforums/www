Do consider this, attractions for each other won't hold both of you together for 5 years. The "getting used" to that you've mentioned is the love that both of you have build over the last 5 years together.<br><br>Try to recollect what both of you have been through for the past 5 years, including all the happy and unhappy moments. If I were in your position, I would've been very touched and such too. However, what kind of man do you really need? Please remember that your ex-colleague A is still very much a stranger to you cos both of you don't spend as much time together as you and your bf. Do you need a man who can cater to you like a butler? Or do you need a man who can stick with you for 5 years and yet still wanna marry you and spend a lifetime with you. What kind of force would make a man do all that if it isn't love?<br><br>Despite his temper and such, which boring guy in this world doesn't have a temper? Think not having a temper is equivalent of not having a personality too, wouldn't it be boring? Being pleased 24x7 will eventually makes that guy seems really irritating to you too, have you thought of that too?<br><br>Ultimately it is still your decision to make regarding this issue. But I would like to assure you that once the magic is gone, this kind of perfect gentlemen's behaviour will eventually irritates you in no time. So I truly hope that you will think through it before you make your decision and live it without regrets.<br><br>Good luck. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div></blockquote>Thanks so much... u really figured out what's on my mine right now.<br>That is why I reluctant to let go my SO.<br><br>I feel so much better.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sound like your current boyfriend is neglecting you. A is right, you should make decision because of you not him. Think about your relationship with this current boyfriend. If without A will you breakoff from him? If the answer is yes, then go ahead. If not you better think twice, A may not suit you. I think that's what worried A that's why he ask you to think for yourself.</div>
