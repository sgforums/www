Suddenly becoz someone else showed u so much concern and care, ur feeling has change. Issit this wat you call a Honeymoon period? When ur bf chase u, dun u undergo this period too?<br><br>If u are going to dump someone of 5 yrs jus becoz u tink he does nt care for u enuff over someone whom u barely even know, even u are with this new man in ur life, in 5 yrs later wat if the situation happens again? are u going for a new guy who showed u with much love and concern.<br><br>5yrs together means that you 2 are pretty to stick it out, going thru thick and thin together. Of course some may argued that time is nt an essetial for relationship. Ppl who marry after 1 yr of courtship may last longer than 5 yrs.<br><br>But look back the 5 yrs. In a relationship is nt abt receiving, it is abt giving also. Ur bf has nv cheated on u i presume. Issit fair to him? Imagine how he will feel. Aniway u have already cheated on him by openly declared u like him and going to dinner dates alone. Does ur bf noes? How would u feel if he secretly goes out dining with another girl alone without ur knowledge.<br><br>Aniway since the girl already has a bf, yet the guy still chase her. I am nt tolerant of tis.
