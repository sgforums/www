Because I found out that he had been cheating behind me for months.<br><br>Due to his pleas and promises, I decided to stay on, because I am too attached to him. We stay together and my life revolves all around him. How am I going to survive without him?<br><br>If he had not cheated on me, I will feel like I am the luckiest woman in the world, because I am getting married. But now I just felt that we are getting married for the sake of marrying; as everyone around is anticipating for this rightful day to arrive.<br><br>However, I met A, he was my ex-colleague. My contract just ended (temp job) and now everyday I am thinking of him... I tried to refrain myself from doing so, but the more I try, the more I think of him.<br>Maybe it's an infatuation.<br><br>At work, we rarely talk, even during lunch time. The weirdess thing is I dare not have direct eye contact with him. The moment I look into his eyes, I felt very awkward and uneasy. Is that a sign of in love?<br><br>I can't really recollect when and how this starts.<br><br>At work, he is really nice to me. even we seldom chat, most of the time our communications is abt work.<br><br>He is very attentive to needs. Like pulling a chair for me when mine is taken up, volunteered to run little errands that he shouldn't be doing... eg. scanning documents on my behalf as i am new to that environment. He's a great help at work, with him around, I will never get bulllied or pushed around by others.<br><br>When I was seriously down with a fever and flu + cough, he will msg m telling me to take care and must rest more, sleep early, drink more water....<br><br>I admitted I was touched... cuz my bf whom i m staying with, don't even bother at all.<br><br>A is also very observant. He notices my attires and asked if my wardrobe only consists of dark coloured clothings. I laughed.... There was once during lunch, he complimented me on the way i hold the chopsticks... I blushed... I was like huh?? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>He buys me lozenges everyday to soothen my coughs and is like shielding me from all dangers and difficulties. I can't help falling into it.<br><br>My last week at work, my bf was deployed for an overseas business trip for a week.<br><br>I meet up with A twice, for dinner and the other for supper.<br><br>Cuz i knew that we will never have the chance again.... when my bf is back.<br>He knew that I have a bf, and I told him abt my ROM, because I do not want to lead him on or to toyed with his feelings. He seemed shocked and distraughted.<br><br>In MSN, I confessed to him that I like him.. and it was terrible that instead of missing my bf whom at the point of time was abroad, my mind was preoccupied with A. I never thought that i will like another person other than my significant other, and moreover within such a such period of 2 months.<br><br>I knew I shouldn't fall in love with him, but I just can't help it.<br><br>A didn't make any confession until when i asked him through MSN, because, face to face, we avoided talking abt r/s....<br><br>Now, I or rather we are merely waiting for my ROM day to come.......<br><br>But from the scenarios as stated above, is A really interested in me? Or is it that I am over-sensitive... because my 5yrs r/s lacks of the care and concern since it's already 5yrs; most of the things my bf already take for granted. That's why I am so drawn towards A?<br><br>I am going abit crazy thinking of A and my present r/s. Should I get married for the sake of marrying or should I get free?<br><br>Maybe my feelings for A is an infatuation.........<br><br>But as what A advised me, if i were to make a decision, I am making it for myself and future. Not because of his existence... He even says that we may not be suitable. Is he backing off because he doesn't want to get involved in this mess?<br><br>But i can't stop thinking of him day and nite. The feeling is really undescribable. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br></div></blockquote>You take care?</div>

I am willing to forgive him because I love him. Sometimes the love for someone can be so overwhelming that it can disguise their flaws. I still choose to believe him. Pray hard that if he ever does anything that betray my trust again, god pls dun let me find out.<br><br>2) why do you trust SO so much? Even he has done so much bad things to you? is he handsome or rich?<br><br>It's not the appearance, family status or whatsoever that counts.<br>It's the matter of feelings of heart.<br>My heart still  goes to him. I care about his health, his heavy work load &amp; stress, his school works &amp; projects, his life, his wellness and everything. I am more of like a companion, a maid and a mother to him.<br>Yes, I admit his looks is not bad &amp; well for his family status is average.<br><br>3) If A try his best will you give him a chance at all?<br>NO, i don't think so now at all.<br>Cos I merely know him and I know it is very natural to like and treat a person differently if the person like and treat u well.<br>That's why i fall in love with him initially.<br>But now, I have a better and more conscious mind.<br>I do not even know him well, so how do I know what lies ahead in the future?<br>I do not want to risk my r/s with SO because of A.... cos I dun tink its not worth it.<br>Maybe I hate to start all over agin in a r/s and build it up again and what if we aren't meant for one another?<br><br>Since SO and I have being together for 5yrs, and we can manage to resolve alot of problems and went thru so much hurdles together, I should value and honour my SO more than anybody else.<br><br>SO &amp; I know &amp; understand each other very well and if there is really nothing good abt him, i doubt i will be able to stay on or hang on in this r/s for so long.<br>Like the old sayings: Love is blind. And if you really love someone, you are willing to do that unconditionally. I have wakened up from the infatuation already.<br><br>My SO is still the man of my life no matter what lies in the future..<br><br>Hope my story ends smoothly......</div></blockquote>Claps claps to the brave girl.<br><br>How many people feel the story will have a smooth ending?<br><br>Since she have already made up her mind.<br><br>No one can stop her anyway.<br><br>I guess you seriously do not know SO well.</div>

Just do whatever is necessary and move on.<br><br>Cheers<br></div>
