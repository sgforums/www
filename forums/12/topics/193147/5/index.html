You really have to be sure that u wana marry him bcos u wana spend the rest of ur life with him, and not bcos u feel that since u have been together for 5 yrs, it's time to tie the knot.  Not bcos of kids etc.  It's still very early to think about kids.  Do not make this mistake.  U will live to regret. </span></strong><br><span style="color: blue;"><strong>Guy A told me this too when I told him i m getting ROM.</strong></span><br><br><span style="color: red;"><strong>Pardon me for saying this, he cheated you more than once.

I am very afraid to get hurt again. On the outside, I always act that I am very strong... that it's ok, tomorrow will be a better day. Only my girl buddies know that at heart I am weak.. Acting strong is to defend myself and not to let others worry. I dare to air out here is because I do not know anyone here in person. If not, I rather die than say. </strong></span>[/b]</blockquote>Hmm...you have certainly given Guy A alot of opportunities to sway you from your marriage. But fret not, there are alot of better guys out there who can easily replace Guy A, and that's the truth. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Correct me if i'm wrong, but from your point of view...certainly you have already forgiven your bf long ago. So this is also not the problem as your bf is irreplacable by any guys...including Guy A. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>So are you afraid or feeling insecure of getting married as in the marriage itself? Why did you agreed to the marriage in the first place?<br><br>The fact that you have agreed to marry your bf despite all that he have done in the past showed me that you still love him. You probably thought back about the past when you're restless and this instill some fears and uncertaincies in you.<br><br>You may want to move on and give your bf a real chance of repentent and observe how he is treating you at the moment. Do not think of marriage as the end of everything, there is always divorce should you really regret your decision in the future. However, should you decide to opt out of this marriage...you must understand that the decision must come from you and not from our advices. Bring your decision to your parents and let them be aware of your fears, worries and insecurities. And allow your parents to help you out of this marriage if you've became the unwilling party.<br><br>Do not delay your decision till every arrangements have been made...for the sake of the happiness of everyone who are important to you.<br><br></div>

You gave him all the freewill to do anything he wants (which is a good thing), but you should never compromise what you have given to him, by retrograding your principles and thoughts to fit him and create a distorted picture of Love (e.g. who hasn't cheated? - this is a extremely negative mindset to adopt).<br><br>He has cheated and repented, apparently. And you had forgave him as well. If it is one isolated case, fair enough. BUT...<br><br><blockquote><strong>'...He got himself involved with a married colleague whom has 2 kids and also other women from pubs and massage....' </strong></blockquote>Counting the least possibility, that adds up to three separate women.

Should be a 'karmanic' relationship...?<br><br>Your relationship which you've chosen to step in and be SHAPED along with it, has caused your 'fate' for today.... All those just happened last year and you're going for the ROM this year with so much DOUBTS still within yourself...?<br><br>You're LOST. Like you're said, you're probably not even yourself anymore.... It probably would be ok if you never 'wake up' again in the future... Anymore problems in the future, just post here in AA and call it a day...?<br><br>What's your SO's horoscope?<br><br>It's difficult to explain to you... Or even to talk you out of it... Because it's a 'cage' you've so willingly placed yourself within... Based on your nature, this just really ain't quite you... But yes, there's an alternate saying.... The 'blindly no turning back' mode... I think you're on IT....<br><br>The reason why you're not pushing back the ROM date is not because you can't... It's because you're weak and unconvinced... Blind as I've said... Because you don't want to... What 'young mum'; anniversary with ROM; others' expectations etc. are just excuses you've made up for yourself SUBCONSCIOUSLY.... Because without them, you probably won't know how to bring yourself to the 'green light' of your ROM... The 'date line' is set and agreed by yourself so that you can quickly get things OVER with...<br><br>You've got a stubborn nature in a sense... And it would certainly be MOST degrading to yourself to ACCEPT that your DECISION to go on this relationship for 5 YEARS of your life... CHANGE YOURSELF and go into a 'no turning back' mode has been RETURNED with a 'HE BETRAYED ME' answer... The FACT that your move was quite a very wrong one...? NOPE. You CAN'T ACCEPT that. That's why <span style="color: red;">you've rather CHOOSE to GO ON and even SUFFER in SILENCE if you have to....&gt;&gt;&gt; Agreed upon this <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </span><br><br>But the fact is humans often make mistakes in their lives... <span style="color: blue;">Even devils do.... &gt;&gt;&gt; Must be you... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </span>It's not just about being 'wrong' now, but the worse of scenerio would be to CONTINUE with that 'wrong' and bring it to a HIGHER LEVEL.... Do you have to live with that? Not if you can do away with your own ego...<br><br>And ANOTHER IMPORTANT POINT to NOTE... If your SO knows that you're on ALL OUT on this 'no turning back' mode (which he should probably knows by now...), he can HOLD a KEY to the OUTCOMES to MANY THINGS to COME... Like you've mentioned about he being the DECISION MAKER MOST of the time... He can choose to RUN the SHOW the way he likes... And YOU can only blindly SURRENDER your FUTURE to him... For better or worse... And just what which of the 2 does it really seems to you for now...? You need not tell... But you should only see....</div></blockquote></div>
