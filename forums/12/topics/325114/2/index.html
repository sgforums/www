            <div class='col-md body'><p>Everyone has different purpose of life.<br>If you are looking at short term, you only need to concern about your 3 meals today, what food goes into your mouth and so on.<br>If you look a bit longer, you need to worry about where you get the money to support a comfortable life for yourself and your family. You need to have good health, study, work, socialize.<br>But the longest you can go is only a few decades coz that is limit of one’s life. Beyond that, people may not bother. But it doesn't mean they don't have to face it.<br>That's when people talk about after life, reincarnation.<br><br>Sometimes we may wonder why in society, some people are rich and some are either poor or being treated unfairly, because of action in past life. Why one feel so comfortable talking to a person in the first meetup, that is due to past life. Why someone and not anyone else being possessed by ghost, it’s all because of the debts in the past, and the ghost may speak a very ancient accent if his last rebirth is long time ago.<br>The late US president John F Kennedy after being assassinated, born as a boy in Germany. This boy can even remember details of his past life, like the office environment, his wife, home etc.<br>All these conclude that, our action will determine our future and it impact not just this life but also many after lifes. So, cherish every second, do the goods, avoid doing something harmful to other people. That is the most basic purpose of life.<br></p></div>

              <p>Frankly speaking, without a goal, I cannot stand where I am today.</p>
              <p>Not that I have done noble things, but being able to survive through years of education to college meant a lot to me.</p>
              <p>I was once recognised as an ultimate noob. In studies.</p>
              <p><em>People looked down on me, and I never thought that studying was great.</em></p>
              <p>But then, when i read news, successful people sharing reflections on society made me want to achieve something, even as simple as passing A Math.</p>
              <p>From then on, I was never who I was. I was no longer a cowardice. I had a hunger of wanting to do more for myself.</p>
              <p>I set <strong>goals</strong>, and I told myself I could do it. But I always fell, each one harder than the next. I broke down, I was utterly discouraged. But each time I fall, I stand up, each time more confident than the next. I was ready to move on.</p>
              <p>Though I'm not in any top schools in my life till now, I am more than contented that I could land in a college I'm satisfied enough to be in.</p>
              <p>Hence, I believed that if I had a heart to put into the best of my abilities into a goal I want to achieve, it can definitely be done. All it takes is DISCIPLINE.</p>
              <p>Goals are important.</p>
              <p>And for now, I just want to ace in my studies and secure an education job in the future to motivate people who are like me! (hopefully)</p>

              <p>The purpose of life is what slips past you while you're mucking about trying to define the purpose of your life.</p>
              <p>Unless you've got a crystal ball, there's always the likelihood that your best-defined purpose today will be absolutely irrelevant by breakfast tomorrow.  Stay felxible and go with the flow.</p>
              <p>That's not to say that everything's got to be lassiez-faire either.  Rather than wasting time trying to draw up the Master Plan, get a couple of SOPs that will apply in most, if not all, situations.  For example, one SOP that's served me well for a long time now is that if I'm not interested in something, it may as well not exist; on the other hand, if something does get my interest, for that point in time, it's the only thing that exists.  Anything in between is a half-hearted waste of time and effort.</p>

              <p>Frankly speaking, without a goal, I cannot stand where I am
              today.</p>
              <p>Not that I have done noble things, but being able to survive
              through years of education to college meant a lot to me.</p>
              <p>I was once recognised as an ultimate noob. In studies.</p>
              <p><em>People looked down on me, and I never thought that studying
              was great.</em></p>
              <p>But then, when i read news, successful people sharing
              reflections on society made me want to achieve something, even as
              simple as passing A Math.</p>
              <p>From then on, I was never who I was. I was no longer a
              cowardice. I had a hunger of wanting to do more for myself.</p>
              <p>I set <strong>goals</strong>, and I told myself I could do it.
              But I always fell, each one harder than the next. I broke down, I
              was utterly discouraged. But each time I fall, I stand up, each
              time more confident than the next. I was ready to move on.</p>
              <p>Though I'm not in any top schools in my life till now, I am more
              than contented that I could land in a college I'm satisfied enough
              to be in.</p>
              <p>Hence, I believed that if I had a heart to put into the best of
              my abilities into a goal I want to achieve, it can definitely be
              done. All it takes is DISCIPLINE.</p>
              <p>Goals are important.</p>
              <p>And for now, I just want to ace in my studies and secure an
              education job in the future to motivate people who are like me!
              (hopefully)</p>
