If you people can't control yourselves. Try to avoid petting and such in the 1st place.<br><br>2. If you really have to go for intimate behaviors, do it in the PUBLIC so as to avoid further activities.<br><br>3. Try to keep some condoms with you just IN CASE.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm....guys i think there's somebody who's really suffering from emotional stress and torture.<br><br>Hey peacely,<br>To answer your first qns. Does sex always comes with love?<br>I say yes, when a couple engage in intercourse. It is a form, expression beyond word. Knitting two souls, two body to one. Unexplainable and idealistic thought.<br><br>I would still it's a yes, Love and pleasure should be the theme in having sex.<br>Unfortunately, when man(human) takes things for granted...it'll become Lust and pleasure.<br>This brings me to the next point.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> If you think the both of you have loved one another to a point when intercourse - the forbidden fruit should should engaged.<br>Just remember that Pre-marital sex has a cost. Are you ready?<br>I should guess you are still young, fun is ok but too much fun is threading on line ice.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>Since it's a metal torture to you to wait for your period.<br>I think you are really not ready to take up the responsibility should anything happen. And you boy don't know what is he playing with.<br>You have expressed that the both of you have talked about it. Very good. However the practical part wasn't that successful.<br>My friend, i had that experience before...it was so tempting to a point when i got to tell my ex that i should go home. Otherwise, somethings would happen again. There were times when the both of us where extremely hurt over the things we did. It's a learning process, just don't let it ruin you.<br>The more you want to set boundaries the more you'll cross it. Sometimes it's so human for us to do so. That's why i call it the forbidden fruit.<br><br>Practice discipline and on top of that. The both of your mindset, needs to be changed....it's not only sex or staying in one another's house. Even though you guys have not much money. It doesn't mean you can't go to beach, kite-flying, strolling along the pavement. or have dinner together in hawker centre. Friend, it's not how much, it's now where you go, not even what you're doing....but ultimately it's WHO YOU'RE WITH <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation">  (trust me, i've learnt this the hard way)<br><br>You also said that you didn't confide in your circle of friend. Which qualifies him to be your one and only confidant.<br>Too bad you're a girl. Otherwise i am willing to talk to you. Anyway, you really should open your heart to someone you trust and know that she'll not reprimand you but support you. (sorry for the YOUs used in these para)<br><br>I hope you could be a responsible daughter and gf also.<br>Cause i can tell you that if you're hurt, he'll be hurt also.<br>On top of that, he might feel guilty hence crippling his senses to comfort and care for you during the time when you need his understanding and love most.<br><br>Remedy could be easy yet difficult.<br>That's to prevent sexual contact. Learning to value and respect one another thru abstainance.<br>You don't have to brake off to escape this kinda of torture.<br>Realise that in r/s, things and obstacles comes. Whether can the both of your hands clasp together and brave thru the strom is a question mark the two of you can answer.<br><br>I wish you well.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

And when there is relationship, sex related issues pops up. These three issues never leave each other and is heavily intertwined. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Regardless of how intimate your contacts with one another; pleasure is secondary. What matter most is how you consider for the other party while having the pleasure. No <strong>good</strong> boyfriend should force themselves on having sex while knowing that their girlfriend will be extremely uncomfortable (worrying, stress, tension, etc). It must be a mutual thing and their post-effect must be neutral/positive and not negative. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Guys read this: your girl may be willing, but if their post effect sucks - a <strong>good </strong>boyfriend will understand and avoid (or at least change alternative - use protection, etc if it can wipe out her worries.).<br><br>Your guy lack understanding and empathy on the matter. You have mentioned that you go over to his house very often over the course of one year plus into your relationship. Gradually, this becomes a routine and your relationship become stagnant. There is nothing wrong in enjoying physical intimacy, rather <strong>it musn't cause a problem.</strong> If it happens, your relationship will be in potential risk.<br><br>Advice?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> He has to see from your point of view. If you are simply not comfortable, he has to know and respect your decision. You could avoid placing yourself in vulnerable situation like going over to his place.<br><br>The main battle will come from communication between the two of you. You have to talk - and do not suffer this in silence. Trash this out with him and listen to what he has to say. You may be (or not) surprise by his reply. From this trashing session, you will realise whether this relationship is worth continuing or not. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>Quote of the day: Before he can learn to protect you from others, he must learn to protect you from himself.<br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>dearest peacely,<br><br>i personally feel that sex and love are two different things and doesn't necessarily have to come together. you can love without having sex (eg. couples who are 'unable').<br><br>i understand your pain of having to wait for your menstruation, because i have gone through that before. even though you didn't exactly have sex with him then, it is only natural that you will worry about getting pregnant.<br><br>my advice is that you get a home pregnancy test kit (like the one that has been advertised on television the past few days). this is the only way you can be certain whether you are pregnant or not. if the result is negative, then good for you. but if it's positive, then i suggest you tell your parents.<br><br>since you have rather "traditional" parents, it is inevitable that they will lecture you. there is no point trying to hide it from your parents if it's confirmed that you're pregnant, because they'll find out sooner or later. your belly will definately swell.<br><br>at this critical point of time, your parents are the only people who can help and advice you on what to do. besides, they are much more learned and experienced than you and your friends.<br><br>whether you want to break up with him or not is up to you, but whatever it is, i hope you make a right and wise decision. if you decide to stay with him, avoid going to his place too often. go out and find entertainment outdoors instead! it's much healthier and it will not cause any worries of you getting pregnant.<br><br>all the best!</div>

YOU are NO longer a VIRGIN... you are worrying of getting pregnant after having sex.... and your bf don't know how to make you worries go away...right?<br><br>Answer time (strictly personal views) : Guys are guys.... never good at console ppl...<br><br>What's done CANNOT be undone.... I rather you continues to worry about pregnancy cos that will prevent you from engaging in sexual activities and as long as you did it..... there's NO way not to worry about pregnancy.... there's no fool proof way about this.<br><br>You can actually prevent sexual activities from happening if you don't create the environment for it. Why go to his house, his room...where you 2 can easily be involved in sexually activties?<br><br>I'm never good at consoling ppl, all I want to say is that try not to create opportunities for sexual activeties and got yrself involved in it and create a mental stress for yourself. A good relationship can be without sex.<br><br>Be safe not sorry.... best wishes.</div>

However the practical part wasn't that successful.<br>My friend, i had that experience before...it was so tempting to a point when i got to tell my ex that i should go home. Otherwise, somethings would happen again. There were times when the both of us where extremely hurt over the things we did. It's a learning process, just don't let it ruin you.<br>The more you want to set boundaries the more you'll cross it. Sometimes it's so human for us to do so. That's why i call it the forbidden fruit.<br><br>Practice discipline and on top of that. The both of your mindset, needs to be changed....it's not only sex or staying in one another's house. Even though you guys have not much money. It doesn't mean you can't go to beach, kite-flying, strolling along the pavement. or have dinner together in hawker centre.

Anyway, you really should open your heart to someone you trust and know that she'll not reprimand you but support you. (sorry for the YOUs used in these para)<br><br>I hope you could be a responsible daughter and gf also.<br>Cause i can tell you that if you're hurt, he'll be hurt also.<br>On top of that, he might feel guilty hence crippling his senses to comfort and care for you during the time when you need his understanding and love most.<br><br>Remedy could be easy yet difficult.<br>That's to prevent sexual contact. Learning to value and respect one another thru abstainance.<br>You don't have to brake off to escape this kinda of torture.<br>Realise that in r/s, things and obstacles comes.

It just seems very natural. Maybe u feel that the more u control the more the two of you wants it even more. It happens when u try to avoid it too much. just talk it out with your bf. if u feel that you are not ready and won't be able to bear the consequence than reject with a firm NO. U won't want to hurt your parents and put them into mistrust for u.<br>Guys r not so sensitive as gers, so try to bear with them. they want their pride, that's y they put up a very strong front. actually they can be just a little hai zi qi.they get jealous easily only coz they care for u just like u will cry only for the man u love. they do like attention as much as us gers too just that they feel that they will appear weak and feminine, u know they have an image to keep up. Spare them some thought too, they are just as emotional just that they don't show it<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> Don't you guys agree?</div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow">  you are right that its almost quite impossible to supress feelings for each other for sex. and its extremely difficult to control the kind of urge when its out of control.<br>To me , this is jus like the addiction for smoking. Its very tough to quit it esp when u are always hanging ard with smokers.<br>Everytime when i cant control my feelings anymore and i give in to it , i got this kind of extremely GUILTH and SINFUL feeling. It became worse when i became paranoid abt it and start to think of its effects. To me , its jus like a gamble. and its not fun.<br>my bf cant even help me much when it happens , there is really nothing he can do .<br>i am jus stuck in the middle of 2 things which are just as important and its very terrible.<br><br>its quite useless to talk and discuss abt all these here coz this kind of things has got no real solution to it . but at least, i feel consoled when i knoe there are ppl out there who are willing to hear me out and provide consulation.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br></div>
