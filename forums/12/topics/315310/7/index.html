              Girls age of course hard to guess, in fact everybody else. Some lady may look chao lao but she is maybe onli 20+? If a female lecturer in ur school walks into your lecture room, she dress in tube, mini skirt and a high heel with a reborn long hair. You might think she is in her early 20s or mid? Maybe she is already married with 4 kids? a middle age woman? How to spot the different? Maybe there are some theory in it, perhaps you can show me?

              Girls age of course hard to guess, in fact everybody else. Some
              lady may look chao lao but she is maybe onli 20+? If a female
              lecturer in ur school walks into your lecture room, she dress in
              tube, mini skirt and a high heel with a reborn long hair. You might
              think she is in her early 20s or mid? Maybe she is already married
              with 4 kids? a middle age woman? How to spot the different? Maybe
              there are some theory in it, perhaps you can show me?</p>

              <p>Hi</p>
              <p>Actually rock sugar is actually a victim also.. because if the gal did not lie to him about her age, do u think the relationship would have a start? I am sure he would not date her out if he had known the truth about her age.. so the gal also has some part to play in this.. Actually she also play u out by lying abt her age.</p>
              <p>Secondly, the gal shldn't threaten to suicide, if she does this, she is too immatured for her age.. u could have tell her, what will you do, if there is this man u don't like but he threaten to suicide if u break with him? it is jus like forcing u to be with her, which isn't correct..</p>
              <p>u shld jus break up clean and for all.. let her takes time to forget about u. u can't force yourself to be with her coz she threaten to suicide.. y did she use this tactic to keep u at her side, if she really loves u, she will wan u to be happy too.</p>
              <p>Take it as a lesson lor.. next time know the gal better before u date her lor..</p>

              <p><br>Unker, did you really carefully went through TS original post or not? He himself said he was desperate for a relationship that was why he went aheadÂ  with the girl (woman 30 liao<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Violet/omg.png" alt="omg.png">)despite her shortcoming like this...</p>

Out of desperation for a partner, I force myself to be with her even though my type of girl isnât her. I mean I try to develop some feelings for her..."</span></strong></p>
              <p>The above was exactly TS words. So? Who is to blame? He victim? LOL. As I've said both also desperate. Both try to cheat one another and themeselves. And TS must be soooooo blind that he couldn't see from his gf appearance to determine her age. Or in this case sooooo desperate that 'no fish prawn oso can lah situation.
