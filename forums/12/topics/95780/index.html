Being rejected does not mean end of the world.. She has mentioned to you that she will not brush aside your confession to her.. That shows she has already know that you have feelings for her.. The part where she said lets be closer frens is a big hint that she will consider abt you..<br><br>What you can do is continue to chase her.. That sign means you need to work hard to win her heart.. Its good that you have confess to her that you like her... work your way into her heart.. touch her heart..<br><br>Being rejected does nt mean giving up on her.. If you rush into things, and she agree with you in a haste manner, you 2 may not work things out.. Take it nice and slow.. and i believe she will be yours if things turn out right..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

I'm not saying all girls are this way but I certainly know some that were...<br><br>The problem thus is indentifying whether she's one of those girls...<br><br>For the threadstarter, my advice is continue and be her close friend and if a better girl happens to cross your path and she hasn't give any indication that she wants to develop things farther then... tell her your decision and for her blessings...</div>

ANd got rejected.. Now wat you can do is to be friends with her first.. At least she din back off when she knows that you like her.. And she's still willing to be friends with you.. You can secretly like her since young.. but how much have you know about her..<br><br>Start off from friends first.. get to know and understand her better.. Like what she says.. Let nature take its course.. She's giving you and herself a chance.. But this takes time.. there's no rush for all this.. Anyway.. i don't believe by doing alot of things for a girl.. she will be touched or moved by what you did.. I rather you be YOURSELF.. and lead the normal life you always do..<br><br>Does no need to do extra or purposely do something for her.. like buying gifts.. etc.. But of cos bday is ok.. Jus treat her as normal friends.. like how you treat your other gal-friends too.. Like that she feel more comfortable when you both are out..<br><br>CHeers..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
