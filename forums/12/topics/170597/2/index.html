            <div class='col-md body'>haha erm i noticed you wrote 'the girl you LIKE' not the girl you planning to marry right... don't think so much until you get to the bridge la. and when you get to the bridge you two will noe what to do, cuz love between you two will be strong enuff for either one of you to make sacrifices for each other.<br><br>just to clarify people, my buddhist mom got married to my christian dad. who says it's not possible? n it's not rare either cuz quite a few of my frenz have christian and free thinker or buddhist parents. in fact i feel it is more likely that a buddhist would want the entire family to be buddhist lor. (in church my frenz always have to sneak out cuz parents don approve of christianity, then some even beat their children for not following tradition. i noe not everyone does that la just citing some examples). But both of my parents were not very extreme in their religion, thus there was no forcing nor fake 'compromising'. recently then my mom converted to christianity of her own will. <span style="color: white;">(she was touched by God and not due to any influence from my dad or other forces). </span> budden i just sharing my story la not trying to insert any religious thingy in here. anyway if it's the girl you like right, if she likes you she would probably respect your decision to remain a buddhist lor... the only other reason she would say she don wanna be with u becuz u not christian is that she using it as an excuse cuz she doesn't like you...<br><br>hope that helps...</div>
