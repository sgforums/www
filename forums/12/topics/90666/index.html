It is just a simple character/personality issue. Open up your heart to the people around you, you got nothing to lose. Socialising is a skill that simply cannot be picked up overnight, but it is something that you are missing in your character/personality. I'm not asking you to be a fake person and pretend to mix around with people around you. Instead, if you are able to prove to people that you can charm them with your character/personality for just one time...then you can go ahead and say that they are boring. If you are unable to do that, then I have to tell you that the fault lies within yourself and you are simply a boring person to mix around with.<br><br>It is easy to take step back and accuse everybody of being boring, but are you sure that you are not the person who is boring out everybody in the first place? Take up the challenge to add effective socialising into your character/personality...it is afterall a life skill which will greatly benefit your social life and future career.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Good luck.</div>
