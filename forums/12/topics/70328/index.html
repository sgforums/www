            <div class='col-md body'>i know this is a very famous story just wanna share it with people here...cuz its one of the most touching emails i've come across, it was sent to me in 2001 and i've kept it till now...<br><br>&gt;The salty coffee<br>&gt;<br>&gt;He met her on a party, she was so outstanding, many<br>&gt;guys chasing after her,while he was so normal, nobody<br>&gt;paid attention to him. At the end of the party, he<br>&gt;invited her to have coffee with him, she was<br>&gt;surprised, but due to polite, she promised. They sat<br>&gt;in a nice coffee shop, he was too nervous to say<br>&gt;anything, she felt uncomfortable, she thought, please,<br>&gt;let me back home..suddenly he asked the waiter: would<br>&gt;you please give me some salt? I'd like to put it in my<br>&gt;coffee. Everybody stared at him, so strange! His face<br>&gt;turned red, but, still, he put the salt in his coffee<br>&gt;and drank it.<br>&gt;She asked him curiously: why you have this hobby? He<br>&gt;replied: when I was a little boy, I was living near<br>&gt;the sea, I like playing in the sea, I could felt the<br>&gt;taste of the sea, salty and bite, just like the taste<br>&gt;of the salty coffee. Now every time I have the salty<br>&gt;coffee. I will think of my childhood, think of my<br>&gt;hometown, I miss my hometown so much, I miss my<br>&gt;parents who still living there. Saying that, tears<br>&gt;filled his eyes.<br>&gt;She was deeply touched. That's his true feeling, from<br>&gt;the bottom of his heart. A man who can tell out his<br>&gt;homesick, he must be a man loves home, cares about<br>&gt;home, has responsibility of home..Then she also<br>&gt;started to talk, talked about her faraway hometown,<br>&gt;her childhood, her family. that was a really nice<br>&gt;talk, also a beautiful beginning of their story.<br>&gt;They continue to date. She found actually he was a man<br>&gt;who meets all her demands: he was tolerance, kind<br>&gt;hearted, warm, careful...he was such a good guy but<br>&gt;she almost missed him! Thanks to his salty coffee!<br>&gt;Then the story was just like every beautiful love<br>&gt;story: the princess married to the prince, then they<br>&gt;were living the happy made coffee for him, she put<br>&gt;some salt in the coffee, as she knew that's the way he<br>&gt;liked.<br>&gt;After 40 years, he passed away, left her a letter<br>&gt;which said: My dearest, please forgive me, forgive my<br>&gt;whole life lie. This was the only lie I said to<br>&gt;you----the salty coffee. Remember the first time we<br>&gt;dated? I was so nervous at that time, actually I<br>&gt;wanted some sugar, but I said salt. It's hard for me<br>&gt;to change so I just go ahead. I never thought that<br>&gt;could be the start of our communication! I tried to<br>&gt;tell you the truth many times in my life, but I was<br>&gt;too afraid to do that, as I have promised not to lie<br>&gt;to you for anything..Now I'm dying, I'm afraid of<br>&gt;nothing so I tell you the truth: I don't like the<br>&gt;salty coffee, what a strange bad taste..but I have the<br>&gt;salty coffee for my whole life since I knew you, I<br>&gt;never feel sorry for anything I do for you. Having you<br>&gt;with me is my biggest happiness for my whole life. If<br>&gt;I can live for the second time, I still want to know<br>&gt;you and have you as my whole life wife, even though I<br>&gt;have to drink the salty coffee again.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Her tears made the letter totally wet.<br>&gt;Someday, someone asked her: what's the taste of salty<br>&gt;coffee? It's sweet. She replied.<br></div>
