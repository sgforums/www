[/b]</blockquote>The saying that JC students gain auto entry into unis are just rumours.. There is no such thing in real life.. This saying came abt is cause of the nos of JC students entering Uni and many people have that thinking where JC students "automatically" gets in to Uni if and when their grades are up to uni entry requirements.<br><br>Many poly students are making questions to the government is because only 5% to 10% of poly students make it to local uni.. Which makes up almost 80% to 85% JC students and the rest making it foreign students.. Basing on the percentages comparing poly to JC students, one can easily tell that JC students to go into uni stand a higher chance..<br><br>Each tertiary institutions have different levels of "competition". Jcs will def fight with well known JC like RJC etc.. That DOES NOT mean that poly does not have it.. There are many polys coming up and there will definately be competition.. making it almost 10% of students going into uni, don't you think the chances are slimer than JC students?<br><br>You cannot use the term USELESS with an A level cert.. If one scores well enough in that cert, with no money to go to a uni or rather, don wish to pursue a uni life YET, one can still go into a work force and their pay is much higher than a student who comes out frm a poly.. It depends on which field of course..<br><br></div>

Sure ...You can tell them to build another one - it will be a while before the university will be recognised as an equal to NUS/NTU .

Are you going to whine that it is unfair that the person has the brains and money to go to oxford ?

If you think it's so difficult and you can't compete for a place in the university because you are goin to be competing with top JC students and extra competition from the poly students, why bother in the first place?</div>

The number of people getting into the uni remains the same, there is no increase of the population of students... just that the poly students are getting better.. scoring results better than jc students... so they got the place... the unis did not increase the amt of poly students for nothing.. if most of them have just 'normal' results, you think our 'top' local unis will accept us, they throw our application into the dustbin...<br><br>and what makes u think a new uni will do us good? the new uni needs time to gain reputation... no one will bothers to choose unless they have no choice... and end up with nothing... so stop whining.....</div>

You have to think he is probably in the same situation as some of your jc friends...prolly he doesn't have to money to go overseas too. That resulted in that letter of frustration. It doesn't bode well on him if he didn't get his facts right. Let's all get over that and move on.<br><br>Now this part I have to love:<br><strong>well...i feel that another uni wil help solve the problem of jc and poly students.or at least provide some more happiness...and relief..</strong><br><br>*takes a deep breath*  Does a degree really really mean that much to you ....so much so that you don't care if the university you go to doesn't have at least an international reputation ?<br><br>Think long and hard my dear. Hypothetically let's name that 4th university Noname Uni. Now if you are an employer and you are looking at a couple of candidates : what do you see?<br>Oxford University VS Noname Uni<br>Harvard University VS Noname Uni<br>Princeton University Vs Noname Uni<br>University of London Vs Noname Uni<br>National University of Singapore VS Noname Uni<br>Nanyang Technological University VS  Noname Uni<br>University of Melbourne VS Noname Uni<br>London Imperial College VS Noname Uni<br>University of New South Wales VS Noname Uni<br><br>Now who would you employ if some are asking for the same starting pay and assuming all of them are nice.<br><br>You from Noname Uni or the others ? Need I say more?<br><br>Why would you think it will give you or any others relief? From what my dad says, if an NUS grad comes to you asking for the same salary as with another grad from a noname university - u take the NUS grad. Why choose a non designer shoe when you can have a gucci/prada whichever? You see ,it is rather naive to think a 4th university will really help you. <strong> Most people I know want places in NUS and NTU increased. </strong>  <span style="font-style: italic;">Why?</span><strong> Because they are established and have some form of academic reputation. People know NUS for medicine and law internationally while NTU is recognised well locally  </strong><br><br>No offence meant but a 4th university is impractical and totally illogical. If you are that desperate for a degree , you might as well get an external degree from London University (they offer distance) and London degrees are acceptable overseas . Do well in the degree and maybe save enough to do an actual on campus post grad program in a prestigious university.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: indigo;">As compared to other countries..we really only have a few unis and it's really competitive.<br><br>But then I think, given the opportunity and if financial situation approves, then perhaps more would prefer to study overseas.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> </span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Not only that , the job market in Singapore is also very competitive. There are some NUS/NTU grads who cannot even find jobs and resulted in working as a clerk etc.<br><br>So Klutzgal , if you want a place in university , compete for it. Don't just think an extra university will help you get a degree. It won't help you at all when the 4th uni is not recognised.<br><br>And besides don't look down on where you are studying. My sis is in one of Monash's external campuses and she says there are some jc students from good jcs , who are struggling in the degree . Everything is a challenge . Good Degrees are not easy to come by and you will always have to compete against someone better.<br><br>When you go to university , you will find out even marks affect your degree in the job market. Unis have rankings 1st class hons, 2nd class(upper and lower) and there are people who have obtained prizes from exceling in certain subjects which they will hammer down in their resumes .<br><br>All I can say . Don't worry about university yet. I presume , you haven't even done your A levels. Just focus on your weakpoints and try to strengthen them.</div>
