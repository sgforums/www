            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Yunhaier:</div><div class="quote_body">  The first time for a guy to approach woman during his life, be it a senseless dare or pure admiration, somehow or another, ounce of energy will gradually flow in you until it accumulates pass a climax, then a sudden urge of doing silly things to know her happens. Before you know it, everything happens in a flash, and when you think back, you wondered how on earth did you manage to do or say something as retard.<br><br>I am in similar hypothetical situation.<br><br>I observed her since two days and for some diabolical reasons, something stuck me, whispering to me in telepathy mode that I have to know her. Must have one of Cupid's bow shot went haywire and got into me - my eyes never left her. She is petite and small, with long flawless hair. Her features were well defined - especially her eyes that captured my soul in the first wink I caught from her. She is not those drop-dead gorgeous model's style, but when she smiles and her two dimples creases into her cheeks deeply, nothing on earth is sweeter than her. Her charisma and the air that saturates around her is angelic and when I am near her, to close for comfort (it'ssimply stressing), she smelled like a walking conditioner.<br><br>I have to know her, if I want this piece of dream to turn into reality. If it were something of my forte, it would have been as simple as snapping my fingers, but I had never approach a girl before. What do you expect from someone who studied in an all guys school since Primary One and not even a single sister at home? Female of similar age don't exist in my environment since I graduated from kindergarten, which was like years ago?<br><br>Today is the last day of school, which means starting from tomorrow, two months worth of vacation began. Then, my chances of seeing her will be zero because she doesn't even stay near me; she stayed near my good friend, Jerry, private estate. Fate has enabled us to meet because two days back, because I have been going to Jerry's house and I would only see her at the bus stop. So everything needs to be done today!<br><br>She is sitting in front of me and my mind is virtually blank, thinking of a good way to start a decent conversation with her.<br><br>Then, the bus appeared into sight and my set my pulse racing - I am losing my time resources!<br><br>The bus slowed down to a gradually stop and we both board it.<br><br>I chose a seat near the back and sat down, watching her walked passed me and sat behind. A wave of uneasiness washed over me as I could even sense her gaze on my back. There was an internal war waging inside me as I am fighting against trying to walk over to introduce myself and to remain rational.<br><br>Finally our stop came and we got down.<br><br>She walked at a quickened pace, reckoning that I am stalking her behind. Every seconds is slipping passed me and beads of sweats broke out at strategic part of my forehead. I can't let this final chance go by!<br><br>She went through the gate of the estate by now and my mind is in state of desperation. Watching her gradually moving towards her block is unimaginable.<br><br>Come on Cloud you could do it! OR you are gonna lose this chance forever!?<br><br>A surge of false strength filled my veins as I ran towards her. When I came arm length distance from her, I delivered a light tap onto her shoulder.<br><br>She turned around, as if expecting all that would happen and gave me a curious look.<br><br>Hi, I was...was wondering if I...I...could get to know you and be your friend??<br><br>All the energy in me had expanded in this stuttering sentence I blurted. My face is beginning to blush red with shyness as I waited for any respond.<br><br>She smiled faintly and gosh, that nearly sweep me off my feet.<br><br>Five minutes went by and everything happened as smoothly as any successful mission. We exchanged numbers and I learned that she is not exactly local; she is a half Japanese who came to Singapore to study. Her name is Yukiko, which means snow in Japanese ?like her unblemished skin, fair and silky-like.<br><br>Then she said she had to leave and with a dumb smile reciprocating her sweet ones, we parted.<br><br>I looked back at her for one final time, before running and yelling at the top of my voice that I made it. Did I mention knocking onto the lamppost and actually apologized to it?<br><br>(To be continued...)</div></blockquote>if this is a real life story..... i wish u all the best.... =)<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I arrived early as usual, this time about 15 minutes earlier, waiting for her outside Macdonald patently. Reckoning about her sudden wanting to meet me suggested motives, thatÂ’s what TV drama always show. Maybe she needed a large sum of money, borrow from me and then disappear into thin airÂ… hiakÂ… the effect of TOO much TVÂ… again.<br><br>As I was busy throwing impossible scenarios into the pictures to cease my tension, she stood in front of me. As I looked up, I noticed her face is getting fairer and whiter to the extend of being pale, but nevertheless her sparkling eyes never loses its glow. Must be the effect of those skin whitening Japanese beauty product.<br><br>Â‘Waited long?Â’<br><br>Â‘Only about 5 minutesÂ…Â’<br><br>My first lie I made to her. But it was for good cause.<br><br>We went into Mac and sat near the window seats, where we could look out towards the roadside.<br><br>Â‘What do you want, I buy for youÂ…Â’<br><br>Â‘You eat anything, I eat anythingÂ…Â’<br><br>I went to buy for her and decide upon Mac Nuggets Meal as she is a small eater. Less than an instant, 2 packets of large fries, 2 large coke and two boxes of 6-pieces nugget was on the tray as I carried them. Somehow, I noticed that she was looking at me with such mesmerizing effect that I nearly unbalanced myself.<br><br>Â‘CloudÂ… why are you so good to me?Â…Â’<br><br>Good? What you mean good? You mean you want me to trick you to bed and after that meet about for sessions like this? Thinking back, only bastard guys would do that and being a good guy, I shall uphold my reputation.<br><br>Â‘What you mean?Â’<br><br>Â‘Before those day when you wanted to know me, I was actually getting a little irritated when you stalked meÂ…Â’<br><br>Â‘Oh really?Â… I must have seen like a pervert or something to you right?Â…Â’<br><br>She giggled out of a sudden and I wondered what she meant.<br><br>Â‘But then againÂ… till now, I realize that you are different from other guys that wanted to know meÂ…Â’<br><br>What? There are other idiots doing the same thing too? Oh well, I am NOT surprised, considering her lovable nature and attractiveness.<br><br>Â‘You are my best friend and appreciated itÂ… and must be fated that will know each other right?Â’<br><br>Fate again. Why must woman always bring up the topic of fate everytime when it comes to relation of any kind? I nodded my head a little. She seemed a little solemn today and I reckoned that if there is anything I could give in to her, I should give in. I tried to cheer her up a little as the topic she started were on the emotional side. I spoke some joke and she giggled a little as we continue to our meals. Sometimes I feel that she is the only person in the world that appreciate what I am doing Â– be it stupid, silly, cute, dumb or whatever shit. It is not much, but she always responded.<br><br>We finished our meals and were playing with our straws like little kids. As we had our little Â‘fightingÂ’, I looked into her eyes and her eyes seemed to tell me that she may have gone through a lot of in during these period. I donÂ’t know what was the problem may be, but all my mind was telling me was to make her happy Â– simple and sincere.<br><br>Â‘Can we go somewhere where I could see the sea?Â’<br><br>We took a taxi down to Marina Bay. Reached in while moment, we got out and walked close to the shores where the waves roar in protest from the raging winds. The sky is densely clouded and the breezes is strong, but just nice enough for comfort. We sat down side by side and watched the waves continual sweeping up the shores.<br><br>Suddenly she position and lean herself on my back with her head facing up, looking at the nightly sky. I told myself never would I forget such day. The first intimate bodily contact I had with a girl back to back, just like two hearts melted in one. We spoke nothing, just revelling in natureÂ’s enjoyment.<br><br>Â‘The sky is beautiful right?Â…Â’<br><br>I looked at the sky and to me, it appeared as if itÂ’s going to rain soon. Then she stopped leaning on me, and looked into me. As if a soldier going for war, my gaze never left hers Â– I have decide not to avoid it. We studied each other gaze for a moment and after what seemed like eternity, I could see a layer of wetness in her eyes.<br><br>Â‘CloudÂ… would you remember me?Â…Â’<br><br>Actually I was wondering why she sobbed, but it seemed that maybe she wants to bring out something to tell me and I suspect it is nothing good. I nodded my head to her question and her gaze move onto the rough sea.<br><br>Â‘Why? I will never forget youÂ… is there something wrong?Â’<br><br>She kept quiet, rolling her vision between the sea and the sky before looking down...<br><br>(To be continued...)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Yunhaier:</div><div class="quote_body">  It was two months since I knew her and we have always talk online. Our relation are like good friends now. Jerry told me to go after her, but my heart doesnÂ’t want to sacrifice this stable friendship for now. Maybe because I had never had a girlfriend before and always have this phobia of relationship not lasting behind my head.<br><br>I came home quite late and logging onto IRC and yes! She is there. Before I could catch my breathe for walking back home from the bus stop, she sent me a messageÂ…<br><br>Â‘Cloud, so late still never sleep ar?Â’<br><br>I heard my mumÂ’s voice lurking in the background, commanding me to finish the leftover food in the kitchen. If my mum knew that I ate in school already, I guess she is gonna skin me alive.<br><br>Â‘Just came back from school, you?Â’<br><br>Â‘I waited for you to come onlineÂ…Â’<br><br>Waited for me? Sometimes girls can be such cute little thing. Words like these seemed like healing wards for the day fatigue. Jerry said that guys must be sweet talkers and romantic, wellÂ… I am none of the above. But when he stressed his point, I tried learning to be one.<br><br>Â‘Why leh? Miss me ar? HAHAHAHA!Â’<br><br>I know the laughter was just to cover my embarrassment, but hey, thatÂ’s a good attempt.<br><br>Â‘<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">Â…Â’<br><br>Â‘Cloud, I am moody todayÂ…Â’<br><br>Â‘ReallyÂ…? What happen?Â’<br><br>Â‘My good friend just broke up with her boyfriend todayÂ…Â’<br><br>Somehow girls are very affected over things happening to their friends in matters of love. Guys would normally tell them to move on with their life and stuff, whereas they would share their pain and sorrow or cry with them. Maybe thatÂ’s why girls always tell one another about their personal problem?<br><br>Â‘WellÂ…itÂ’s getting common isnÂ’t it? Relationship are breaking up every now and thenÂ…Â’<br><br>Â‘I seen them come together and they have been together for 3 months plusÂ… so longÂ…Â’<br><br>Three months and you called that long? ItÂ’s not even longer than a semester. Maybe people involved will find it longer than it seemed to be. I am a counsellor in school and people approach me for all kind of interpersonal relation problem. Maybe thatÂ’s why I have another point of view? But when it comes to myself, I am such a dickhead.<br><br>Â‘If they were meant to be togetherÂ…wellÂ… they will be together right? Sometimes not being together is a good thingÂ…couples not suited for each other being force to be together is a painful thingÂ…Â’<br><br>Â‘FateÂ…?Â’<br><br>Fate to me is like a legend; everyone talks about it, rant about it, thank God about it, but when it comes to relation, I have never gotten myself a girlfriend, so I know nuts about it.<br><br>Â‘ErrÂ… you could say that?Â’<br><br>Â‘Then are we fated to know each otherÂ… CloudÂ…?Â’<br><br>I always hated it whenever girls corner me with questions that neither YES nor NO is the right answer. Just when I am stuck with her questions, my mum with her pissed off face come knocking at my door, demanded that I finish the food left for me.<br><br>Â‘Hey, I have go off for now to eat supperÂ… answer you another timeÂ…Â’<br><br>Â‘<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">Â…Â’<br><br>Â‘Come onÂ… gif me a smile ok? I treat you movie next timeÂ…Â’<br><br>Â‘You say wan arÂ… <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">Â… I see you tomorrow ok?Â’<br><br>Well, it seemed that the treating trick always works. HeyÂ… it means that I can make use of this excuse to catch a movie with her! I am such a fast learner.<br><br>Â‘Ok! bye bye!Â’<br><br>The next thing I see is the Â‘DISCONNECTÂ’ word on my computer. Grinning from ear to ear, I skip my way to the kitchen.<br><br>(To be continued...)</div></blockquote>when she ask u the important qns...and u tell her u have to log off.... u might make her mis understand leh that u r not interested and trying to avoid the issue.....</div>
