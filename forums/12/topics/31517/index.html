            <div class='col-md body'>The first time for a guy to approach woman during his life, be it a senseless dare or pure admiration, somehow or another, ounce of energy will gradually flow in you until it accumulates pass a climax, then a sudden urge of doing silly things to know her happens.

Must have one of Cupid's bow shot went haywire and got into me - my eyes never left her. She is petite and small, with long flawless hair. Her features were well defined - especially her eyes that captured my soul in the first wink I caught from her. She is not those drop-dead gorgeous model's style, but when she smiles and her two dimples creases into her cheeks deeply, nothing on earth is sweeter than her. Her charisma and the air that saturates around her is angelic and when I am near her, to close for comfort (it'ssimply stressing), she smelled like a walking conditioner.<br><br>I have to know her, if I want this piece of dream to turn into reality. If it were something of my forte, it would have been as simple as snapping my fingers, but I had never approach a girl before.

            <div class='col-md body'>It was two months since I knew her and we have always talk online. Our relation are like good friends now. Jerry told me to go after her, but my heart doesnÂ’t want to sacrifice this stable friendship for now. Maybe because I had never had a girlfriend before and always have this phobia of relationship not lasting behind my head.<br><br>I came home quite late and logging onto IRC and yes! She is there. Before I could catch my breathe for walking back home from the bus stop, she sent me a messageÂ…<br><br>Â‘Cloud, so late still never sleep ar?Â’<br><br>I heard my mumÂ’s voice lurking in the background, commanding me to finish the leftover food in the kitchen. If my mum knew that I ate in school already, I guess she is gonna skin me alive.<br><br>Â‘Just came back from school, you?Â’<br><br>Â‘I waited for you to come onlineÂ…Â’<br><br>Waited for me? Sometimes girls can be such cute little thing. Words like these seemed like healing wards for the day fatigue. Jerry said that guys must be sweet talkers and romantic, wellÂ… I am none of the above. But when he stressed his point, I tried learning to be one.<br><br>Â‘Why leh? Miss me ar? HAHAHAHA!Â’<br><br>I know the laughter was just to cover my embarrassment, but hey, thatÂ’s a good attempt.<br><br>Â‘<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">Â…Â’<br><br>Â‘Cloud, I am moody todayÂ…Â’<br><br>Â‘ReallyÂ…? What happen?Â’<br><br>Â‘My good friend just broke up with her boyfriend todayÂ…Â’<br><br>Somehow girls are very affected over things happening to their friends in matters of love. Guys would normally tell them to move on with their life and stuff, whereas they would share their pain and sorrow or cry with them. Maybe thatÂ’s why girls always tell one another about their personal problem?<br><br>Â‘WellÂ…itÂ’s getting common isnÂ’t it? Relationship are breaking up every now and thenÂ…Â’<br><br>Â‘I seen them come together and they have been together for 3 months plusÂ… so longÂ…Â’<br><br>Three months and you called that long? ItÂ’s not even longer than a semester. Maybe people involved will find it longer than it seemed to be. I am a counsellor in school and people approach me for all kind of interpersonal relation problem. Maybe thatÂ’s why I have another point of view? But when it comes to myself, I am such a dickhead.<br><br>Â‘If they were meant to be togetherÂ…wellÂ… they will be together right? Sometimes not being together is a good thingÂ…couples not suited for each other being force to be together is a painful thingÂ…Â’<br><br>Â‘FateÂ…?Â’<br><br>Fate to me is like a legend; everyone talks about it, rant about it, thank God about it, but when it comes to relation, I have never gotten myself a girlfriend, so I know nuts about it.<br><br>Â‘ErrÂ… you could say that?Â’<br><br>Â‘Then are we fated to know each otherÂ… CloudÂ…?Â’<br><br>I always hated it whenever girls corner me with questions that neither YES nor NO is the right answer. Just when I am stuck with her questions, my mum with her pissed off face come knocking at my door, demanded that I finish the food left for me.<br><br>Â‘Hey, I have go off for now to eat supperÂ… answer you another timeÂ…Â’<br><br>Â‘<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">Â…Â’<br><br>Â‘Come onÂ… gif me a smile ok? I treat you movie next timeÂ…Â’<br><br>Â‘You say wan arÂ… <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">Â… I see you tomorrow ok?Â’<br><br>Well, it seemed that the treating trick always works. HeyÂ… it means that I can make use of this excuse to catch a movie with her! I am such a fast learner.<br><br>Â‘Ok! bye bye!Â’<br><br>The next thing I see is the Â‘DISCONNECTÂ’ word on my computer. Grinning from ear to ear, I skip my way to the kitchen.<br><br>(To be continued...)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Â‘Cloud! You are finally here!Â’<br><br>I looked at the clock and it says 10 pm. No, I am not late, rather I am pretty early using IRC entering our usual chat room.<br><br>Â‘Cloud, my good friend tried to patch back with her bf todayÂ… but he ignore herÂ…Â’<br><br>WellÂ… guys of these days are not looking for serious relation. People have to get to know and go through more relation before they could realise that who is the right one for them what.<br><br>Â‘She cried you knowÂ… so poor thingÂ… then that guy said that he likes another girlÂ…Â’<br><br>A Chinese proverb came into my mind Â– Tian ya he chu wu fang cao. Why cry wasted tears over a relation that was never meant to be yours in the first place? Human, even though are emotional creatures, after a period of time, everything will just be a memory of what had taken place.<br><br>Â‘Yah I told her to move on with her life, but she loved him so much and she couldnÂ’t believe that he like someone elseÂ… if I am her, I will also dunno what the doÂ…Â’<br><br>DonÂ’t know what to do? Make yourself happy instead of lingering in this sorrowful event? Sometimes I really wonder if woman are that dumb? Or is it love that is making woman a vulnerable creature? And what makes you think THAT it is love? Woman, in their first love, love their lovers, in others, they loved loveÂ…<br><br>Â‘Really?Â…Â’<br><br>All woman loves romance. It is like salt and sugar in cooking. Without it, whatever relation will be bland.<br><br>Â‘What about you Cloud?Â’<br><br>Me? How come the topic is about me now? I always avoid questions whenever it comes to me in revealing my inner self. It is like exposing yourself to danger through speaking. People, whom you least expected it, betray the trust you given to them and you will have to go through this series of utter disappointment and sadness. Ok I admitÂ… I watch TOO much TV.<br><br>Â‘Me? What about me?Â’<br><br>Â‘What if something like that happens to you?Â’<br><br>Â‘ErÂ… it wonÂ’t lar. I donÂ’t even have a gfÂ…Â’<br><br>Â‘Why? Go get one?Â’<br><br>Â‘Â…Â’<br><br>Â‘y? something is wrong?Â’<br><br>Ok baby, this would be the catalysis to explode my innermost views again.<br><br>Â‘I donÂ’t want to get a gf for the SAKE of getting oneÂ… its meaningless donÂ’t you think? Relation nowadays are going nowhere because people just want to be in a relation. They are afraid to be alone - they WANT someone to walk by them. Be it emotionally, sexually or physically. I donÂ’t mind being alone - I like it! Until maybe when the special one comes along, I will try my best to be with her, doing stuff together and most importantly, grow togetherÂ…Â’<br><br>There was an unaccustomed silence after I type that paragraph. My fingers speed through the keyboard and finally stop at the last word. Oh shit! Have I just ruined my good impression? I discern its time to celebrate with Jerry about my first failure.<br><br>Â‘You are right CloudÂ…Â’<br><br>Hooray!! I could see my happiness on the computer screen, signalling to my victory of words.<br><br>Â‘I want to stay single, until the special one comes along tooÂ… <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">Â…Â’<br><br>Oh wait, how could cute girls like her possibly stay single? Guys will try all sorts of ways to get her and she would finally succumb to one. She is too cute to stay singleÂ…<br><br>Â‘/me blushedÂ… no I am not cuteÂ…Â’<br><br>She is such a poor liar. When you praise a girl pretty, they would tell you they look ugly. When you say that they look like toilet, she retaliate and bites back, saying you look worstÂ… such is mentality of a woman.<br><br>Â‘I girl mah, that why will also be like thatÂ… =PÂ’<br><br>From a close defeated battle, I have eventually emerge the winner as I continue to chat with her for the next two hours. Somehow, during these periods of knowing her, I had never asked about the background of her family or sort, but we talk everything else. I loved to chat with her as she is way so different from all the other girls Â– she is VERY naÃ¯ve and this creates an impulse for me to protect her, to guide her along. She showed me the real innocence of a young lady, untainted and pure. I love the way she is, naturally cute and THIS is the reasons that stop me from jioing her Â– I canÂ’t take advantage of her innocence right?<br><br>Â‘CloudÂ… I have to go alreadyÂ… its getting lateÂ…Â’<br><br>Â‘I have to leave tooÂ…Oh yeahÂ… its almost 12 and my Cinderella has to leaveÂ… HAHAHAHA!Â’<br><br>Why is it that I must laugh every time I attempt a MUSHY statement? A lousy cover for my embarrassment.<br><br>Â‘<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">Â…Â’<br><br>Â‘CloudÂ… you say the other time you wanna treat me movie right?Â’<br><br>Ok, my hypnotic statement has hinted her! YEAH!<br><br>Â‘Lets watch movie together tomorrow ok?Â’<br><br>ErÂ… ok!Â’<br><br>My mind was cheering and screaming in rejoice. All hail cupid for the golden opportunity!<br><br>Â‘OkÂ… Cloud you log off first, I donÂ’t want you to see me goÂ…Â’<br><br>Â‘AwwÂ…ok I count to 3 and leaveÂ…Â’<br><br>I canÂ’t believe I am doing this SILLY business.<br><br>Â‘3Â…2Â…1Â…gone!Â’<br><br>I couldnÂ’t get to sleep on that day, totally excited about tomorrowÂ’s event. Going out with a girl? I had never been out with one before! Praying at my bedside sincerely that nothing will screwed up on that day.<br><br>(To be continued...)</div>
