            <div class='col-md body'>So...Yunhaier thinks he can find the special one by judging from how a girl looks? Or that he can find the special one by boarding more buses?<br><br>Your thinking is sensible and mature in that you don't want to get into a relationship for the mere sake of having someone there, but by going out with this girl you are telling her she can be the potential "special someone". Not good to give her false hops dude. It really looks like she's way into you right now...cos she's taking initiative to ask you to a movie. Girls usually can PRETEND they don't get the hint, or that they forgot(yeah right) about it.<br><br>Well good luck for your movie date. And try not to compliment her too much on her appearance because she may start thinking you're only interested in her looks. (BECAUSE you approached her spurred on by her beauty...and "walking conditioner" scent.)<br><br>Happy fishing! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It was 8.40 pm and I was at Starbucks (20 minutes before appointment point) Â– Plaza Singapura, the location we suppose to meet. It is not polite to be late for a date for the first time anyway. Slipping my favourite ice blended mocha, I waited.<br><br>I was daydreaming about todayÂ’s soccer match I played and started pondering over life issues and soccer; Life is like soccerÂ… you never know when you gonna get hit by the ball in your face. What load of crap!<br><br>As I was trying to entertain myself to relieve some amount of tension in me, I sense her presence Â– the smell, I can never forget. I looked up and saw her smiling and making her way towards me. She is simply stunning and like a critical hit, I was stoned watching her coming. White spaghetti straps top with jean skirtsÂ… Woah, I simply love girls wearing skirts. It makes them lookedÂ… moreÂ…ermÂ…more female.<br><br>Â‘Sorry I am lateÂ…Â’<br><br>Â‘Nah, its Ok. I am just early myselfÂ…Â’<br><br>Â‘So what movie are we watching?Â…Â’<br><br>Â‘ItÂ’s ok, we will check it out later, anyway what matter most is who I am watching with, not the showÂ…Â’<br><br>She blushed and I nearly died saying that sentence. HeyÂ… I am pro huh? HAHAHA!<br><br>Smiling at my flippant words, I commented on how gorgeous she looked today. I guess it was just something to start conversation, but heyÂ… I really meant what I said. She looked really shy and reply with a soft thanks. I bought another ice-blended mocha for her as she said she wanted the same.<br><br>We chatted for a while - Jerry told me to soften her up with the conversation as she will most likely be as tense as I am. Gradually, she gain comfort from my company and from chatting, it grew some laughter in it. Actually at times (lucky thing it wasnÂ’t frequent), I did not understand what she was saying. Her Japanese accent with little tint of singlish that comes along with it, was weird but comprehendible. Nevertheless, she looked so cute, especially when she smiled that I have this burning urge to pinch her cheek.<br><br>After finishing our drinks, we made our way to the Cinema, after we decide and made purchase for Shallow Hal. It was comedy show and Jerry said that comedies is good way to remember a first date. At least she wonÂ’t be crying while watching a sad movie and I had to cheer her up later, although horror show seemed like a whole lot better option to me. Hiak!<br><br>The movie is talking about Hal Larsen, the ultimate shallow guy. He judged woman by appearance and in the end he got hypnotize by this guy who made him sees woman by their character instead of physical beauty. Rosemary, the lead actress came into the picture and he fell in love with her, without realizing that she is not what he thinks she looked like.<br><br>The story is a mixture of hearts, laughs and emotions and at the end of the show, I could see watery tears rimming around YukikoÂ’s eyes. What the hell? WellÂ… at the very least she understand the story, which was my first fear. We walked out of the Cinema and out of Plaza Singapura, while I tried to reassure her that the world was still spinning and it was only a show.<br><br>Â‘CloudÂ… do you think there are people like that?Â’<br><br>Â‘SureÂ… of courseÂ… that is the real worldÂ…Â’<br><br>Â‘Why must guys like pretty girls?Â’<br><br>I was momentarily taken aback by a sudden question. I asked myself and the answer that came up doesnÂ’t seemed too goodÂ…<br><br>Â‘Because human like to see pretty things? I mean you would like to see good looking guys too right?Â’<br><br>Â‘But good-looking guys donÂ’t give me security. ThatÂ’s why I donÂ’t like good-looking guysÂ…Â’<br><br>My heart screamed another point of victory; I am not good looking - I am decent looking, the second closest to handsome. Even though she never really answered my question, but I love her reply.<br><br>Â‘What about you Cloud? Do you like pretty girls too?Â’<br><br>THIS KIND of question AGAIN? If I said yes, I will appear damn shallow. If I say no I am lying to myself. Gawd! I need the best of both world answerÂ…<br><br>Â‘Me?Â’<br><br>I was trying to buy time as she nodded her head almost immediately.<br><br>Â‘WellÂ… I think I preferÂ… cute girls likeÂ… you!Â’<br><br>My system was undergoing this contained stress and it is making me go nuts every time she throws questions like these to stumble me. She blushed and tapped my head lightly. Oh man, I think I am not gonna wash my hair today.<br><br>Â‘DonÂ’t be sillyÂ…Â’<br><br>I know that sentence was just to cover her embarrassment, just like me laughing whenever I made mushy remarks.<br><br>I decided to sent her home by bus as I think this is the very least what a guy should do. We boarded the bus, the same bus 171 where we always take - We recognized the bus driver.<br><br>Â‘Boy arÂ… not bad arÂ… get to know her liaoÂ…last time you both dunno each other wan right?Â’<br><br>It was the bus driver and I nodded in faintly agreement with him and smiled my way through, while she giggled uncontrollably. We choose a seat at the far back and sat down.<br><br>Â‘This driver is always very chatty, donÂ’t bother about him. I always seen him talking to other passengersÂ…Â’<br><br>She shaped a smile from her lips.<br><br>Suddenly, she took the bus tickets I was holding.<br><br>Â‘Look away first!Â’<br><br>I did as I was told and after five minutes she hold my waist and put her fist onto my hands. Am I in heaven?<br><br>Â‘I have nothing to give you, so I made this two heart myself. One for you, one for meÂ…Â’<br><br>I looked at her origami made from bus tickets and wondered whether I should do something similar. I appreciate her effort though Â– I thanked her.<br><br>Finally her stop arrived and she had to align. We got down and I insisted in sending her all the way till her block.<br><br>Â‘ItÂ’s ok. ItÂ’s not good if I am being seen by my neighbours with a guy so late at night you knowÂ…Â’<br><br>I nodded and finally relented. Well, every date has to part eventually right?<br><br>I watched her fade into her estate and until I caught zero glimpse of her.<br><br>I am in LOVE with TODAY.<br><br>(To be continued...)<br></div>

If got people accompany home, this thing wouldn't have happen right?

            <div class='col-md body'>For the next few months, we chatted everyday and each time I felt that I am slipping into this pit of angelic darkness called love. She told me she couldnÂ’t go out very often as her guardian is very strict Â– finally she is talking more about herself. Her parents are overseas working, leaving her all alone, which contribute reasons for her character. I know she longs for my company like I longs for hers. We are like one in-separate-able pair of best friend. Whatever problems she has, she consulted me and I will be there to give my expertise advice. Maybe this is what true love is, someone to be there regardless of whether you two are together - someone to guide, shield and depend. Jerry, the womanÂ’s men, said that I am wasting too much time on a single girl. I should have just pop the question and leave the thinking to her, after all life is too short to spend on one person. But the urge to reveal my feeling hasnÂ’t reached to such stage for desperation yet. Maybe next time I would, but when is the right time?<br><br>Â‘CloudÂ… I have something to ask youÂ…Â’<br><br>Oh no, not again?<br><br>Â‘What do you think of me?Â…Â’<br><br>Oh shit, peer evaluating time! Even though I speak easily to myself, when it comes to expressing to HER, I am score an F9 for it.<br><br>Â‘Cute? And you are a very good friend of mineÂ…Â’<br><br>Â‘That all?Â…Â’<br><br>What do you mean thatÂ’s all? Oh dear, I have to say something that she wants to hear or forever I will be condemn in her eyes. NooooooooÂ…..<br><br>I decide to avoid the question using my avoidance tactics.<br><br>Â‘There is a lot of things in my heart that I feel about you, but in this short span of time, I canÂ’t express it out. But regardless of what is it, I want to let you know that treasure you a lot.Â’<br><br>Phew, lucky thing I manage to come out with this marvellous sentence. It seemed that after the episode of knowing her, I am beginning to learn the trades of using words.<br><br>Â‘<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">Â…Â’<br><br>I didnÂ’t know how to reply her smile and decide to leave it until she reply me with something else. Five minutes went by and I am starting ponder whether I should reply anything.<br><br>Â‘CloudÂ… can we meet for dinner tomorrow?Â’<br><br>Another date! Yeah I screamed literally at my computer scream as she is able to go out once more, with me.<br><br>Â‘Sure! What about your guardian? She allows you to go out?Â’<br><br>Â‘Yes, she allow me to go out tomorrowÂ…Â’<br><br>Â‘OkÂ… we meet at Mac at Parklane ok?Â’<br><br>Â‘/me nodded her headÂ…Â’<br><br>Â‘Ok I have to go offline nowÂ… remember donÂ’t be so early ok?Â… I feel bad if you have to wait for meÂ…Â’<br><br>I smiled at her consideration for me.<br><br>Before I could reply with anything, her nick has quit IRC. Guess that I have to wait for tomorrow to see her again.<br><br>(To be continued...)</div>
