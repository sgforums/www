            <div class='col-md body'>Nobody is borned into this world knowing everything that you ought to know in surviving any relationship. Everyone was borned a like fool - because in Love, there is no rule - people just have to go through it because you only grow after your experience it. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>So when that happens, most, in fact virtually everyone recognise this rancorous feeling that is worst than any poison of the heart: Regret.<br><br>Most people have regrets in their life. They bring forward to their next life, still bearing the deep regrets they did when they were still naive about reality. You could hear a thousands theories on love, with people of high learning enlightening you about this issue - ironically, you would still go through this phrase sometime in your life. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Regrets are the memories that you truthfully hate yourself for acting that way at that moment - yet like a ball of flame. You are dazzled by the beauty of the fire - yet it horrifyingly reminds you of your burn scorch.<br><br>People feel difficult to move on - because everything past incident kept replaying. How many times when you tried to sleep and end up recalling all these incidents? How many times have you thought of something, yet brushes it aside and telling yourself not to? How many times have you weep silently in your heart or physically when the similar evironment, music, situations, etc took place and instantly transported you into another world - your world of old memories? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>Bus Ride was written by me - Yunhaier, no doubt and each short chapter over the spread of this 2 weeks plus had attracted regular readers in the forum. To you people - its another love story - to me, its a paradox that writing it seemed more emotional then reading it through.<br><br>Four people made this story possible - My disciple, girl that passed away, girl that vanished from the face of the world to England and of course me. Two true tales combined into one made it simplier to write and to post. If you are asking if this is for real - you are right in the sense that major incident all took place, the small details were spawn from fictional imagination for better reading. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Everyone, created from the miracle of nature, has to go through phrases to discover four aspect in love.<br><br>1) Yourself - you cannot love others if you do not learn to love yourself. Studies have proven people who doesn't love themselves tend to find partners that will abuse them or do not treat them as well as other guys would.<br><br>2) Someone you Loved the most - This phrase is often when your were still wild and naive about Love. Dauntless is your middle name and the inexperience you falls very deep in love this special person - but you wouldn't be together with him/her. This causes regrets<br><br>3) Someone who loved you the most - After the 2nd phrase, you will mature, but finds it very difficult to let go of that past. In your course of life - people would also fall for you - but none of them seemed anywhere closer to that special guy/girl, even he/she may be your gf/bf or simply good friends. You will cause them emotional hurts regardless of how tactful you deal with their feelings because they are now experience the second stage, while you are at the third. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>4) Your life partner - finally after everything, you will settle down with special one who will walk down the rest of your life with you.<br><br>Many people do not follow this phrase in order. Some people gone through 3rd stage first, etc - so is it possible to skip phrase 2 and 3, and just go towards 1 and 4? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>I want to tell you people how lucky you are because, at the very least, you people could still speak with those whom you may have regreted upon your actions. They may not listen - but you could still have a thousands and one means to bring your message across.<br><br>Everyone here in this forum, wearing their nick and chat - behind every computer, is a story to tell. Each of your have your own experience, have your own skeleton in your cupboard. After going through my story and listening to what I have to say here...<br><br>Do not die with your regrets in life. If you can do something about it - DO IT NOW. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>Prays (For myself and other who have gone through similar difficult incident of death and separation)<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Writing, composing it is indeed more emotional then people reading it. Because to write a story like yours(Yunhaier) it takes more then talent and eloquent language skill. It's the soul of the story, that heart of the composer....maybe i read to much Comics which contained too much sorrowful Love stories.<br><br>It reminds me of many songs....but most haunting of all will be my favourite song.
