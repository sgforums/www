Let's be honest - I don't think there're too many girls who bother about being teased by her friends (at least, not to the point that it'd jeopardise her giving a chance to you) if you were a guy she fancied...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

If she is a chinese, perhaps when u see her, you could say "happy lunar new year" to her.  If she responds then this will make it easy for you to have small talk with her in time to come.  Do it in a spontaneous way, this way the colleagues may not tease her.  Or if her colleagues are also around, you could be friendly and say "happy lunar new year" to them, too!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
