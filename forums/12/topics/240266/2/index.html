            <div class='col-md body'>She say that she want to be with you, but how you know if it is a genuine case whereby she likes you and not just want to stick by you just because you're treating her too nice and she's feeling bad about it?<br><br>Something you might want to ask her is what exactly does she want. If she is just your gf because she feels bad about you giving her the attention, it is better to be friends, no point in staying with her. It's not fair to you. If not, give her time.<br><br>btw, what's with the "his ex bf frens told her that he is very sad after the break up."? Are they intending to try and see if she can patch up with her ex or what? Ask her what exactly she wants. Why is she afraid of regret? Could be some issue with her insecurity, if it is, only she herself can deal with it.</div>

Even if u both go ur seperate ways for now, let her know u'll be around (and not just disappear from her life).  U can decide whether or not to get back together when both parties have a clear mind.. it'll be easier on both of u too <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
