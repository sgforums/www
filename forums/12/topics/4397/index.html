You people have such an unique way of seeing love or relationship... Such a woman's way.... By the way, how old are you...? I think you can get BETTER ADVICEs from your other lesbian friends...?

If you can handle them then you can do whatever you want except for going against your conscience.<br><br>Many people in society are homophobic and some of the lesbians/gays are more sensitive to people not accepting or approving of this type of relationship.<br><br>That said, i've always thought (still think) that love should not have any boundaries, be it man or woman, old or young, race or culture.  Love is always Love... it's up to you.<br><br>Just do not regret being involved in a lesbian relationship, in future.  Hey!  Life goes on... and on and on... until we die.  Then its a different ball game.<br><br></div>

How experienced is her in this game?  I know that from your mail you've made up your mind about what to do.  Then she might be playing a game with you... slap me if i'm wrong.  But look inside yourself this time round.  Examine your thoughts first then your feelings.  Afraid you have to help yourself now.<br><br>What's this about feelings running away?</div>

It always happens when the first relationship doesn't work out or when you see your friends' relationships don't work out.<br><br>Some people get hurt and hide in a shell, afraid of trusting and loving again. Others, go into excess and start having revenge by fooling around with many people, hurting people at the same time.<br><br>The best thing is not to be afraid.  Life goes on.  I think it's sad that a single incident can spoil a person's entire life.  Such incidents do create fear but HECK IT!  Life is not worth living as a coward... without passion.  After all, life is more than making $$$, buying big houses, fast cars and beautiful people.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></div>

If it didn't kill you then can only make you stronger.  hahaha... maybe you have not met the right person after all.<br><br>Marriage is... taken too lightly in recent years.  Marriage vow also anyhow say... sigh.  It is to make a commitment to your spouse.  To enjoy that companionship not only for sex but more than that... in daily affairs, and accepting each other.  Even though they have "heavy breath" in the morning, stroking her hair, enduring weird mood swings, or they are fat, or have become ugly and all that.  It is to hold and support each other through good and bad times, sickness and in health, rich or poor... above all to know that someone is always there to be loved by and to love.  Hmmmm.... getting mushy... aiyah!<br><br>And NOT, you got money, you got car, i want you.  You Pok-KAI, I bye bye!<br><br>My friend said that marriage is like a job, have kids and raise children.
