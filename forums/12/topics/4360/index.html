            <div class='col-md body'>This is so confusing... she broke off with you for less than 3 months.  Within this 3 months she is already attached and her new relationship is already on the rocks.  And over here you're still pining away for her.<br><br>Now do you see the picture?  Like what the other says, maybe you will not want her back after all.  Erm... I don't want to ask but how long was your relationship with her?<br><br>Somehow, I remember that Japanese serial "With Love".  The male lead, was mumbling about physical relationships without love is like 2 pieces of flesh going at it.  Sorry, I don't make sense but maybe some of you know that show.<br></div>

So man must open eyes BIG BIG to see clearer.  In situation like these, be calm and access situation before doing an attack.  Holding the fort and hoping to be rescued by the calvalry is sometimes pointless.  Attack but be ready to be killed too.<br><br>Gary, read lesson 29 carefully... hmmm... think I better kept the rest of the book secret.

            <div class='col-md body'>Like wat the others said previously, you know how to deal wif this situation and i prefectly agree wif them. However, Love itself is irrational and no one can place a value to it coz beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder.<br><br>There may be alot of other stuffs that happened between the r/s which u did not reveal. I guess its becoz she's the best in ur heart and no matter how much she's done to hurt u, u'll wan her back.<br><br>However, you thought of your feelings yet not hers. If you really love her, let her choose her path and be happy. Love isn't only abt possession. At least you can smile back and say tt you were once madly in love.<br><br>Move on coz there'll be some1 waiting to cross your path somewhere ...<br><br>"If you love something, set it free... If it comes back, it's yours, If it doesn't, it never was yours...."<br><br></div>
