              <p>Another question with no actual answer.</p>
              <p>This question is very debatable, with plentiful of people standing on either side, and a handful believing that sometimes you control fate, sometimes it controls you.</p>
              <p>You said that you have given up on a certain someone, but it seemed that you would like to gather opinions and challenge fate once more.</p>
              <p>My answer is that you cannot change fate totally, but you can alter part of it. You cannot choose what results to get for your exams, but you could always work harder in order to have a higher chance of getting a better result.</p>
              <p>What happen in the past is the past, but what you do now will affect what will happen in your future. I certainly hope you are not doing any silly things again.</p>

              <p>Great answer.</p>
              <p>Fate is just another word. Don't always blame it on fate straight away. Take time and think it over. Maybe because the other person performed better, that's why he got promoted. Maybe because you didn't study enough, that's why results not ideal.</p>

              <p>I hold the view that people (ren) and fate (ming) are always dynamically interacting.</p>
              <p>Thus people &amp; fate of someone is constantly dynamically evolving depending on the multivariate inputs make by the person. You can imaging a graph plot of two "stocks" keep on progressing, and the person's overall opportunities and luck will be the average of the two values.</p>
              <p>The someone can influence his "people" stock by actively doing things to improve his foreseen positive outcome, such things normally amounts to "luck". E.g. you personally place a fish tank somewhere in your house, or clear the dust of your altar, or wear a jade penchant on your body etc. Alternatively, you can work hard in your job, help your colleagues or boss solve problems, interact more with your peers to increase network, etc to improve you "opportunities".</p>
              <p>Fate itself will also evolve as you age, and is not a constant. E.g. you are borne rich, then your dad becomes bankrupt when you are 10yrs old, or you lead an active life have a good gf, then you are hit by a car and become handicapped or got cancer at early age, etc. Ofcourse, it can be positive, like you are borne poor, stay in HDB 3 room flat, but someone helped you or you start your own business and manage to buy a condo at age 30 yrs old, etc. Also, the actions you do, i.e. "people" will also affect "Fate", e.g. you kill alot of people in war, thus you will have alot of enemies and people cursing you, you cannot expect to have a good ending for you life when you are old, or you kept plotting against the people you dont like, and have very narrow tolerance to people who do not bear the same thinking as you, or you dont like to see people perform better than you, like you dont like see people score better than you in exams etc. There is a personality deficit in you, such things will lead you to an eventually poor fate, cuz your "ren yuan" is low.</p>
              <p>Thus, the two constantly evolving "people" and "fate", will dynamically influence and interact with each other, will taking in variables mostly from "people" as what you do will be most sensitive to "people". But the things you do will also influence "fate".</p>

              <p>A wise man once told me, you can alter fate but you cannot change destiny.</p>
              <p>Destiny for one is finite. Just like our alotted lifespan. No matter how healthy you attempt to live your life, within that century, you will return to dust.</p>
              <p>But fate is alterable. Fate is a condition, situation and environment that you live, shaping, controlling and directing you into one direction. While you are still alive, you can break out of such control by using the power of your mind - to think , anaylse and work out a rational decision to avoid what 'Fate' has determined.</p>
              <p>For example, in this financial crisis, many will be out of jobs and staring at empty dinner tables at home. Money had become scarce. You presume there is no job, and it is your 'fate' to starve. But if you think rationally, you will know that is not true.</p>
              <p>Money don't disappear, but had only been hoarded up. But not by everyone. There is still money in the financial market, and jobs still abound, made more so by leaders who have a responsibility to see that their citizens do not starve.</p>
              <p>Therefore, if you actively seek out jobs, correct your mistakes and retune your personality after each rejection, no matter how mean, you will not starve. It is only temporary. </p>
              <p>Once confidence returns, the world's economy will surge. There is an additional few US trillions floating in the market, with resources going cheap. Those dollars are opportunities and bound to trickle down, but only for those who dont give up to presumed 'fate'.</p>
              <p>Some believed that 'fate' controls one. Some believe in the philosophy of 'what is yours will be yours, but what is not yours will never be yours'. No point banging your head onto the wall.</p>
              <p>I had tried and proven such philosophy wrong with success several times, but....at high costs to myself and had come to believe that when you challenge fate, you will have to make sacrifices...</p>
              <p>Still, one have to survive, if not for himself, then for his loved ones, and must weigh the  priorities and get it right on how far one should go.</p>
