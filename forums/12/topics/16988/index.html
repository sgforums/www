            <div class='col-md body'>Hello.  I am a 19year old Poly student.<br>I am about to quit my diploma course, as I cannot cope with it.  After which, of course, I will be called up for national service.<br><br>I need some answers about the following.<br>1.  Does the Army or Mindef offer courses like military law to people who sign on?<br><br>2.  Who are those qualified for it?<br><br>3.  If not military law, what other courses does Mindef or Army have to offer?<br><br>4.  I only have an O'level Cert, would that be a problem?<br><br>5.  If none available, what should I do to further my studies or advance in any future career?<br><br>Just a bit of background.  I like military stuff alot, and never failed to get information and knowledge about it.  In fact, most people feel that i know the military better than I know my family or school.  Most actually encourage me to find my place in the military, but I have doubts because of what my parents always tell me.  They tell me that, people in the military have no future.  They believe that only in the public sector will one prosper.  I believe that without the military, there would be no public sector, or Singapore.<br><br>Can someone give me any ideas on what to do from now and answer the above questions.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My idea is these uniform organisations all sama sama one.. eat your youth, then later put you in the closet if you do not perform well or have a high qualification. So it's not really worth investing your life in there.<br><br>Then again, like that Devil said, it's only tough to survive the days ahead, but it is NOT impossible. There are people who work part-time to earn their school fees for poly, and people who saved up already and study after that.<br><br>I can see that both have advantages, because when you're being force in a situation when you have to work part-time you will focus better, as it's your own money yhat you're using and you will not tend waste it as you learn the hard way to get your qualifications.<br><br>The other way helps in the sense that you will know how working life is and will understand the good life of a student. you will also be more matured in you thinking to think what is better for yourself and what you want to pursue in your life.<br><br>Then again why not join the Navy?? heard got better prospects, but not sure if true or not...<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Devil1976:</div><div class="quote_body">  Like what KOF guy had said....

When u are given an order, u NEVER say u "cannot cope". if dis is de type of attiude u have, forget bout de army.<br><br>here my last piece of info for u.

            <div class='col-md body'>Shotgun...<br><br>I agree with Psycho.  One tends to know nuts about the army until they're are in it.  If you're aptitude is not into studying.  Are you good enough for Special Operations, Commandos?<br><br>Without good studying powers to continually upgrade and get promotions.  The army is quite a dead end but really stable career.  If you study hard and be smart, can become a general.  Otherwise, can end up condemned as a SAF regular.  Most of my friends with 'O' Levels who joined the army left after they completed their first 6 years.  Just so they can get the gratuity to do what they want.<br><br>I'm not against a career in army, you're still young and there are many things you could do.  Keep your options open.  Unless, you just want to use being a regular as a stepping stone or as a form of escapism from finding real work.  Then go for it, otherwise keep looking.... Good Luck!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well.. nowadays, to be a general, you at least gotta be a OMS (overseas merit scholar), other than that, it's very difficult. i only know 2 generals who made it, who were not. most of the people here are right, unless you have at least a diploma, you can't be an officer. it kind of depends on what kind of work you like. some people say it's better to be an officer for a regular. well, as an officer, you start out low, and get dumped most of the work. an "entry-level" officer, like most NSFs, is a dirty job. why not try the SAF for a few months, like BMT, or when you hit the unit, and observe what the higher ranking people do? see if you like the lifestyle then.<br><br>once you're in, it's not easy to eke out a living outside. the regimentation sets in you, plus the people skills and that. took me, a NSF, a while to get used to civilian life after 2 and a half years. imagine a 6 yr contract? it's a good steady job, but you get into a rut after sometime. i know of regulars who literally sit their lives through army, just to earn a living, with no passion for what they're doing. pretty bad.<br><br>but with that said, a specialist's job can be rewarding. i was one for like 2 days. hahaha...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> nah just kidding.. i say that from observing specialists in my unit.</div>
