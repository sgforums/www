              <p>hi ! I have a friend whom I have known 4 1 year plus and the actions he did during the past few months made me ponder  as to whether he is really  a true friend of mind . For example, he will always ask me out 4 meals but when he reach e place, he will always order expensive food and say he did nt bring enuff cash and expect me 2 lend him. As a friend, I just lend him e $$ but  he will always  forget to return what he owes me and still has e guts to ask me 4 $$ each time we go out to eat .</p>
              <p>Moreover ,this friend  say he treat me like brother and even call me dunnoe wat ''darling brother'' on msn which i find it very gay and uncomfortable. Although this guy will help me when i have problem like giving suggestionsto solve the problem   , he will always ask me to treat him a meal in return . I was like WTF as i thought  true friends are suppose to help each other without expecting anything in return and summore i lend him $$ a lot of times . Can someone out here pls offer  me some suggestions on wat to do with this guy and tell me whether this friend is juz making use of me ?</p>

              <p>Next time he want to borrow $$, tell him you can afford to give him a treat. And bring him to coffee shop not expensive resturant.</p>

              <p>Something I find unusual - if your friend is as messed up as described in your post, why would you even bother to keep in contact with such people in the first place, for a year plus even? Typically, you should be able to tell if he is a "true friend" within a month or so of interaction..but if you are colleagues/are in close proximity with one another, it might be difficult to shake him off.</p>
              <p>If he was truly taking advantage of you, you can do whatever googooboyy has suggested above, and it should reveal that he is uncomfortable. Generally, when people have a taste of their own medicine, they would get what you mean. Otherwise, it just means that he has a plain shitty memory.</p>
              <p>Somehow..I feel that the friend of yours is really desperate..going for meals with you and asking you to lend him money on countless occasions, calling you "darling brother", and helping you solve your problems. Maybe he is just looking for a true friend as well..but that is just my opinion.</p>

              <p>yes he's making use of you. you're similar to me in that i also find it hard to say no to people asking for favours/help even when i know they're jerks. just play the avoiding game and everytime he asks you out, say you're busy, your cat died, you're grounded, etc soon he will fade away.</p>

              <p><br>Advice - Go out and make other friends and ditch him.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Reason - He just wants to have fun but got no money/wants to use you for $.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Suggestion - Go out with him but don't bring or say you have money also .... go out with 5 dollars and said you spent all your money on gf's handbag or some dumb reason. Do it everytime he calls you out. See how long your relationship will last after that. Decide after.</p>

              <p>hi ! I have a friend whom I have known 4 1 year plus and the
              actions he did during the past few months made me ponder
               as to whether he is really  a true friend of mind .
              For example, he will always ask me out 4 meals but when he reach e
              place, he will always order expensive food and say he did nt bring
              enuff cash and expect me 2 lend him. As a friend, I just lend him e
              $$ but  he will always  forget to return what he owes me
              and still has e guts to ask me 4 $$ each time we go out to eat
              .</p>
              <p>Moreover ,this friend  say he treat me like brother
              and even call me dunnoe wat ''darling brother'' on msn which i find
              it very gay and uncomfortable. Although this guy will help me when
              i have problem like giving suggestionsto solve the problem
                , he will always ask me to treat him a meal in return .
              I was like WTF as i thought  true friends are suppose to help
              each other without expecting anything in return and summore i lend
              him $$ a lot of times . Can someone out here pls offer
               me some suggestions on wat to do with this guy and tell me
              whether this friend is juz making use of me ?</p>

              <p>Hi montana,</p>
              <p>It sounds like he is treating you as an ATM...</p>
              <p>I will suggest that you either make things clear to him that you are not his ATM, or stay away from him for good. In the latter case, ignore all his calls and do not bother yourself with any of his requests.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>
