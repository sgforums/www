              <p>haiz.. its seems every job he find is not the type that is feasible yet he feels that i m against every job he find.</p>
              <p>(1) insurance agent</p>
              <p>yes. i am against that. &amp; i believe alot of people do too. reason is alot.</p>
              <p>(2) admin at some weird company in ulu place.</p>
              <p>i m not really against that. i only say if he cant cope with the politics in the office which he told me, then leave. He says there is alot of politics, he don't want. becomes i m against. =.= fine.</p>
              <p>(3) customer services at changi airport. (his mom intro)</p>
              <p>yes. i m against the timing which i already told him since he start to find job. i already told him don't find night shift job. Because when he start schooling, he confirm lack of sleep and cannot focus. And yes, the planner is someone who does not care. last minute told him to cont the next shift due to miscommunication which is simply she doesnt even bother to ask the so call manager for his num. if the 1st day can like this, i don't see why there wont be any last min schedule.</p>
              <p>i told him other jobs he refuse. either the pay low or the place too far. or he he can't work weekends. but the things is, cust svs at changi airport also require wkends.</p>
              <p>he says he want a job that he can write on resume. well, cust svs at changi airport is more high class den kitchen helper in ikea???</p>

              <p><em> </em>I don't think so. It is good her man wants to get a job with as much pay as possible, and also one which will allow him to write in his resume for future jobs, but he seems to be a bad planner who could only plan half of the things.</p>
              <p>Indeed, he tried to go for the jobs which he think will help him go according to his plans, but he did not study the jobs deep enough to realise what is required from him. As such, as most of the fellow forummers here will agree, this type of person is better of learning things the hard way.</p>
              <p>As for labbish, I won't say she is being too naggy, she just care a lot for the person she loves. And to be honest, I will say she has better foresight than her other-half. She thought all about her lover's future, not only his present job-dilemma, but also his future studying need, and also his future career.</p>
              <p>If her other-half think he could handle study and job together, I will say he will have "fun" enjoying his uni time. If he crack under pressure, the worst situation will be that he gave up both his studies and his part time job.</p>
              <p>Indirectly, she worries about his future career, for if he couldn't do well in his studies, how could he get a good job in the future?</p>
              <p>On the otherhand, having a 'customer service' is better than having a 'kitchen helper' on his resume. Here is where labbish is wrong. With experience in the customer service sector, it will be easier for her other-half to enter careers which require him to have frequent direct customer contact, such as counselling and marketing. The extra experience will also help him in dealing with difficult and troublesome customers in the future.</p>
              <p>What could 'kitchen helper' on the resume do? Future kopitiam bowl-washer? I certainly hope not. ( Touchwood ).</p>

              <p>labbish's possibly future mother-in-law was the one who asked her son to take up the job. Labbish herself wanted her other half to get another job as she worries this part-time job will affect his studies when school starts.</p>
              <p>I merely corrected her as she thought this job would be no better than a kitchen-helper, which is very untrue.</p>
              <p>As the two of us mentioned, the best thing to do now is for her to take a step and back and let him do what he wants.</p>

              <p>Firstly, i m not the one that think its no better then the other. Its him. He feels that kitchen helper can't help him much. but i feel that at least there is no night shift. he can rest at home probably. manual work he refuse, he says he is tired of that from NS. kitchen helper cant help him in resume. the office job he says got politics. other job, pay too low. pay high, need work weekend. then what? this job he find also need work on weekend just that its at night. the pay is also same as other part time job. not lower, not higher.</p>
              <p>And one thing, i never force him to take up this shift cust svs job. =.= read carefully. in fact, i prefer he take up other job that is day time. so at night he can rest probably.</p>
              <p>And yes. i decided to let him handle on his own. and at this point in time, i am also tired. he cant even manage his... haiz... maybe we are just not meant to be. the way we do things is just different. i agree that i have been mothering him. even his dad told me not to always do things for him just because he want. let him learn to do things himself.</p>
              <p>really thank you guys. i read through every post and after a day thinking by myself, i guess i ought to let him experience the choices he made himself and not keep.. haiz...</p>
