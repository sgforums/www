Stop seeing it as a competition and start seeing it as a mutual effort towards a common goal. Instead of competing and comparing yourself against others, why don't you just focus on trying to improve yourself?<br><br>Forget about trying to be someone else.

The enemy is within yourself.<br><br>You are the only one who can truly stop yourself from becoming a better person.</blockquote>Thanks for your comments, but you are not aware of the reality in science.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You never know that there are people who are worse off than you. Its considered admirable that you are even a scientist.<br>Remember, "Let the person perform the Art he loves most". If you are extremely interested in science, you should have more confidence and substitute your negative points with some other aspects. Like creativity?<br><br>Also, everyone in this world will have their own expertise, just believe in yourself. Let the others be, they might seem to be in a better position because they have manage to overcome or avoid their weaknesses. Do that too and you will surpass them one day.<br><br>Have faith in yourself and i will have faith in you too. Good luck and not dwell on it anymore.</div>
