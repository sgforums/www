            <div class='col-md body'>Have known my gf for more than a year nw. We are in the mid 20s. We developed from heavy petting to one day, had intercourse. It was her first and the moment we tried, she felt sharp pain. I know it's natural as it was her first. But even after a few times, it was still painful to her. She was so tensed up even though we were relaxed during foreplay before intercourse. It seems she's very stressed.<br><br>After a while, she told me not to try anymore as she's too scared. We were very relaxed during foreplay and it's only when intercourse, she's so tense up. I had 'counselled' her before, but to no avail. Anyway, since she is so scared, I decided to respect her and abstain from intercourse totally.<br><br>Have the following questions to enquire:<br><br>a) When I had intercourse with my ex before, I was also her 1st. During the first two times of intercourse, she felt pain. But after that, it was 'smooth sailing'. However for my current gf, even after a few times, she felt so much pain even though we were well 'lubricated'. Is it because of her size, as she is quite small size?<br><br>b) I know I have to respect her wishes to abstain from intercourse, as i don't want to hurt her. But to be frank, as a guy, I have my own urges and sometimes I find it hard to control. Just like to know, whether anyone here has been a couple but never had intercourse with his gf during the relationship? How can you control? I know love not only encompass the physical self..but to be frank, how to ccntrol the urge then?<br><br>Thanks! Hope to receive frank and sincere views.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"><br><br></div>

Your girl might be having some psychological tense-ups, which would in turn cause her to feel panicky, that there's something wrong with sexual intercourse. Besides, you guys aren't married right? Premarital sex in her opinion might be something negative, but she's giving in to you as well, she likes/loves you.<br><br>Talk to her about the process, i.e. when/how does it hurt, what do you think you can do to lessen her pain and increase her enjoyment, et cetera. Don't just focus on the physical aspect, but concentrate on the feelings as well. Communication is the key to a wonderous physical and emotional relationship between a couple.<br><br>Hope this helps.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
