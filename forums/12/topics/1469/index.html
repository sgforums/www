Just let everybody know, and stand up to her face-to-face.  Tell her that, you no longer bother about her anymore because she has a F***ed-up attitude and lousy behaviour.  tell her to stop her nonsense.<br><br>the next thing you must do is to walk your talk.  promise yourself to forget about her completely.  the best way to do that is find another girl who is better in character and got more class, or hit the gym, or exercise like mad.  with time someone better will come along.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Another thing "Don't whine too much in school."
