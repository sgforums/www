Its never nice to joke about someone since it will more or less hurt that person's pride. I think all those people you joked with in this manner are guys right? Girls are more sensitive to these so think thrice before you crack a joke to anyone.<br><br>As for your case with your friend: be the first to contact him and apologise on your part. I am sure you don't want to lose a friend right? Wait a few days for him to cool down then call him out so you can talk to him in person.</div>
