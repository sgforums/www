            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm.. different race and still can start a relationhsip on bad communication basis... I'm not saying that u can't haf one of a different race, but when communication is bad. It's hard to even express urself properly... anyway that's not the point.<br><br>Maybe u can explain to him ur personal concept of a relationship. once he haf a better idea of how u think, it could have change his behaviour if he really wants to be wif u. I'm also not saying that he muz give in all the way.. but maybe both of u can give in to a certain extent. That's wat love is all about. To gif in to each other, and to understand each other.<br><br>If he cannot accept ur more conservative way of thinking, and argues that u shld think like him , and be more open. I think it's about time that u shld consider if it's love from his side that is maintaining the relationship. In a relationship, I think neither shld gif each other too much pressure, becoz abt to tolerate and give in to each other is showing love to each other. I mean be fair to each other. U gif, he gifs. u gif more, than he shld gifs more. Furthermore he's a guy, theink he can afford more, if u r the princess in his eyes..<br><br>------------------<br>Barely Bearing Berry Belly Bear</div>

Is this really the case or r u deceiving yourself, juz because he's gd in cheering u up and is appealing to u, that's the reason u can't bring your heart to break up with him, huh.  Mayb the best way now is to have a heart-to-heart talk with him and let him understand what u r thinking and watch out for his response.  If he really understands and loves u, he'll definitely agree to a "cooling down" session for both of u.  Mayb both of u r still not sure of what u all want, but if he had no respond at all, then u will b sure that it's absolutely rite to break up with him, agreed?<br>Anyway, for the affairs of the heart, I can only give u advices but the final decision actually lies in u.<br>can icq me at 62617763 if u really needs a frd or person to talk to, ok...<br><br>------------------<br>Hope to b your frd forever, Mike signing off</div>

I also think that it's becoz the other guy did sth that made u touched... that's y u r saying that like this guy.. Maybe he has done u a favour that's y u like him. Or maybe becoz u are in the midst of ur confusion and he  appears and thus u felt something for him. It always happens.. We, humans, tend to grap hold of some other thing when we feel that we are not safe. And we always mistake it for another safety precaution, but chances is that it's also another loose rock...<br><br>As for ur bf, I think it's becoz u can't let go of it that's y u r saying that u haf feelings for him too. It's common, especially for pple who just got themselves involve in this r/s thing for he first time.<br><br>U haf to ask urself who u really love??? Or even u can say that u dun love anyone in the end I will still think it's perfectly fine... Choosing the rite person, involves the heart and the mind. The heart to tell u who u really love. the mind to tell u shld u love him. Becoz ur heart can only sense feelings which is the most impt in a r/s, of coz. Ur mind will play the role of telling u if u r really in love and not in infatuation of someone's gratitude.<br><br>Okie.. now for my honest, but rather harsh words... I would say u will be better off w/o ur first bf... But as for ur 2nd guy, I will only say, it's better that u know him well enuff first, I'm sure u dun want things to happen like wat's ur first rite?? Moreover, give urself time to get over the temporary depression first. And the time that u r using to get over, u can also find out more abt this new guy. to understand him better better before really going into a r/s. I'm sure u r looking for a lasting one rite?? And finally, can test if his words are true or not. He said he is going to wait for u, but if u r not going to test him out, how would u know that he is just saying for the sake of holding ur hands. No harm done.... A lot of guys will say that especially when they are in sec sch.. Still immature of wat is love.. and also it's just to get the ger they like.. that's my only warning...<br><br>t|red: let u do some work mahz if not u say I take everything and dun let u haf a chance to perform..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>------------------<br>Barely Bearing Berry Belly Bear</div>
