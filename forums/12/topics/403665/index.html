              <p>Perharps you should Take one Step back and observed your own emotion maturity.</p>
              <p>From what i observed you need to ask yourself if you should be considering married at all.  Because you have to ask yourself who you are NOW.</p>
              <p>Look at it this way....for whatever reason You n your 1st relationship both of you grow up and move apart.....And you found a new person to love.</p>
              <p>If you are having a 7 years itch. I suggest you don't make any decision period.</p>

              <p>Ya, u are right.</p>
              <p>however, 9 years ago when my EX left me, she was having great difficulty in her life, she came from a single parent family, and she has to look after her younger sister.</p>
              <p>She would often tell me that, why is her life so fucked up, she can't go out but has to look after her younger sister. and stuff like that. I remember seeing her once at taka she was hanging out with some beng wanna be.</p>
