            <div class='col-md body'>It's hard to determine what she means by those actions and in first place its pretty hard to understand gals, individually thats it. So many gals so many different personalities, some like surprises some hate it like hell, while some like money some like romance.<br><br>Take for example, she might be saying she's busy because she wants you to APPRECIATE her and NOT TAKE HER FOR GRANTED if you both decide to get into a relationship (if...). I know of gals who play hard to get and that's what you get, a puzzled guy like you.<br><br>And then she might answer your calls because she stil want to maintain that friendship with you, possible right? She might not want to be so cruel and to like - CAN YOU STOP CALLING ME UP BECAUSE ITS IMPOSSIBLE FOR US TO BE TOGETHER? kind of thing. I also know of gals who prefer friendship to love cause to them, friendship can be forever, love is kinda hard to achieve that forever thingy.<br><br>In conclusion, i would recommend you just ask her how she feels bout you, and you also tel her how you feel bout her ya? Its always better to ask than to regret few years down the road thinking - gee, what if i asked her that day? could we be together?<br><br>Hope that helps abit. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
