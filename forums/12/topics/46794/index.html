Love is something that people of your parents generation feels that it can only come when certain requirements are fuilfilled - like career is stable, guy must seemed and look and feel decent, etc. People of that time don't start relationship at the age of say 16 or even younger. With media and news kept flashing reports on kids blinded by so called puppy love and did foolish things - it will have subconscious effect on them.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>Few points that is definite in your case:<br><br>I) Your parents will worried more for you because you are a girl.<br><br>II) Your parents will feel that they have seen more of the world than you and their impression/thoughts about your bf will be more substantial than you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>III) Since you are a daughter, their desire of putting into good hands is greater than sons in generally. Esp the dad - who will always want their daughter to have good b/f. The mum only fear security and the can-he-take-care-of-my-daughter kind of thing.<br><br>From above: It will spark the kind of conversation you hate to hear.<br><br>Advice? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You can't change the root of their thinking because it is generation thoughts. No car, no career (still studying), etc is absolutely ok as long as he is still doing something practical like studying and not slacking his life away.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Regrets? Why regrets? Unless the both of you had pre-marital sex and a baby is conjured from that act, in which you will be walking right into what you dad had predicted. Your dad's words has deeper meaning, just that he never said it in full explaination.<br><br>The difficult part about dad stage is that ALL dad will feel that the guy would only want one thing from their daughter - prove them wrong and they will succumb and break from their aged thinking.<br><br>Whatever you do - think of the big picture and see if it is going to affect your parents impression negatively anot. Right down, the problem ain't severe, because its only a bad impression without concrete prove and situation/events to back it up. Once there is just one incident to back it, your bf can forever be condemn in hell by them.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Early impression, more often than not, is always wrong. If your dad talk about this to you again. To tackle him, is that you must speak to him in <strong>soft and low tone</strong>, to the extend that he could hear you just nice. <strong>Do not </strong>counter offensive tone with offensive ones. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Then tell him this: <strong>'Dad, am I going to marry or not is a thing that never come across my mind. If the thoughts ever come across me, whichever guy it is, I will seek for your opinons on him, because is important and your views have its own purpose and stand. Right now, its not even anywhere near there.<br><br>Afterall, how I know the man I will marry in the future to be a good man if I have never been in other relationship before</strong>?'<br><br>Your goal is hoping that your parents would accept your bf as part of the family  - but the first thing is to take things one at the time. Settle that kind of false impression that your dad have first, before moving on. After this, perhaps you could private message me or post a new topic to update us.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>

With weightage higher on you probably (not to assume that you're the 'problematic' one)....<br><br>You're unsettled in nature, hence giving your parents the impression that you might not be making an appropriate choice for bf. What many previous relationships you had? If you have had failed relationship, your dramatic change due to the failure might be another reason why your parents are controlling over this one. Still, that has not include the fact that your bf is probably not a good fit in your parents's eyes (especially your dad's).<br><br>I shall not be touching on whether your bf is a good choice on your part. It's probably not the duration of around 1 year which your parents see confidence in your relationship with him but more of a worry about how he has been treating you in the past one year.<br><br>For now. To OVERCOME the impression, the LEAST you'll need to work on would be...<br><br>1. Show your parents that you're mature enough in your way of handling things. (not by arguing your way out pls.. It's by SHOWING it and getting their approval.)<br><br>2. Just your bf to treat you better. To buck up in his commitment towards you. You might not really be concerned about it, but your parents certainly DO.<br><br>3. Show to them that the two of you can be a LOVING couple. Not by putting up an 'act' (or more?)... It has to be GENUINE... Any 'faking' if caught red-handed would be GREATLY PENALISED... Besides.. It's not like your bf would be really interested in the 'act'?<br><br>Last but not least. Please DO provide your dad's horoscope as it's rather CRUCIAL to the whole issue.<br><br>Regards.</div>
