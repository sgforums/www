Up to this point... If my ASSUMPTION is true, the main issue is indeed YOU.... I still don't know your dad's sign... But he might be a little going offside for a while... (though he's still a crucial character...)<br><br>You're the main STIR of the whole issue... Your parents are rather 'inexperienced' I would presume in 'modern dating'... Especially so for your dad... He should be kinda 'backward'... Your mum should be able to accept things better than him...<br><br>Your parents are naturally PROTECTIVE of you... Because you're their daughter... Because you love them... And because you're a girl....<br><br>I'm kinda 'surprised' by the qualities your bf has displayed... And not sure how far they've been degraded...? Hmm... I think you can 'sense' it too...? That's why you're rather relunctant to give him up...? Giving him up earlier would be for the better of him but a loss on your part... (If he hasn't change much yet...)<br><br>Your bf is kinda a 'rare species' for his characteristics..? Perhaps he've already changed (or beginning to change..?) I don't know... But probably because of the fact that this is his 1st relationship so he's still 'fresh'... Which is actually a GOOD thing....<br><br>If you combine BOTH the MAIN REPLIES I've made to you in this thread &amp; in your previous thread, you should roughly get the whole picture....?<br><span style="font-style: italic;"><br>~good luck....</span></div>

This 'feature' of him usually not so easy to be found when he's seasoned enough... It's kinda natural for this characteristic of his to wilter off with time UNLESS you do something to PRESERVE it.... It's definitely a 'bonus' and quite a 'rarity' INDEED.... But the way you're treating him for now is....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  Partial advantage in display because if you give in too much to him he probably won't treasure you enough.... But too much of this over a longer period and you'll probably see the 'appropriate' changes in him in time to come...?</div>
