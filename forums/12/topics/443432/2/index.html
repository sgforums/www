              <p>A person who is not racist is hard to come by.</p>
              <p>That means she is not narrow minded like the majority of people on this earth.</p>

              <p>Me a racist? Hello!!! Wake your eyes up and read the post of M874 and winsomea 'most chinese cannot accept Indian'</p>
              <p>Winsomnea and M874</p>
              <p>'think all chinese families will allow their daughters to marry Indians?'</p>
              <p>'No racism but from my observation not many Chinese would accept indians, you consider yourself lucky that the Chinese girl does not mind you'</p>
              <p>LOL!!! I consider myself LUCKY a Chinese would be willing to go out with me? Are you wearing a monkey's brain?</p>
              <p>Have you walked along the CBD of Singapore - Raffles Quay and One Fullerton - and the CBD of Kuala Lumpur - Bukit Bintang and KLCC - and managed to observe anything?</p>
              <p>Note the number of Indian guys with Chinese girls dangling on their arms. Oh perhaps, you work at the farside of Tuas, stuck in the back room, at a factory site, to hide your faces from public eyes.</p>
              <p>But here's the funny thing right? Why are there these Chinese girls going out with these Indian dudes?</p>
              <p>Oh yeah.................well if you happened to inquire and observe further, you will not a difference. These are the Indian dudes that happens to wear Gucci glasses and dressed in Armani suits, with credit cards to swipe for their ladies' wine.</p>
              <p>So don't give me some hoot, crap, about Indians being LUCKY to be with a Chinese girl. I would puke my guts out.</p>
              <p>This issue is not about racism!!! This is not the intention of this thread!!</p>
              <p>If you monkeys intend to turn this into a racist thread, so be it!! But it ain't on me!!</p>
