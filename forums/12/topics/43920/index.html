            <div class='col-md body'>Since quitting from my last job(I'm a graphic designer), i have been caught in a dilemma where I would like to start a design studio wif a partner or continue to work for people.<br><br>There are certainly risks involved to set up a design studio now esp wif the downturn times now. Sometimes, I must be crazy to think abt setting up one since people are losing jobs and the design market is very bad now. But on the other hand, I can't see myself working for other people for the rest of my career. The thing abt doing creative work for company is that they earn money thru your own creative juices though u get paid. But it's not something u earn directly cos in actually fact u are the one who design and come up wif the design solutions for the client, it's just so that the company 'helps' u sell the work. Who gets the credit and gd money? The company of course.<br><br>Sorry to hear my rants in here. If there are designers out there who owns a design studio, do share your views and maybe can advise my hoe to set up one. Non designers are welcome too.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yah nismo is right... who knows the client is satisfied with your work thats why they keep coming back to your company.. if you have set up your company, who knows they might let u handle it. U will have a lot of considerations that restrict u.. but once u step out and start planning it.. u will do it somehow..anyway its not a really high capital kinda thing u starting with so no harm trying. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
