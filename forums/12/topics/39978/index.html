            <div class='col-md body'>HI girl,<br><br>As what you say he has a crush on a girl from his school. Crush is not love, it's maybe only a moment of affection. I assume you two are still very much in love but what you two lack is commuincation and something to really push ur relationship up. Sometimes when at home you can try watching tv with like like his favourite sports or ur favourite drama. Play computer games, buy puzzles etc..<br><br>this is something that can boost up a bit...<br>when relationships get long, it is the thing that will happen lah, so dun get too worry over it. ideas!! think of ideas that can be a common and fun thing for u two to do... it helps...<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>oooooooooooooooook... *breathes deeply*<br><br>the problem i see here seems to be a reln out of habit. many couples out there stay together becos that's wat they've been doing for X amount of years, it doesn't cause them that much discomfort (you know like living with ur parents becos u dun have a choice, for some of us) but it is not a loving an fulfilling relationship.<br><br>you're not wrong when u say that interest is lost in a relationship, especially when you are young. that would be my first assumption. youngsters get into a reln for different reasons, of course we all profess to love our partners, but let's not even go there, for it's hard to define, even without age or maturity in the equation.<br><br>i believe when we are/were younger, we go into relationships for fun. companionship, someone to hang out with, play, even to look good (i have a pretty gf type thing) in front of frens. if i may be so bold to say, most young pple would beg to differ, they would say it's true love etc etc, but in time, the same people would look back and laugh at themselves. how silly i was then!<br><br>so, back to u. unfortunately this is something that most of us go thru when we are/were young. it's a learning experience, something that we will take with us in our next relationship, provided we learn from our "mistakes". actually, i should use the word experiences instead of mistakes. no one could be in the wrong yet the relationship fizzles.<br><br>pertaining to the specifics, i would suggest that you both cool it on the "why are we like this?" part. the more u stress about why it's not like that, the more it's NOT gonna be like that, if u know wat i mean. in a way, i'm saying, take the reln LESS seriously. go with the flow. nothing to talk don't talk, don't feel like meeting, don't meet. why pressure each other? wat sort of person says to herself "aiyah i better find something to talk to him about if not we'll be very quiet and awkward"... often, the silence between couples is intimate beyond description.<br><br>yeah.. try that. dun FORCE urself to be silent, but there are other forms of communication. stay in each others' embrace in silence. i know some guys have a problem with that (i have NO IDEA why!) but if u cannot be silent with ur partner, u're definitely not comfortable with eact other.<br><br>er.. i think that's it for now. watever it is that happens, never stop learning. that's just how life works.</div>

Hw is with his group of GUYS friends.. Of cos they will talk about gUYs stuff instead of Girls things... If you know you are goin to meet his friends together with him.. YOu should know what will the topic be like.. So dun get angry for NOthing.. and maybe you could join in their conversations too..   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>When you talk to guys.. is it his friends or your guy friends or someone your bf doesnt know? afraid of losing you? Well, a sense of possession? Insecurity? A fully satisfied man will never fall for another..   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>He talks to you about the things that you hurt him.. Try not to be so annoyed over such Little things.. Tame your temper down too.. If you keep on going like this.. angry for nothing.. angry jus bcos he talks to his friends everything on guys things and not girls matter.. And after that he got to "hong" you back.. One day he sure cant take it and get sian of doing the same thing again.. YEs.. finally he couldn't take it anymore.. Now at least you realised that what you've been doing is wrong... You regretted.. feel guilty... Try to change your attitude towards him.. Be more considerate..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Dreaming of past memories doesnt mean/show bad omen.. or bad things.. It suggests that he is ready to get rid of his old ways and undergo some sort of new transformation and new outlook in life. It also indicates a lesson to be learned something from the past. Due to the weather and SARs virus.. Is best to stay at home and dun go crowded places too.. Moreover you are allergy to it..   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Basically.. in your relationship.. both of you are lack of communication.. And your bf is really sick of the things you all have been doing.. it becomes a routine each day.. He told you everything about about his life and nothing else to talk?? You can talk about something out of jus his life your life.. For instance - Share what have you watch on tv.. what stupid things you done... what books you read.. what funny things that you've come across.. Dun hold on the phone and keep quiet.. He was once a very quiet person.. Suddenly ask him to change to a very talkative person takes time... If he dunno what to talk to you.. you can start a topic yourself.. Practically jus talk about anything that come to your mind.. But now... He's tired of it..   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Besides cycling, pool, shopping, movies.. you can always come up with some surprises.. or do little stuffs for him.. Or you 2 can go take up some activities together.. Do something extra not the thigns you always and usually does..   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Right now.. both of you comment that don't really have feelings for each other.. and decide to end the relationship and become friends.. Funny is that when u 2 becomes friends you seems to have a lot to talk.. Why is this so? Cos both of you doesnt feel so tense and no commitment considered.. that's why  you can open your heart and talk freely..   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>But somehow you feel strange.. As if one part of life has gone.. He feels the same too.. And then you got back together.. and he say he loves you... Simply becos.. both of you are so used to being with each other.. this becomes a companion rather then BGR - You are so used to each other that is has become a habit.. Both wants each other back not becos you still love him/her - but jus that both havent find another right person. He had a crush on someone. Who knows later he realised is not jus merely a crush but is someone he likes.. he gets to see this girl everyday in sch.. but he doesnt get to see you often right..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Now that you've come to a stage that the kind of chemistry has gone - I suggest you to sort out your real feelings for him.. Ask yourself is it love or is it jus for companion.. Are you taking things for granted or is jus plainy a routine in a relation. You once said you dun really love him.. Think about it.. When a relation break and patch.. it often leads to a faster stage of declining. You are afraid that boredom might lead to another break up again..   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>If you really do love him.. Get some actions done.. Make some progress in the relation.. Not neccessary must go interesting places.. when he feels moody.. try cheerin him up.. or have a chat with him and make him open up his heart and talk to you.. Communication is very important in a relationship.. Let him know that when he's with you.. He's happy.. and not moody.. Let him know that you always be there for him.. caring and supporting him..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Dont get too depressed about it.. Think twice before making any decisions.. There's bound to be one solution to it..   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

(which means less nagging.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> )<br><br>You feel that the problem revolves around this huge giant topic of 'Being-sian-in-the-relation.' Let me say something: A couple truly in love enjoys being together and not the things they do. OBVIOUSLY - the chemistry is blown off after a while and sinks into this phrase called the routine relation.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>What is routine relationship?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Let me ask some simple questions: Do you still have the great desire to see your other partner? Do you still sms those cute little mushy mashy message anymore? How about the last time when you gazed into his/her eyes just for the sake of looking at him/her? Etc, etc, etc.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You both are bored easily because both of you ain't reached to a stage where you feel you could settle with one - Its natural and many people are in the same boat as you.<br><br>You mention that after you both break, it seemed like you lost some part of yourself, but dunno exactly what - This another clue of a routine relationship - its what my book, CloUdiSm - state as the Plain Water Relation (Plain water are tasteless, but you can't live without them).  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Both of you are SO used to being together that love isn't a factor to hold this relationship. Its the companionship and the fear to venture alone in life.<br><br>He mentioned that he has a little crush on this girl - my guess of 96.3% confidence is that he couldn't get her. Either luck/fate is not on his side or he just never do anything. Because if it does, he wouldn't go back to you. Same for him, naturally same for you if you were to be in this shoes.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Since the both of you have decide to patch back, my suggestion is that if the both of you were to lead this relation like what you people has always been - then I see no point in patching back. This patching must be accompanied by the effort and wanting to work for this relation in ENSURING that this routine problem is minimize. Sunrise mentioned quite a few good examples and ways for better communication, etc - look through her words.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>P.S: Patching back isn't simply just patching back - it means you have to strive to put more effort from both side since the previous union.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers<br></div>

I c ur prob... I actuali encounter such probs b4 too in my relationship. Juz tat itz not as serious as wat i wil post here loh. Every relationship is bound 2 haf probs, like wat frenz here say. U muz b stil young like mi i suppose. But u've already been in dis relationship 4 quite a period of time liao. Gettin jealous is normal loh. I would say tat itz a ger's nature. I oso do feel jealous at times when even my bf wif his guy frenz. They may not necessary tok abt guys stuff. Maybe they wil tok abt other gers or ogle at some chiobus outside. So i dun c dis as a prob tat hinder ur relationship.<br><br>As u c, when ur tokin wif other guys onli ur bf wil get jealous liao. So e more he shd understand ur feelin... Both of u shd haf trust in each other, shd assure love 4 each other mah. He told u he dreamt abt e past, sad memories i suppose. U shd tok 2 him loh. Tell him tat itz no use tinkin or recallin abt e past liao. Itz a fact tat wat happened in e past did reali happen. But u cant undone it wat... So wats e pt of recallin sad times in e past while e both of u r actuali happy together now in e present? At least if u spend tat time rememberin all e happier times together b4 itz stil reasonable. U shd tel him 2 cherish e present loh...<br><br>Den another prob. Ur commuication wif him. Both of u r lackin communication in ur relationship. N tats a impt factor tat contributes 2 a gd relationship. A couple need not c each other everyday as long they haf each other in their heart. N itz oso becoz u dun c each other often so u'll haf more 2 tok 2 him e next time u meet him mah. Ur guy is indeed weird. Guy wif little words... Maybe both of u r stil young n after some time tend 2 get tired of e relationship. Tat shdnt b e case if u reali wanna b together wif him. U shd c long term. Like wat loneryu00 had said, ur in a 'commitment' stage. U n ur guy shd noe wat is commitment n how u go abt it...<br><br>But |Uv`-f|UtE-`, glad 2 hear ta ur bk wif ur bf. Itz a gd thing. It shows tat u stil can haf room 4 improvement in dis relationship. It oso shows tat ur stil in love wif each other. Now try 2 haf more communication wif him. Find out more abt him, noe wat he likes 2 do, or c if both of u share similar interests. So u can take up same hobbies wif him, n both of u wil haf more things 2 say loh. Try 2 b gd 2 ur guy, let him feel love fr u. Dun anyhow throw tantrums loh... But sometimes gers wil haf monthly mood swings lah (u-noe-wat-i-mean...)... I oso understand sometimes emo cant control one loh... Mi 'guo lai ren'... Went thru alot too... Ppl here wil noe wat i mean...<br><br>Regardin his lil' crush on tat ger fr his sch... Dun worry so much as itz onli moment of affection n it wont last long lah. Unless they take a step forward 2 noe each other better... Anyway itz gd 2 hear tat u've gotten it over liao. But if i were u i wouldnt b so strong as 2 get it over so fast. S'pore is so small n itz always e same places 2 go 4 couples... Itz up 2 both of u n wat preferences u haf den u decide e places loh... Try 2 do lil' stuffs 4 ur guy, surprise him n let him feel different. Im sure he'll appreciate ur effort.<br><br>So... Dun get sad now loh... Cherish e time wif ur guy maintain e relationship. Try 2 understand e meanin of 'commitment'. Hope 2 c ur postin some other day tellin us ur on a stable relation wif ur bf liao... Take care. Sorry 4 e long long reply...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i think u did the right thing to talk it out with yr bf. loving each other conditionlessly is very impt. accepting the other's good point, and bad point, loving the other party regardless of their shortcoming, this will give them the security of being loved regardless their bad points, while giving them room to change for the better for you. encourage the other party to change. talking is indeed very impt, but communicating is more impt. can the other party understand your needs? everyone of us is imperfect. and when 2 imperfect ppl come together, become an imperfect situation. so dun blame yrself, try to be more understanding and change your bad temper. forgive one another. and treat him as you would want to be treated. u'll realise you'll get the same result if he really loves you. dun avoid stuff. just talk it out. u'll find that after talking about it and taking real steps to solving the conflict, u both will become closer.

(which means less nagging.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> )<br><br>You feel that the problem revolves around this huge giant topic of 'Being-sian-in-the-relation.' Let me say something: A couple truly in love enjoys being together and not the things they do. OBVIOUSLY - the chemistry is blown off after a while and sinks into this phrase called the routine relation.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>What is routine relationship?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Let me ask some simple questions: Do you still have the great desire to see your other partner? Do you still sms those cute little mushy mashy message anymore? How about the last time when you gazed into his/her eyes just for the sake of looking at him/her? Etc, etc, etc.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You both are bored easily because both of you ain't reached to a stage where you feel you could settle with one - Its natural and many people are in the same boat as you.<br><br>You mention that after you both break, it seemed like you lost some part of yourself, but dunno exactly what - This another clue of a routine relationship - its what my book, CloUdiSm - state as the Plain Water Relation (Plain water are tasteless, but you can't live without them).  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Both of you are SO used to being together that love isn't a factor to hold this relationship. Its the companionship and the fear to venture alone in life.<br><br>He mentioned that he has a little crush on this girl - my guess of 96.3% confidence is that he couldn't get her. Either luck/fate is not on his side or he just never do anything. Because if it does, he wouldn't go back to you. Same for him, naturally same for you if you were to be in this shoes.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Since the both of you have decide to patch back, my suggestion is that if the both of you were to lead this relation like what you people has always been - then I see no point in patching back. This patching must be accompanied by the effort and wanting to work for this relation in ENSURING that this routine problem is minimize. Sunrise mentioned quite a few good examples and ways for better communication, etc - look through her words.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>P.S: Patching back isn't simply just patching back - it means you have to strive to put more effort from both side since the previous union.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers<br></div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  Oh my dear...
