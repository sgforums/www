And don't ever think of dying, cos you never almost lost yr life b4, and you dunnoe how good it is to stay alive, and let me tell you this "ITS REALLY GOOD TO STAY ALIVE".

            <div class='col-md body'>Yupz like wat Atti mentioned.. we're sure there will be a reason for having this kind of feelings. Something happen in ur life of soemthing? Maybe it's not a failure in a r/s but more like unable to get the love or attention that u were searching for. For instance, maybe u may say that ur parents dotes on u. but u usually return to a empty home after sch. Maybe u find urself popular, but the thing maybe u find that ur friendships wif them are very superficial. Or maybe u have seen so many negative sides of life hence feel rather bored of life coz it may mean that life is full of pain...<br><br>Tell us... we'll try our best to help..

            <div class='col-md body'>dearest leo...<br><br>everyone will somehow or other grumble about his/her life... no one is 100% satisfied with their life.. some might say " hey, my life's great and i love every single bit of it.. ".. deep down inside will go " but it might b better if... " or " of coz i won't mind another.. "... stuffs like that...<br><br>what i'm trying to say is that no one's life is perfect and smooth sailing.. tho i dunnoe wat causes u to b so depressed as that was your one and only message with no reply... i'm sure there's some bright side that u can look upon, some sources of support where u can derive your strength from, some aim and goals in your life for u to bear hope in life.. death is definitely not an alternative...<br><br>ok.. before i carry on with  all the "seemingly crap" i have told u... i hafta admit resorting to death has brushed across my mind before.. and trust me, there's many out there who have thot about it before... but juz dun eevr let this thought sets in... you can make a decision.. and u sounds wise enough to me as in the sense u should be able to know what's the best for you... reallie hope that seeking death was onli a passing remark or something that struck u but oso left u instantaneously...<br><br>you don't have to be perfectly satisfied with your life... one with no faults... juz try 2 be contented... your life will be better... may you be blessed with true happiness soon.. ^_^<br><br>[This message has been edited by Babyacid (edited 17 February 2001).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i guess i just have to say that depression can be unexpected .. i mean , you can have everything going right for you, and still be depressed. if you`re feeling down, get help. let your friends, maybe your family know. let those around you know, so they can help you along, take care of you. its not going to help to keep it to yourself.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Many people misunderstand clinical depression from the blues. It happens to the affected and causes unhappiness without any reason. I suggest if u feel this way all the time. Please go see a doctor. It is treatable. It's like having cancer, no matter how much you try to fight it, without medical help, u still succumb to it's fury. Go see a doctor. If u r afraid to see one, call me. Cause I have it too and until now I still dare not see a doctor. Ha ha. Good luck.</div>
