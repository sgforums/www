            <div class='col-md body'>I agree, if you are not schooling, then go to a polyclinic and get a referral to any of the hospital with a neuroscience unit or counseling centre.  The psychiatris will first go through with you your history and then do a diagnosis on whether you are suffering from depression.  Medicine may or may not be required.  Bec you are referred you will be entitled to subsidised rates.<br><br>They have counsellors there too.  eg like in NUH's neuroscience department, they have psychiatrists and psychologist (counsellors) so you can see both.<br><br>The thing about depression is that the sooner you seek assistance the easier it is to resolve it.  so please be encouraged to seek assistance.  plenty of people do it and in fact 1 in 5 will get a sever bout of depression sometime in their lives.  so its nothing unusual.<br><br>For private psychiatrist in places like raffles hospital/geneagle/Mt E and other private clinics, the charges that I know of can be anywhere from $80-150 per visit and counselling can range from $50-150/hr.  Some of these practitioners will vary their rates according to your ability to pay.  Yes help is not cheap but from people whom I know of, they see it as a something worthwhile even with the cost bec without normal level of feel good, your quality of life and your performance in relaitonship and even in work and making money is affected so it becomes more expensive not treating it!<br><br>So if you cant go the private way, go through the public route and you will get medical assistance at subsidised rates.<br><br>Take care</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Oh if your depression does not originate from a biological cause, whether the doctor gives you any medication or not to help lift your mood, you should still see a counsellor to work through the issues.  otherwise, the medication can make you feel good but once you stop, the issues remains and you are kinda back to square one.<br><br>Depending on the reason and cause, sometimes you do need to have a trained counsellor to help.</div>

Haiz.....</div></blockquote>sorry to hear that you are under so much pressure.  It is only natural that anyone under the pressure that you are under will feel the way you feel.<br><br>The first thing to do is to regulate your sleep.  YOu definately need more sleep and quality sleep at that.  Go to your GP or your polyclinic and explain to the doctor what you said here.  Ask for something to help you to sleep.  without sleep, all the other "help" will not work as well.<br><br>Next thing is to eat.  you need to regulate your body function.  loosing too much weight has a big impact on your body.<br><br>In as much as your mind determines your mood state, so does the health of your body!  so you must must must regulate your vegitative state first - ie your sleep and your eating!<br><br>next once you have rested and eaten get some exercise.  There are a few hormomes in your body that will make you feel better, one of them is adrenalin, the other is endomorphine and some other feel good chemicals.<br><br>Have you always been so under weight?  Get your health checked out by the doctor.<br><br>This is a good place to start.  At the same time, you may want to start on your counselling.  It is never a sign of weakness to go for counselling.  Only the wise and the healthy are willing to go bec they can put aside their so called pride and admit that there are just somethings in life that they need help to understand and work through!<br><br>let us know how it goes ya  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Haiz.....</div></blockquote>see a doc from polyclinic... then they will refer u to IMH... depends on ur condition, if taking anti-depress medi, u need to pay but to seek a therapist, i dun think u need to pay for anything...<br><br>Btw, i think u stress urself out.... Try exercise or yoga to destress... or re-think ur problem and find a solution... i don't think things can turn out so bad that u can be starved to death right... the worst is not there yet.. so lighten up abit!</div>
