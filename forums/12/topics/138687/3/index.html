I dun know f i like her or her what. but going out as platonic friends i am afraid i cannot control myself when she arouse me and engage in sexual activities with her. I have needs too and i have no gf k. I ceased contact with her for about 3 days from now and everyday she is smsing me asking if i am alright aand she is worried what happen to me. She is like crying in the sms whn she ask me to sms a while to know that i am fine. I am getting soft hearted again but i don't want to sms her back to give her false hope. I rather she hate me and stop pestering me.</div>

All the guys thought  that since she is an ugly gal sure no one want one to have sex with, so goes happily goes to bed with her and some guys she did oral sex only and was shock to find that they kena some sex problems. Shockingly the gal still goes around doing that to guys who are not aware of her.<br><br>Is ok since you feel that she is not the same person as the one in my case then  I will not talk about the case anymore, since you say you just only want to be normal friends with her.</div>
