            <div class='col-md body'>yesterday we met each other again and from her face she is so happy to see me but we are only going out as friends. We went for dinner like normal and then go for movies. She already bought the tickets and it was lover's seat before i found out. inside the cinema, she rested her head on my shoulder and i allow her not very polite to push her away then later a while, she rested her hands on my pants (private part) and i didn't really push her hands away i just say no but she didn't stop and continue that time i was high already because her hands were massaging there. she unzip me and took out my brother and rubbing it and oral sex till i climax. I made a mistake here and i should have stop her right from the time she rested her head on my shoulder. But thank god the show ended and we left. after the show, she says she is feeling very upset and stress and ask me wanna go beach and take a walk but i decline and she seems begging me i told myself go beach only lah. we sit on the beach and watch the stars and she says she miss me very much throughout these months and she was leaning on my shoulder again and even closer like hugging me from the side with her body so close to me. She kissed me on my face and lips. Being polite, i kiss her face back and put my hands on her head and console her. But i don't know if we can still go out or not. I treat her as friend but she treats me like husband. What can I do to make her give up without hurting her at all?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>

If she can do it to you in the cinema, are u sure she never do it with other guys too? U are only 23, do you want to have any health problems due to sex? oral sex there is no protection. Just want to caution u first.<br><br>My advice:  Totaly ignore her stop all calls and sms. She is sex crazy and once she is finished with you she will disappear and find a new one.<br><br>Just curious is she born in the month of feb?</div></blockquote>she only did that with her ex bf . oral sex carries little to no risk besides she is the one giving me and i did not give her.<br><br>I did try to ignore all her calls and sms but she will sms me things like is it because u think i am no good for you all these? and even sms me say things like she cannot live without me. She is sex crazy and i can tell but i don't wish to be like a toy to her.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agreed with your saying that I should focus more on the guy but for the guy I think the people in the forum had already done a very good job in advising him. I have already say and done enough for him. If he does not want to listern, is his choice and we cannot force him. I see no point in repeating my advice for him again and again since I will be wasting my time doing that.<br><br>If this is a normal case I would agreed with you that the girl is not at fault and she is just trying very hard to love someone but sadly to say if the profile match then we have a problem at hand.<br><br>I am giving the worst case scenario!!<br><br>If she got some health problems due to having too much sex, she might have spread it to him already. I am trying to stop her in her tracks and prevent other guys like him from suffering.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To Kerotan Frog, I really hope that you will heed my warning and leave the girl alone, sometimes being hard hearted may save your life.<br><br>This gal profile is the same as the previous case, the way she says and the lies she tells and finally the methods she use are the same. Even the birth date is too close for comfort.<br><br>Just to warn you that this gal is a very dangerous gal. I do not wish to nag but if you wish to countinue to see her is your choice I have no right to change that.<br>No one can save you but yourself. Only you can make a difference.</div>
