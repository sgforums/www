We went for dinner like normal and then go for movies. She already bought the tickets and it was lover's seat before i found out. inside the cinema, she rested her head on my shoulder and i allow her not very polite to push her away then later a while, she rested her hands on my pants (private part) and i didn't really push her hands away i just say no but she didn't stop and continue that time i was high already because her hands were massaging there. she unzip me and took out my brother and rubbing it and oral sex till i climax. I made a mistake here and i should have stop her right from the time she rested her head on my shoulder. But thank god the show ended and we left. after the show, she says she is feeling very upset and stress and ask me wanna go beach and take a walk but i decline and she seems begging me i told myself go beach only lah. we sit on the beach and watch the stars and she says she miss me very much throughout these months and she was leaning on my shoulder again and even closer like hugging me from the side with her body so close to me. She kissed me on my face and lips. Being polite, i kiss her face back and put my hands on her head and console her. But i don't know if we can still go out or not. I treat her as friend but she treats me like husband. What can I do to make her give up without hurting her at all?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> </div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

Some even think the opposite sex are tools to be use to achieve what they want.<br><br>I used to know a girl, who is first condemn by our class girls, then she no choice have to stay with boys, some of us sympathise her, some were even infactuated with her as she belong to the "needed protection" type but as time passed, she grown into a 1000 year v*x*n, able to manipulate guys to do things for her, all she do was plead and charmed, and 90 % of the guy would give in.<br><br>I have also know that 2 tools clever women like to use are their charm if they are not bad looking and tears which all of them have to achieve their goals.<br><br>not saying all girls do such things, but trust me, there are cases out there.</div>
