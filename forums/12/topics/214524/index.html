            <div class='col-md body'>education and all these nitty gritty things don't really mater in a r/s<br><br>what matters are that you got to accept him as he is and realise that whatever habits you know him to have now, will continue for avery long time. What I am saying is that if you are comfortable with the fellow, but you expect him to change for the better in future, I hope your future is measured in million of light years. It depends on what you can overlook and what you cannot. I can over look my husband's smoking, coffee drinking habits and the fact that he is married to his family and love his niece dearly. But I would not overlook if he is constantly in financal issues and I would not overlook that my guy is not strong in character and street smart.<br><br>I don't know about you, but as a woman, I look for security. I tend to forgo things like romance and etc over the fact that he is reliable. But just as mentioned, B was chasing you and I do not know how much you know about B so make your decisions wisely. But every action has its own consequence. AS my mother said, there is some good but never perfection.<br><br></div>
