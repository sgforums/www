You have to decide your own destiny.  But let me share my story.  I was with a Mr. D for almost 3 years... I have lost count how much I have loaned Mr.D to pay up for his gambling debts... from EPL to World Cup... each debt comes in midto high four-digit amounts... and because he's on and off jobs, most of his living expenses were paid by me...<br><br>Everyone thought I must be mad... I guess I was... But at that point of time, I truly believed he loves me... afterall I did so much for him.  He told me he will change... But he never did....<br><br>I though I could take the monetary stress and the objections from my family... I believed one day, he will lead a normal life... It's been 2 years since we broke off... He's still the same...<br><br>One thing I realise about <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">habitual gamblers</span></strong> is that they will never change...<br><br>No asking you to dump him immediately... Just want you to face the facts bravely... after going through so much crap... after all the pain... you are just waiting for the sweet ending to come... the day Mr. A will finally wake up and be a real man...<br><br>Mr. B shouldn't even be in the picture... cos you have to make a decision for yourself... if you are going to leave Mr.A...<br><br>Be brave girl... sometimes... persistence doesn't pay off... life's as such...<br><br>Good luck!<br></div>
