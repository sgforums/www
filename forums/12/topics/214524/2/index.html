            <div class='col-md body'>First, A is immature. He doesn't know how to manage his finances and he gambles. God knows how long he will take to quit that habbit if you don't teach him a lesson by leaving him.<br><br>Second, B has a son. Does he have a wife? If he does, you might be breaking up his family, even though he shows lots of interest in you. And if he can break his marriage covenant with his wife, what makes you think he'll not break the one with you in future? If he doesn't have a wife, then might want to give him more time to know you better and for you to know him better too. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
