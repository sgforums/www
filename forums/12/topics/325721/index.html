              <p>tried and tried, this time no violence.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>but it seems relationships after relationships go down the drain.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i had a thread before and yes, i did not resort to abuse in a relationship. yet what i do is throw tempers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>it seems, i have put aside many instances of chances where girls are decent and demure, the traditional dream girls.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>my taste has evolved, into something, voracious and unique.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i have been doing some soul searching and knew what i want: girls with character, spunk, x-factor.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i recently got together with another girl and yeah she left. but somehow i identified the problem. girls with character seek independence. they seek distance between each other and understanding. however, i keep treating the girl as she is dependent on me. and it fails because i seem too 'clingy' to her. and the clingy feel only comes in when i deem a girl dependent on me.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i view it as a mistake on my part. so the burning question is, what do girls with the X-FACTOR want? what do they need?well i dont need specific answers but just, in you peoples' opinion, probably through past experiences would be nice.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>thanks.</p>

              <p>in the past, it seemed everything was right, friends and family thought we were the right one, but i started the abuse in the relationship and she left me.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>this time round i did not use any violence anymore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>yes, there should be mutual respect and space for each other, but what if the partner is capricious, and does so much behind your back?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>if we are saying 'whats ours will be ours and what's not wont be', then why shouldnt we fight for whats ours? its the insecurity some flirting partner gives to us that leads to a more restricted relationship right? can we blame ourselves totally?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>then again, it takes two hands to clap.</p>

              <p>Be yourself. You are destined to mess up your life. So be it. Try not to drag someone else in with you.</p>
              <p>Trying to figure it out the tactics and technique, will only make you successful in catching a luckless girl. But not keep her. You want an object, you go get it. No need to consider its preference. You want a person, you have to give regard as to whether that person wants you. That is an important consideration.</p>
              <p>Remember verbal abuse is assault. Just because it is vocal and not physical, and the law do not recognise it as assault, doesn't mean it is not assault.</p>
              <p>Hitting with a fist or a stick. Hitting out with your vocals. It is the same, only the medium used is different.</p>
