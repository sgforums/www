Saying sorry is  a show of one repentance and acknowledgement of one mistake. Its usually fruitless and uneccessary if one say "I am sorry..but I am still correct...I am sorry..but you shouldnt have done that..I am sorry..but..".<br><br>Anyone who apologise, i do acknowledge he is keen to make up for any disagreement, but most importantly, is he really fully aware people might be more interested in some actions, some show of full unreserved acknowledgement of mistake, than some forms of compensation like an apology, monies, other sort of benefits? This specially apply for really serious disagreement or long term brawls..not those "Oops, sorry I broke your favourite chinaware..sorry if this statement offend u" sorta immediate acknowledgement of own faults thingie.<br><br>I mean, for me seriously, an apology is not the end which i expected or hope for in certain situations, some situations require some show of actions, and most of all, since an apology must be treated seriously, it should be an wholly unreserved one.<br><br>Otherwise, actually i am allright if someone dont apologise at all, instead of making reserved, conditional apology, which is kinda worse. Like my JC Physics tutor alway say, sorry has lost its meaning. Its time to give value to it.<br><br>Hmm, the above is my opinion only. Anyone has theirs to share? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br></div></blockquote>yeah i have apologised many times to some people who get offended easily about what i say.. even though i think they are too sensitive;<br><br>e.g. in class<br><br>me: hey Y, u know how to do this question?<br>Y: No....*glarey look*<br>me: oh ok.. just tot u were the maths wiz..nvm<br>Y: *evil look*<br>me: what?<br>Y: U just PISSED Me off<br>me: hey man im sorry<br>Y: *walks off*<br><br>later on hours later. Me looks for him at the canteen:<br>me: hey sorry about that little arguement ok? *me shakes his hand*<br><br>thats it..<br><br>me walks away thinking; "Jesus christ, what a fucking weirdo, these people.."<br><br></div>

It doesn't necessarily means that someone definitely has to be saying it just to humour you? They can be very sincere too..? You just can't fix in all into one mold..
