Don't worry, we all go through that kind of stage before we are more open to this society...<br><br>First thing to do is to say out loud, 'you want to be out-going'.<br><br>Second, when talking to people, bring in subjects or similiar experiences that you have encountered...<br><br>Third, listen (not hear) to what people are talking... Be curious in new things people are saying to you, and be interest in things that sparkle your mind...<br><br>Fourth, when you feel that the person is thinking you are bored or snobbish, tell them the truth that you are actually shy and quiet... this will not only break the barrier, it will also let them know you better...<br><br>Fifth most importantly, Join our outings.. you will learn to speak up... hehehe~<br><br>------------------<br>()""()     ************************<br>( 'o' )     Barely Bearing Berry Belly Bear<br>(,) (,)   =======================<br>(.)_(.)

            <div class='col-md body'>Always remember that what you are facing is not a "problem" as some have said. Perhaps you are a bit different due to your upbringing. Going out for gatherings is ok but take small steps at a time. But you have to keep in mind that if you're not ready, these gatherings can be cruel at times. I would suggest you start of with a small group max 3 pple incl yourself. Too many and you risk being left out and that can be awkward. In any case, unless you really feel necessary, don't change just because you want to fit in. You know, a lot of pple looks happy and fun on the outside but actual fact it isn't so. These are just suggestions, it may not work and you have to do some soul searching to find the inner happiness and peace.<br><br>As for what others can do to help, you could show some compassion when you come across such cases. Rather than ignoring the poor chap and continue with the flow, you could slowly coax the person to open up. It takes time, patience and tolerance. The rewards will come much later.</div>

We are not born to b gd communicators, some people r strong in it and others aren't.  In order to overcome your problem, juz open up and talk to others, don't hav this feeling that others won't like what u said, juz speak what comes to your mind, trust me, I've been thru your stage and thought that I may nt b speaking what others like to hear, but in actual fact, this is a learning process and we can actually learn mre as time goes by, trust me...<br><br>------------------<br>Hope to b your frd forever, Mike signing off</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I feel there is nothing wrong with being quiet.  And there is nothing wrong with sitting in a corner.  I am new to my module classes, I sit in the corner and i keep quiet.  I do that simply cos there is no need to talk, but when people talk, reply and try to keep the conversation going.<br><br>Sometimes, i feel the key is finding the right people to talk to.  I would think as these people as the "laoda."  Once u can communicate well with them, u basically unlock the door to talking to the whole group.</div>
