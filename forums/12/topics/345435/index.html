              <p>coz the parents noe each other tt well tt they think it's best they divorce. wife earns abt 3x more than hubby (partly coz she grab OT all d time)..hubby doesnt want to get a part time job n choosy in finding a better earning job..he's working as a cleaner, say, a security job earns better, but doesnt want to..reason being, boring job, juz sit n do nothing..</p>
              <p>they havent slept together in years.. by tt i mean, sex.. hubby is sick of wife's attitude, finally saw her true colours after 20 yrs of marriage.. wife juz have a lot of say in d family.. wife decides to get a divorce coz hubby was a nuiscance to her..</p>
              <p>that's d gist of it..</p>

              <p>LOL Dearie,</p>
              <p>Then I think its a matter of economics.</p>
              <p>When you kids are younger,Â  not divorcing, is a matter of trying and hoping that things can change for the better.Â  ie, your mother needing to work, someone need to be home to watch you kids, be around for you kids.Â  And all female's hope that their spouse will change for the better, or contribute better.</p>
              <p>Divorcing now when the kids are grown up, is still possibly a matter of economics, She is resigned to the fact, that he dont like to contribute to you siblings or to maintain a lifestyle and since you mentioned that they are already living kinda separate lives, maybe she just wanted to kick your dad to pull up his socks to provide for the family instead of living off her salaries.</p>
              <p>So divorce is to her, considered a method to get your father get sensible.Â  If he doesnt, well, it wont hurt her since they have grown apart.Â  If he does, then it will be better for you and her,Â  she does not have the hassle of a marriage, and you kids will enjoy the fruits of her 'labour'.</p>

              <p>Humans are flawed beings. Love that brought us to spend an eternity together only reveal those hidden flaws. Some whose love for each other are strong, accept those flaw, but some refuse to bow down to failings and seek for improvements.</p>
              <p>Neither are both circumstances wrong...or right.</p>
              <p>Only the children suffer. Many whom love their children stay in a marriage despite inherent flaws of their opposite member and hope for change. Some in despair break free, children and time,effort wasted to clear their minds.</p>
              <p>Children suffer nevertheless still. No child must be left without a father or a mother, for both willÂ impart traditions and knowledge to the next generation, and more importantly, the rock of stability for a growing child grasping to understand and comprehend the adult world and its complexities.</p>
              <p>Children are born out of love between 2. It hurts them to see parents quarelling and fighting, and in their young innocent minds, trying hard to understand and make sense ofÂ what they are seeing.</p>
              <p>For the sake of children, divorce must, mustÂ always be the lastÂ solution. Adults must find ways to negotiate and compromise. Marriage was contemplated because of love, and trueÂ love never dies, simply because love is built with a strongÂ foundation of care and concern and many other good qualities admired in mankind.</p>
              <p>It may seemed absent over time, but that spark of love will always burn within, if only one pauses to recall back the building days.Â Should a divorce occur, it is still never the end. Love that is built is never easy to destroy. Being apart may even rekindle the glowing ember.</p>
              <p>So do not be afraid or sad or blame anyone. What must come will come in the end, for the good of all. As long as we are still alive and able to breathe, your parents will still be around for you to confide in, even though apart now. Learn from their mistake so that when your turn comes to love another, mistakes can be avoided and not repeated.</p>
