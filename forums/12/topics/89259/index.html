Many people be it guys or gals.. When they are attached, they tend to throw their frens, good frens etc aside.. Its not surprise esp when they wanna spend most of their time with their bf/gf.. I believe the friendship is still there.. Just that its not that close as before..<br><br>There is no such thing as looking back for old frens and they will think you look for them when in need.. Honestly, in my view, i find it a very lame and stupid way of thinking..<br><br>Like what the others say, socialise with outside people..
