              <p>pardon my long-winded story.</p>
              <p>During the December holidays, I've started to like my classmate (let's call her Gi). I guess that's what they called absence makes the heart grow fonder. I don't dare say we hit off really well at school, but at least we were on talking terms and SMSed from time to time.</p>
              <p>Lately, I've tried small steps to win her heart, like meeting her before going for class outings and offering to see her home after that. Unfortunately, these attempts have been unsuccessful. She would say her boyfriend is sending her there and she would be sharing cab with her girl friend home (although I lived closer to her).</p>
              <p>The news that she has a boyfriend certainly broke my heart. And I confided my sadness to her close girl friend. However, according to this girl friend of hers, Gi sweared to her  that that is not a boyfriend, YET. My so-called rival is actually a family friend of hers and Gi has a pretty good impression of him.</p>
              <p>Of course, this now introduces another problem-- why did Gi tell me she has a boyfriend, even though they have not gone into a relationship YET?</p>
              <p>I chose to believe her friend, coz it reignited my hope. Her birthday is coming in two weeks' time and I wanna spend it with her, that is, if she gives me that chance. I tested her out today after one month without SMSing her. I went to NTU today for a school tour and offered to bring her some brochures and prospectus. Well, at least she replied but it was still a 'no thanks'.</p>
              <p>So the big question now is whether I should pop the question?, that I wanna celebrate her birthday with her. I could almost foresee a no (CNY, busy). There should be no harm trying (at most worsening of our relationship, if we even have one in the 1st place). Yet, I'm kinda sick of being rejected all the time. Does sincerity through never giving up still work in this age and time?</p>

              <p>i would applaud your effort, so sweet ~<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/love.png" alt="love.png"></p>
              <p>however, give her some time and space, don't give too much pressure. honestly i think she is not interested in you, but that doesn't mean no hope.</p>
              <p>the sms can still go on, but the private meeting thing you should stop awhile, few months later then try again, juz to give her some breathing space</p>

              <p>well well well... i would say that you have almost zero chance to be with her..</p>
              <p>She is already hinting to you that the two of you hav absoultely no chance by telling you that she has a bf. She chooses to share a cab with her female friend instead of you means she wants to keep a distance from you. Thirdly, she rejected your offer in helping her get some brochures from NTU means that she does not even wants to meet up with you.</p>
              <p>This is the cruel truth. I suggest you to forget about her and move on. Dont even try to ask her out to celebrate her birthday with you. You are just a nobody to her, she can always celebrate with that male friend that she is interested in, or her other friends. I suggest you dont ask her just so that you do not bring hurt to yourself.</p>

              after one month without SMSing her. I went to NTU today for a
              school tour and offered to bring her some brochures and prospectus.
              Well, at least she replied but it was still a 'no thanks'.</p>
              <p>So the big question now is whether I should pop the question?,
              that I wanna celebrate her birthday with her. I could almost
              foresee a no (CNY, busy). There should be no harm trying (at most
              worsening of our relationship, if we even have one in the 1st
              place). Yet, I'm kinda sick of being rejected all the time. Does
              sincerity through never giving up still work in this age and
              time?</p>

              <p>well well well... i would say that you have almost zero chance
              to be with her..She is already hinting to you that the two of you hav absoultely
              no chance by telling you that she has a bf. She chooses to share a
              cab with her female friend instead of you means she wants to keep a
              distance from you. Thirdly, she rejected your offer in helping her
              get some brochures from NTU means that she does not even wants to
              meet up with you.</p>
              <p>This is the cruel truth. I suggest you to forget about her and
              move on. Dont even try to ask her out to celebrate her birthday
              with you. You are just a nobody to her, she can always celebrate
              with that male friend that she is interested in, or her other
              friends. I suggest you dont ask her just so that you do not bring
              hurt to yourself.</p>
              <p>Give up now rather than later. There is no chance.</p>

              <p>I agree man. You tried to play it cool by staying away from her for a month. Apparently it didn't have an effect on her at all. Usually within 10 minutes of meeting a girl she decides if you are boyfren material. Sometimes cannot means cannot. Just move on for the next prey.

              <p><br>Not meaning to be rude, but that's the typical mindset of a defeatist.</p>

              <p>The sad truth is that what suck 20 years ago still suck now. If you're boring and totally unattractive to her - don't think you'll find her in your arms "in the future".</p>
              <p>I always tell people to put yourself against your opponent - what is it that he has that attracts her like hell? And what is it that you lack? If your game plan's obviously not working, then well... change it!</p>
              <p>Well, TS you can choose to do it the "purists" way and bump into a lot of walls in your entire love life; but you also can choose to use a bit of brain and start winning at some hands.</p>

              <p>pardon my long-winded story.</p>
              <p>During the December holidays, I've started to like my classmate (let's call her Gi). I guess that's what they called absence makes the heart grow fonder. I don't dare say we hit off really well at school, but at least we were on talking terms and SMSed from time to time.</p>
              <p>Lately, I've tried small steps to win her heart, like meeting her before going for class outings and offering to see her home after that. Unfortunately, these attempts have been unsuccessful. She would say her boyfriend is sending her there and she would be sharing cab with her girl friend home (although I lived closer to her).</p>
              <p>The news that she has a boyfriend certainly broke my heart. And I confided my sadness to her close girl friend. However, according to this girl friend of hers, Gi sweared to her  that that is not a boyfriend, YET. My so-called rival is actually a family friend of hers and Gi has a pretty good impression of him.</p>
              <p>Of course, this now introduces another problem-- why did Gi tell me she has a boyfriend, even though they have not gone into a relationship YET?</p>
              <p>I chose to believe her friend, coz it reignited my hope. Her birthday is coming in two weeks' time and I wanna spend it with her, that is, if she gives me that chance. I tested her out today after one month without SMSing her. I went to NTU today for a school tour and offered to bring her some brochures and prospectus.

              <p><br>What do you see in her in the first place?</p>
              <p>What is the reason that caused you to be attracted to her?</p>
              <p>If it is not her personality, then it is her physical appearance.</p>
              <p>You will find someone with better physical appearance than her and next time you must first fall in love with her personality before you decide if you can love her physical appearance for the longest period of time.</p>
              <p>Life is full of regrets lurking at every corner, so don't make this current girl becomes one of your regrets in life. Because some regrets will stick with you for life, unlike other kinds of regrets.</p>
              <p>I don't encourage you to confess because you couldn't make her feel attracted to you, and she doesn't have any reason to accept you and so she won't accept you as her boyfriend.</p>
              <p>Even if you succeed, you also won't feel comfortable with her if she's constantly rejecting you. How much more pain can you absorb before you breaks?</p>
              <p>Think about it and it's better to go after the girl only when you have succeeded in attracting her attention and of course...curiousity. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
