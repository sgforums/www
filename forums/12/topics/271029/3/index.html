Think again.. is it really worth for you to be angry with this shhyt type of gal ? Does she really deserve your cry or anger ? Think again... Dun be so emotionally in this period of time<br><br>I think she wants u to forget her thats why she showed u the pic..<br><br>Dont you get it,? Its really over, shes  not meant for you. She is the playgal type.. u wont be happy if you be together with her again</div>
