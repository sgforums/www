Don't you think the relations are getting really stretched?<br><br>It's always nice to care for a friend, especially a close friend. But even if blood were to spill and revenge were taken, what would that justify? It will only satisfy your own hatred for injustice which you inherited from your friend's misfortune. What you really need to do now as a friend, is to help your friend to recover from this sudden break-up.<br><br>Good luck. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>
