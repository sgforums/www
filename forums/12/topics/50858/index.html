(Ok, I double checked and found your DOB with me) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><strong>Nobody</strong> has doom love life - I don't use astrology to advice people I know them real life. The reason why I do it here, at times, is because I do not know them personally and the questions people post ain't the problem at all (probably a comment post or similar Or I am just curious lar.) Everyone is entitled to their own share of love and romance - just how you go about handling it makes a whole lot of difference. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Ok, here it goes again astrological speaking, the reason why things are happening is influenced by your Venus in 7th hse squaring your Neptune: "You should make a <strong>particular effort </strong>to examine your motives in your sexual and emotional desires before pursuing them actively.<br><br>It is really important to stand back and take a second look at relationships or partners that seem, at first glance, to promise everything you want.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>This does not mean that every seemingly golden situation is rotten underneath, but that you <strong>should be aware of that possibility</strong>. By being scrupulously honest with yourself and by asking the opinions of trusted friends, you may gain a much more realistic viewpoint and avoid becoming enmeshed in affairs that will surely go awry. This is especially important, because once into an unsatisfactory situation, you find it quite difficult to <strong>extricate yourself</strong>."  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Have you pondered all that I mentioned above?

            <div class='col-md body'>if you said those guys you met are liars (which they obviously are) but whereas you have little feelings towards those nice and honest guys, could the issue in the guys that you are looking for? It is horrible to be taken for a ride and it seems it has happened before. There are guys who are smooth talkers (even black can be argued to be white by them), be wary! These are the ones who can make you laugh and also cry the hardest. Look for sincerity....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

Alot of people out there have PROBLEMS with their LOVE life. I guess this should APPLY to them too? And meanwhile perhaps you should advise them NOT to struggle and just give up on things?
