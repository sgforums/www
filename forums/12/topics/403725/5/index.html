              <p>are
              you perfect? have you never done anything that you regret and wished
              for chances in your life? from the sound of it, it seems you could do
              no wrong. or perhaps you do have that 1 or 2 regrettable things, and
              you choose the cowardly way out: you exit the entire relationship when
              you could have chose to face up to it and make amends, that is what a
              MAN do, he dun run. </p>
              <p>from what you said abt my example, by
              bearing with the agony of multiple betrayal, you feel that is a show of
              weakness? its people like me who condone such acts of infidelity? well,
              its either of 2 things:</p>
              <p>possibility 1: you did not read the
              post properly because you seemed to miss the fact, that she knew it was
              a problem that she have. (and upon checking with her ex bfs, none of
              them lasting more than 6mths, its true. she has been cheating her
              entire life. thats how all her relationships ended.) you also missed
              the fact that i concluded in which she has been 'clean' for the past 1
              year.</p>
              <p> her precious sister sms me: you are the only guy i have
              seen with her so far, who may be able to help her....please give it
              some thought...</p>
              <p>you see, Sg lovecop, there is something you are
              missing here. you do not understand that she cannot help herself. not
              everyone is as mentally strong as you are.</p>
              <p>but she wants to change, qn is, who is going to help her change? a kiddo WILL leave her and say: F*ck you slut!</p>
              <p>a man will say: are you possitive you want to change? how do you intend to change? how can i help you to change?</p>
              <p>possibility
              no. 2: you absorbed all the facts but because you are too immature to
              understand the essential point: its human to err. question is, is
              he/she willing to be better.</p>
              <p>yes, i do check on her and the reason behind it is very simple.
              it was a solution proposed by her so as to help me slowly gain back the
              trust in her again. it was to both of us at that point in time, the
              best way forward. Even my counsellor said so. and i am proud to say, i
              dun feel the need to check on her as frequently as in the past.</p>
              <p>here's a real life qn for you to ponder Sg Love cop: at the very
              beginning of any relationship, trust is implicit until one party breaks
              it. question is, does it mean that the broken pieces should be swept
              and thrown away? and start looking for another one? please
              think.....not for anyone's sake, for your own sake.</p>
              <p>you say i am in no position to advise TS, i tell you why i am
              eligible to advise the TS. i understand the pain of betrayal. that is
              what he going through now. i do admit, without a child in my equation,
              its slightly different. but it does NOT hide the fact that what the TS
              is going thru now is something that i can relate with. and you, being
              such a....' perfect person' i would assume, have never been betrayed.
              so tell me, in what capacity do you have, to advise the TS to ruin 3
              lives by having a divorce?</p>
              <p>1 last thing i have to point out to you; Quoting you:</p>
              <p><em>of course its a very tough road. why do you say it never end? if
                                      you are living happily, all the suffering should already be behind
                                      you. i really doubt whether you are living happily with your wife
                                      now or you are just settling for whatever you can get. TS's wife
                                      doesn't even want to go to counselling.</em></p>
              <p>when
              you question why i say it never ends, it just proves 1 thing: you are
              really in-experienced in relationships. a relationship is a journey,
              its not a fairy tale book that ends with living happily ever after.</p>
              <p>You have a lot to learn about relationships, my young friend.</p>

              <p>are you perfect? have you never done anything that you regret
              and wished for chances in your life? from the sound of it, it seems
              you could do no wrong. or perhaps you do have that 1 or 2
              regrettable things, and you choose the cowardly way out: you exit
              the entire relationship when you could have chose to face up to it
              and make amends, that is what a MAN do, he dun run. </p>
              <p>from what you said abt my example, by bearing with the agony of
              multiple betrayal, you feel that is a show of weakness? its people
              like me who condone such acts of infidelity? well, its either of 2
              things:</p>
              <p>possibility 1: you did not read the post properly because you
              seemed to miss the fact, that she knew it was a problem that she
              have. (and upon checking with her ex bfs, none of them lasting more
              than 6mths, its true. she has been cheating her entire life. thats
              how all her relationships ended.) you also missed the fact that i
              concluded in which she has been 'clean' for the past 1 year.</p>
              <p> her precious sister sms me: you are the only guy i have
              seen with her so far, who may be able to help her....please give it
              some thought...</p>
              <p>you see, Sg lovecop, there is something you are missing here.
              you do not understand that she cannot help herself. not everyone is
              as mentally strong as you are.</p>
              <p>but she wants to change, qn is, who is going to help her change?
              a kiddo WILL leave her and say: F*ck you slut!</p>
              <p>a man will say: are you possitive you want to change? how do you
              intend to change? how can i help you to change?</p>
              <p>possibility no. 2: you absorbed all the facts but because you
              are too immature to understand the essential point: its human to
              err. question is, is he/she willing to be better.</p>
              <p>yes, i do check on her and the reason behind it is very simple.
              it was a solution proposed by her so as to help me slowly gain back
              the trust in her again. it was to both of us at that point in time,
              the best way forward. Even my counsellor said so. and i am proud to
              say, i dun feel the need to check on her as frequently as in the
              past.</p>
              <p>here's a real life qn for you to ponder Sg Love cop: at the very
              beginning of any relationship, trust is implicit until one party
              breaks it. question is, does it mean that the broken pieces should
              be swept and thrown away? and start looking for another one? please
              think.....not for anyone's sake, for your own sake.</p>
              <p>you say i am in no position to advise TS, i tell you why i am
              eligible to advise the TS. i understand the pain of betrayal. that
              is what he going through now. i do admit, without a child in my
              equation, its slightly different. but it does NOT hide the fact
              that what the TS is going thru now is something that i can relate
              with. and you, being such a....' perfect person' i would assume,
              have never been betrayed. so tell me, in what capacity do you have,
              to advise the TS to ruin 3 lives by having a divorce?</p>
              <p>1 last thing i have to point out to you; Quoting you:</p>
              <p><em>of course its a very tough road. why do you say it never
              end? if you are living happily, all the suffering should already be
              behind you. i really doubt whether you are living happily with your
              wife now or you are just settling for whatever you can get. TS's
              wife doesn't even want to go to counselling.</em></p>
              <p>when you question why i say it never ends, it just proves 1
              thing: you are really in-experienced in relationships. a
              relationship is a journey, its not a fairy tale book that ends with
              living happily ever after.</p>
              <p>You have a lot to learn about relationships, my young
              friend.</p>

              <p>TS: sorry for hijacking your thread....i just realised how rude i
              was...please...spare me 1 min to read through the following...and by
              the way Sg Love Cop, i am thru with you...i realised you honestly just can't relate to relationships....and its sad...but like what someone else said in this thread: its good that u hate adultery to the bone....i just hope, for your sake it will never ever happen to you becoz the psychological trauma is unthinkeable....i was like you in the past actually....</p>
              <p>TS: i know how u feel, i understand the anger that erupts occasionally when you think about it...but please understand....</p>
              <p>formula: intent dictates action dictates end results</p>
              <p>1. you can't change the past...</p>
              <p>2. the future is NOT made...its resting on the above simple formula...</p>
              <p>please think about the intent...you need to decided very firmly on your intent....and i would advise you not to shape the intent based on feelings....but based on your goodness and humanity. you acknowledged that partially you were to blame...but finding legal recourse against a guy in another country is an intent to revenge....and you know what happens when a person holds the intent to revenge...he / she destroys the people around him / her...</p>
              <p>i had difficulty overcoming those swells of anger in the past before as well....even till today sometimes...but much much less so....1 technique that worked for me (recommended by my counsellor): i think about the happy times, i visualize her laughing at my jokes, i visualize her look of delight when i gave her a present...all the tiny tiny little things...and i remember how happy i felt, making her happy....</p>
              <p>it has helped me...i hope it will help you as well....</p>
