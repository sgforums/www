              <p>you doubt, that when betrayal of trust has happened, the relationship can continue happily.  i am a living example that this can happen: <a href="http://sgforums.com/forums/1991/topics/402715?page=1#post_9877264"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff; font-family: Times New Roman;">http://sgforums.com/forums/1991/topics/402715?page=1#post_9877264</span></span></a></p>
              <p>you also mentioned, that as long as you select the right partner, the bond will get stronger and stronger. well, i am positive when you make this statement, you have not gone through enough relationships to have the neccessary experience to advise the TS here, in fact, your comments are dangerous to the TS at this stage as he is emotionally fragile at this moment. thus please spare a thought with your comments. you may very well be destroying 3 lives.</p>
              <p>my suggestion to the TS:</p>
              <p>from your responses, i have no doubt that this case that u raised, is a real case although who u really are in the case, i do not know. the road of recovery from humiliation, anger, betrayal, to one of love is a very very tough road. as someone who underwent betrayal 6 times, i fully understand.</p>
              <p>you need counselling help; both you and your wife. its tough but not impossible. and it will never end. take strength from your kids and perservere no matter how daunting it feels to you sometimes when doubt and anger creeps into your mind again. work at it.</p>
              <p>simply being optimistic is not going to work. you need to keep working on the relationship and be the one that gives Love. i wish you the best of luck.</p>

              <p>6 times betrayal? If everyone were like you, everyone would be cheating around behind their spouses. You know why? Because no matter how many times they do it, their spouse will still forgive them. By condoning their sins, you are encouraging them to do it again. Your wife is a record holder all because of your tolerance and generosity. I guess you have become very good at suppressing your own feelings.</p>
              <p>of course its a very tough road. why do you say it never end? if you are living happily, all the suffering should already be behind you. i really doubt whether you are living happily with your wife now or you are just settling for whatever you can get. TS's wife doesn't even want to go to counselling.</p>
              <p>you give her love and she returns it with 6 times of betrayal. Fantastic advice!</p>
              <p>Oh look what i found. You are the type of guy who will entertain the idea of fooling around.</p>
              <p>"if the
                                          opportunity presents itself for me to have sex 
                  with another girl,
                                          would i do it? Definitely MAYBE....Why? my life 
                  is too short not to
                                          experience different things...no human likes to 
                  eat abalone every
                                          day.....including girls."</p>
              <p>Your situation is entirely different from TS. Your relationship is based on multiple sex partners, how can you compare with his. And you want to advise him now? HAHAHA</p>
              <p>and you have to conduct surprise checks on your girl? Wow, you must trust her alot. Even if you do not manage to catch her again, doesn't mean she is not screwing other guys behind your back. She just got better at hiding it from you!</p>

              <p>6 times betrayal? If everyone were like you, everyone would be
              cheating around behind their spouses. You know why? Because no
              matter how many times they do it, their spouse will still forgive
              them. By condoning their sins, you are encouraging them to do it
              again. Your wife is a record holder all because of your tolerance
              and generosity. I guess you have become very good at suppressing
              your own feelings.</p>
              <p>of course its a very tough road. why do you say it never end? if
              you are living happily, all the suffering should already be behind
              you. i really doubt whether you are living happily with your wife
              now or you are just settling for whatever you can get. TS's wife
              doesn't even want to go to counselling.</p>
              <p>you give her love and she returns it with 6 times of betrayal.
              Fantastic advice!</p>

              <p>All your fault la. Dun ever beat her or raise your farking voice at her anymore.</p>
              <p>1st step: Let all your relative to know and let them advise her. You cannot advise. The more you talk the worse it get.<br><br>2nd step: Your most precious chip is your kids. A lady is always a female creature. She will be more bond to the kids. So stick to the kids and let her feel that the kids needs her everyday. Let her have no time.</p>
              <p>3rd step: You can't take legal action againts him BUT you blow up the matter and force your wife to quit. Go to the office and make noise. You must bring her out of the situation and the enviroment VERY IMPORTANT bro. Den Throw away her hp and make it seem like lost and change her HP number. The guy shouldn't chase her.</p>
              <p>4rd step: Try to think. I think cos the guy is someone that can aids her career so she dun dare to go against him. The guy is just a life saving cause when your wife feel sad. He consoles her and let your wife put him into her minds.</p>
              <p>5th step: DUn ever called up the guy and scold him. You will only push your wife to him more. Dun ever get into a fight, you are always at the losing end cos you will only push your wife to him.</p>
              <p>6th Step: Spend more time with her but not fetch her everyday but occasionally. Reminds her of the time you have been with her. Give her family happiness and not pressure her. She will come to you. REMENBER you are Always at the Upper Hand cos you got CHIPS on your hand.</p>

              <p>You stupid. You think the lady will do that. She is already confused. File for domestic, it got to have medical report to support. Now no injuries unless the TS own up in the court.

              <p>I dunno is her wife a slut. Maybe she is too confused. If she got the determination to twist the two guys around her finger, truly she is really a SLUT.</p>
              <p>But TS is trying to salvage their marriage. What i can say is just treat her well. She will think of TS every now and them as they are once together happily and married.</p>

              <p>You stupid. You think the lady will do that. She is already confused. File for domestic, it got to have medical report to support. Now no injuries unless the TS own up in the court. Full custody not that easy to get. You totally dun understand. Dun ask people to divorce, may you in bad luck forever.</p>

              <p><br>You then is most stupid, don't know the law still want to act like you know.</p>
              <p>Don't you know you don't need medical report to file for domestic violence?</p>
              <p>Crime is defined by the victims, if the victims felt that she was discriminated, then she has a valid case.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Full custody is not difficult to obtain as long as you play your cards right. Against dumb Singaporean males, it is extremely easy to obtain. Don't you know that the law favours women to men?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why do you think TS's wife should play fair in TS's game of divorce? It is the dumb TS that will continue to play fair in his wife's game.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I believe a lawyer should do their best to protect their client and show no mercy to beat down their opponents, no matter how dirty it is required to twist the fair law for the sake of their client's advantage.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have no problem of living in bad luck, but you seems to have a huge fear of living in bad luck, so I will wish you forever to live in your fear of bad luck.</p>
              <p>The fact is, the more you feared bad luck, the more likely you will be hit badly and haunted by bad luck throughout your lives.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And there's really nothing you can do about it.</p>

              <p>It's a good thing you despise adultery so much.</p>
              <p>You hate it to the bone. That only means that YOU will not commit such sin yourself.</p>
              <p>Hold yourself to this kind of high standard, is a good thing actually.</p>
              <p>But don't hold your high standards to another person. You will be disappointed.</p>
              <p>In life, we go through ups and downs.. people fail , and they stand up again.  We commit sins, but we must repent and not do it again.</p>
              <p>When someone genuinely repent and seek forgiveness, we must try our best to forgive.</p>
              <p>When the sinner continues to sin.. then we move on knowing he/she cannot change.. we do so because we are protecting ourself.. not because we are angry.</p>
              <p>Does your parents punish you severely when you do wrong ?</p>
              <p>You seem rather an extreme personality. I think you must have grown up in an extremely strict family. Much devoid of love and forgiveness. Yes ?</p>
