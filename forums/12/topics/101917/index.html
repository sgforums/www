            <div class='col-md body'>There is this guy whom i have met thru an online network...and we first agreed to meet through a clubbing session. By then we have already known each other but got to meet face-to-face for the first time.<br><br>Even though we met each other for the first time, he already started making simple physical contacts like ruflling my hair and touching my arms.<br><br>Then we started to go swimming together and went out together. One day he even asked me to go to his house to watch a movie.<br><br>All these while he has been very friendly to me, and as usual, he made lots of physical contact like putting his arms around my shoulders, ruffle my hair, poke my cheeks, poke my waist, splashed water playfully when swimming and carried me in his arms and threw me in the pool, asked me to give him a massage, playfully called me names, tried to pull my hand when we crossed the road, and gave a parting hug when we parted on the bus. When i was at his house, he carried me again and then put me down into his laps. He used to mention that he "quite like petite girls" (like me), and he talked about his ex-gf casually who seems to be petite also. when i was at his house, he actually took off his shirt and asked me to apply moisturiser on his back and give him a massage...sometimes he will jokingly call me to give him a hug, but i will refuse.<br><br>I do not know what he's thinking, and i'm not sure if he's interested in me or just toying with my feelings, or treating me like an "outgoing" girl. In front of him, I do not act flirtatious, because I am still a conservative girl who will not have sex with anyone until i really find the right one whom i will marry. But it's easy to ask him to go out. I dunno if i am treating him just like a friend.<br><br>I do not feel the same way to him as I did to people whom I really liked before. The thing that confuses me, is that he's a <strong>model</strong>, and I do not know who he hangs out with. I am confused. I am kind of attracted to him now, but i dunno if it's lust or like, and i also found out that he has a lot of friends. I do not know if he treats other girls the same way as he did to me with all those physical contacts.<br><br>Please tell me what i should do to know if he's really interested in me or just being friendly or playing with my feelings.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks everyone from your replies....but i just wanna add on, that we really did not do anything at his house, he showed me sum army videos and his baby photos....<br><br>He's quite friendly to me, and i feel happy hanging out with him coz he makes me feel comfortable with all his crap. i really wouldn't have continued seeing him if he really makes me feel awkward, and the things he did (other than giving him a massage, and putting me on his lap after carrying me ---think it was only a convenient gesture coz he was tired after carrying me) really seem like sweet gestures a guy would do to a girl. He even sent me and my friend home after clubbing that day. That's why i am confused.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>to understand him further, maybe you should try to go out with his group of friends and observe how he behaves... seems you two have not explored much into each other's life... i say its still early lor, give it time... don't rush into anything...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>........................................................................................................................................<br>~ meow ~ meow ~ <img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v517/kei_ko/catdance2.gif"> meow ~ meow <img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v517/kei_ko/catdance2.gif"> meow ~ meow <img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v517/kei_ko/catdance2.gif"> ~ meow ~ meow ~</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I used to know a guy like that.<br><br>He starts off being soft and friendly.  A true gentleman and a great friend.  At early state, he will start touching the 'victim' netral zone in the so-called 'natural and friendly' manner.  Then he will continue.. and continue.. and slowly escalates to touching other parts.<br><br>I once witness him smacking 4 different girls butt while in the same room.  I asked the girls 'Doesn't that bothers you?' and to my surprised, their respond, "Oh, I think it's okay.  He can't help it and we don't really mind."<br><br>So I ask, "You don't really mind being touch on your butt or you don't mind him touching your butt?".. Obviously, I got scolding from the 4 girls for kinda insulting him.<br><br>Months later, when they realised that he is trying to work on them to be the one playboy among them.  They realised that they have been too open towards him and have been providing free tofu.  They have nothing much to blame except for feeling stupid as they did not oppose to his action as and when it happens.<br><br>So.. good luck to you and bare in mind that, when a man loves a woman, he will do anything for her especially respecting and honouring her.  Touching in the manner you mention? Well, it's a sign of testing water on your level of openness to let him pop the golden question physically or verbally.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Thanks everyone... i believe that I have been too innocent to give in to him whenever he asked me to go to his house and give him a massage and stuff. I was too soft to reject people.<br><br>I guess i just have to work out my firmness and stop going out with him for a period of time.<br><br>Although he may be intellectual and friendly to everyone, it seems from his friendster testimonials that he gets attention from females very easily and I believe he is friendly to everyone else.<br><br>I had to thank him tho, for brightening up my days when i was out with him. I believe if he was really sincere and interested in me, he would show it through other means, like making extra effort to do things for me, instead of me doing things for him.<br><br>Thanks. I have reached a decision. I believe we should still remain as friends, but refrain from going out with him too much. if his actions continue to become too much, i guess it will just break the trust between us even if we were just friends.</strong></div>

By then we have already known each other but got to meet face-to-face for the first time.<br><br>Even though we met each other for the first time, he already started making simple physical contacts like ruflling my hair and touching my arms.<br><br>Then we started to go swimming together and went out together. One day he even asked me to go to his house to watch a movie.<br><br>All these while he has been very friendly to me, and as usual, he made lots of physical contact like putting his arms around my shoulders, ruffle my hair, poke my cheeks, poke my waist, splashed water playfully when swimming and carried me in his arms and threw me in the pool, asked me to give him a massage, playfully called me names, tried to pull my hand when we crossed the road, and gave a parting hug when we parted on the bus. When i was at his house, he carried me again and then put me down into his laps. He used to mention that he "quite like petite girls" (like me), and he talked about his ex-gf casually who seems to be petite also. when i was at his house, he actually took off his shirt and asked me to apply moisturiser on his back and give him a massage...sometimes he will jokingly call me to give him a hug, but i will refuse.<br><br>I do not know what he's thinking, and i'm not sure if he's interested in me or just toying with my feelings, or treating me like an "outgoing" girl. In front of him, I do not act flirtatious, because I am still a conservative girl who will not have sex with anyone until i really find the right one whom i will marry. But it's easy to ask him to go out. I dunno if i am treating him just like a friend.<br><br>I do not feel the same way to him as I did to people whom I really liked before. The thing that confuses me, is that he's a [b]model</strong>, and I do not know who he hangs out with. I am confused. I am kind of attracted to him now, but i dunno if it's lust or like, and i also found out that he has a lot of friends. I do not know if he treats other girls the same way as he did to me with all those physical contacts.<br><br>Please tell me what i should do to know if he's really interested in me or just being friendly or playing with my feelings.[/b]</blockquote>Typical playboy. Reject him.</div>
