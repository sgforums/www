That why I said, if she is happily attached, shouldn't try to break up the r/s...</div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Say you are a third-party of a bad-relationship, does that makes the title 'third-party' any better, or technically makes the party involved feeling better? In an analogy, it seemed better to steal-from-the-rich and divide it among the poor, but does it means the crime has became something else other than theft?<br><br>Don't get me wrong, I am not saying that being a third-party equates to 'crime'. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>I wholly support the idea of all is fair in love and war</strong></span>. I am just curious how people reason with themselves regarding 'Good' and 'Bad' relationship and how it seemed ok to enter into the picture using a third party title ONLY if your love is in a distressing relationship. Of course, often, some are downright obvious CMI, but there are the dubious kind - where the 'bad' isn't a bad, neither is the 'good' something good. So what do you do? Stagnation?<br><br>E.g. Your crush tells you that his bf is always neglecting her. In your opinion, he seemed like a bad bf. So under this assumption, one step into this damsel in distress, feeling completely reasonable. Say your crush loses the relationships and almost gotten a relationship with you, but just before that happens, she realise that that guy wanted to propose to her this coming week, working all his guts out to buy her a ring, thus neglecting her for the past few months.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> We are just mindsets of our own preceptions.<br><br>When he/she is attached in non-marriage sense, that doesn't mean competitions ends there. Being attached, still means your options are open, JUST that you DON'T actively seek potential mates to settle in another BGR, because that would bring in complications.<br><br>Still my old saying, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>a completely satisfied woman cannot be seduced</strong></span>. If he's a guy, then it depends on his wisdom. (Nature is such that biological genes want polygamy, spiritual love wants monogamy). <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

Before John can get Cindy Peter gets her and leaves John feeling sore.<br><br>Then after sometime John recovers from emotional sadness and his eyes fall on Anna. Peter again becomes friends with Anna too. John is about to ask Anna out when he realises that Peter and Anna just got attached. Yeah Peter n Cindy broke up.. Yep. Poor John got beaten to it twice by the same guy.<br><br>Well I am the John in the story and the feeling totally sux. I liked Anna for 8 months.. But all gone in a week..
