Then later you contradict yourself by complaining that he did not share happiness with you. What are you talking about? He also has his problems too. He also can't share NS with you, can he?<br><br>Then you say you can stand loneliness and you understand his NS transition period but you are still feeling that lack of lovingness from him. You contradict yourself by saying that you can stand loneliness and you still want to meet him. Truth is, you aren't. Lots of confusing language here. What about you showing your lovingness by not demanding too much ? Aren't you contradicting yourself here? You know his problems but you are complaining. Are you being understanding?<br><br>Haha...Im not trying to scold you or anything. Give him room to relax and adjust into NS life.<br><br>OK? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>doko</div>
