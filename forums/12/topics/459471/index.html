Often for many projects he has a very good Plan A in his mind. When Plan A fails, he should also have a Plan B. But he do not always have a Plan B ready on hand. He starts to get stressed up before finally coming up with Plan B. I believe an entrepreneur must always be prepared for the worst case scenario.</span></p>

But it annoys him to no end that others tend to think that appointments and starting times are just suggestions or hints, not actual times. Previously he worked with a partner that is not always as on the ball as he is. He gets very stressed up. He is also often very eager to suggest how his schedule goes and how things should be done to save time.</span></p>

                      do not always have a Plan B ready on hand. He starts to get
                      stressed up before finally coming up with Plan B. I believe an
                      entrepreneur must always be prepared for the worst case
                      scenario.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span>He enjoys
                      working that clearly defines his responsibilities and maybe the
                      customers’ as well. But he does not like to write things down or
                      work with contracts. He relies solely on trust and his
                      understanding of his customers.</span></p>

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span>He seldom
                      takes advantage of getting caught up with the latest happenings. So
                      he does not do upgrading of skills at all. He relies on his current
                      knowledge and skills as his asset. He does however enjoy learning
                      by doing.</span></p>

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span>He has a
                      habit of being punctual which is good. But it annoys him to no end
                      that others tend to think that appointments and starting times are
                      just suggestions or hints, not actual times. Previously he worked
                      with a partner that is not always as on the ball as he is. He gets
                      very stressed up. He is also often very eager to suggest how his
                      schedule goes and how things should be done to save
                      time.</span></p>

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span>Lastly, he
                      gets very eager to start up that he might simply just get a partner
                      for his business. The partner might be a friend he knows; might be
                      someone of the same field. But if the partnership builds up too
                      much disagreement, for example sense of time, the business might
                      wind up again.</span></p>

              <p>Men are bigger risk takers than women.</p>
              <p>Some men take calculated risks, most women prefer stability.</p>
              <p>Men often venture out of their comfort zone trying to make something out of nothing , women only do so after they have secured backings.</p>
              <p>To start up a business, he can be a sole proprietor or private limited company. No need to find a partner if he doesn't work well in a partnership.</p>
              <p>You and your husband seem to have a lack of knowledge in setting up a company. Please educate yourself first.</p>
              <p>No human is perfect. Not even the most successful businessman.</p>
              <p>You have insecurities that's holding him back. You will need to resolve this first.</p>
              <p>Are you worried about financial liabilities ? Are you worried that he will squander/gamble away all the family savings and leave nothing for you and your children ?</p>
              <p>If you can afford, hire a independent financial advisor ( not insurance or banking sales people) to help determine if venturing out is a good idea . Your husband will be more receptive to the advisor than you nagging him with your negativity.</p>
              <p>Instead of fighting him, I suggest you work with him to figure out something both you and your husband will be comfortable with. <strong>Both </strong>of you will need to compromise.<strong><br></strong></p>

              <p>First of all, its great to have th entreprnerial dream.</p>
              <p>But having said that one  must go back to reality. Do I really make the cut to be entrepreneur as of now?</p>
              <p>What must I do to become successful?</p>
              <p>Think about george lucas and steve jobs who failed so miserably b4 coming to become so successful.- Can i suffer the varoius setbacks?</p>
              <p>Perhaps that would be too far fetched you say, but in local context look at the bubble tea biz. during the craze, ppl want to do this biz. but after the hype wats left are notably koi, gong cha and others who became brand name.</p>
              <p>They have a long-term approach and not jumping in for a quick profit.</p>
              <p>A biz must be viable and sustainable in the long run.</p>
              <p>Partnering wise, choose prudently. I know of someone who got cheated by his partner during a joint venture and I do not want your partner to reach this state.</p>
              <p>Yes, an entrepreneur rely on his experience gained from real life and his instincts. but he does needs skills upgrading.If he doesnt know how to man and build a website and do biz accounting, how is he  going to expand and manage the business finances and  cashflow? If cashflow is a problem. the company if half-dead.</p>
              <p>Time wise, can you or your husband take up failure from risks of biz? cuz if thinkinh of fulltime biz, only income would be from buidling your biz. But if you need cash for biz and family, can you have sufficient cash to toght over till the biz breakeven and gains profit?</p>
              <p>If not, I would suggest your husband remains at full time job and start a biz part time.ONly when income from biz is stable then you may consider changind to biz full time.</p>
              <p>But well, thats time-consuming and may have little time for family in the short-term and relies much on family support.</p>
              <p>Can your husband take the stress and tired schedule?</p>
              <p>To be a successful bizman, you must have the passion in it to help you to pull through the rainy days.</p>
              <p>IFA suggestion may be an idea, but I would not personally suggest it as they may not have the experience to advise on biz stuffs. They do not know how to operate  biz.</p>
              <p>Would you listen to a professor lecturing on marketing or accounting if they are not proficient in the field?</p>
              <p>All this are based on my personal opinion.</p>

              <p>Business survive and grow simply because of its owner! Why? It is the business intellect of its owner to see, response, attract and select the right opportunities, right partners, right customers, and most importantly adjustmentment toward changes, especially adverse changes in the market.</p>
              <p>I own a business and fwew things are more exhilarating as being totally

                                  <p class="" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span>My husband
                  has been telling me his interest in starting his own
                  business.</span></p>
                  <p class="" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span> </span></p>
                  <p class="" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span>He has been
                  into his own business before but he wound up his business because
                  he said it is tiring and stressful.</span></p>
                  <p class="" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span> </span></p>
                  <p class="" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span>Now after
                  he became employed, he desire to go back again. I told him I
                  disagree with him.</span></p>
                  
                  Just quick questions here.
                  
                  1. What sort of business he wish to start?
                  2. Does he has enough running capital that will sustain his business for months to come to probably afew years to break even?
                  
                  <p class="" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span> </span></p>
                  <p class="" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span>He has many
                  qualities of an entrepreneur but he also has some dodgy traits that
                  worries me.</span></p>
                  <p class="" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span> </span></p>
                  <p class="" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span>He is a
                  good planner. Often for many projects he has a very good Plan A in
                  his mind. When Plan A fails, he should also have a Plan B. But he
                  do not always have a Plan B ready on hand. He starts to get
                  stressed up before finally coming up with Plan B. I believe an
                  entrepreneur must always be prepared for the worst case
                  scenario.</span></p>
                  <p class="" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span> </span></p>
                  <p class="" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span>He enjoys
                  working that clearly defines his responsibilities and maybe the
                  customersâ€™ as well. But he does not like to write things down or
                  work with contracts. He relies solely on trust and his
                  understanding of his customers.</span></p>
                  <p class="" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span> </span></p>
                  <p class="" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span>He seldom
                  takes advantage of getting caught up with the latest happenings. So
                  he does not do upgrading of skills at all. He relies on his current
                  knowledge and skills as his asset. He does however enjoy learning
                  by doing.</span></p>
                  <p class="" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span> </span></p>
                  <p class="" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span>He has a
                  habit of being punctual which is good. But it annoys him to no end
                  that others tend to think that appointments and starting times are
                  just suggestions or hints, not actual times. Previously he worked
                  with a partner that is not always as on the ball as he is. He gets
                  very stressed up. He is also often very eager to suggest how his
                  schedule goes and how things should be done to save
                  time.</span></p>
                  <p class="" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span> </span></p>
                  <p class="" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span>Lastly, he
                  gets very eager to start up that he might simply just get a partner
                  for his business. The partner might be a friend he knows; might be
                  someone of the same field. But if the partnership builds up too
                  much disagreement, for example sense of time, the business might
                  wind up again.</span></p>
                  <p class="" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span> </span></p>
                  <p class="" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span>How should
                  I advise my husband to convince him?</span></p>
