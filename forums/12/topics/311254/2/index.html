              <p>Hi Jo,</p>
              <p>To your first question, I've got no better answer to it than it being a sense of pleasure. I think people enjoy physical intimacy from time to time.</p>
              <p>To say I feel physically used teeters on the highwire of extreme hurt. I don't think of it as hurt, more or less a hint of occasional glum.</p>

              <p>Are you subconsciously thinking that he is there to fall back on

              <p>I think if you want to really move on from this, u got to be
              hard on urself. Break off all contact. Or like what some of the
              forumners say, cook up an attached status story. Even though the
              sleepless nights might continue for awhile, at least, you know that

              <p>You're probably right in certain ways though I'm not counting on him for companionship. We are not in a relationship to begin with.</p>
              <p>I have broken off contact several times and I continue trying though I don't think the sleepless nights will stop. Especially of late when he's been increasing contact since he left a few weeks ago. From now on, I won't be answering any more phone calls or messages.</p>

              <p>You know your problem. Start from there.</p>
              <p>Your inner dialogue. Your thinking. Your mind is talking, try to
              identify who is actually talking, and give her a name. You will
              find your subconscious (or whatever name you gave it) elusive,
              and when you identified it, it will quieten down. Try it, and
              practice will lessen your dilemma. In the mean time, don't
              mind  the guy, and don't date him. When he calls, just dismiss
              him, and watch you mind's dialogue.</p>
              <p>And of course, you can't have a blank mind, think of other
              things. How to make life in the office easier. Increase you
              vocabulary, think of new words every day. Practice  awareness
              of your surroundings, by listening out and seeing details. Solve a
              sudoku puzzle. Don't let you mind go on auto run.</p>

              <p>You're feeling this way maybe because he has made a definite
              impact in your life in the past. It is hard to forget such a person

              <p>One way is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> to make this person the centre of your universe. You can try
              focusing your attention elsewhere, like on your studies/job, or
              family, or a new love perhaps?</p>
              <p>From the way you wrote, either he is a persistent fool deeply in
              <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/love.png" alt="love.png"> with you, or he is a
              pervert-on-way-to-becoming-stalker. Stop giving him attention. Put
              your hp on silent mode when you sleep at night. Don't pick up calls
              whose numbers you don't recognize. Don't reply his SMSes. Ignore
              him TOTALLY.</p>

              <p>I guess he's had an impact on my life in several ways. It doesn't consume me completely, but when I'm reminded of him when I see a message or a missed call, even if I do not return it and do not pick up, I could not help but wish this person was never part of my memory.</p>
              <p>Other times I wonder if we were the same type of person. And whether it was all that wrong to cease contact.</p>

              <p>I have been very forthright as a person with him. I told him this is headed nowhere. He asks me why. I tell him because he is this strange person who'll never be mine. He says he feels exactly the same way about me. I tell him it upsets me when he leaves. He informs me when he leaves and now makes it a point of telling me when he'll be back. But hey big fucking deal right? It feels as if he's now reminding me when he'll be back so I can clear my schedule in advance and make some space for him.</p>

              <p>My dear young lady. What you're feeling is a sense of loss of attachment with your pride and dignity wounded.</p>
              <p>After all you have been with this man for sometime and no matter what you said, you did invest your feelings into this relationship and did try on your part to make it work. After a certain period of time you realized the relationship was going no where whereby you were doing all the giving and not receiving anything back so being the smart logical person you are, you bailed, which is good. But do bear in mind you or rather most people are all emotional creatures and a part of us couldn't help but to feel 'cheated'.  And even though you know you really don't want this relationship anymore you couldn't help feeling a sense of loss as though a part of your limb was suddenly severed from your body even though that limb was cancerous.</p>
              <p>Take time out. Go overseas for a holiday to relax yourself. Get active. Do anything that will occupy yourself. Preferably switch off the phone if the need to be. That way you won't automatically reach for it when it ring. After a while you will be alright.</p>
              <p>Also let me warn you about this. Even though you were the one initiated the breakup but if you do happen to see him on the street with another girl you will suddenly feel a flare of jealousy. Don't worry about it. It's a natural process of breaking up. The feeling will pass.</p>
              <p>So don't go so hard on yourself. Good luck!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ps : By the way my wife said you sounded like someone she knew. A lecturer are you?<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/greggman.com/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>

              <p>No future with this person no matter what happens. We're headed
                  for very different places in life. I think the only window for a
                  possible relationship/future was closed a long time ago. My only
                  dilemma is my inability to let it go. I just would like some advice

              <p>Schizoprenia only if you are totally consumed by another personality and you are not in control.</p>
              <p>Here it is to tame your mind. Identifying the thoughts, recognising its characteristics, (giving it a lable helps to pinpoint it and subdue it). You can't stop you mind from wandering, but you can choose what you want to think about.</p>
              <p>When you can't sleep, because thoughts of some person is hogging you mind, try out the identification tactic.</p>

              <p>To your first question, I've got no better answer to it than it
              being a sense of pleasure. I think people enjoy physical intimacy

              <p>To say I feel physically used teeters on the highwire of extreme
              hurt. I don't think of it as hurt, more or less a hint of

              <p>Just do it, enjoy yourself, good bye, see you next time. Men does it all the time. Is it a "Wham, bang, thank you mam" encounter, that getting you feeling used? Well get him to work on you. Get him to give you that multiple Os. Give him the "Well done, thank you, stud, see you around."</p>

                          a new number and I wind up picking up the call. The cycle is
                          getting tiring. And I have long concluded we’re headed
                          nowhere.<br> <br> A few weeks ago, he asked me why I never seem to call him or
                          initiate contact even when he’s back home. I reflected asking him
                          why should I? I’m searching for a person who can be around for my
                          ups and downs. Not some kind of ninja (like a forumer once
                          described) who appears and disappears at will. To pacify the
                          situation he told me he’d be around when I need him. Even now when
                          he makes the effort to make more contact while overseas, I view it
                          as his latest attention-seeking ploy.</p>
              <p>Am I too cynical about this person or am I a dimwit, back up,
                          spare tyre who keeps falling for the same old tricks?</p>
              <p>Along with most of his other three worded sentences, I’m hardly
                          a believer anymore but I'm finding it arduous to keep him out of my
                          mind.<br> <br> What I do not understand is why is that no matter how hard I try to
                          be rid of this person in my life, he has to keep coming back. Why
                          he isn’t getting the hint. Is it because he thinks I’m really this
                          stupid?<br> <br> Feel free to be harsh.</p>

              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"> <span style="font-size: 10pt;">So we are back to square one; I checked my
              database and recalled replying to your post 290507, 310507 &amp; 300607. 
              Perhaps the difference now and then is that your earlier awareness confirms
              your need to sever this intensive karmic bond, yet you have no idea why you
              never succeed.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Yes you are right in saying that a dubious
              relationship with this man is meaningless and aimless. However, if you take him
              out of the picture and relook at your life holistically, it doesn't actually
              change much. What you are facing is the lack of strong conviction to remove him
              because in the first place his presence doesn't consciously change the existing
              structure of your love life, albeit in essence, it does affect you emotionally
              negatively. It is as empty as a shell.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Are you in love with someone else? No.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Are you exclusively dating with someone else?
              No.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Because your love life is almost defunctive,
              even if a jerk was to creep in and take shelter, it doesn't really matter
              because the real dude has not arrive to steal your focus away from this
              ridiculous relationship you had with him.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">To worsen your plight, it seemed to me that
              you have a very passive attitude towards changing your situation. You want to
              cut contact, yet you questioned yourself why didn't he get the hint and leave
              you alone. The problem lies not with him leaving you alone, but rather how much
              determination you have to tear away from this bondage. Logically, why should he
              initiate to leave since he can continue to milk sex from you? Hinting him to
              get out of your life? Oh dear, he is probably anxious that this uncommitted
              free sex is about to expire: better make more calls and shower more attention
              to ensure that it continues. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">My dear, you can't stop him from trying to
              contact you, but you have a choice on whether you are contactable by him.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Until the day this conviction is clear, you
              will never walk out of this.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Your emotions and mind is probably jaded. You
              might subconsciously tell yourself '<em>what the hack... what's the difference
              between having sex with him for the 65th times since we did it 64 times
              already.</em>'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">It's no longer about the sex or the
              relationship you have with him.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">It's about you being severely encumbered by
              this scenario, decapitating you and robbing your ability to see interest in
              anyone else.</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Unless you change status quo, you will

              <p>Yunn, thanks for your thoughtful post.</p>
              <p>Why is it an intensive karmic bond? In physical aspects, I try my best to do right from wrong. Whether it comes to him or any other options, I avoid veering towards temptation. Sometimes I manage, other times I don't.</p>
              <p>I quit picking up his phonecalls neither do I make contact. I avoid contact. By some twisted chance he keeps coming back into my life. Is it my subconsciousness at work?</p>
              <p>I've been in serious relationships but never been in love. Haven't dated anybody exclusively for a long time now. Your post brings one question to mind, something that's been nagging me from time to time, am I normal? What do I do from now on to turn things around?</p>

              <p>At times I veer off course and consider whether it's necessary for me to take a step forward. Be nice. Go for dinner. Give it a try. Do this and do that. Respond a little, pay him a visit, give him a phone call. Is it all connected? Are things the way they are today because I lack the ability to show this person, or any other person, any kind of affection? Or is this just the way it's supposed to be. And it's best for me to just leave things as they are because he's just a jerk to begin with.</p>
              <p>Did he severely encumber me, or was it my own doing? Who was wrong about it? I stagger along these two ideas, unable to decide.</p>

              <p>JD,</p>
              <p>May I remind you this.</p>
              <p>If he is the kind that will milk you for sex.</p>
              <p>He's probably milking other women for sex too.</p>
              <p>Given his status, he doesn't have to settle with just you.</p>
              <p>I suggest you go get your blood tested just to be sure.</p>
              <p>Think about your own health first.</p>

              <p>In between harsh opinions, frisky taunts and well-meaning words, just want to say I really appreciate those who’ve been giving me advice.<br><br>curiousOrange, <br><br>Everyone yearns to experience something out of the ordinary. I’d like to reinstate the fact that I am not referring to carnal pleasures. In my humble opinion, memories are always well worth it, whether good or bad. Even though there are certain extremes in the past I do wish to erase, memories on extremes of make and break, of life and death. This person had come into my life as part of that memory, an old phase of my life where most of it today has gone. <br><br>I haven’t been able to relate all of what happened, and not that there is much point to it but I bear no anger towards the situation. No resentment towards him. It came clear a year ago that this was headed for nowhere but funny how I still don’t think of Mr G as some wayward evil jerk. More like a person no different from myself, in search of what he believes in to fill in a void. Be it life, passion, love or simply casual intimacy. It could be naivety or plain foolishness. I have no idea. Probably too young to tell. Probably need to be more clever. I probably need a little bit more anger. <br><br>Apart from the realm of romance and love I believe in other possibilities. Sometimes it feels like things are moving on the right track. Other times it feels as though I let slip many things whilst in pursuit fervently. Mostly it feels like I’ve achieved very little over so long a time and in the end, conquests are all for nothing. Perhaps that is the emptiness you’re talking about. <br><br>Someone mentioned feelings dissolve in the natural rhythm of time. It does, except when you think it can only get better, a thought strikes and the heart rips once again even with my foot firmly lodged. And over the past few months, even in conversation and even when I'd thought emotions had faded away, it still feels weird. I find myself still thinking about the conversation. Maybe it's impossible to put certain things away with a reason.</p>
              <p>Right now I find myself in need of fixing perceptions. Maybe some time away will do me good. Or maybe there’ll be no end to fixing these things.</p>
