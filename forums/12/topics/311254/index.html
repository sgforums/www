              <p>I write with feelings of confusion. I'm not quite close to agony, but my situation is enough to jostle a few sleepless nights now and then. Seeking advice from people here, what would you do if you were in my situation?<br><br>I tried breaking contact. I deleted his numbers. I changed my numbers. But no matter how hard I try, as always I'd end up revisiting the same old grounds going through the same old feelings. The phone rings while I’m fast asleep, I pick it up in a hurry and it turns out to be him. Either that or I do not recognize a new number and I wind up picking up the call. The cycle is getting tiring. And I have long concluded we’re headed nowhere. <br><br>A few weeks ago, he asked me why I never seem to call him or initiate contact even when he’s back home. I reflected asking him why should I? I’m searching for a person who can be around for my ups and downs. Not some kind of ninja (like a forumer once described) who appears and disappears at will. To pacify the situation he told me he’d be around when I need him. Even now when he makes the effort to make more contact while overseas, I
                              view it as his latest attention-seeking ploy.</p>
              <p>Am I too cynical about
                              this person or am I a dimwit, back up, spare tyre who keeps falling for
                              the same old tricks?</p>
              <p>Along with most of his other three worded sentences, I’m hardly a believer anymore but I'm finding it arduous to keep him out of my mind. <br><br>What I do not understand is why is that no matter how hard I try to be rid of this person in my life, he has to keep coming back. Why he isn’t getting the hint. Is it because he thinks I’m really this stupid? <br><br>Feel free to be harsh.</p>

              <p>JD,</p>
              <p>Are you allowing yourself to get to know other guys ?</p>
              <p>You keep going back to the same old ground, because you have no newer ground to skip to.</p>
              <p>Is he really the most "eligible" guy in your life right now ? If so, just roll with it. Stop the hinting game.. stop the second guessing.</p>

              <p>Jo, work keeps me busy. Time flies quickly. I date people from time to time. I have no future with Mr G.</p>
              <p>Even for those I have no liking for, the way I see it some are more vacant than wistful. Others more wistful than vacant. People come and go in my life, I'm hardly in search of new grounds in the realm of romance.</p>
              <p>I don't think it's the problem of finding a new man. The problem could lie with myself? I have no idea. I cannot pin.</p>
              <p>I have been very forthright as a person with him. I told him this is headed nowhere. He asks me why. I tell him because he is this strange person who'll never be mine. He says he feels exactly the same way about me. I tell him it upsets me when he leaves. He informs me when he leaves and now makes it a point of telling me when he'll be back. But hey big fucking deal right? It feels as if he's now reminding me when he'll be back so I can clear my schedule in advance and make some space for him.</p>
              <p>The cycle repeats. Whatever cycle it may be, on days like this I think of it as a vicious cycle. And him, as a devious person.</p>

              <p>On the other hand, I'm chastened into believing life is short.</p>

              <p>You think so? I feel that way as well. I believe I've been trying too hard to rationalise this when in fact, all along it has been a meaningless problem. What I need is a good kick in the ass and wake up the idea.</p>

              <p>Thanks for the advice so far.</p>
              <p>He's not married, at least not here in Singapore. Not so sure about elsewhere. Not my ultimate goal to marry him. The way I see it, there's no real objective to this affair apart from the occasional companionship. Anything more than that is unnecessary. Or even beyond what is possible.</p>
              <p>To the second question, I'd be lying if I said I do not miss him when he's gone.</p>
              <p>I think the problem is even if I do not respond and come up with excuses for being busy etc, he'll still be calling. If not today, then tomorrow. Or the day after.</p>

              <p>He is a procrastinator.. and a procrastinator will not take the
              bait unless he is very very.. absolutely sure it's gonna be a
              secure long term investment.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Right now.. you're like a high risk investment.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On a lighter side, perhaps you can propose a long term plan.
              Like get married and start a family with him.</p>

              <p>Hi Jo,</p>
              <p>No future with this person no matter what happens. We're headed for very different places in life. I think the only window for a possible relationship/future was closed a long time ago. My only dilemma is my inability to let it go. I just would like some advice on how to let go of these old feelings which aren't doing me any good.</p>

              <p>If that is the case.. have you specifically told him you do not wish to have further contact with him ?</p>
              <p>When he calls.. you need to tell him " If this is about work, I'd be glad to hear you out. If not, please do not call me again."</p>
              <p>And if he ask you why.. you can use your tactic about having a boyfriend. After all , it is your personal choice.. and he has no right to question it any further.</p>

              <p>Jo, I think you're giving him too much credit. It's true that human beings by nature, they test. But some men stick around even when they know the relationship is not going to last. Usually to finish milking the sex until the female actually leaves.</p>

              <p>He calls, you respond. And you go home feeling like a used doll. What's the point ?</p>

              <p>Are you subconsciously thinking that he is there to fall back on in terms of companionship? And that when he comes back into your life, there's a tinge of familiarity or "i have so missed you..." that is holding you back?</p>
              <p>I think if you want to really move on from this, u got to be hard on urself. Break off all contact. Or like what some of the forumners say, cook up an attached status story. Even though the sleepless nights might continue for awhile, at least, you know that there is some light at the end of the tunnel.</p>

              <p>You know your problem. Start from there.</p>
              <p>Your inner dialogue. Your thinking. Your mind is talking, try to identify who is actually talking, and give her a name. You will find your subconscious (or whatever name you gave it) elusive, and when you identified it, it will quieten down. Try it, and practice will lessen your dilemma. In the mean time, don't mind  the guy, and don't date him. When he calls, just dismiss him, and watch you mind's dialogue.</p>
              <p>And of course, you can't have a blank mind, think of other things. How to make life in the office easier. Increase you vocabulary, think of new words every day. Practice  awareness of your surroundings, by listening out and seeing details. Solve a sudoku puzzle. Don't let you mind go on auto run.</p>
