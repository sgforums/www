              <p>Yunn, thanks for your thoughtful post.</p>
              <p>Why is it an intensive karmic bond? In physical aspects, I try
              my best to do right from wrong. Whether it comes to him or any
              other options, I avoid veering towards temptation. Sometimes I
              manage, other times I don't.</p>
              <p>I quit picking up his phonecalls neither do I make contact. I
              avoid contact. By some twisted chance he keeps coming back into my
              life. Is it my subconsciousness at work?</p>
              <p>I've been in serious relationships but never been in love.
              Haven't dated anybody exclusively for a long time now. Your post
              brings one question to mind, something that's been nagging me from
              time to time, am I normal? What do I do from now on to turn things
              around?</p>
              <p>At times I veer off course and consider whether it's necessary
              for me to take a step forward. Be nice. Go for dinner. Give it a
              try. Do this and do that. Respond a little, pay him a visit, give
              him a phone call. Is it all connected? Are things the way they are
              today because I lack the ability to show this person, or any other
              person, any kind of affection? Or is this just the way it's
              supposed to be. And it's best for me to just leave things as they
              are because he's just a jerk to begin with.</p>
              <p>Did he severely encumber me, or was it my own doing? Who was
              wrong about it? I stagger along these two ideas, unable to
              decide.</p>
              <p>I know you're no step by step guide out of any problems, but
              what would you do if you were in my shoes? I don't think the
              problem lies in this person. The problem lies with myself. If I
              were him, I wouldn't want me. So why should he? Or anybody
              else?</p>
              <p>Anyhow life goes on and I have many questions but never enough
              answers.</p>
              <p>Will take things as they come for now and keep myself busy
              enough with work and stuff.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> Karmic relationship doesn't define itself as a 'right'
              or 'wrong' relationship. The morality of a relationship is mere segmentation
              perceived by humans, churned from different sets of value and beliefs. It
              merely spells it as a relationship that produce tremendous lesson that leaves
              behind more than just footprints in our lives. Often we degenerate; may not
              always be in linear sense, but holistically speaking, something is stolen away
              from us surreptitiously and we can't seemed to revert back to 'once upon a
              time'.  </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">In general, we called it experience - what I did was
              to define this experience as karmic. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Twisted chances you say? Or is it self fulfilling
              prophesy? There is an equally high chance that you subconsciously bought the
              idea that he will never go away and your thoughts merely deliver this exact
              result into reality for you. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">What would I do? </span><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="icon_question.gif"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">You write well and I have seen long essay of your old
              problem a year back. Surely, there are probably some unspeakable emotions that
              cannot be expressed into words, racing through your consciousness randomly
              every other moment of your life, like some kind of macabre affliction.
              Therefore, you probably think, ponder, consider, conclude, reject/accept ten
              times more intensive about the emotions you cannot express, than the ones
              already written here. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The reason why you don't feel this vehement hatred
              towards him, albeit he has been condemned as a jerk by everyone else, is
              because he did satisfy a hidden, unconscious need you never realized in life.
              And I want you to understand that this vulnerability probably stem from some
              kind of aberrant development during your earlier stage in life. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">You are right in saying that there is 'something wrong
              with yourself' - therefore the exercise you need to accomplish is to uncover
              what went off-key in your life and what did his presence actually do to
              paralysis your unconscious wounds? </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Of course, it takes more than just an online forum
              like this to understand you as a person, because what works for me might not be
              as effective for yourself. Therefore, only by understanding one’s root where
              the rot began to fester, would one be more competent to combat current and
              future 'infections'.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Still, to answer your question: I will eliminate
              contact forever. No exception whatsoever. Period. Rational being: if you can't
              handle it, then avoid putting yourself into such predicament. Then I will nurse
              myself with massive introspections and reviews about this scenario and figure
              out what do I learn about myself from this ordeal. </span><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="icon_idea.gif"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> </span></p>

              <p>I write with feelings of confusion. I'm not quite close to
              agony, but my situation is enough to jostle a few sleepless nights
              now and then. Seeking advice from people here, what would you do if
              you were in my situation?<br> <br> I tried breaking contact. I deleted his numbers. I changed my
              numbers. But no matter how hard I try, as always I'd end up
              revisiting the same old grounds going through the same old
              feelings. The phone rings while I’m fast asleep, I pick it up in a
              hurry and it turns out to be him. Either that or I do not recognize
              a new number and I wind up picking up the call. The cycle is
              getting tiring. And I have long concluded we’re headed
              nowhere.<br> <br> A few weeks ago, he asked me why I never seem to call him or
              initiate contact even when he’s back home. I reflected asking him
              why should I? I’m searching for a person who can be around for my
              ups and downs. Not some kind of ninja (like a forumer once
              described) who appears and disappears at will. To pacify the
              situation he told me he’d be around when I need him. Even now when
              he makes the effort to make more contact while overseas, I view it
              as his latest attention-seeking ploy.</p>
              <p>Am I too cynical about this person or am I a dimwit, back up,
              spare tyre who keeps falling for the same old tricks?</p>
              <p>Along with most of his other three worded sentences, I’m hardly
              a believer anymore but I'm finding it arduous to keep him out of my
              mind.<br> <br> What I do not understand is why is that no matter how hard I try to
              be rid of this person in my life, he has to keep coming back. Why
              he isn’t getting the hint. Is it because he thinks I’m really this
              stupid?<br> <br> Feel free to be harsh.</p>
