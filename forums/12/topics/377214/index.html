              <p>One can think all that one is incline to. One can project all that one was or is going to be. Reality is what one being now.</p>
              <p>PS: Ts - she gave u a 'centre' - which <span style="text-decoration: underline;">u never</span> had or misinterpreted as <span style="text-decoration: underline;">emanating from within u</span>. Now she is gone u are on the verge of collapse. In this instance it was a gal, add on ..... it is the same conundrum/predicament</p>
              <p>When I say centre  - i mean this lar - eg., your job, your car, your parents, your friends .... add on what comes to your mind. These are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">propping</span> u up and u feel good.This is an ego trip. The <span style="text-decoration: underline;">price </span>- u have unwittingly surrendered your sense of being to others and things outside of u. Try as u might it will work for awhile and u may feel 'good' but the moment all these are gone or sth goes 'wrong' u are going to feel miserable. This is the nakedness of existential truth.</p>
              <p>(If u can) understand, accept and in the very <span style="text-decoration: underline;">knowing</span> an inner transformation would take place within u. Patience is a virtue that is worth embracing!</p>
