Be thankful that u look the way you are and quit whining about it.  Deformed faceÂ… bah!!  Just take a look at accident victims or those born with birth defects.  Horrible body... hogwash.

Imo, i think a change of hairstyle will be good really.... and lose some weight. I have met people who are not good lookin but they dress really well. I dont see any lack of confidence in them. There are girls who will like guys with good dress sense. It's all in the mind. If you think your fugly, you will assume everyone, every strangers will think like you do. Why care bout others. You might have somethin/talent that they dont possess but you do.<br><br>Looks/features wise, you cant change much but you can keep your face clean and maintain good skin. Grooming issues. First of all, lose some weight and a change of hairstyle will do fine. Have more confidence in yourself. Your definitely not the worst. Dont let this kind of thing affect you in life!<br><br>And oh, you might have think im comforting you with words like 'Your definitely not the worst', or 'look at the bright side of life!' or whatever, but im just speakin whats on my mind.
