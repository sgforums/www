But funny because I have huge belief in myself, and that helps me to act like a confident person, and my gf is 172 (taller &amp; older than me), i've got business man coming up to me wanting to work together with me (so i'm not really stupid and useless afterall), and i'm definitely not a virgin (although i wish i am)... but one thing those people may be right is that i'm still quite broke, i also dunno why.</div>

I express my likings and dislikes openly. I tell a friend i love them from the bottom of my heart, and i tell somebody i dont like them from the bottom of my heart too.<br><br>Oh ya, what physical illness i have you might ask? I have this serptal defect, a puncture at the wall of my heart. I had it plugged till i was around 13 before i underwent surgery to patch it up. Due to my liking for football, i kept on exercising till i can run 10 kilometers non stop, and is still jogging and jump jumping regularly.<br><br>Both my feet were what they called "figure 8 feet". My mum told me just a few days after i was born, planks were tied to my legs to try bring them back in place. The condition was much better but still my feet were inverted and pri sch friends called me duck legs. I forced myself to change the way i walk. Now i walk just like any normal people.<br><br>I was plagued with acne in sch sch. That brought my morale down the most. Still i hang out with friends, do stupid things etc etc... I still remembered telling my mum, "Buy a lemon for me every 3 days, i am gonna apply lemon juice on my face till acne goes away." Now its much better, i have some scars, but who cares? I am a guy, not a girl.<br><br>I was fucking fat too once, once weighing 75 KG i think around 160 in height during sec sch. Then i cut down eating at night and together with playing football, i stand 170 and 55kg now.<br><br>The reason why i seriously despise u from the bottom of my heart is, all you do is whine, or i would say, kpkb. I can say EVERYBODY have some problem or things they dont like physically, and they work to change it. Which is totally the opposite of u.<br><br>I forgot if i mentioned this before but, I have a classmate this sem, His name is MAX. He is physically disabled, and needs 2 walking sticks whereever he goes. I dont know the exact problem with him, but his feet seems like jelly.<br>HE never look down on himself, he is very outgoing and friendly.  Not only that, he took part in the Olympics for the Disabled for 3 years straight already, and he just returned from this year's competition 2 months ago. I forgot which event he took part in, but he told me he was just short of qualifying for finals.<br><br>Now you know the difference between those physically disabled, those who have problems physically, those who are unhappy with themselves and you?<br><br>Its they DO something about it.</div>

I express my likings and dislikes openly. I tell a friend i love them from the bottom of my heart, and i tell somebody i dont like them from the bottom of my heart too.<br><br>Oh ya, what physical illness i have you might ask? I have this serptal defect, a puncture at the wall of my heart. I had it plugged till i was around 13 before i underwent surgery to patch it up. Due to my liking for football, i kept on exercising till i can run 10 kilometers non stop, and is still jogging and jump jumping regularly.<br><br>Both my feet were what they called "figure 8 feet". My mum told me just a few days after i was born, planks were tied to my legs to try bring them back in place. The condition was much better but still my feet were inverted and pri sch friends called me duck legs. I forced myself to change the way i walk. Now i walk just like any normal people.<br><br>I was plagued with acne in sch sch. That brought my morale down the most. Still i hang out with friends, do stupid things etc etc... I still remembered telling my mum, "Buy a lemon for me every 3 days, i am gonna apply lemon juice on my face till acne goes away." Now its much better, i have some scars, but who cares? I am a guy, not a girl.<br><br>I was fucking fat too once, once weighing 75 KG i think around 160 in height during sec sch. Then i cut down eating at night and together with playing football, i stand 170 and 55kg now.<br><br>The reason why i seriously despise u from the bottom of my heart is, all you do is whine, or i would say, kpkb. I can say EVERYBODY have some problem or things they dont like physically, and they work to change it. Which is totally the opposite of u.<br><br>I forgot if i mentioned this before but, I have a classmate this sem, His name is MAX. He is physically disabled, and needs 2 walking sticks whereever he goes. I dont know the exact problem with him, but his feet seems like jelly.<br>HE never look down on himself, he is very outgoing and friendly.  Not only that, he took part in the Olympics for the Disabled for 3 years straight already, and he just returned from this year's competition 2 months ago. I forgot which event he took part in, but he told me he was just short of qualifying for finals.<br><br>Now you know the difference between those physically disabled, those who have problems physically, those who are unhappy with themselves and you?<br><br>Its they DO something about it. </div></blockquote>though i feel ur motives are well intended and u have made ur point clear and they are indeed useful. it is always a benefit to put it across in a more caring and compassionate manner if u know how it is to be in pain, than u must also know that it sucks to have someone throw ur problem back at u on the face and yell at u.<br><br>there are many ways to convince ppl to change. try the soft reasonable approach. it works better.<br><br>i am sorry about ur condition. and if i can be of any help pls let me know</div>
