            <div class='col-md body'>everyone will be very nervous during exams, just that some hide their emotions well and some dont...<br><br>now that your exams are over think and reason with yourself...will you do better if you could just relax or u require that self-imposed stress to egg you on and push yourself to the limit. take time to reflect on this.<br><br>once u decide that you are one who needs stress to perform up to your expectations then you should psyche urself up before a major exam that there'll sure be stress that you'll be facing and remind yourself that this stress is the SAME as what i've experienced before in my previous exams then u'll find that exams are not really that scary afterall. In this case, stress is a bitter tonic that u want to take to achieve better results but as you know too much of a good stuff may harm u instead...later kena nose bleed <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>However if you one who's capability is severely hampered by stress then just take things easily cos giving yourself stress will not only not give you the results you want but will cause long term health implications like hypertension. Got good certs no health to enjoy ur success also no use right right?<br>In this case, giving yourself stress is like eating shit in place of your usual tonic...not only do you not get what u want to achieve but it also shows that u're dumb enough not to realise that what you doing to yourself is not helping you at all<br><br>so take this time before exams to gauge what type of person you are and how you react to stress while you still have the time to test out the best possible state of mind to go into exams hall before you have to take your O levels i suppose? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Or 3 hours only... After you've STUDIED and put in so much effort for it.... After that 3 hours or less of input... TREAT YOURSELF to a NICE MEAL or DRINK...
