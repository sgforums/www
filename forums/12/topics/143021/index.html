            <div class='col-md body'>currently am working, in an office based surrounding. But things are Always not going smoothly on my side. Other party (other agencies/offices)forever not willing to co-operate &amp; end up i m the one being blame in the company. To summarise everything, whenever things goes wrong, I am forever being the one to push blame, since i got no high post or pple to back me up.<br>They simply can't understand the rationale that one hand wun clap! How am i suppose to get things done without other party co-operating?<br>Then whenever things screwed up, i would be living in fear, waiting to hear or expect something from big boss. This kind of life is tiring &amp; stressful.<br>Today is a good example. i get blamed for things that i have done but some axxhole accused me that i din do it!!!! I retaliate back to higher level. Then now higher level knows abt it but tilll now i received no news abt the update. have you ever felt this way too?<br>Sometimes really feel so unappreciate in the organisation. But i can't bear to leave my current job, cos of the good pay &amp; benefits..</div>
