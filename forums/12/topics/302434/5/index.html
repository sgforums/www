            <div class='col-md body'>TS dun pressure your hubby too much, if not wait "Nong Qiao Cheng Zuo".  Give him some privacy.<br><br>You must understand that is normal for guys to masterbate one. Not because he is flirt or dun love you already. Sometimes is because he wants to release stress and kill the urge. Of cos you can say there are alot of ways to release stress but masterbating is the most easiest way out. What you need is just some imagination and of cos some strength. And less than a ten mintues everything is done. His stress is released and got his satisfation and dun need to bother you.<br><br>We can understand your concern but what he does is only virtually that every guys does too. Maybe you can try understand your hubby that why he want to masterbate? Why he wanna lie to you in the first place? Of cos when u approach him with all these questions, you have to accept it with an open heart.<br><br>But, b4 you question him, do ask yourself<br>- Everytime when you have s3x with him do you really satisfy his needs?<br>- Do you have s3x regularlly?(At least 2 - 3 times a week)<br>- Maybe we can excuse you for pregeant for not having s3x with him but you can also excuse him for himself to masterbate for this period of time?<br><br>One thing for sure is that he lied to you. That's the truth and no one can deny. Do you know why he want to lie to you? I guess when I say it out, all the guys here will support me.<br><br>- He care and dun want to hurt your feelings.<br>- He's embarssess to tell the truth.<br>- He care about your health, your body and baby.<br>- He can't force you to satisfy him. He also can't commit adultery cos he knows is an offence and he's going to be a father soon. So he uses DIY method.<br><br>For a guy, I think if his wife can't satisfy his hubby needs, is really a very sad thing. Instead if pinpoint him wrong, why not think what started this?<br><br>Good to think about it.<br><br>Thanks for your time.</div>

His stress is released and got his satisfation and dun need to bother you.<br><br>We can understand your concern but what he does is only virtually that every guys does too. Maybe you can try understand your hubby that why he want to masterbate? Why he wanna lie to you in the first place? Of cos when u approach him with all these questions, you have to accept it with an open heart.<br><br>But, b4 you question him, do ask yourself<br>- Everytime when you have s3x with him do you really satisfy his needs?<br>- Do you have s3x regularlly?(At least 2 - 3 times a week)<br>- Maybe we can excuse you for pregeant for not having s3x with him but you can also excuse him for himself to masterbate for this period of time?<br><br>One thing for sure is that he lied to you. That's the truth and no one can deny. Do you know why he want to lie to you? I guess when I say it out, all the guys here will support me.<br><br>- He care and dun want to hurt your feelings.<br>- He's embarssess to tell the truth.<br>- He care about your health, your body and baby.<br>- He can't force you to satisfy him. He also can't commit adultery cos he knows is an offence and he's going to be a father soon. So he uses DIY method.<br><br>For a guy, I think if his wife can't satisfy his hubby needs, is really a very sad thing. Instead if pinpoint him wrong, why not think what started this?<br><br>Good to think about it.<br><br>Thanks for your time.</div></blockquote>hi EvilPorkChop (u dun sound evil at all...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> ),<br>thks very much for yr time to analyse so much too<br>i really appreciate it...<br><br>very glad that there're still many many nice pple here...

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>Once bitten twice shy, this quote sounds very familiar to all of us here.<br><br>Everyone living on earth has similar characters in one way or another, but it does not implies that we are the same.<br><br>You are in fact considered fortunate to be married to a Mr Nice for your second marriage, don't you think so? Since you have chosen to remarry to your present husband, you should not harbored the thoughts of what your ex-husband has had done that resulted in your failed marriage.<br><br>Isn't it unfair for you to compare them? If your present husband doesn't possess certain marriage material that you are looking for, I doubt you will consider marrying him and even willing to bore him a child, am I right?<br><br>Yes, you are pregnant, but remember, do not let this be a threaten to your marriage.<br><br>Think about it, if your husband does not have any needs in his sexuality, isn't it that there's something wrong with him too<br><br>Does it mean that if you are pregnant, your husband cannot be a Man? I am sorry for being crude here, but watching porn is definitely not a fatal offence or crime that he has committed.<br><br>he has been trying to give in, I mean as a couple, you should learn to be understanding and trust each other.<br><br>Being pregnant, you will have the tendency to be temperamental, so does that means that he has to give in to you and kow tow to you?<br><br>Since it is not advisable for you to satisfy him in his sexual needs, then you should try to be nice and allow him masturbate or watch porn.<br><br>He lied because watching porn is not something that a person can flaunt of and he is also being sensitive to you and trying to show some form of respect too. Don't always take it negatively.<br><br>You are going to be a mother soon, live happily, have confidence in your choice of marriage, your husband, your life and be optimistic. Most importantly, you have to trust your husband. If you continued to give yourself this kind of stress, you are also putting him on a spot and pressuring your marriage.<br><br>Last thing, think of why in the first place do you marry him?<br>Why is it that you allow yourself to be tied up with the past that your do not want to remember?<br>Since you are leading a whole new life now, you are already giving yourself a new lease of life in sought of your happiness. do not dwell in the past and bring misery to your life. You should look forward in receiving your newborn, your new motherhood life, be a wonderful , considerate wife and not look backwards. Learn to appreciate and cherish those who loves you, maybe you have longed overlooked that due to your insecurities.</div>
