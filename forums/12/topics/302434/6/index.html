He doesn't want to hurt you, that's why he's keeping it a secret when he needs it. He fears your wrath, but is afraid to tell you his needs because he feels you are going to condemn him anyway.<br><br>Seek his reassurance that he would not be unfaithful. Seek to understand his feelings about porn, and tell him about ur insecurity over him watching porn. Let him know that his actions of using pictures of naked women makes u upset.

Well, only a handful mentioned that you are in an unique situation. There's nothing wrong with you feeling insecure, and there's no need to see a doctor. All women feel insecure now and then, even guys feel insecure sometimes (when they gain weight, lose job, had an injury) so don't let other people deny your rightful feelings. As i said before, this is an issue u need to work with in ur marriage, you are not wrong, but this is something to work with ur hubby.<br><br>The first trimester is the worst, but no guy has ever gone thru labour before, they dont know what it means, and frankly speaking, with the level of stress our people in singapore face here, ur hubby is probably just feeling self-absorbed and needs a little outlet to vent his frustrations, sexual or otherwise.<br><br>Lastly, going 10 months without penetrative sex is a long time for a guy. I know because I've done it, and perhaps you should pay a little attention, when you feel like it, to ur hubby's needs.<br><br>As for someone who mentioned bj, well, bj is fun for the guy, and in some cases, if the gal is in a great mood, she enjoys dishing out fun.

              <p>whoah... i stumble to tis thread and find it rather ineteresting to read...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To TS, how everything wif ur hubby? i rather understand wat r u fear of and why r u so uptight over tis issue.. u fall once and u r afraid to fall again.. is hard to build up the trust like before.. coz u experience before..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>well juz my opinion for guy to watch porn is a common thing.. almost out of 10 i think 8-9 watch it. n masterbate is a way to release stress u know.. n is proven..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>from wat u mention, i can c tat u have a good husband who r really sensitive to ur feeling n ur needs.. treasure n cherish him.. dun let small issue destroy ur and his whole life.. is really silly n stupid to do it.. tell him ur feeling n vice versa ask him how he feel.. communication is the key to build thing.. at least both have a good understandin n prevent any suspicion.... :)</p>
