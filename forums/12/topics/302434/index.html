If not how can you judge based on him watching porn?<br><br>It is normal for men to masturbate as sexual urges are harder to control but easy to release. He may not admit to you because probably you make a fuss about it everytime he does, and men wants nothing but peace and quiet from their women.<br><br>I think what you are experiencing is depression - there is medication for this and please consult your doctor before you end up in a tragedy.</div>

If you are unhappy about the porn. Then manage the sexual r/s between the 2 of you so that he does not need to resort to porn. Won't that help you 2 become closer than to kick up a fuss? Anyways people watch porn sometimes to let off frustration and stream.  Look at it from that point of view. As long as its not pervasive, perverted and addiction, it is ok.<br><br>If he ease his needs with a prostitude or another woman.

            <div class='col-md body'>hey girl, I understand that being pregnant tough and its common for mothers to be to have pre natal depression, but please don't do anything silly.<br><br>firstly, men have urge. your hubby is sensitive to your discomfort and thats why he did not wake you up to do it. Be grateful u are having such a caring husband. Think about this, if he really did wake u up early in the morning for it, wont you be sad as well? blaming him for not caring enough, disturbing your sleep for his own urges?<br><br>then, him being reluctant to tell you the truth is probably because he knew u too well, that when u find out, he is going to have hell. So to avoid trouble, he wanted to hide it. Most guys, if they know that their partner tends to jump to conclusion or kick a fuss out of little things, will choose the easy way out.<br><br>Don't be silly and end a life just because of such little things. Why are u even having this baby in the 1st place if you love and faith for your husband can't withstand such a small ripple in life.<br><br>P.S. Men watching porn is like eating rice nowadays... yes even sec school boys watch it. your husband is a man. cut him some slack.<br><br>Also, if you keep your attitude, temper etc up, your husband may break down one day and may leave you for good even before you can jump off a building together with your baby. Please wake up. Being together takes patience, tolerace and forgiveness. You are living in a real world where people have their needs and life to live.</div>
