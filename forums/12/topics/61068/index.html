Such scenario often happens right after the initial honeymoon stage, or at least when the relationship has begin to feel a little too 'comfortable'. Partners, of course, have different view point and preception in leading and maintaining a 'healthy' relationship. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>In the end, they will try to work out a common solution and acceptance gradually take place. If quarrel take places and affects the relationship - unwilling to compromise, acceptance and work out is the cause of it. Such things are nothing in face of these qualities. Learn to acknoledge the existence of problem and tackle it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't think there is a standard we all shd follow. I think how many time a couple meet totally depends on the circumstances.

            <div class='col-md body'>though there's no rule for you to follow how many times you should meet, but I think there should be period of how long you guys don't meet. (assuming that both of you are living in the same country). If not there's going to be trouble if you guys are not sparing to meet even once a month... BIG TROUBLE...</div>
