            <div class='col-md body'>Pumpy, you need professional help. Go to see a specialist. Guess it is easier for you to seek help since you know wat you are doing are not right and you want to change. Listen to NeonTetra and BaByBoY's advices. You really need to find someone you can trust to talk to. Someone who is sensible and able to give you sensible advice or see a specialist. Dun let this drag any more cos it's affecting your studies. Dun go and do "those things" anymore. I believe you should be able to get over this.  and we are here if you should need listening ears. You can do it!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
