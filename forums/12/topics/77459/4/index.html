On the serious side, please seek professional psychiatric assistence, because its a psychiatric addiction, it is not as easy to give up on, so other than relying on so called trustable friend, who may or may not be even giving the right advises. It is often more advisable to involve professional assistence.  Don't confuse smoking with other addictions, they may be similar but they may need different approaches in resolving the addiction, its unwise to throw a generic solution to everybody.<br><br>No, going for psychiatric counseling doesn't mean you are insane, if you go by that definition, we are all insane in one way or another. Freud or some Freud-school psychiatrist said that, we are all mentally imperfect in some way, its natural.<br><br>Start with general consoling hotlines, from there either inform your parents and visit a psychiatrist for counseling, if your parents will freak out and send you to the exorcist.. that kinda type of people, which unfortunately does exists, might make matters worse, thats why the hotlines are for, after that you can tell them about your "problem". Ask for more information on psychiatric counseling, they will gladly assist you in hearing you have the determination to solve your addiction.<br><br>So the bottom line is, go see a psychiatrist, its not that bad, they know what and how to advise you on even the most sensitive matters. As long they are no quacks, they will not confuse and leave you with riddles.</div></blockquote>Hmm... Not bad?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
