              <p>Then in that case.... it's time you learn to come up with courage from <em>within yourself</em>. Your friends may not always be there to give you the courage that you need.</p>
              <p>And believe me, a team that works together for the sake of getting the job done is not the best team there is. It's all clinical, business-like... if you just allow the pure existence of the project be the only thing that binds the team together, then all you get is a broken egg held together with super glue. One knock, and it cracks.</p>

              <p><br>Good for you. With your decision to join the camp, I see that you have a healthy mindset towards interpersonal relationships.</p>
              <p>Remember that you can't always make every love you. But then again, as you said, it works both ways: you don't have to love those people who hate you.</p>
              <p>Undergraduate life will be interesting, and it will indeed have its ups and downs. Going it alone won't be easy, and having friends and seniors around will help you make it through, especially in the early semesters when you're still new to the system.</p>

              <p>I joined SCAMP... its a science fac camp on 23rd to 27th
              june</p>
              <p>After reading all your comments I realised that I really need
              friends in uni to help me go through the ups and downs. One of the
              reasons Im afraid of going is that people may dislike me one way or
              another... but it dawned upon me that I wont be friends with such
              people anyway. Real friends will tolerate and compromise with each
              other... whats important is to find friends that are mine and
              ignore unwanted comments.</p>
              <p>Thanks :)</p>
