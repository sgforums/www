We worked in the same company.She asked me once whether I had a girlfren but foolishly I said "Yes" because then I was not sure how  I feel about her. After that, we became close frens till one day she left for further studies. She even asked for my opinion on her decision. I told her that her studies should come first. The hardest decision was letting her go. I did not tell her how i feel then because i did not want to disturb her studies.<br><br>Last week, my colleague told me that she is going to finnish her course soon. Got her e-mail address from her fren. Now i don't know what to do.......should I  forget about her?...Am I too late?...I still have strong feelings for her.<br><br>After 2 years will a girl give guys like me a second chance...should I court her????????</div></blockquote>Ur brain working on slew?<br><br>Go for her laaaa</div>
