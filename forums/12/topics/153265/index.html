You're feeling the way I feel...??  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Now... SERIOUSLY... You shouldn't really worry too much about how people might brand you...

What are you doing ALONE...??" I mean... SERIOUSLY...

HEY!! I think you really should LEARN to ENJOY YOURSELF even when you're ALONE...?? I can ALMOST ASSURE you, that would be ULTIMATELY one of the MOST PRECIOUS GIFT you can RECEIVE IN LIFE!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> "<br><br>PS.

            <div class='col-md body'>whats schezophrenic?<br><br>Try to plan before hand what you gotta do on saturday to prevent yourself from feeling very alone. Be the one to organise an outing with friends! e.g. cycling at pulau ubin! Have to learn to be more independent in making yourself happy everyday, we are responsible for our own happiness. You gotta make your own day, not others! As friend gets older, alot will get attached le, I didnt expect my friends would be single all the time. you have to learn to live with it. Theres alot more to do with life than feeling lonely.<br><br>The way you feel is so normal. You not alone in feeling this way. I experience this kinda feeling myself too. especially when my bf just broke off wit me, when I am alone at home alot, I will think alot, I tend to forget to make myself happy, I am so engrossed in my own sadness that I cant help feeling drown in it and have depressions. Even people around me gets affected. I even wished that I never had bf before man.<br><br>Before that when I never had bf before, my life is so happy even when I was alone at home, I can happily read a book whole day, play computer games, watch vcds, drawing, playing my harmonica~ Find a hobby! this month I stay at home every saturday because I am so broke man, even my friends also miss me le  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  but no choice. Then I plan on what to do this weekend, which is reading my favourite book! so I doesnt feel sad on a satuday at home le. Make yourself think happy first.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The first few months after breakup is indeed miserable when weekend is approaching and there is no plans and no calls from friends. You just need time to re-adjust yourself and just try not to think too much as in who to go out with. Think abt what to do on Saturday and Sunday. Be it going out with friends or doing something else alone, make sure that ever weekend will not be put to waste.<br><br></div>
