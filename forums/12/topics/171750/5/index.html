Even though I'm saying i'm focusing on other area of life, but when I'm back to my rest time and de-focus it all comes back. Not easy to move on. Alot of times will need another focus in the same relationship area or self-numbing and time to lessen the pricks on the heart.<br><br>But, don't take things too hard. She will not know how hurt you will feel missing her at a particular time. The situation will still remain as it is no matter how we feel inside.<br><br>Hmm... lolx seems I'm advising myself also  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

( dont really know if this topic was created before, i apologise if i did a repeat thread)<br><br>Just a general statement, is waiting a fool's game (for love).<br><br>I know that in my case, I always have been waiting for the girl to accept me. Despite waiting for ages (sec1 - sec 2 End of year ) , all i Got was a negative reply. I put in the effort and time to woo the girl, but still , i guess i dont make the cut. Although the girl said NO to me once before, i continued to woo her still , thinking i can melt her heart.<br><br>But, then i asked again after another year, but this time i just realised that she has a boyfriend, so i discontinued my "waiting game". It was devastating, i was totally crushed and felt so lost. I wandered aimlessly in msn, games and all around thinking that this shouldnt be happening.<br><br>But i got back on my feet and widened my social circle (I only have a few close friends with me back then), I got to know this girl through IRC (same school) and she is supposedly to be the smart,nice,sweet, girl next door.<br><br>Half a year later (sec 3 mid year) , I found that we have common interests and stuffs so I decided to try my luck and began the "wooing process". I admit, i pestered her aimlessly on msn and smses. I told her I would wait for her, which took another half a year , and still we kept in contact and I still waited and waited and waited. But in the end, she gave me a reason to why cannot accept me, all due to studies. I was crushed yet once more, how many times God wanna test me? I asked myself whether is it because of my looks and character?<br><br>Then now, I'm in a poly, which i wont disclose, I just recently found interest in another girl (same class) , though she hinted to me many times that I do not stand a chance, I'm still determined to woo her. tell me, is history going to repeat itself and me... am I a fool, for this waiting game?</div></blockquote>Forget abt it.

            <div class='col-md body'>Let me do the explaining for Boo777. I think I understand what he is trying to say.<br><br>Guys who have spent some time thinking about their aspirations and ambitions in life will know what I am talking about.<br><br>Life is too short to be hung up about your lovelife. I myself have only completed 40% of what I want to acheive in life.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mindset: Â“Let them come to you, they can choose why not youÂ” </span></strong><br><br>The part in red is a <strong>mentality.</strong><br><br>To be successful in anything you do, you need to have the correct mindset.<br><br>Too many guys out there focus on meeting womenÂ’s expectations. They forgot about their own expectation and passion in life.<br><br><strong>Getting a woman is not success. Getting a woman who is willing to accommodate your expectations and passion in life is the real success.</strong><br><br>To achieve that,<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Focus on improving yourself first and foremost as it makes you a catch.<br><br>Be willing to walk away if she cannot give you what you want.<br><br>Boo777 is talking about a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">weeding out process. </span><br><br>Once you have gotten your act together, donÂ’t settle.<br><br>Weed out those who are not willing to accommodate, keep those who can meet your expectations.</span></strong><br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Practice</span></strong><br><br>I donÂ’t think I need to elaborate on this one. Confidence and charisma comes from practice.<br><br>You can keep improving yourself but still don't know what to say when a woman approaches you unless you get some real experience.<br><br>But I have something I want to add though.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Practice with the correct mindset.</span></strong><br><br>I have a friend who started torturing himself with a Â”3 secondsÂ” rule some time ago.<br><br>When he sees someone he likes in the street, he gives himself 3 seconds to decide whether he wants to approach.<br><br>I saw how the other guys were laughing at him when he was shot down and I asked him why he wanted to torture himself like that.<br><br><strong><span style="color: blue;"><br>His reply:<br><br>Â“I should be the one laughing at them. IÂ’ve spent only 3 seconds of my life making a decision, if her interest is low, I drop the idea and move on.Â”<br><br>Â“They on the other hand will spend the whole day discussing every aspect of that girl but will not know whether she is interested!<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Â“They are wasting their time!Â”</span></span></strong><br><br><strong> His focus is on himself.<br><br>He is concerned about other aspects of his life that requires his attention.<br><br>Therefore, he uses the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">weeding out process. </span><br><br>Weed out those who has low interest in him instead of spending so much effort trying to raise their interest.</strong><br><br>He understands right from the start, what he wants to achieve:<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Getting a woman who is willing to accommodate your expectations and passion in life is the real success.</span></strong><br><br>A woman who has high interest in you will naturally try to do that.<br><br>And you donÂ’t have to waste time trying to raise her interest.<br><br>Your focus will always be on your dreams and passion in life.<br><br></div>
