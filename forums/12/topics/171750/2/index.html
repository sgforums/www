Despite waiting for ages (sec1 - sec 2 End of year ) , all i Got was a negative reply. I put in the effort and time to woo the girl, but still , i guess i dont make the cut. Although the girl said NO to me once before, i continued to woo her still , thinking i can melt her heart.<br><br>But, then i asked again after another year, but this time i just realised that she has a boyfriend, so i discontinued my "waiting game".

I admit, i pestered her aimlessly on msn and smses. I told her I would wait for her, which took another half a year , and still we kept in contact and I still waited and waited and waited. But in the end, she gave me a reason to why cannot accept me, all due to studies. I was crushed yet once more, how many times God wanna test me?
