Despite waiting for ages (sec1 - sec 2 End of year ) , all i Got was a negative reply. I put in the effort and time to woo the girl, but still , i guess i dont make the cut. Although the girl said NO to me once before, i continued to woo her still , thinking i can melt her heart.<br><br>But, then i asked again after another year, but this time i just realised that she has a boyfriend, so i discontinued my "waiting game". It was devastating, i was totally crushed and felt so lost. I wandered aimlessly in msn, games and all around thinking that this shouldnt be happening.<br><br>But i got back on my feet and widened my social circle (I only have a few close friends with me back then), I got to know this girl through IRC (same school) and she is supposedly to be the smart,nice,sweet, girl next door.<br><br>Half a year later (sec 3 mid year) , I found that we have common interests and stuffs so I decided to try my luck and began the "wooing process". I admit, i pestered her aimlessly on msn and smses. I told her I would wait for her, which took another half a year , and still we kept in contact and I still waited and waited and waited. But in the end, she gave me a reason to why cannot accept me, all due to studies. I was crushed yet once more, how many times God wanna test me? I asked myself whether is it because of my looks and character?<br><br>Then now, I'm in a poly, which i wont disclose, I just recently found interest in another girl (same class) , though she hinted to me many times that I do not stand a chance, I'm still determined to woo her. tell me, is history going to repeat itself and me... am I a fool, for this waiting game?</div>

Not that many interesting girls i have met can capture my heart so much. Yet, that is why i chose to wait... and in the end... the result i get is so.... Negative.</div>

Thats a atypical human reaction I think, so thus, We can only blame ourselves haha.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by alexkusu:</div><div class="quote_body">Hmm...can be considered 'waitin' if you dated a few gals while waiting for the primary gal to come to her senses right? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </div></blockquote>LOL Alexkusu, you just made me laugh , Thanks so much. But that wont seem to be flirting right? I mean just plain flirt without ill intentions is ok, but I doubt I have the qualities to flirt. Oh primary target? I bet that will take another # years where # is yet to be determined =p</div>

I tried already, but she didnt exactly say no, or say yes. just a little in between, so now im trying hard. But i abstained from clicking her MSN contact or smsing for fear of no replies or "sweet,short" replies. The trying part is the tough one, I will persevere! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
