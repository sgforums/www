( dont really know if this topic was created before, i apologise if i did a repeat thread)<br><br>Just a general statement, is waiting a fool's game (for love).<br><br>I know that in my case, I always have been waiting for the girl to accept me. Despite waiting for ages (sec1 - sec 2 End of year ) , all i Got was a negative reply. I put in the effort and time to woo the girl, but still , i guess i dont make the cut. Although the girl said NO to me once before, i continued to woo her still , thinking i can melt her heart.<br><br>But, then i asked again after another year, but this time i just realised that she has a boyfriend, so i discontinued my "waiting game". It was devastating, i was totally crushed and felt so lost. I wandered aimlessly in msn, games and all around thinking that this shouldnt be happening.<br><br>But i got back on my feet and widened my social circle (I only have a few close friends with me back then), I got to know this girl through IRC (same school) and she is supposedly to be the smart,nice,sweet, girl next door.<br><br>Half a year later (sec 3 mid year) , I found that we have common interests and stuffs so I decided to try my luck and began the "wooing process". I admit, i pestered her aimlessly on msn and smses. I told her I would wait for her, which took another half a year , and still we kept in contact and I still waited and waited and waited. But in the end, she gave me a reason to why cannot accept me, all due to studies. I was crushed yet once more, how many times God wanna test me? I asked myself whether is it because of my looks and character?<br><br>Then now, I'm in a poly, which i wont disclose, I just recently found interest in another girl (same class) , though she hinted to me many times that I do not stand a chance, I'm still determined to woo her. tell me, is <strong>history going to repeat itself and me</strong>... am I a fool, for this waiting game?</blockquote>Br strong,buddy! I failed twice with great disaster! But I believe the twice failure make me smarter and allow me to review why I fail and move on..I told myself I will not fail for the third time!
