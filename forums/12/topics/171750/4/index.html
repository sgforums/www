            <div class='col-md body'>Hypercurry,<br><br>Before you seek out other girls whilst waiting for her, consider how you would feel if you were sought out whilst the girl was waiting for another guy?  It's Not only unfair, it's downright insulting.<br><br>Perhaps to make it more fair to the girls, you may wish to tell them that you have someone in your heart already.  Let them go into a relationship with you with their eyes open.  At least, Nobody can blame you for keeping them in the dark.<br><br>FeowFeow<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by hypercurry:</div><div class="quote_body">-raises a weary hand-<br><br>sigh... i dunno la.

( dont really know if this topic was created before, i apologise if i did a repeat thread)<br><br>Just a general statement, is waiting a fool's game (for love).<br><br>I know that in my case, I always have been waiting for the girl to accept me. Despite waiting for ages (sec1 - sec 2 End of year ) , all i Got was a negative reply. I put in the effort and time to woo the girl, but still , i guess i dont make the cut. Although the girl said NO to me once before, i continued to woo her still , thinking i can melt her heart.<br><br>But, then i asked again after another year, but this time i just realised that she has a boyfriend, so i discontinued my "waiting game". It was devastating, i was totally crushed and felt so lost. I wandered aimlessly in msn, games and all around thinking that this shouldnt be happening.<br><br>But i got back on my feet and widened my social circle (I only have a few close friends with me back then), I got to know this girl through IRC (same school) and she is supposedly to be the smart,nice,sweet, girl next door.<br><br>Half a year later (sec 3 mid year) , I found that we have common interests and stuffs so I decided to try my luck and began the "wooing process". I admit, i pestered her aimlessly on msn and smses. I told her I would wait for her, which took another half a year , and still we kept in contact and I still waited and waited and waited. But in the end, she gave me a reason to why cannot accept me, all due to studies. I was crushed yet once more, how many times God wanna test me? I asked myself whether is it because of my looks and character?<br><br>Then now, I'm in a poly, which i wont disclose, I just recently found interest in another girl (same class) , though she hinted to me many times that I do not stand a chance, I'm still determined to woo her. tell me, is history going to repeat itself and me... am I a fool, for this waiting game?</div></blockquote>You've got strong willpower. After my 1st rejection in sec 2 i never woo-ed a girl until poly. Call it a very traumatic experience. Sure it may seem like God's testing you but at the rate you're going theres bound to be a suitable partner for you. All the best to you.</div>
