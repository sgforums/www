              <p>Hi guys,</p>
              <p>I write here because i can think of no other place that i can
                                      seek advice, and would gladly appreciate any.</p>
              <p>I am 27 years old, male, and graduated last year from an
                                      Australian university after spending 2 years plus there. Have been
                                      working in a bank as a relationship manager (aka salesman) ever
                                      since.</p>
              <p>After I graduated, i found that jobs were limited (i graduated
                                      in finance) and people didn't take my degree seriously. I was
                                      offered jobs pertaining to insurance and sales, which is why i am
                                      at my current job (I think i sent out over 100 resumes). Don't get
                                      me wrong. I like my job, i consider myself more of a right brained
                                      person that possesses (hopefully) good EQ.</p>
              <p>The thing is, I'm not happy with my life. I think i deserve
                                      better. I'm working 12-13 hours a day, not earning enough, and the
                                      future looks bleak. Living in a HDB flat while slogging away for
                                      the next 30 years trying to pay off the housing loan, while
                                      servicing car instalments and yet desperately saving for my
                                      children's education doesn't really appeal to me. Just like any
                                      other man, I look forward to providing my future wife with a
                                      comfortable lifestyle, and to be able to send my kids overseas to
                                      study.</p>
              <p>I am thinking of moving back to Australia, to Sydney, maybe back
                                      to Brisbane (where i studied). I think Australia might be able to
                                      offer me what I want. My only concern is not being able to find a
                                      job when i get there. i dont mind working in Coles/Woolworths till
                                      i get a job.</p>
              <p>What do you guys think? I think i am gutless for not being brave
                                      enough to seek a better future for myself, and at the same time, i
                                      can't bear to leave everything behind. my family, friends ... etc
                                      etc ... (FOOD..).. etc.</p>

              <p>thanks for the support :)</p>
              <p>i am hoping to relocate to one of the major australian cities, preferbly sydney or brisbane..</p>
              <p>my girlfriend is very supportive of my idea, and she relishes the idea of going overseas to work. the thing is, i'm concerned that she might not be able to adapt to life there, shops not open after 5, culture, the prospect with working with foreigners .. etc etc.</p>
              <p>i've thought about what i want. australia offers a good work life balance (or so im led to believe so since i've a couple of friends in oz working), freehold housing (albeit at super high interest rates), and cheaper cars. also, if i do eventually get PR, at least in future my childrens' education is secure.</p>
              <p>hopefully i might be able to find a job there as an analyst in future, or something .. this part i haven't really figured out... we won't know what life would eventually throw at you.</p>

              <p>Hi guys,</p>
              <p>I write here because i can think of no other place that i can seek advice, and would gladly appreciate any.</p>
              <p>I am 27 years old, male, and graduated last year from an Australian university after spending 2 years plus there. Have been working in a bank as a relationship manager (aka salesman) ever since.</p>
              <p>After I graduated, i found that jobs were limited (i graduated in finance) and people didn't take my degree seriously. I was offered jobs pertaining to insurance and sales, which is why i am at my current job (I think i sent out over 100 resumes). Don't get me wrong. I like my job, i consider myself more of a right brained person that possesses (hopefully) good EQ.</p>
              <p>The thing is, I'm not happy with my life. I think i deserve better. I'm working 12-13 hours a day, not earning enough, and the future looks bleak. Living in a HDB flat while slogging away for the next 30 years trying to pay off the housing loan, while servicing car instalments and yet desperately saving for my children's education doesn't really appeal to me. Just like any other man, I look forward to providing my future wife with a comfortable lifestyle, and to be able to send my kids overseas to study.</p>
              <p>I am thinking of moving back to Australia, to Sydney, maybe back to Brisbane (where i studied). I think Australia might be able to offer me what I want. My only concern is not being able to find a job when i get there. i dont mind working in Coles/Woolworths till i get a job.</p>
              <p>What do you guys think? I think i am gutless for not being brave enough to seek a better future for myself, and at the same time, i can't bear to leave everything behind. my family, friends ... etc etc ... (FOOD..).. etc.</p>
              <p>I would be glad to hear any thoughts ... thanks.</p>

              <p><br>IF you have nothing to lose, then you should be feeling excited at the uncertaincies that life is going to throw at you. Whatever happens in the future will ensure that your life will never going to be the same as your peers in Singapore. Your life will be changed ultimately based on what you have decided to steer it.</p>
              <p>But if you got something important here that you are not willing to lose it, then you might need to reconsider your decision. And if you really don't wish to go to Australia, you wouldn't even bothered to post this topic. I'm sure you wanted to go to Australia, but you probably want support from the people in here.</p>
              <p>Take a chance with your lives if you can afford to do so, else soon you might be too old to take any chance with your lives...if there's still any chances left for you to take them.</p>
              <p>At the most, you are always welcome to return home to Singapore and work in Carrefour/Giant/NTUCFairPrice/ShengSiong.</p>
              <p>And you no need to go back and do your NS every year. Greatest happiness for all Singaporean guys I believe. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well if you want to move, you had better do it soon. Cos when you hit 30, you lose another 5 points. While you are deciding, check your eligibility for PR. If you are looking for something different in life and Singapore is not offering it, go for it. You're still young and can go anywhere you want. If you decide you don't like it a few years down the road, you can always come back. But when you are old and want to move somewhere else, it is not easy anymore.</div>

              <p>Thank you all for your posts and concern.</p>
              <p>parn &gt; your post made me consider whether i posted this to get affirmation from fellow forumers, and yes, although when i click on this post i hope to see positive comments, no i don't think im looking for people just posting to encourage me to migrate. i hope to be able to see views that i've never thought of before, angles i never appreciated, and how that might affect me.</p>
              <p>starry99 &gt; i appreciate it. its great advice. i've checked, i qualify for a working visa, (marginally!)</p>
              <p>alfagal &gt; yes i agree its very competitive out there. everyone wants to make it big, but only a select few can. as much as i would like to blame market sentiment for my current predicament, i wont. i believe (maybe naively) that my future is in my own hands and i have the power to control my destiny. thing is, where does it lie? in oz or here ... haha .. nobody would know that ..</p>
              <p>sinicker &gt; actually, no, i didnt know that. at least, i didn't know it would be THIS bad. I'm very proud of the university i graduated from and i can't say for sure that every university graduate could say that.</p>

              <p>It doesn't make a whole lot of sense jumping ship when you don't have another ship to get to.  If you feel that your prospects are better elsewhere, well and good, but just getting up and going when you don't have any firm prospects is effectively placing a stake on cards that you don't hold in your hand.</p>
              <p>In your position, I'd first apply for skilled migration, and applying for jobs after getting approval.  That way, when you do move you know what you're moving towards.  Coming here and being a shelf stacker while you wait for your ship to come in is a particularly risky proposition, especially in the current economic climate.</p>
              <p>By the way, how long ago did you graduate?  Your degree's good for an extra 5 points for six months after graduation, but after that you'll need to back up your qualifications with work experience for those extra points.</p>

              <p>Gendaken &gt;&gt; i graduated 2 years ago. i've thought what you said, but if u look at it from an employer's perspective there is no incentive for them to hire someone overseas (it's not like i have any special skills or talents) as opposed to them hiring someone within Australia. i'm quite sure im not the only one who has this mentality.

              <p>Tricky life decision making... As a friend i can advise u...  The smart thing to do is work there, earn the money and come back to s'pore to buy a home.I have stayed in aus for 4 years. Since i went there alone, i had to cope with depression and loneliness.</p>
              <p>Unlike me, u have the support of your gf/wife. So i say u give aus a try. if u dont like it, u can return, but i would say u will have work expereince that local grads lack. A quote for u to consider</p>

              <p>Is hard to mingle along with the whites..as in to get them to accept u into their social circle..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i've friends who ever worked in Aust. before &amp; opt to come back..like what they said "there's no place like home"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>indeed it is hard to find a job that can give u both the job satisfaction + satisfied remuneration package in s'pore right now..BUT still..u can still try for it..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Unless there's really such a good job offer based in Aust, u might consider going over there as an expat, invest a few yrs of your time over there..perhaps 4-5yrs? earn enough $$, accumulate enough working experience &amp; back to SG..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>By then, with your Deg. on hand + working experience..there <span style="text-decoration: underline;">MIGHT</span> be lesser hurdles to getting a nice job in SG..</p>
