Honestly I do believe that if you find the right partner, he or she will actually help to motivate you, instead of holding you back.<br><br>There is always a saying that behind every successful man there is always a capable women.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Carpe Diem Jur,<br><br>I beg to differ.  Before you get upset, let me say, please don't be.  It's a matter of choice.  You chose to put career before love, because your priorities are Not the same as mine.  Perhaps you feel that things will always be there, whereas there's a risk that love will fade or your heart will be shattered, the way a Baccarat crystal shatters when dropped?<br><br>My priorities in life are different, I guess.  I won't deny that career is very important to me, &amp; that I work hard in return for a stable job, &amp; enough income to afford things.  However, the income goes towards  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> treats for my family.  My friends always tell me that I should "invest" in decent designer bags, shoes, clothes, car, etc.  I chose Not to.  I DO have designer bags, but I don't buy compulsively.  Instead, the things I choose to spend my $ on, bring intangible rewards.  The smile on Dad's face when I wanna buy him the best kinda dinner I can afford, the smile on my guy's face when I surprise him flowers (yes, flowers) &amp; a bottle of wine for both of us to share.<br><br>Love, laughter, &amp; making those people I love deeply smile bring me indescribable joy, the kind that designer things can't bring.  Sure, I'll feel good buying all these things, but the intangible rewards I get from splurging on loved ones instead make my life fulfilled.<br><br>My guy means everything to me, &amp; I to him.  This knowledge makes it easy to focus on my career, because I know there's someone to talk about my day with (of course, I DO share with my family, but it's still different), whom I can relax with, etc.<br><br>As I said, you made your choice, &amp; perhaps you're happy the way you are.  I respect that.  However, to me, career whilst important, can't take the place of the intangible rewards I get with love.

(A rich guy probably have no qualms about spending big money to buy expensive gifts, treats and such - but is every girl looking for such extravagant enjoyment? Taurus, Capricorn and Virgo probably yes. And having a scenario to say sorry probably equal to a Tiffany ring, flowers and everything.
