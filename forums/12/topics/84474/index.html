There is probably two options for me if I were you. First option, never lend him any money...because people like him deserved a fate like that. Second option, if you have to lend him money...never lend him the full amount that he request. Say if he ask for $100 from you, you have $100 to lend him...lend him $10. Why? He probably will never be able to return you back your money, so you be better off lending him an amount that you will not feel pain if he decided to run off with your loan...which in this case is $10.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> And also...by lending him a little bit of money, you are doing him a favour and he cannot blame you for not helping him. If he say you don't help him enough, think you should give him a piece of your mind and you keep the $10 for your next Premier membership.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>That's all...don't get cheated hor.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Same goes for his wife.<br><br>When frens are in need, we should always try our best to help. Juz lending him e money however isn't e way cuz from a long term perspective, it will not solve his problem. He must 1st help himself by putting in effort to manage his finances, be prudent. Cuz if he continues e way he is, then he does not deserve help or sympathy from anyone.<br><br>It's ok to lend ur money to someone for a good cause even though u noe that there's little chance of getting it back. But lending it even to a fren, knowing that he may jolly well splurge ur hard earned money on a new hp that he doesn't reali need... I dun think u wanna be a s u c k e r.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If he really want to solve his financial problems, he must relook at his way of spending money. A lot of people get into debts because of wanting to keep up with jones. That is also the reason why some people never seems to have enough money even though they are drawing a high income.<br><br>To answer your question, say No to his request. Very simply, he is digging a hole to cover another hole. By lending him money, you are not helping him, but helping him dig his own grave. Not going to solve the problem and ultimately may end up in bigger problems. I suggest you ask your friend to really do some self reflection and seek professional financial advice on planning for the future of his family.<br><br>I have first hand experience in lending money to a "friend", and never gotten the money back after a year. I asked every month, and every month there is a new excuse and it is getting tiring. So, I really advise you NOT to lend him money to save yourself from frustration.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Let me tell you my real experience on this matter of lending money to a friend.<br><br>If your friend needs the loan for the family due to some unforseen circumstances, perhaps you can consider as doing some good deeds and I trust your friend would treasure you and repay you when he has the means to in the future.<br><br>Other than what I had explained above, I strongly advise against it. It may seem to be heartless on you even if you had known him for years. However, such type of person/s will only take advantage of their friends and biggy back on them on the slightlest opportunity. Once you do it, they come hovering over you again and again. Eventually, you will find yourself being their ATM. They never learn, and value the friendship entrusted to them but rather thake advantage of that.<br><br>Learn to say NO for the first time and stand firm on it. But do prepare to lose him / her. If that becomes the situation, then you will know what friend you had for the past years.<br><br>I had been through this and learn the magic word "NO". The money loan out will never return.[/quote]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Don't sympathise with this type of people. Once u lend him, he will keep coming for more. Let him learn to handle his own problems. But if u still want to help, buy him food for his family.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Honeybunz:</div><div class="quote_body">This friend of mine....<br>very nice to me and the rest of the friends.  Nice as in, he will always buy us drinks.  Yes, he is a spendthrift.  He can just walk past a shop and suddenly decide to spend a few hundred dollars on a new handphone when his existing one is still working fine.<br><br>Two years ago, one night he suddenly asked me to lend him money.  But sway sway, that month, I was very tight with money cuz I gave a portion to my parents and one portion went to pay for a course that I signed up for.  Moreover he called me almost at the end of the salary month and needed money almost immediately.  Even if I were to help him, I need to go bank to within cash on my credit card during the office hour (which has to be the next day or so).  He die die don't want to wait, so I told him I could not help him.<br><br>This year, he's in financial trouble again.  But he didn't approach me.  He asked from another friend of mine.  Somehow I am very worried for his child.  Yes, he has a child, who should be either in K2 or Pri 1 now.<br><br>My friend was very reluctant to lend him, but still lend him a few hundred dollars.  But within two weeks, he asked her again.  She was very annoyed.  Moreover, this guy who is supposed to be in financial difficulties now, still took taxi to her place to ask for money.<br><br>Should I lend him money, if he asks me?</div></blockquote>Hmm... Wonder if you've already made your decision already?<br><br>On SURFACE advising, I would ADVISE AGAINST IT... Time is BAD nowadays... People are going around asking for money... In MOST CASES I've seen, usually not returned in full, not returned in time if not 'not returned at all'.... And from the way you've described him...? Err... A bit difficult yeah?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Besides... How does he intend to pay you back? With what? How long? By lending him the money, can you really 'save' him? Does he really needs to be 'saved'..? If he's really just 'covering a hole' as per mentioned in one of the other post, it'll be almost a useless act...?<br><br>But IN CASE you really wanna lend him (or someone else) at time like this... It's ALWAYS ADVISABLE to set a CREDIT LIMIT. Be FIRM. Set an amount. Nothing beyond that. Let it be an amount which you can still be bear to be RIPPED OFF...</div>
