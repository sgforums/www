On the basis of that, it's perhaps about right the two of them went their seperate ways, isn't it? At the very least, they're incompatible.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I felt the guy could have done better planning and better communication. I felt that he could have been more sensitive in some situations, but I think he purposely was nonchalant just to get back at the girl for hurling abuses at him. The oversleeping part could have been avoided, but it was a minor issue.<br><br>I felt the girl was being really anal and acting like a princess. I understand that she was frustrated with waiting alone at Orchard, but there're plenty of things she could have done while waiting for the boyfriend. Go Borders, read a book, go grab a bite, or do window shopping. I felt the girl was not matured or independant.<br><br>another thing, both are in the relationship for 2 years, its more than enough time to find compromises and know each other's bad points<br><br>So what do you guys think?<br><br>also, i wonder what was that hobby? otaku?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i see myself in you. i can understand how you feel. i can imagine your frustration when you're out at orchard alone and instead of easing your frustration, your boyfriend isn't doing anything to help you.<br><br>i don't think the relationship is working out anymore. both of you have broken up a few times already and it shows that the r/s probably isn't so important to both of you anymore.<br><br>during the last few times of breaking up and patching, have you both thought about what was the problem? understanding or trust or what?<br><br>think about it this time round and let your thoughts of it be known to him and see what he says. if it's time to let go, let go. there's no point clinching onto a relationship that is painful and torturous. it's not happy at all.<br><br>and reflect about your temper and behaviour.</div>
