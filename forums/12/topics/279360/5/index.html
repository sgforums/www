            <div class='col-md body'>A side comment about gaming...<br><br>I'm worried that a whole new generation of guys/girls grow up, playing too much computer games... Already many schoolgoing teenagers are playing too much, and ignoring traditional recreational activities like sports, reading, board games..<br><br>Computer games are unlikely to go away, because there are even university level modules about them and it's a big source of revenue.<br><br>One reason why too many teenagers and even adults play them, is because they can escape into a fantasy world they have control over. This, I fear, would diminish their survival and social skills in the real world. It also creates a feeling of apathy to the real world.<br><br>I have been a gamer years ago. It wasn't so popular then, I just played to kill time in my idle NS years, and sometimes the real world seemed so surreal after when you emerged briefly from the game.<br></div>
