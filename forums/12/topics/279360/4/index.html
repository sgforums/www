I am just saying that, ultimately being with someone else in a relationship needs to be a choice, not a need. Compromises still need to be made but it has to be made in an environment of mutual respect and trust.<br><br>he may not need to be with you all the time to be happy, but that does not mean he did not CHOOSE to love you. but if choosing to love you means he needs to fulfil a set of criteria in which to show his love for you - then you have to decide how much you need these criterias to be fulfilled in order to choose to love him HAPPILY in return.<br><br></div>

It has been more than a week since we broke up, but I am still seeking ways to salvage this relationship. I think of him everyday, I wont say that he doesnt think of me because I dont know so I wont assume.<br><br>Yeah, I am a spoilt brat. An attention seeking one. Thanks. I knew it long ago since very young Maybe thats why he liked me in the first place. But only if he knew how to balance his stuffs. He shows more love towards his hobby than towards me. Its just too tiring.<br><br>Moreover, I believe I have put in 101% of my effort in this relationship. I dont know about him. I just feel I gave too much. You know the feeling of someone whom you keep caring for just give you cold shoulder just because he's more engrossed in engaging something he 'enjoys' and probably 'loves more' ?<br><br>Thats it.</div>

LOL.. you mean you havn't met one yet ?<br><br>Any form of obsessiveness is BAD.<br>But the true deal breaker are gamers. WHY ?<br><br>Physical games like tennies or fitness, you cannot do those for 24 hours, NON-stop, you'd die first. Besides, those are healthy, makes the body STRONG... yah.. we like strong.... (ahem).<br><br>Now, gaming, it's a whole new story.<br>I know of people who practically plant themselves on their bed for 3 days, and have the PC attached to the side.<br>Only getting up to the restroom, if they have a choice, they'd probably put a potty under their butts. They eat, sleep and stayed awake infront of the PC.<br>WHAT FOR ?.. to get to LEVEL 80, or they lose their honor.<br><br>Now, don't get me wrong, girls don't hate games, they probably grew up with one anyway. But it's the obsession that just kills any romance in a relationship.<br><br>Besides, it's just natural women instinct to avoid such men.<br>Imagine, this<br><br>Wife : Hun, can you change the baby's diaper please ?<br>Hub : Eh ? Why, that's why diapers are for, I'm fighting the KING now hun.<br><br>Wife: Hun, can you pick up the kids ? I need to do grocery run.<br>Hub: Eh ? I need to go home straight after work, my clansmen are waiting for me to start the clash of the TITANs with another basty clans.<br><br>Wife: Hun, will you give me a back rub ?<br>Hub: Eh ? My fingers are aching today hun. How a about I use my feet ?<br><br>See . Really, hardcore gamer guys should just get themselves a virtual girlfriend. And the world will be at peace.<br><br></div>

This kind of guys do exist and sadly enough, my ex was one of them. Worst of it all, there's no future in it. I dont see why he can spend 90% of his time on it, and yet 10% on other stuffs like sleeping, bathing.<br><br>If he was obsessed with a sport, maybe basketball or badminton, I probably will join him. But what he is being obsessed now is seriously, ridiculous and hopeless. I dont hate games, I am a gamer too. Somehow. But not as obsessed as he is. So I guess I just hate his obsessiveness.</div>
