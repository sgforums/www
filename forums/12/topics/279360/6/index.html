If my bf pulled that party sh*t on me, I'd break up with him too.  Why?  Because it means he's embarrassed to have me in front of his friends, he doesn't trust I can have fun without bugging him, he doesn't respect me enough, and he probably also wants to flirt with other girls.<br><br>Don't let your emotion cloud your judgement.

He's obviously just not that "into" you anymore.. he already made it clear.  If my bf pulled that party sh*t on me, I'd break up with him too.  Why?  Because it means he's embarrassed to have me in front of his friends, he doesn't trust I can have fun without bugging him, he doesn't respect me enough, and he probably also wants to flirt with other girls.<br><br>Don't let your emotion cloud your judgement.  It's not wrong to expect your bf to act like one.  This boy is a waste of your time.  Smells like he just wants to use your TLC for as long as he needs to find another girl.</div></blockquote>I really dont know how true is your inference of him. But he told me that he wished I could go to the party with him. And that he even told all his friends about it.<br><br>And...He's not the kind who go for pretty faces and slim bodies. Not the kind who would flirt with other girls. Not the kind who whistles at any girl down the street, calling her chiobu. Not the kind who would ask pretty girls for numbers. He's just not that kind. Those are major turn offs and I am glad he isnt. Thats also one reason why I try to hold on to this relationship. I know this is quite the opposite of my action that day. My harsh decision.</div>

Perhaps, the issue isn't so much about love, much more than compatibility as a general rule of thumb.<br><br>Being in love is free, but being in a relationship comes with a price - the price of being subjected to gruesome test of eliminating our overly individualistic perception of life and learn to manage an additional headcount, transcending every aspect of our life.<br><br>Many often lament about how my partner is unable to do this... unable to do that - but that's look at it objectively, if it wasn't taught, then how would one learn? Following this line of argument, if it wasn't understood, then why would one allow himself to be 'taught'? And it goes round in that cycle.<br><br>People are always taught about love, it doesn't just appear from nowhere. Though love comes quintessentially natural, but natural doesn't mean that our development are enlightened or learning that promote minimal intensity or conflicts. In fact, it's usually our frictions that we burn ourselves with, bestowing us the most valuable lessons in love.<br><br>A princess will always be a princess until the princess understand the reason NOT to be one.<br><br>Similarly, a gamer/clubber will always be a gamer/clubber until circumstance make him realise otherwise.<br><br>Incompatibility, coupled with wrong frame of time... sometimes... makes the most suitable thing unsuitable.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers       </div></blockquote>Thanks for taking the time off to write such a sensible and logical comment.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>

Forgot to quote. Sometimes after reading few days i tend to lose track. And instead of quote.. i just reply.<br><br>Anyways..<br><br>Different ppl different habits due to the environment and friends.<br><br>Seriously.. alot of you thinks that drinking , clubbing , snooker , gambling , street racing.are bad habits. I mean o.k.. fair enough , they are not exactly very good habits. But i dont think that they are that bad a habit. Unless u are talking about addiction to it. Small gamble , small drinks..  should be acceptable right ?<br><br>anyways... you women are hard to understand. Maybe we men are as hard to understand as to why we do what we do. Sometimes its not so simple , i admit.. any form of addiction is bad. But until it is proven that they are addicted to it , addicted as in... will DIE.. or go on a fit because of not getting any... then maybe should talk it out. And compromising will always work. Guys will say thier fellow brothers getting pusssy whipped..  but in the end we all understand. At least he came out to have a drink with us.. even if it means he needs to go home early too. once in a while , if some occasion , just let him out.. or be with him till late.<br><br>It just depends on the crowd and people he is with. Supportive of him and the decision or not they like you as a gf to him. And as a gf , you should get to know his close brothers. Because they are the ones that influence him.  N when u guys quarrel.. know that these guys are the ones he will be b|tching  to and downing his sorrows in beer with. Unless his brothers are like real fuked up ppl .. if he is blind to not see.. well.. just let him be. he will get into some deep sh|t and come crawling back telling u, you are right.<br><br>understanding of each other and the people around them is important. with that , you can get a better understanding and work your way from there to solve those little little issues. in the end , if one side dont compromise , it just wont work. If he is just being a son of  a b|tch.. and an @ss and jerk.. just dump his @ss.  I am sure he has those things u like about him.. or else you wont be with him in the first place. but if it starts to turn ugly... all those things u like about him all gone.. then.. drop him.</div>
