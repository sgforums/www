I believe you understood how I felt. I knew I was too much by hurling abuses at him. But its like really common for us when we are angry. I am not exactly princessy.

Its not like I demand things from him and make him serve me all the time. I am just hurt. Maybe I do demand things from him at times, but that is mostly when he makes me angry.

            <div class='col-md body'>I think we do not know enough of TS and her relationship with her bf to label her as a bad gf, or him as a bad bf.<br><br>Vulgarities mean different things to different people. Different people have different levels of communication.<br><br>TS,<br><br>No doubt, you want the understanding and attention of ur bf, and rightly so. But sometimes it helps to communicate properly. And frankly speaking, I think sms text messages sometimes miscommunicate feelings, rather than communicate.<br><br>As jojo mentioned, we guys aren't telepathic. We really aren't.<br><br>You could have said that "i am looking forward to this party becos i want to unwind", and he would get the message in a clearer manner. And perhaps, both of you would go off happily to the party, and you wouldn't be here posting all these.<br><br>Your bf has faults too, but guys usually hate girls who nag at them all the time.<br>My wife has nagged countlessly at my hobby too, and after sometime, i learnt to give in, and she learnt to respect i need that outlet.<br><br>For you, a compromise needs to be set in after much discussion.<br>Maybe his hobby is a source of self-worth and self-esteem, or simply the best way to unwind, as for me.<br><br>I would suggest to the bf, if he reads this, that a relationship requires more than words, it needs action and commitment. Oversleeping and making a girl wait is downright unacceptable. And girls are usually very sensitive and "do one thing while say another". That's girls, for you. Learn to manage the moods of a girl, and you'll get far in your relationship.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Lets just take it as his hobby is gaming since its somewhat like it.<br><br>The main reason why I really dislike his hobby is because he would neglect me. He doesnt know his limits and he would not reply my smses even if he could pause for a moment. He did it over-excessively once and we broke up as a result. Thus, I have been trying my best to compromise. I tried to accept his hobby, but he doesnt bothers about compromising.<br><br>Anyway, the incident has happened more than a week back. We are still sms-ing but not much. And we arent together. He has asked if we wanted to patch but I did not give him an immediate answer. Maybe people in here were right, I dont deserve him.
