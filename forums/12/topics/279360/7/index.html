Perhaps he wishes to say all these, if only you can somehow apologise for your princessy attitude first.<br><br>Obviously you kind of regret your outburst, but perhaps you think that being the first person to apologise would allow him to get away with his mistakes. I would say, it takes a courageous person to apologize and then communicate what he/she wants to the other party.<br><br>I am not suggesting what you should do.<br><br>But pride, according the Roman Catholic Church, is the deadliest of the 7 deadly sins.<br><br>Hope that helps.</div>

TS perhaps only tell from A - C..<br><br>FOr me , i think her reaction is normal,, not demanding or princessy, TS just feel shes unimportant to him and for all gals, this feeling is very important.<br><br>I still think her ex is a terrible jerk.. how could u overslept when u date your gf..and let her waited 2 hours.. gosh.<br><br>Communication is SUPER important in any r/s. In this case, i guess TS's ex rarely try to communicate with TS..<br><br>My ex even get angry with me when i left my apartment with a simple note but didnt wake her up to tell her that... She thinks she's unimportant to me.  Its just the matter of understanding ma. Obviously , TS's ex never really understand TS</div>
