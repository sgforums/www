            <div class='col-md body'>Im currently taking my E Commerce course in ITE Clementi. On the other hand, I feel like retaking my O levels, could be because I want to try out Communications and Media Management. Sometimes I ask myself to quit ITE, but on the other hand I asked myself am I escaping away from trouble?<br>During the past 3 years, whatever that Ive joined, be it work or school, I quit. I have yet to accomplish anything. During the past 8 months I struggled to get along with classmates, altough Im very nervous with ppl, and that freaks them of unintentionally. However, I try to minimize drama whenever I come to emotional crisis and chose to focus on bigger things like studying hard for exams while trying to live positively. I left my friends who doesnt really like me and since then, Ive been doing things alone, be it lunch or going out for a walk. I thought thats fine. But this year, we have alot of projects, and I had no choice but to join my ex group of friends again, some were rather reluctant to let me in. I find that they as typical ITE students, cant be bothered with project work. So I decided to take initiative to do everything, since they wont do a single job. I dun mind that, but later, they complained that Im manipulative and bossy. I tried all ways to please them, like giving them new year cards and encouraging them. But I dun blame them. Maybe its really my fault for not communicating well with them.</div>

Probably won't even speak up in front of the others.... (peer pressure..?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> )<br><br><strong>Your Social Circle :</strong><br><br>I used to be a loner just very much like you.. (in fact I'm still kinda like one..? Hehheh...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">&gt; ) There are such things as friends and acquiantance.... Or EVEN CLOSE FRIENDS.... Be REMINDED that you live in a world of HUMANs... Not of your own... Maybe it be that you like it, OR NOT... They're there... And you'll NEED them.... (For whatever different sort of reasons...) You shouldn't be just 'dumping' people because you don't like them...? (Ok... Unless you REALLY DETEST them....) Think of how your friends AVOIDED you...? You've probably contributed to the picture by playing your part...? You're just a NORMAL person... You DON'T have to BUY people over just because you want them as friends...? At least not when you're not directly involved in POLITICS and BUSINESS where such 'hands' might be 'needy'....?<br><br><strong>Your Academic Life :</strong><br><br>Singapore is a country of CERTs... (Certificate lah... Not the kinda SWEETs you eat...) You've probably heard of that long before... They're just like stepping stones in your life... Helping you to accomplish what you need in life... Getting to various stages... Every time you DROP a COURSE (or whatever...), you give that 'RECOGNITION' a MISS... You still GAIN whatever you've learnt till that point... But people probably can't see it in BLACK n WHITE, and you don't expect them to READ YOUR MIND to know what you've actually acquired...? Unless they've know you LONG ENOUGH (which they probably won't have the extra time and WHY take the extra chance...?).... GET YOURSELF SOMETHING before you END UP with NOTHING.... SURE you can pursue whatever you're REALLY INTERESTED in... But don't make yourself run in circles for the rest of your life...? Get SOMETHING... It's always BETTER than NOTHING... At least you've got SOMETHING to rest on and you can just decide where ya wanna move on from there...?<br><br>About getting projects done all by yourself... It WON'T work... NOT now... Not in your FUTURE.... It's SUPPOSE to be a TEAMWORK... Even IF you've got all As for your projects you've probably FAILED BADLY in the MAIN IDEA.... Yes.... TEAMWORK &amp; COMMUNICATION SKILLS..... And DON'T think you'll make people 'feel better with you' just because you do EVERYTHING... You'll only make yourself MISERABLE... And the way they'll be TAKING ADVANTAGE of you...? YES... You've got to play part of the RESPONSIBILITY too... JUST BECAUSE ya made it HAPPEN....<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic;">PERSONAL ADVICE</span></span></strong><br><br>Go read up some books on Management and how works should be divided out among individuals...? Work out the shares in such a way that IF one person don't do their job, the WHOLE TEAM would SINK together... Nobody would want that to happen... If one or 2 of the idiots think that way, the others would probably urge him/ her not to.... CHANCES are the ball would start to bounce on your side of the court...<br><br>AND.... LEARN to MIX around with people... Whether you like them or not.... COMMUNICATION and INTERACTION are IMPORTANT in a SOCIAL... In doubt..? Join us for OUTINGS...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>I wish you luck...?</div>
