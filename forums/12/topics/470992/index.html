              <p>The study abroad section of the forums seems pretty dead so I'm posting here instead ahhaahah hope you guys don't find me annoying (:</p>
              <p>I'm sec 4 this year and I'm studying in one of the IP schools in Singapore. I'm doing fine in my studies but faced with the upcoming A levels, I've been extremely paraniod that I'd do really badly for it and not even qualify for local u. After all, it's ONE major standardized exam - the stakes are high and it's unimaginable if you screw it up haha</p>
              <p>I've been thinking a lot lately as well, and since my mom's an Australian citizen (she's living there permanently now), it seems pretty reasonable for me to move over. I'm thinking of going for foundation at Trinity College, then doing a double-major in Finance and Accounting at University of Melbourne. After taking 1 year of Uni, I'd then return for NS, before going back for 3 more years. Meanwhile, I'd convert to Australian PR so that I'll be paying local (and subsidized fees).</p>
              <p>My concern here, however, is how prestegious Australian Universities truly are, since they have a strong rep among Singaporeans for being backup options. I want a job in an investment bank, preferbly in a bulge bracket, so how they appear in the eyes of the Singaporean employer would really matter. I don't want to come back with an unrecognized degree that can't get me anywhere!</p>
              <p>If not, I'd probably be staying in Australia with my PR, but I'd prefer to come back to Singapore anw, it's home to me! (:</p>

              <p><em>By Esther Tan</em></p>
              <p>SINGAPORE Institute of Management (SIM) student Samuel Tan Chee Hong 
                  will not get to sit for his first-year examinations at the end of this 
                  year.</p>
              <p>By then, the youth, who turned 18 last month, will have been called up to begin his national service (NS).</p>
              <p>Samuel joined the private educational organisation in the middle of 
                  last year, finished a six-month foundation programme and started his 
                  course in computer science at the start of this year.</p>
              <p>But, last month, he received a letter from the Defence Ministry telling him to report for NS next month.</p>
              <p>He has made five failed appeals to Mindef asking for a deferment. At 
                  first, he pleaded for a deferment until the end of his three-year 
                  bachelor's degree.</p>
              <p><strong>When that was turned down, he made four further appeals seeking a 
                  three- month deferment to allow him to at least complete the first year 
                  of his course.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>All have been rejected, even with support from Aljunied GRC MPs Cynthia Phua and Lim Hwee Hua.</strong></p>
              <p>Mindef's replies to him all carried the same reason: Male 
                  Singaporeans aged 18 and due to enlist will be granted a full deferment 
                  from NS only to pursue educational qualifications up to 'A' levels, a 
                  polytechnic diploma or equivalent qualifications such as those from the 
                  Institute of Technical Education.</p>
              <p><strong>NS deferment to pursue a university degree has not been allowed since late 2005, said Mindef spokesman Darius Lim.</strong></p>
              <p>At the Budget debate in 2006, Second Minister for Defence Ng Eng Hen 
                  explained that, with more educational opportunities available now, 
                  pre-enlisted males can start their courses at any time of the year. This
                   means many more Singaporeans are able to start university or other 
                  courses locally before they reach 18.</p>
              <p>Defence Minister Teo Chee Hean also reiterated Mindef's stance in 
                  Parliament last month. "Allowing such students deferment would be unfair
                   to the vast majority of their peers studying in junior colleges, 
                  polytechnics and other institutions who do not have the same opportunity
                   to be deferred for their university studies."</p>
              <p>Samuel's father, Mr Roger Tan, said his youngest of three sons had 
                  started the SIM course knowing there was a chance he would not get to 
                  defer. "But we didn't want to waste time waiting for him to hit 18 
                  before he started NS. It was a risk we had to take," said the IT 
                  manager.</p>
              <p>He could have enlisted earlier, as teens aged 16 1/2 can apply for 
                  early enlistment. But his father did not want him to do that: "Boys that
                   age are too young, immature and slow to learn. The risk is too high and
                   they will be more prone to accidents."</p>
              <p>An SIM spokesman said the credits Samuel obtained in his first three 
                  quarters of the year will still be valid when he finishes his NS in two 
                  years' time.</p>
              <p><strong>Since the start of the year, five other SIM students have had to stop
                   their studies to enlist for NS. </strong>So far, all returning students have not
                   had to pick up new modules to replace the old ones, the spokesman said.</p>
              <p>When contacted, a Mindef spokesman said it considers two main factors when facing a deferment request.</p>
              <p>One is the need to preserve equity in terms of educational attainment
                   before NS. The second is the need to enlist NS-liable males for 
                  rigorous military training "while they are young and fit".</p>
              <p>Mr Tan, 54, said his son was asking for a three-month delay and would be only half a year older upon actual enlistment.</p>
              <p>"Even with a full deferment, he would only be 20 years old upon the 
                  completion of his degree course. He'll still be young and fit then," he 
                  said.</p>
