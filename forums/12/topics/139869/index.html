            <div class='col-md body'>Although she have betrayed me, hurt me alot but then, there is really no turning back. She is the last person who I think will ever hurt me in any way but then, time really flies, our r/s ends for more than 1/2 year. She contacted me recently, ask me how am I, how happy she is. I saw her ROM photo with her husband. I really dun know to express my self in words. Rather happy for her. Maybe the hurt is not as tremendous by then when the wound is still fresh.<br>Maybe, I have gave up all hopes and all hatred and anger gradually vanished. Abit sad cos I have lost something which I treasured most but yet after a couple of months of in-depth thoughts. she isnt worth my effort after all. Still friend but its only time when contact will slowly reduce to none.<br><br>At time, I still feel despair. I told myself that I have no choice, really no choice but to move on and let time heal the wound. To all who suffer in a r/s, move on and push on cos thats the only method that is rationale.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Till now, she still thinks that her action is right and justified. I did try to unveal the missing link which I have been trying to find out and I must thank her for revealing the truth that she indeed did something behind my back.<br><br>I must admit that I am a failure in one way or another. I did alot of self reflection and I really cant compare with her husband. I am really poor with insecure low pay job back then.<br><br>She told me that her husband really treats her well, bringing happiness and joy to her, care abt her etc etc. She has forgetten what I have done for her. She told me that this is life or reality cos someone gets dumped vice versa.<br><br>I told her one thing tat for what she has done to me, I cant hate her anymore cos I knew that the hatred and anger posed hurdles for me to move on in my life. I kept telling myself that time can determine how far I walked away from the her and her inflicting pain on me and time can also reveal the whole truth.<br><br>Just hope that I am able to love and be loved.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ptw, I'm sure you must have felt really worse when she called you on the pretext of concern and catching up to compare and show-off to you how good she's doing right now. Yes, it's sad that what she really wanted was to compare and do a little showing-off to make herself feel better. But do not worry, she did that cos she is feeling a little insecure about her decision to leave you. So feel better cos she will definitely regret it in the future...be it big time or small time. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Don't worry about trying to make her understand your pain and her heartless act, cos she will NEVER admit to it even when she's about to die. And this gives you a very good reason to HATE her. <strong> There's nothing wrong and ungracious in hating someone who deserves to be hate, </strong> remember that. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> (That's applicable in your case)<br><br>If you agree that humans are selfish species by nature, then you will agree that what she did wasn't wrong...from her perspective. She did cause you to experience unbearable intense searing pain deeply scarred in your heart. And it really felt worse than dying, cos both your body and soul is causing great pain to you. Believe me, it doesn't felt that bad if your body wasn't causing you to experience any of those heart pains. But you did felt a lot better after your body drained you out of all those painful emotions.<br><br>She did you wrong even though what she did was perfectly human and there's nothing wrong in seeking for a better life and future for herself.<br><br>Embrace hatred towards her as this is the lesson that you must learn in this period of your life. If you let it go and forgive her and blame yourself thinking that you will become a betterman, then you are wrong. If you let this lesson go and didn't embrace hate, you will lose this chance to learn this important lesson in your life, and the same situation will keep on repeating itself like a bad dream*dejavu loop. And when that happens, you will realised that you haven't change or evolve in the way you perceive things.<br><br>So trust me and embrace this hate till it became a normality and part of you. You will definitely learn and realised some truth at the end of this etching process. Everything happens for a reason...most of it is unknown, and you will be a betterman if you embrace this hate...and things will definitely appears to be a lot more different to you. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I sincerely hope that you will overcome this lesson in your life and find true happiness and peace within yourself, I'm sure that you will if you didn't take a step backwards to try to forgive and forget. Accept this hatred and move forward with it, whatever things you may learnt out of this will certainly ensure that you won't have to deal with this situation ever again and you have one less situation/crisis to deal in your life. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Good luck, the good in life cannot be taught...they have to be learnt. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>
