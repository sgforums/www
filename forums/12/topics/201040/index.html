Dare to step out of your current boundaries and do things you've never done nor thought of doing before.<br><br>Try to get friends to accompany you! It's easier to try out new things when your friends are with you.

Somehow it's like in denial? I'm not asking you to ALL HELL BREAK LOSE... Going for the EXTREMES... I'm just saying sometimes it's ok to be curious... Question around and find out more... If you're worried... Just remember that so long as you keep yourself within 'safety distance' from your wander off from 'mainstream' life, you should be relatively safe...? 'LIFE' itself is a relative set of 'GOLD'... It just depends on how you tackle and approach it....<br><br>You need to be truthful to yourself? Don't pour and fit yourself up with activities which you're really not that interested in and try to convince yourself that you're interested in them... 'You' are really not as stupid as you think it is.... Resentment naturally comes in....<br><br>I think it has been quite a while since we last met?

Another friend says it's depression.<br><br>Currently, everything goes well in my life.  Good job, nice friends etc.<br>But I don't seem to be happy leh.  I don't know what is bothering me.<br>I get bored with all the things I have even though <span style="color: red;">I keep reminding myself to be happy</span> and contented with everything and that I am a lucky person.<br><br>I try to have a bit of motivation by setting new goals.  I thought I just need a push to feel more fulfilling.  But I am just not interested in anything to set any new goals, new targets.  I keep feeling "I've been there, done that.  What is there new for me now?"<br><br>I notice that I smile less, laugh less.  I feel physically tired easily.  Everything I suggest to myself to do certain thing so as to feel less bored, I will always have a reason not to execute it eventually.  Eg. If I think of doing window shopping, after a while, I will tell myself that it's so boring cuz I have done it so many times.<br><br>Things that I have not done before, I will feel lazy to try out.<br><br>I try going shopping, thinking that it should be interested.  After all, shopping is all ladies favourite past time.  I can walk the whole shopping mall and find nothing interesting or pretty enough.  I don't have any motivation or push to make me buy anything.  Makeup, nice dresses are all too boring to me these days.  In the end, in the past couple of months, I totally never buy anything for myself, except toiletries and shampoo stuff that have run out at home.<br><br>Even if you show me the nicest thing, I will tell myself "no point" (ie. pointless to buy).<br><br>I constantly have this very lousy and sian feeling in me.  I try keeping myself very very very busy at work.  It is true that when I am loaded with works and deadlines, I feel slightly better.  But once I clear all my work, and relax a little, the lousy feeling starts flowing into me.  Then I have to find something to do again.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Spending time with loved ones become too tiring for me.</span><br><br>In fact, last weekend, I literally sleep more than 15 hours each day.  I wasn't tired.  But I just didn't feel like doing anything.<br><br>I really dunno what is wrong with me.<br>Mid life crisis?<br></div></blockquote>I am more concerned with the highlighted...<br><br>I supposed you have nothing to look forward to after work? You may be lost in your "direction"? You feel like being stuck in a pool of mud and unable to get out? You feel you are sinking and also no way out? You feel like crying because no one truely understands you? You feel virtually nothing you find can truely satisfy your meaning of existance?</div>
