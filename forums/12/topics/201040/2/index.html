            <div class='col-md body'>Ohh..u guys are so nice. Organise outing..cool..<br><br>Anyway honeybunz, why dun u take a month long holiday?..Go somewhere far, like US or Europe, or even nearby countries. When u are there, go make new frens, just simply go up to strangers and strike up conversations, perhaps in the subway or a restaurant, even in the plane. Trust me, meeting new ppl widens your view and thinking about this world. Quite often, u will come upon ppl who are less well off than u (not only financially wise, many other things as well). And then, u will come to realise that ur life is not that bad after all.<br><br>It worked for me, and am sure it will work for u too.<br><br>Most importantly, think about wat u are really passionate about in life. And go take action to make it a reality. Good luck!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>

You have the raging hormones and as a teen, you have all kinds of emotions popping up in your mind. My advice for you of this age: Study. You have nth to worry about, unless yr family is in need of another income then you have to comply abit. ELSE study is your way for now. You can find out more about life as you go along. When you working or finish studies and still feel like this, then come back here. I will tell you a different answer.</div>

Have to go drag her out of her house hehe  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  Anyway, try volunteering? Bring meaning to you own life and also to others.. You like animals? Volunteer for the cat welfare society or SPCA. If you like kids, go to the various children organization... At least there is some meaning.. Helping other people could be what you need now and do it with some friends so got a bit of motivation.. hehe..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
