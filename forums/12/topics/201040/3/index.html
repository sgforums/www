Another friend says it's depression.<br><br>Currently, everything goes well in my life.  Good job, nice friends etc.<br>But I don't seem to be happy leh.  I don't know what is bothering me.<br>I get bored with all the things I have even though I keep reminding myself to be happy and contented with everything and that I am a lucky person.<br><br>I try to have a bit of motivation by setting new goals.  I thought I just need a push to feel more fulfilling.  But I am just not interested in anything to set any new goals, new targets.  I keep feeling "I've been there, done that.  What is there new for me now?"<br><br>I notice that I smile less, laugh less.  I feel physically tired easily.  Everything I suggest to myself to do certain thing so as to feel less bored, I will always have a reason not to execute it eventually.  Eg. If I think of doing window shopping, after a while, I will tell myself that it's so boring cuz I have done it so many times.<br><br>Things that I have not done before, I will feel lazy to try out.<br><br>I try going shopping, thinking that it should be interested.  After all, shopping is all ladies favourite past time.  I can walk the whole shopping mall and find nothing interesting or pretty enough.  I don't have any motivation or push to make me buy anything.  Makeup, nice dresses are all too boring to me these days.  In the end, in the past couple of months, I totally never buy anything for myself, except toiletries and shampoo stuff that have run out at home.<br><br>Even if you show me the nicest thing, I will tell myself "no point" (ie. pointless to buy).<br><br>I constantly have this very lousy and sian feeling in me.  I try keeping myself very very very busy at work.  It is true that when I am loaded with works and deadlines, I feel slightly better.  But once I clear all my work, and relax a little, the lousy feeling starts flowing into me.  Then I have to find something to do again.<br><br>Spending time with loved ones become too tiring for me.<br><br>In fact, last weekend, I literally sleep more than 15 hours each day.  I wasn't tired.  But I just didn't feel like doing anything.<br><br>I really dunno what is wrong with me.<br>Mid life crisis?<br></div></blockquote>don wry im 18, and me and my friends experience almost the same thing, BORED! ARGHGHGHGHGH!!! somthing like that, wanto go out also dunno what to do where to go. go on msn everyone send me the same thing and i do the same. " BORED!!!!" so well, i really need help too -.-<br>maybe at my age, ppl will tell me to club since im finally legal, buts its like i club since 16, gt bored of it soo long ago, sometimes i feel like games are too boring to play, wanto go out but too lazy, bored but dunno wad to do. this is a sh!tass feeling</div>

If all else seems boring to you, why not focus your attention on studies? I assume you and your friends go out to have fun and such. Ever tried heart to heart talk?

You may not find it now doesn't mean you will NEVER find it. It took me a LONG time to find it, but I found it.

            <div class='col-md body'>There are possible reasons for losing appetite over the usual daily chores and events of your life.<br><br>1. You have grown wiser. e.g., look back to your teenage years. Would you now react, behave, be interested in things, as you had when you were a teenager? Why have you lost appetite for those that you used to enjoy as a teenager - is a similar question you would be asking yourself now - iff (mathematical abbrev for 'if and only if') your current loss of interest is due to your becoming wiser.<br><br>The times when you feel 'no point' are evidence that you have become wiser.<br><br>2. There is an unfulfilled desire which has become amplified recently. The amplification could have been triggered by a series of advertisements running on TV, the middle-east situation, your sister/brother/neighbour getting married or having had a baby. A silent unknown obsession can cause you to lose interest in other things. It's like an unreachable itch and you just don't know where to scratch.<br><br>You might have seen a cute furry sheep dog at your friend's landed house, and since you know your HDB apt can never accommodate such a huge dog, you throw it off behind your mind and you'll never know it's the cause of your disinterest.<br><br>3. Feelings of helplessness and haplessness. And you don't like the feeling and therefore you block the helplessness off your mind. But it still bugs you. You offended a neighbour or friend just before she/he left the country or died. You feel offended for having offended your own principles and therefore the framework of your life is breaking down silently.<br><br>There are times when we should enjoy the emotional free-fall of feeling helpless. It is a very great experience. It is like jumping off a plane before the parachute opens without the risk and cost of parachuting.<br><br>4. It could be a combination of all the above.<br><br>One could medidate to equalise his/her mental and physical state, to calm oneself against the superficial waves smashing into your face and feel the strong silent undercurrent of tide flowing by your feet, stretch out your hands and let it flow with the calm of the surface water and gradually let the natural response of your body balance your body against the rollicking surface currents.<br><br>After a long while (just don't fall asleep and drown yourself) you will discover that you could attain a wider attitude, a wider mind, a wider mode of communication and then you will notice what was ugly is no longer. What was beautiful is mundane. But then as you go off home, your ordinary attitudes return to you. Then you have to find another opportunity of free day and free moments to repeat the exercise.<br><br>There is a silent back cove at Sentosa. Once during off-peak days/hours, I have seen a couple doing stuffs there. But that is not the point. The point is there is a cove at sentosa that at times is so silent you could immerse yourself to the neck and meditate there. Haven't been there in years - hope it's still there.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sorry, I had the impression you had a 5Room or HUDC.<br><br>You need to find ways to mess up your life a little.<br>Do some things that do not require much motivation.<br><br>Dispose (sorry for intruding your privacy) all your undies and buy a new set.  If you are unwilling to do that ~ perhaps, you are hopelessly emotionally tied down to an unknown entity. It's a huge waste, but that's the point.<br><br>Donate blood. Also consider visiting the Singapore Biopolis and volunteer donating ~ what they might need but lack donors ~ because medical ethics prevent them from paying donors, but what would otherwise monthly go to waste. That is, if Singapre does conduct non-embryo stem cell research. http://www.time.com/time/archive/preview/0,10987,1218061,00.html<br><br>Drive a car (rent if you don't have a car) into JB. Bring a friend along. Drive into Malaysia with no destination in mind. But that might not work because you would need to find out and plan what places to avoid. Too much planning spoils the broth.<br><br>Come to Maine or New Hampshire for two week vacation. It's rather safe, but don't take that for granted. People don't normally lock their car doors or their houses. But please, don't commit the embarrassing activity of obsessive shopping. Cross shopping out of your list. Drive and walk around town aimlessly. But safely, so that there are people to ask if you need help. Loosen up and greet strangers like you've never greeted anyone before. Singaporeans do not need visa to visit the USA.<br><br>On the other hand, something as simple as renovating your apt would bring your spirits up.<br></div>
