Give urself more time to forget about the 1 who ill treats u. Don't let ur EQ overtake ur IQ.<br><br>Hard to break off with current bf?<br><br>My advice to u is, think of ways to forget the old 1 instead of thinking how to break with the new 1.<br><br>Put urself in ur new bf's position. if after u go back with ur old bf, and found out that whenever he's with u he thinks of other girls, when he's not with u he's with the other girl. and eventually he breaks off with u yet again becos of the other girl. how would u feel???<br><br>Cherish what u have now and not go back to the old 1. things will have to move forward and not stay stagnant.

            <div class='col-md body'>Forget it.. about ur ex... U should cherish wat u have now...<br><br>I used to face the similar problem with u... my ex used to take me for granted as well.. after broke up with him, i got myself a new bf within months, but not to make him jealous.. just my new bf treat very well upon that moment.. But few months later i broke up with my new bf, cause i found him is not right person for me..<br><br>That time, I still seeing my ex as a friend as n when, whether i'm attached or not... He did ask me few times whether we can patch up or not.. but i rejected.. However, my ex able to get me back to his side finally as he promise he will treat me nicely and cherish me.. plus i still have the same feeling for him.. I thought this time we really can make it, I even fantasized about our future...<br><br>But a month later, he broke up with me.. I was so shocked at that time.. caused everything seem fine for the past one month.. He just told me that he cant get himself to treat me well.. I was very sad and really angry.. i was thinking that he just play a fool with me.. From that day onwards, i din keep a contact with him anymore..<br><br>So my conclusion is <strong>never get back to your ex</strong>, even though they told you that they are not the same old him anymore, promise will treat u nicely and cherish you... All these are just bullshit.. DUN BELIEVE!!!!</div>
