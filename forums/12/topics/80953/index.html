Don't give up. Even when all the odds are against you, don't give up. Even when you imagine her actions/behaviour has already rejected you, don't give up. Even when her so-called sworn brothers/sisters threaten you with death and destruction, don't give up. Even when you are already very battered and tired from chasing her and feeling super frustrated for not able to win her love, don't give up. Give up only when your heart is already numbed of her and it doesn't matter if she tell you she hates you and ask you to go and die but you didn't.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br></div></blockquote>on the contrary..i know A very well..as a friend lar  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>lol the second part very inspiring hor... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br><blockquote><br><strong>Originally posted by beagle<br>just be single.<br><br>single rules, i hate girls .</strong> </blockquote>hahahahaha....a bit the incoherent. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
