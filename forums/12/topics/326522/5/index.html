              <p>I know whatyou mean. When I first got together with my now-husband, my mum used to say,"why don't you like chinese guys? Are there no chinese guys?" I was offended.

              <p>Sadly, until today, I don't think she fully accepted him. She sometimes treats him like a servant/driver.  At least she doesn't say those things anymore and accepted the marriage. I don't really bother to think about my relatives, I totally get what you mean about hypocrisy. I don't see anything wrong in marrying someone I love even though we are from different cultures, nationalities, even social backgrounds. What's not important is the past and things you can't change. We share the same dreams, the same ideals, same intellectual level and educational level. Better than my relative who married a myanmese who doesn't even have a common language with him. So weird. Now that's weird. Don't think about judging me. I don't give a flying fuck.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>My mom once told me: No matter who the child is with or marry to, if the parents object, it's just temporary. In the end, it's their choice. Parents reaction is for the well being of the child. They can only hope that their child won't regret the choice he or she made. So, if you guys are really serious about it ( meaning planning for a future, having a family), then go for it.<br><br>On the other hand, as you say, she is a nice gal and you think it's just left with only your parents to approve then it would be a perfect picture. But what about in long run? If you never think of marryin this gal, why be together in the first place where you have to go through all these problems? My point is, don't rush to conclusion.<br><br>It's not just the race and religion but how you 2 are brought up in a very different family of rules and regulations. Are you sure there wont be any ways whereby you and your gf wont conflict in at all in future living together? Put it the other way round. Why is it not your gf giving in to you by converting out instead? You're doing it one-sided I guess. (correct me if I'm wrong)<br><br>Traditional chinese parents are always like that. Face comes first for traditional parents. How are they going to face their relatives and so on? Both parties have their dignity, reputation and principles to uphold. I'm in the same situation as you as well in some ways, but to avoid getting into getting "trouble" with my parents, my relationship is not disclosed to anyone cos my bf and I never know whether we will be marryin to each other in the end. It's not we don't believe in each other but shit happens sometimes. Therefore, we didn't want to upset anyone in the mean time, or go thru all the dramas at the moment., since everything is not comfirm yet till maybe we are really getting married as in till we are engaged or sth like tat. Imagine, (not cursing you) but if one day you and your gf broke up for some reason we never know, won't all these dramas between you and your parents esp your father, seems like you going through and fighting for nothin?<br><br>No matter what you choose, show respect and gratitude to your parents. They give you what you have, brought you up to the person you become. Is that how you're going to repay their kindness?<br><br>There are too many elements in life that you have to sacrifice sometimes cos of the decision you made. Love is not everything. Loving someone doesnt mean you have to possess him or her.<br><br>In the mean time, why not just enjoy life, enjoy what you have and appreciate it.</p></div>

              just left with only your parents to approve then it would be a
              perfect picture. But what about in long run? If you never think of
              marryin this gal, why be together in the first place where you have
              to go through all these problems? My point is, don't rush to
              conclusion.<br> <br> It's not just the race and religion but how you 2 are brought up in
              a very different family of rules and regulations. Are you sure
              there wont be any ways whereby you and your gf wont conflict in at
              all in future living together? Put it the other way round. Why
              is it not your gf giving in to you by converting out instead?
              You're doing it one-sided I guess. (correct me if I'm wrong)<br> <br> Traditional chinese parents are always like that. Face comes first
              for traditional parents. How are they going to face their relatives
              and so on? Both parties have their dignity, reputation
              and principles to uphold. I'm in the same situation as you as well
              in some ways, but to avoid getting into getting "trouble" with
              my parents, my relationship is not disclosed to anyone cos my bf
              and I never know whether we will be marryin to each other in the
              end. It's not we don't believe in each other but shit happens
              sometimes. Therefore, we didn't want to upset anyone in the mean
              time, or go thru all the dramas at the moment., since everything is
              not comfirm yet till maybe we are really getting married as in till
              we are engaged or sth like tat. Imagine, (not cursing you) but if
              one day you and your gf broke up for some reason we never
              know, won't all these dramas between you and your parents
              esp your father, seems like you going through and fighting for
              nothin?<br> <br> No matter what you choose, show respect and gratitude to
              your parents. They give you what you have, brought you up to the
              person you become. Is that how you're going to repay their
              kindness?<br> <br> There are too many elements in life that you have to sacrifice
              sometimes cos of the decision you made. Love is not everything.
              Loving someone doesnt mean you have to possess him or her.<br> <br> In the mean time, why not just enjoy life, enjoy what you have and
              appreciate it.</p>

              <p>This is not true.  As much as the bible has stated that a christian should marry a christian, christians marrying non-christians are still very common, and they will not be treated as outcast.  Unlike Islam, where this is strictly enforced.  If a muslim were to marry a non-muslim, they will be despised by the entire muslim community.</p>

              <p>It's true christians do marry non-christians (it goes against the word of god; which sorta leads us to question their devotion in the first place) and they are not outcasted the same way as the islamic religion, they usually attempt to convert the other party to their religion.</p>
              <p>This is especially problematic when the other party is of another faith. A tug-of-war between husband and wife of different faiths is very detrimental to the relationship since one believes the other is going to hell (and that their god is the one true god). For freethinkers, this is still a huge problem since christians are also told to love god first and others second meaning that even if the atheist party believes her partner to be her one true love, the feeling is apparently not mutual. There is then a discrepancy between husband and wife in which one loves an "imaginary friend" more so than he does his partner, which I find extremely disturbing =/</p>

              <p>don't get why everybody thinks that parents will always love and forgive you... parents are not invincible or ultra wise, they are just push into the so-called position of authority.. if going against their wishes or arguing with them means unfilial then good luck to you..</p>
              <p>do what you want.. if your parents are not magnimous enough to accept others, then you don't have to force yourself to accept their mindsets too.. parents are not everything.. care and respect for them but to a limit..</p>

              <p>people have different ways of looking at a situation like this. ultimately, if both parties truly love each other, this will naturally override everything else. and for parents/relatives of both sides who reject interracial relationships, they should take a step back and look at their sons and daughters. are they both happy being with each other? like truly, purely love each other, enough to go through the conversion process and come out of that still as a couple. its the same as the line "for better or worst". NOT saying converting falls under "worse" here, but rather the couple going through everything as one.</p>
              <p>that's the most important, and they can't force their children to do otherwise. that's being super unreasonable, in this day and age. when you've found your "the one", nothing is going to stop you from being with that person, and its above all, be it religion. and if you love the person truly, all this converting will not bother you. <br>just hang in there <a href="../../../users/243046">R3D3V1L</a>, besides doing all you can to prove to your parents that you and your gf are meant to be, its time that'll also show your parents that fact. don't ever give up on true love.</p>

              of course not lah, but if he truly loves her, then should be thinking pretty long term already. if really got the guts then do as you say, convert, get engaged and stay together. all without the parents' blessings.
              
              gosh talk about being romeo and juliet -esque man.
