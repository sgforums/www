              <p>I hate relatives by the way. You see them once in a while and they tell you how you've grown, how handsome you are and how smart that you got into university. They then proceed to talk behind your back. You don't love your cousins, they view you as competition to beat in life. Who is the smartest, the richest...</p>
              <p>The disease of the old generation still infects some of the younger generation today. No love in family. Good thing you ignored their insults. Because they would love nothing better than to see you fall.</p>
              <p>I'm not crazy. I just won't compromise my principles. I'm stubborn.</p>
              <p>I'm not sure about you guys out there. But my extended family is like this. Fxxxed up.</p>

              <p>R3D, I empathise with you. I went out with a guy my then-alive dad disliked.</p>
              <p>Despite the family's rejections (said he is not rich, not well educated, blah blah blah), I still went out with him, thus developing a serious relationship with him.</p>
              <p>My dad and the rest of the family learnt to slowly accept him as part of my life and I was heartened.</p>
              <p>I never regretted with anything so far up to this point.</p>
              <p>I went through with insults from relatives and still am.</p>
              <p>What to do? I like him and I want him. I will do anything for him, even had stupid thoughts of committing suicide when certain issues arised between us. </p>
              <p>Are you as crazy as I am? As devoted and perhaps blind like me?</p>
              <p>Sorry if I sounded like a freakish Joker-wannabe. Lol... Tends to get into matters over my head.</p>
