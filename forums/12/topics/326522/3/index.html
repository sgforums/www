              <p>cant you see i have done no wrong? if anything i would be forsaken by them. <strong>its not like i'm married and my wife says "throw your parents out, they are annoying" and i do so. If that was the case, I'D THROW MY WIFE OUT of the house.</strong></p>
              <p>perhaps your best friend has HIV. your parents strongly object you from being close to that person. would you accede to your parent's request knowing it is wrong to abandon your friend in his hour of need?</p>
              <p>tension is expected. but you forgive your parents that they are blind and hope one day they will understand and forgive you. i only hope to make them see. but if the worst case scenario happens, i will just have to try to make the best of it. knowing that i have not taken the easy path. do you get my point?</p>
              <p>if some of you were fathers, would you really interfere with your son or daughter's relationships? remember you are not your son or daughter. i'm sure you know people have married against their parent's wishes and have had happy lives. should they have obeyed? people have gone out to live happy lives doing things they love against their parent's wishes.</p>
              <p><em>&lt;fictional example&gt;<br></em></p>
              <p><em>"Son, I am a doctor so you should study medicine."</em></p>
              <p><em>"Dad, but I love ballet."</em></p>
              <p><em>"Son, you embarrass me. why don't you just be a good man and study medicine. you will have money and respect."</em></p>
              <p>I agree we should give weight to our parents wishes. But when they are so obviously wrong in cases like these. How can you comply?</p>
              <p>Be it about anything. If i do not know, I will follow my parents. If I am not sure, I will follow my parents. If I am sure, I will give my parents the benefit of the doubt. But now I am 100% sure, therefore my position cannot be compromised.</p>
              <p>In my father's shoes, he feels that all this is an embarrassment to him. I know it.</p>
              <p>If I were in his shoes, I'd tell the boy to learn all he can about Islam. Follow her family to fast. To make sure he understands what his life would become if he were to convert. I would then give him my blessings. For he is my son, he is not me.</p>
              <p>I will try my best now to get them to like my girlfren. But if they remain hostile. i can only hope one day they can find in themselves the heart to forgive.</p>

              <p>I somewhat could understand your situation... My dad's a chinese and my mum's a malay... Lucky for you, the girls family could accept you...</p>
              <p>For my parents, when they started dating, both sides of the family rejected to this idea.. I guess it was because of the mindset during that time,,,</p>
              <p>From what my parents told me, they had lots of obstacles... From my mum's side, they tried to have an arranged marriage for my mum... But she strongly refuse... My dad side, his parents gave him the silent treatment...  This was when they were just dating...</p>
              <p>When they really got serious, my dad came to my maternal grandparents house to ask for my mum's hand of marriage,.. <span style="color: #ff0000;">He didnt tell me the full details on this one</span>...</p>
              <p>When they got married, my dad <span style="color: #ff0000;">convert to Islam</span> BTW, my mum side was beginning to accept him...  My paternal grandparents were still cold to him... Until my eldest brother was born...</p>
              <p>About the name, no need to worry... <span style="color: #ff0000;">I have a muslim name</span> with my fathers surname in front...</p>
              <p>Even if your parents say that they will disregard you as the eldest son, they actually wont... Even if the put it in action, in their heart, you are still they eldest... Just be patient and be strong... You could try and bring home your GF to intro to you parents.. But they will be very cold at 1st... Your GF must really learn how to impress them and be strong...</p>

              <p>It might soften the blow. Parents, the traditional ones, usually want someone in the family to carry on the family name. So if he has siblings and he converts to Islam, at least the parents can still rely on the other sons in the family so the effect, although will still be disastrous, but won't be as bad as if TS is the only son in the family...</p>
              <p>Anyway, your parents are two individuals, you can do nothing much to change their feelings about you dating a Malay girl if they are bent on going against the relationship. So for now just go out with her per normal and try to turn a deaf ear to whatever your parents are saying. Since you say you have no plans to think about marriage yet, then just live in the moment for now...</p>

              <p>religion is always a bone of contention.....many chinese families will also have issues with their children's spouse if they are christians...let alone muslims, the main reason is that they feel the children can no longer participate with them on special occassions.....even if you are present but do not consume the food, your parents will feel slighted...</p>
              <p>the fact that you've gone halal is a sign that you are prepared to convert when it comes...actually, there's no reason why you should abstain from pork at this stage since you are just only dating.....parents of sons are particularly edgy because it's quite common that wives get their way when it comes to relationship tug of war....</p>
              <p>enjoy your bacon, show your parents they're not losing you but i can tell you for now should you marry, they will not attend and it will take probably years and grandkids for them to come to terms......</p>

              <p><br>Hi R3D3V1L,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I know of a couple. Chinese husband, Indian wife. Started off as a young punk on a scrambler. Problems with his gf's family as you know, Indians are generally more conservative.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Today, this Chinese husband aged younger than 40 is estimated to be worth somewhere between 7~10Mil. One of his cars is a Lamborghini Gallardo, stays in his own bungalow. Has 2 children with his wife. He and his wife runs multi-businesses. The husband employs his brother in law and pays him pretty well. They were interviewed on CNA 2 years ago and have come to inspire people. I recalled the man said "Do what you do best."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With such a charismatic man of extraordinary leadership, no wonder his in-laws sang his praises on CNA.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You will not be judged with where you come from. Instead you will be judged by the content of your character &amp; your achievements. As this is the only factor that will last the weather.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Looking at the skin colour is only temporarily. If your gf is a good girl who truly cares for you, I think she is a gem compared to a materialistic girl of the same ethnic group.</p>
