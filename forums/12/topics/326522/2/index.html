              <p>Rednano:</p>
              <p>That is a misconception, I am allowed to choose my own name. But the point is, I'm not about to burn bridges here. If it happens, it's cos my parents burnt the bridge on their side =(</p>
              <p>A name should be respectable and meaningful that's all. If its a legacy I wish to pass down, I'd make sure I've done something great in my life that my future generations will remember. Not just cos "I'm called Tan cos some old guy who died 100 years ago was called Tan". That was what I meant by the vainity of attaching too much value to surnames. It makes people who think this way perfer sons to daughters. But its just my thinking which I apply to myself only. If you value tradition I respect that.</p>
              <p>The thing is, I love my girl so I'm not gonna break up, much less for the reasons my parents already given me. As much as they are my parents, I cannot obey if they tell me not to date a malay or indian or whatever. It's not just a preference for chinese which I am fine; It's the rejection of others purely because of their race which I am against. If I follow my parents wishes, I will feel like I'm a "crap bag" for what I've done.</p>
              <p>I'm young. So? Cannot have malay girlfren?</p>
              <p>I appologise for the bluntness of the line above but I'm quite shag now to think of a nice way to phrase it. You don't suddenly get married what. Of course must start dating first. I'm complaining my parents object to me being with my girlfren. Not complaining that my parents "don't allow" me to marry her. Although that would be a terrible scenario.</p>
              <p>Thanks for the heads up. I've already considered the points you listed long ago. If I love her enough to marry her it won't be a problem. But its for the future to decide, not the biased views of my parents. Que sera sera.</p>

              <p>what's up with this que sera sera thingy.. my friend with a malay bf also put this as her nick...( I know it meant whatever will be will be)</p>
              <p>I think rednano meant you're still 23, career and everything else still just taking off or what.. so marriage or commitment might be a bit too early to say.. how long have you been with this girl?</p>
              <p>if you have truly made up your mind, maybe you should just go your way.. irregardless of what will come since you have already think of those points so long ago.. nothing we asked to know more about the situation will help anyway?</p>

              <p>Maybe find out your parents concerns and maybe ask them to be logical.</p>
              <p>Would they prefer their son to be with a Chinese girl though her charc is not good but just because she is Chinese than a Muslim girl of good charc.</p>

              <p>I somewhat could understand your situation... My dad's a chinese and my mum's a malay... Lucky for you, the girls family could accept you...</p>
              <p>For my parents, when they started dating, both sides of the family rejected to this idea.. I guess it was because of the mindset during that time,,,</p>
              <p>From what my parents told me, they had lots of obstacles... From my mum's side, they tried to have an arranged marriage for my mum... But she strongly refuse... My dad side, his parents gave him the silent treatment...  This was when they were just dating...</p>
              <p>When they really got serious, my dad came to my maternal grandparents house to ask for my mum's hand of marriage,.. He didnt tell me the full details on this one...</p>
              <p>When they got married, my dad convert to Islam BTW, my mum side was beginning to accept him...  My paternal grandparents were still cold to him... Until my eldest brother was born...</p>
              <p>About the name, no need to worry... I have a muslim name with my fathers surname in front...</p>
              <p>Even if your parents say that they will disregard you as the eldest son, they actually wont... Even if the put it in action, in their heart, you are still they eldest... Just be patient and be strong... You could try and bring home your GF to intro to you parents.. But they will be very cold at 1st... Your GF must really learn how to impress them and be strong...</p>

              <p>TS,</p>
              <p>I somewhat could understand your situation... My dad's a chinese
              and my mum's a malay... Lucky for you, the girls family could
              accept you...</p>
              <p>For my parents, when they started dating, both sides of the
              family rejected to this idea.. I guess it was because of the
              mindset during that time,,,</p>
              <p>From what my parents told me, they had lots of obstacles... From
              my mum's side, they tried to have an arranged marriage for my
              mum... But she strongly refuse... My dad side, his parents gave him
              the silent treatment...  This was when they were just
              dating...</p>
              <p>When they really got serious, my dad came to my maternal
              grandparents house to ask for my mum's hand of marriage,.. He didnt
              tell me the full details on this one...</p>
              <p>When they got married, my dad convert to Islam BTW, my mum side
              was beginning to accept him...  My paternal grandparents were
              still cold to him... Until my eldest brother was born...</p>
              <p>About the name, no need to worry... I have a muslim name with my
              fathers surname in front...</p>
              <p>Even if your parents say that they will disregard you as the
              eldest son, they actually wont... Even if the put it in action, in
              their heart, you are still they eldest... Just be patient and be
              strong... You could try and bring home your GF to intro to you
              parents.. But they will be very cold at 1st... Your GF must really
              learn how to impress them and be strong...</p>

              <p>would like to share some experiences.. i am chinese and have dated a malay before..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>that time still young so like not yet serious at all. i did not tell my parents but his family object like crazy. even got once the boy's mother call my house ask to speak to my parents and want to tell them to stop me from seeing their son. luckily it was my brother who picked up the phone! my brother is really nice to me and he did not tell my parents but just talked to me ask me to think about things carefully.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>eventually we broke up not but it was not because of any family pressure. anyway if you are in a serious relationship with a malay you must be prepared that if you are to get married. you will have to convert to muslim. this is the main reason why most parents cannot accept - the change in religion is too drastic. are you prepared to do that? if you are considering a long term relationship then you must really think about this carefully and find out more information (maybe from the girl) about what it means to convert. the girl won't be allowed to marry a non-muslim (in some countries you can be put to death if you want to change your religion from Muslim to others!).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have a girl friend who converted to muslim and eloped with her malay boyfriend and got married because her parents object to it. After a few years, she has 2 boys and her family has gotten used to the whole thing and accepted her again. But of course relationship is not the same as before, you would have to be prepared for this too.</p>
