              <p>Hmm, have you thought about switching to her religion? And is her family very into their religion? Cos if they are, you might need to convert to become a Muslim before you can marry her.</p>

              <p>That's cos they have a lot at stake. Most parents are not so open-minded as to allow their son, esp their first son to switch religion just like that. Plus the religion is one which is very different from the one they are currently worshipping and will cause many restrictions in the future. You might not mind the restrictions, but your parents might.</p>
              <p>So in the end it all boils down to how much you think this is worth it. Is it worth sacrificing the relationship with your family members to have a relationship with this girl?</p>

              cross marriages are so common now, judging one by colour is so superficial. i have to say your family is definately biased. they would rather put up with the previous one just cuz shes chinese? absurd!
              
              so u have my support. im not asking you to fall out with ur family cuz they have their reasons for doing so (even if i dont agree). give your relationship more time. time to confirm if the girl is for you, and most importantly for your family to accept her.
              
              good luck!

              <p>Erm, what is at stake is your relationship with your parents. They are refusing to accept someone who is of a different religion into the family. Yes, it is biased and prejudiced but it is never easy to accept someone who is not like us to become one of us.</p>

              <p>Assure your parents that you still love them and explain truthfully to them why you need their approval.</p>
              <p>If you are serious about this girl, then please explain to your parents that even though their disapproval might eventually cause the two of you to breakup. Let them know that you will still feel regret and sad over her even after when your parents both leaves you in the future.</p>
              <p>You could invite her parents to have dinner with yours if you're keen on her. It's easier to convince your parents with her parents. Let them meet up and go for a good dinner, your treat of course lor. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>cross marriages are so common now, judging one by colour is so superficial. i have to say your family is definately biased. they would rather put up with the previous one just cuz shes chinese? absurd!</p>
              <p>so u have my support. im not asking you to fall out with ur family cuz they have their reasons for doing so (even if i dont agree). give your relationship more time. time to confirm if the girl is for you, and most importantly for your family to accept her.</p>
