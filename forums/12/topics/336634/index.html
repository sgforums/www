              <p>how would you know if a guy likes you?</p>
              <p>I have been friends with a guy I know for a long time. We weren't exclusive or anything. Just friends that sometimes meet.</p>
              <p>Recently, when I went out with him, He's kind of different. He tends to be very competitve with me. I want to qualify for something, he also wants to do the same when initially, he wasn't interested.</p>
              <p>And when I suggested that I was a masochist, he would suggest that he likes to see suffering and pain in others. When I said that I am extraordinary and I only look at extraordinary guys, he was kind of excited and kept repeating that he is an extraordinary guy that looks for an extraordinary girl. At the movies, he would at times turn and look at me, as if I didnt see.</p>
              <p>When we look at clothings on the manakins, I would suggest that the clothing is my style, he would say, "My wife will wear this.". This was said everytime I commented on a certain garment. Except for the last when he suggested a different clothing that I disliked, he said something like,"Who cares if you're a hot bitch".</p>
              <p>When I see and commented on other guys physical appearence as macho or handsome and muscular as attractive, he would either say "ee", or "The media has painted an .... ideal of a person". And would get a little defensive.</p>
              <p>I am not aware if his actions are voluntary or involuntary.</p>
              <p>What does this mean? Does he like me or something? BTW, he tends to come into this forum, therefore some detailed info are not posted. It's not just me, but my sis noticed his changed character too.</p>
