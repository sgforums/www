Which makes this new relationship a rebound? a float? back tyre? substitute?<br><br>I have a roommate who spent 5 years just to get over her first love. It's a matter of attitude. I have 14 suggestions for you to get over your first love, if you are willing to.<br><br>1st) Write a goodbye letter. Make it a real good one. Highlight your attributes and his flaws. Be sure to tell him how much better life has become without him.<br>Keep this letter, don't send it, you will want to check back at the end of your journey and see how truthful your feelings were at that time of such pain.<br><br>2nd) Make a list of all the things he will miss about you. E.g. your sparkling smile, quick wit, oatmeal raisin cookies, sexual prowess, etc..<br><br>3rd) Go to Triumph and drop a wad of cash on some brand new single girl undies. Nothing makes a girl feel better than knowing she looks good "under there". Go through your drawer and get rid of all the undies he loved, especially those he has gave you. If he likes lacy red hot G-string, buy yourself some white cotton thongs.<br><br>4th) Make a list of things you can do this week to help you feel good fast. E.g An "ALL-GIRLS ONLY" weekend, doing nothing but shopping, eating and bashing guys. Take a class and learn how to pole dance. Take a trip to a sex shop and check out all the new gadgets. Believe me, anything you purchase will more than pay for itself within a week.<br><br>5th) Make a list of every argument you two had and why you were right everytime. Like you know, the time he wanted to go to his mother's for Mother's Day and you wanted to hit the new, hot club in town. Imagine, choosing his mother over dancing with you! What a momma's boy!<br><br>6th) Call those girlfriends you have neglected during the relationship and catch up on their lives. Avoid talking about your ex-bf, diets, debt or how bad life is. Keep it upbeat and make fun plans for the future.<br><br>7th) Buy yourself something frivolous, anything impulsive and over-priced. Something you know he would roll his eyes at and consider a waste of $$.<br><br>8th) Burn yourself a new CD to listen to. Make sure it is filled with songs that empower you, songs like "I will love again", "Greyhound you're gone", "I will move on", etc...<br><br>9th) Make a list of all the red flags you missed in the relationship. Stuff like how all his ex-gfs were responsible for the breakups. The fool just couldn't take responsibility, could he? How about how he was always late for a date and always managed to turn it around and blame it on you somehow?<br><br>10th) Why not a cold beer straight out of the bottle? Since it was his opinion that a real lady would never drink beer from the bottle.<br><br>11th) Find any Tee-shirt or boxer shorts he might left behind and tear them into rags. Take the rags, some buttons, feathers, strings, etc.. and make up into a VOODOO DOLL. Make it as ugly as possible! Then, give it a goood, hard poke every time you think of him.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>12th) Find a quiet place in your home to create an alter for yourself, to go alone and collect your thoughts and thanks can be given for the chance to start fresh. Grab a table or shoebox and cover it with lacy scarf, top it with candles and photos of yourself only, with aromatherapy and accessorize with your favourite jewelleries. Sit at your alter daily and mediate on what you want your life to be. Imagine a full rewarding life without the jerk.<br><br>13th) Host a party! or even better, a sex toy party. Get your girlfriends together and put on a little raunchy attitude.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>14th) Make a list of top 10 "must haves", of your next boyfriend. Things like financial viability, big hands and feet, a vacation home in the island, short and plump, etc...just make sure he is worth your time and effort the next time around.<br><br>I'm sure you are getting the idea, aint you? That's how I took 1 month to get over my first love. It was short but fun. After that month, I went back work with a different attitude. Keep your hands busy so as to tame your thoughts; happiness is a state of mind.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Good Luck!</div>

Would that make you happy?<br><br>If you love someone and that person also love you... But marrying her would mean a whole lot of hell from her family and relatives.. Would that make you very happy?<br><br>If you love someone and marrying her would means that you need to give up on your career plans or perhaps some vital goals of yours in life... Would you necessarily be genuinely happy...?<br><br><span style="color: red;">'Always better ways' like what....?</span></div></blockquote>Loving someone doesn't really means the person has to love you back. It is called "one-sided", but I prefer calling "unconditional love". Yes I may not be as happy as I could be if she reciprocate, but I am happy simply knowing she is happy, whether she is with me or not.<br><br>If marrying her means a whole lot of hell from her family side means I would not be happy. But I marry her, not her family. Her family may give hell to me but I am prepared for it. If I am not prepared for this, I shldn't have gotten married in the 1st place, right?<br><br>Sometime marrying someone, there are sacrifices to be made. And yes many things I can do when I am single would have to be put aside. But dis only comes into account I have acknowledged what I has to sacrifice if I go into the vows of matrimony with her.<br><br>AND it will be better if we both understand each other well before the discussion of marriage comes in. Its when we know each other's strengths and weaknesses, likes and dislikes, habits, hobbies, quirks, behaviours, lifestyle, beliefs, family, friends, etc, etc, then we decide if we are able to bring our relationship to another level: which is marriage and living together and many other things.<br><br>That is why I prefer not to jump into the "love wagon" without knowing the person well. What if I jumped in and found out she has many things I found it hard to live with? What if she found out I have things she cannot agree upon? In the end there are so many things we cannot agree on, we have to break up? Sorry, I rather not go into a relationship than going into one and end up breaking her heart and mine.<br><br>I know I cannot answer your question in red but I try my best to say it within my limited capabilities.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Loving someone is a hard thing to do. Can you love the people whom you hated? Can you love the people who are so good at backstabbing or havoc wrecking? Can you love people for who they are and what they can be capable of as a person in the future? Can you love someone knowing you do not get anything much for what you give? I can't do all those, but I am trying my best though.</span>  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>I know all these seems like "wah" or "ooooh", and it may be like I am talking big.
