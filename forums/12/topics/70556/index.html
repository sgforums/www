            <div class='col-md body'>Hi just a suggestion for you. Go and buy this brand of skincare products - <strong>Eucerin</strong> from Guardian Pharmacy. The range consists of face wash, skin tonic solution and a cream. It contains lactic acid and is targeted at acne bacteria. Quite cheap. Less then $20 for each product. Btw it is dermatogist tested, and thus is kind to even sensitive skin. Try it!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>NSC only 4-5 times in 6 years? *raises eyebrow*<br><br>Shouldn't it be a regular affair?<br><br>I had acne problem also, but I went to NSC when I was 15, and it's gotten better since, even though the problem came back once after I stopped going there.<br><br>My advice is, continue going to the NSC or some more reputable clinic. Don't rely on commercial products because you won't know if they're too harsh on your skin. Not even Neutrogena ok. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Just go and see the doctor...<br><br>Normally to treat acne, the more severe cases will need antibiotics or some other form of medicine to be consumed, anti-bacterial facial wash and topical cream.<br><br>For me what I use is Cleanz from the NSC, 2.5 Benzoyl Peroxide from Stiefel Labs and uhhh. Bacterim <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Works pretty fine for me! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>And also remember to take lots of vitamins. I took Redoxon two tablets a day... the Vitamin C with zinc one. 2 tablets = 1000mg. I think that helped alot cos a while after I stopped taking those vit C tablets, the improvement kinda slowed down significantly.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I also got this problem in my secondary school days and it occurred every month and I am a girl..... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> There was even a few times that my face swelled so bad, that I could not even open my eyes.<br><br>Later, the doctor suggested that I take Vit C pills. and if u believe in Chinese Medicine, go and see a sinseh from Eu Yang Sen. I took a few dose of Chinese Herbal Brew to purge the toxins from my body (very bitter).  Don't know if it was the Vit C pills or the herbal brew or a combination of both.....the prob lessened.....now happily married with a handsome husband....still continue with Vit C pills now.<br><br>Don't wash ur face too much.  Wash with cleanser twice a day, dont scrub...gently massage face with foam and finger tips, splash off water and dab dry.  In between wash with water only, unless very dirty (and dab dry...don't rub, it spreads the bacteria).  If got time, steam face once a month and do a mask (clay mask good for deep cleasing and oily face). If u really want to squeeze pimples, must steam face first and dab the sore with cotton soaked anti-bacterial solution, for those really big acne which does not seem to shrink, but must ensure got head already.</div>
