            <div class='col-md body'>This is the first woman i truly felt for at my age. Although this is not my first time having an infatuation on a woman, it was the first time i felt that i truly liked someone.<br><br>I never had experience with this kind of things, and now i am a little confused.<br><br>There's this girl whom i met in SIM. We are doing the same BA and currently is in the same class for 3 semester straight already.<br><br>At first i didnt notice her, until i she needed help with her work and i happened to be the one nearest to her. Our chats started gradually, and its usually online chatting at first. From just normal friendly chats to teasing each other and playing yahoo games together. We can spend up to 4/5 hours playing games during weekend nights, and although sometimes minimal conversation was exchanged, i liked the company.<br><br>One thing i really could not comprehend was, our person to person interaction was rather not "normal".<br><br>She would not look into my eyes when we speak. Sometime when she past by me, she would give me a quick glance and then walk away. When we have conversations, she would always end it with, "OK...." "whatever...." etc etc...<br><br>I gave her flowers before, she sms-ed me immediately and told me she love it and even took pictures of it and showed me on msn. I bought her gifts when i saw some small nice items which i felt she might like and she liked those too.<br><br>She would sms me things like "Hey i am bored..." and things as such.<br><br>Even though we are in the same room, we would not speak to each other sometimes.<br><br>I am a very quiet person and i could say i am pretty introverted. I dont know if she finds it weird because, sometimes when i was sitting at the cafeteria alone, when she walks past with one of her good friend in sch, both of them would say "Hi" to me, but laugh as though i've got something stuck on my face or something is wrong with me.<br><br>Recently i just found out that a guy in class for a crush on her too.<br>Coz once when i was walking with her to the train station (which is real seldom), she say her friend and her friend mention the guy's name and gave a cheeky smile.<br><br>The guy always sits near to her and chats alot with her.<br>Alright i've got to admit, that guy is a really extroverted guy and strikes up conversation very easily.<br>I felt that i've lost, or i would soon.<br><br>I want to go further and would be willing to open myself up more and do things like that, but i just cant comprehend her...<br><br>Hope the people here can give their views... thanks<br></div>

Our chats started gradually, and its usually online chatting at first. From just normal friendly chats to teasing each other and playing yahoo games together. We can spend up to 4/5 hours playing games during weekend nights, and although sometimes minimal conversation was exchanged, i liked the company.<br><br>One thing i really could not comprehend was, our person to person interaction was rather not "normal".<br><br>She would not look into my eyes when we speak. Sometime when she past by me, she would give me a quick glance and then walk away. When we have conversations, she would always end it with, "OK...." "whatever...." etc etc...<br><br>I gave her flowers before, she sms-ed me immediately and told me she love it and even took pictures of it and showed me on msn. I bought her gifts when i saw some small nice items which i felt she might like and she liked those too.<br><br>She would sms me things like "Hey i am bored..." and things as such.<br><br>Even though we are in the same room, we would not speak to each other sometimes.<br><br>I am a very quiet person and i could say i am pretty introverted. I dont know if she finds it weird because, sometimes when i was sitting at the cafeteria alone, when she walks past with one of her good friend in sch, both of them would say "Hi" to me, but laugh as though i've got something stuck on my face or something is wrong with me.<br><br>Recently i just found out that a guy in class for a crush on her too.<br>Coz once when i was walking with her to the train station (which is real seldom), she say her friend and her friend mention the guy's name and gave a cheeky smile.<br><br>The guy always sits near to her and chats alot with her.<br>Alright i've got to admit, that guy is a really extroverted guy and strikes up conversation very easily.<br>I felt that i've lost, or i would soon.<br><br>I want to go further and would be willing to open myself up more and do things like that, but i just cant comprehend her...<br><br>Hope the people here can give their views... thanks<br></div></blockquote>BA? Business Adminstration from RMIT ah? SIM? Now sem 5 liao right? Exam coming soon, jia you ah.<br><br>Anyway, just to inform u, its normal nowadays about what u termed "abnormal" in terms of person to person interaction. There's this gal I like, we can chat everything and anything under the sun on MSN. But when come to class time, we both can don't speak to each other for hours. Blame it on technology la. It allows people 2 communicate easier online but retard our human-to-human interaction.<br><br>From what I see, u are soon falling into her category of "friends" if u don't admit to her how u feel. Girls can sms anyone and tell them "I'm bored". Not necessarily to people they like ONLY. And judging from her friend's reaction towards u, i dare say she and her friends suspect that u like her already. If she never hint u anything to indicate that she don't like u, then u stand a chance.<br><br>You have not even gone to war yet, and all u can say is u think u are going to lose? Then indeed u are gonna lose. Because the fact is, it has nothing to do with being introvert or extrovert, its all about sincerity towards the girl. If u make the girl feel ur sincerity, feel that u really love her, ur character/personality would not be the main factor anymore. Don't let this thing drag on. Tell her how u feel, and see how it goes. Get an answer so that both of u can move on. If u having exam soon, then wait until after exam k? Gd luck!!</div>
