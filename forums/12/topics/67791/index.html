            <div class='col-md body'>heya kid..5 mths and you've seen ups and downs? i spent 6 mths with my ex and not a single quarrel and argument.. erally honeymoon for 6 mths.. but at the end of the day.. she's my ex...<br><br>what i've gotta say is...dun devote yourself so quickly to a girl.. i hear u say u love her.. do you know what that means? i bet no one really know what it means until you feel it. I'm not sayin you are NOT feeling it, if u do.. you're really lucky and fortunate to feel it at that age.<br><br>well about your problem, firstly.. girls hate jealous boyfriends.. esp since she's 13, she'll be looking at every single guy that goes by and what are u going to do? get jealous everytime? slap her? hit her? no right? same for you..dun lie i'm a guy too and i can tell u now.. if i ever get married, i'll still be checking out every pretty young thing that walks by.<br><br>its human nature and you can't help it. Sadly, being jealous is also human nature... so how like that? i tell u.. have a open heart.. dun be so sensitive.. everytime she does something that you'll get upset and sensitive about, jus go do something else.. for me.. when my(ex) gal goes clubbing(without me of course) and comes home feeling high(goodness knows what she did with who) esp after i told her not to come home to late..(she comes back at 5...) i'd spend the whole day playin cs and ignoring her.. its my way of sayin "i'm pissed but i'm not gonna direct it at you"<br><br>i loved her.. and i knew being upset with her was not gonna solve anything.. anyway.. by the time i finished playin.. it'll be at night.. then i'll meet her and we'll kiss and make up.. so u see.. i was pissed but i didn't direct it at her.. i took it out on something else..if u dun play games, go for a jog/swim get fitter build up your bod so that girls will fall at your feet.. and at the end of the day.. your gal wil have to think.. "hey maybe i hurt him as well" and since u didn't take it out on her.. she's gonna be awed by your matureness and then she wouldn bother abt the other small boys that surround her.. sounds good yah??</div>
