I understand you feel alot for her etc .... but ask yourself, do you seriously think she will definately tie herself down to you at the age of 14 ??? Are you certain she won;t wanna explore other pastures before settling down...?? She has a long way more to go in growing up so do you ..... the only reason why most people are telling you think is coz it's a stage we had all been through ....... good luck ...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

I don't expect you to be philosophical at that point of age and know alot of about love.

Dun let your emotions rule you, emotions are not logical. I understand you feel for her deeply, but come to think about it, i mean, to be realistic, is she the one you looking for? Or rather, are you the one she's looking for? Yesh, both of you may have memorable times together, and not to mention sad ones. But this is just part and parcel of life. Who noes, maybe u'll find one when u graduate in about a yr's time or two.<br><br>Dun brood over it. Let nature takes its course. Love will find it's way to you.</div>
