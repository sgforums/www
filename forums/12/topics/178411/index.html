I feel so weird, since I've not made an advances or suggest to date her at all.<br><br>A few days ago, I just happened to see her online after many months, so I messaged her usual thing like "Hello! how have you been?" Then I concluded almost immediately with "Busy at work now. Talk to you again if got chance."<br><br>Then yesterday and today, the moment I go online, she immediately goes offline. I thought yesterday was co-incidental, but today the same thing happens. When I just got online, she was online but within 2 seconds, she was offline.<br><br>I wonder if she's hyper-sensitive and think I will make advances towards her kind of thing, that's why she's trying to avoid me. Which i will then feel is funny, since I've not done anything to suggest that. Or is she afraid that I'll try to date her out today since she's single?<br><br>Woman, unfathomable...</div></blockquote>the fact is u are not close to her at all.<br><br>dun bother unless u really have feelings for her.<br><br>besides if she doesn't want to talk to u, why should u let a woman to affect u so much? there are so many women out there. assuming what u said is true, then she is not worth being ur friend at all. She assumes too much and that's her problem.<br><br>Get urself some self-respect and dun think abt her, dude.</div>
