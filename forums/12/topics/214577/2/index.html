Change the topic or get out of there. Say you want to go toilet, something like that. Arguing is bad for r/s.<br><br>Anyway, to be fair: don't control her too much.

From my experiences, the guy should not let the girl know he is upset whatever. That shows he is not in control meaning he is upset easily. A great guy must learn not to take things personally. Just let her know he will not tolerate those stupid things. That's all. Avoid any forms of argument. And just withdraw.<br><br>Hope it helps.</div>

She obviously gives no thought to your feelings and remain close to other guys. With relationships, it always pays to be cautious. This is as you never know when feelings might grow. It is always best to pay it safe and maintain a distance with the other sex. Friends ok, but not get too close.<br><br>You made the right choice by leaving her.<br><br>Also, I know it hurts, especially your ego. Just don't make the mistake of trying to be with her again just to salvage your ego. Just eat it and move on. It is painful, but know that you will be stronger after this episode.<br><br>I rather not have friends like her, and that 'godbrother' is a bastard by trying to ruin your relationship with her. I see all this 'godbrother'/'godsister' nonsense as a means of infatuation between 2 parties. Best to avoid such nonsense.<br><br>It is obvious that this girl has yet to be matured, and you are 100% better off without her. You got a whole life in front of you to look forward too. No need to cry over goods that is not worth it.</div></blockquote>Don't blame the girl for everything, you can see that both have been at fault where this relationship is concerned. And if you ask me, he only has himself to blame now that she is accepting her godbrother. At least he's there for her and providing support for her, which is more than what I can say for the threadstarter. He broke up with her and left her alone.<br><br>Ultimately I believe this relationship is not doing good for either the guy or the girl. They both should move on and at least the girl has done so.</div>

If she really loves you, she would be as broken hearted as you are and start doing some self reflection and realise that that fiance joke is, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">n.o.t f.u.n.n.y</span> at all.<br><br>Get on with your life.... I won't ask you to forget her now coz it's in the mind... Just do your own stuff and spend more time with friends and family... You may be rolling your eyes when you hear me say," Time will heal..." But trust me, it really does...</div></blockquote>I seriously don't think the fiance joke was funny or a good idea to begin with. But rather than just blame the girl for everything, I don't think their relationship was a bed of roses to being with.<br><br>I feel the fiance incident was more like a last straw kind of thing, so if it wasn't this, it would be something else. Better 5 mths than 5 years or more. It's not like I know the full picture of their relationship, but it's kind of the feel I kind of get from reading his posts about the relationship.<br><br>Just my own opinion but maybe it was never meant to be.</div>
