            <div class='col-md body'>I do agree the circumstances are not conducive for yourself to stay with this girl. She obviously gives no thought to your feelings and remain close to other guys. With relationships, it always pays to be cautious. This is as you never know when feelings might grow. It is always best to pay it safe and maintain a distance with the other sex. Friends ok, but not get too close.<br><br>You made the right choice by leaving her.<br><br>Also, I know it hurts, especially your ego. Just don't make the mistake of trying to be with her again just to salvage your ego. Just eat it and move on. It is painful, but know that you will be stronger after this episode.<br><br>I rather not have friends like her, and that 'godbrother' is a bastard by trying to ruin your relationship with her. I see all this 'godbrother'/'godsister' nonsense as a means of infatuation between 2 parties. Best to avoid such nonsense.<br><br>It is obvious that this girl has yet to be matured, and you are 100% better off without her. You got a whole life in front of you to look forward too. No need to cry over goods that is not worth it.</div>

You assume too much and get too possessive. You need to change yourself. Possessiveness and jealousy are undesirable traits. You let a third party easily influence the quality of the r/s so you are being weak. You should remain cool like everything is under your control.<br><br>You are the one who broke up with her so don't expect her to give you time again. Girls have ego also you know.<br><br>Move on.</div>

Where is the security?<br><br>Honestly dude, think carefully before you initiate break up.  And once you have broken up, don't look back unless there are very valid reasons, like the problems leadin to the break up which cannot be resolved in the past, can be resolved now.<br></div>
