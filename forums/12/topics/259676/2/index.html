I no longer behave jerky when i meet girls liao. But rather i treat them like normal friend. Furthermore, I will always convince myself that when a girl treats me nicely is because we are friends. Not like in past, i will think about y she does this or that, does she likes me? Well just share with u this incident,  a female friend of mine got her ankle sprained when playing catching (sec sch days u know). Then, she asks me to help her remedy her pain, then i touch her ankle twist here and there and ask her pain a not. If u are a sec 4 guy, what will u think? to a guy, when we touch a girl ankle, we are like WTH y u ask me to remedy y not ask a girl, u must be liking me so that i can touch ur ankle, right? But to a girl, they are like i need ur help and can please help.<br><br><strong>just because u are rejected then u have no courage to express ur like..<br>Are u a guy?? </strong><br><br>I am a guy but i am also a human, i need time to recover. Some more, i got pride one also. Ok if u say i cannot let go my ego. But.... is just a man thing, dun know how to explain.<br><br><strong>just dun lose faith ! u must jia you and find the person u like and hope to be with!</strong><br><br>I will try  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br><strong>I see that u fall in love quite easy and have a great imagination too!</strong><br><br>I can't help but agree with u more.<br><br><strong>Sometime , the girls wanted to be friend with you! </strong><br><br>In the past, i will think is impossible.

So, if i feel that i really like a girl, i will try to be her friend first. Like what Yunhaier says: you find yourself hastily falling in love with whoever that treats you nicely, you are just going to spoil the broth even if there's only one cook.

And jojobeach, i still cannot help but can u explain this to me:" I get it that you like pretty girls. Would you accept an average plain Jane?"

I know there are others out there who suffer much worse fate than me (after reading through the AA forum) but i am starting to feel lethargic about relationship. I admit i get attracted to pretty girls easily but because of my look and past experience, I always try to refrain myself from liking them. To prevent them from being kind to me which always give me false hope, i will act like a jerk to them but not to the extent that i am so resentful (still can be normal friend that kind). The 3 confessions i made to the girls is because they are just being nice to me, then i thought they like me (but i also like them too la). Now i am going to UNI soon, i am wondering i should go for the orientation cos i hear from my senior that you will get to know a lot of people there, especially chio bu. I am scared of falling in love again, i rather to be single than to be hurted again. Now that i am no longer feeling much for girl (dun say i gay, i hate them to the core, i rather be a virgin till i die than to be a gay), i am reverting back to my true self now (no longer acting like a jerk) as i dun like to wear a mask if i can afford to.
