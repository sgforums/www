I know there are others out there who suffer much worse fate than me (after reading through the AA forum) but i am starting to feel lethargic about relationship. I admit i get attracted to pretty girls easily but because of my look and past experience, I always try to refrain myself from liking them. To prevent them from being kind to me which always give me false hope, i will act like a jerk to them but not to the extent that i am so resentful (still can be normal friend that kind). The 3 confessions i made to the girls is because they are just being nice to me, then i thought they like me (but i also like them too la). Now i am going to UNI soon, i am wondering i should go for the orientation cos i hear from my senior that you will get to know a lot of people there, especially chio bu.

            <div class='col-md body'>hi jojobeach, thanks for your advice the last time. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br>Ya as for the filial piety, non-tomboyish and trust i think i put it in a too general way. please allow me to explain further.<br><br>Being filial is not equivalent to everything also must consult parents. my understanding of filial piety is that we, as children, must know how to repay our parent for what they have done for us. For my case, i have a loving parent that encourage me when i am down and cares for me when i am in danger. Therefore, forsaking my parent for a girl is a big NO NO. But if i know my gf is filial then i can be quite sure that she won't tell me to forsake my parent.<br><br>to me, non-tomboyish is to behave like a lady that's all. i know of a girl who spikes her hair, then i was like OH MY GOSH.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> Though i know it is quite common now.<br><br>yes i agree trust needs to be earned. But the trust that i am refering to is dun be overly-suspicious. If she doubts me when i am just chit-chatting with a female colleague or friend, then should i doubt her when she talks to a guy friend? For me, i trust my girl wholeheartedly as long as she dun kiss other guy la. If ur other half behaves affectionately with the opposite sex, u can treat it as though it is nothing meh?</div>
