                              this is a summary of what you should know.<br><br>For those that do
                              not like reading "wall-of-text", just read the texts in
                              bold.<br><br>=========================================================<br><br><strong>Your
                              Higher Self is the ultimate coach.</strong><br><br><strong>Your Higher Self is
                              able to see all who you have,<br>all who you are now ,<br>and all who
                              you can be.</strong><br><br><strong>Due to this expanded perspective,<br>your
                              Higher self knows you more intimately than you know yourself.</strong><br><br><strong>With
                              such expanded awareness, <br>there are limitless possibilities of
                              what your Higher Self can do to assist you in resolving your
                              issues.</strong><br><br>Almost everything your Higher Self says is driven
                              by its desire to show you how to master creating your life.<br><br>Among
                              other things, you are here on Earth to master your skills in
                              creation. <br><br><strong>Your Higher Self has been with since you the

                              of time.</strong><br><br>Your Higher Self know you far better than you can
                              know yourself-simply because it is the totality of all
                              your-selves:<br>past<br>present<br>and future.<br><br><strong>Your Higher
                              Self knows all, sees all and has the greatest possible compassion for

                              is within the confine of the third density.<br><br>The fourth density
                              is where dreams, astral projections, or out-of-body experiences
                              occur.<br><br>The fifth density is where the Higher Selves live.<br><br>You
                              always have contact with your Higher Self, but it comes through more
                              clearly when you focus your intent upon bringing Spirit(Higher Self)
                              into your life.<br><br>Since your Higher Self is not limited by time
                              or space, <br>you can access the whole of your entire being, <br>that
                              is your past, present and future selves,<br>as well as all aspects of

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma,sans-serif;"><strong>My dear readers, please listen to me.</strong><br><br></span><span style="font-family: Tahoma,sans-serif;"><em>Since
                      the beginning of time on Earth, people of all ages, races and beliefs
                      have one thing in common - the search for true happiness.<br><br>If
                      they believe happiness is in the sea, they go to the sea.<br><br>If
                      they believe happiness is in the mountains, they go to the
                      mountains.<br><br>If they believe it is in the shopping malls, they
                      go on a shopping spree.<br><br>If they believe it is in the
                      nightclubs and bars, they go on a drinking spree.<br><br>If they
                      believe it is about being rich, they devote their lives to getting
                      money.<br><br>If they believe it is about being famous, they seek
                      with every means to fight their way to fame.<br><br>What all these
                      people find in common is that all the water, entertainments, money
                      and fame in the world cannot help them when they are confused, heart-broken,
                      depressed or in pain, that even a mountain of wealth and sensual
                      pleasures cannot fill the emptiness in their hearts. In fact, such
                      experiences produce short-lived pleasure which will inevitably lead
                      to stress and exhaustion.<br><br>Fortunately, all of us are blessed
                      with ability to produce self-sustaining love and happiness - this
                      kind of love and happiness that only we ourselves can produce are
                      completely independent of personal circumstances and external
                      factors. These kind of love and happiness lies within all of us, and
                      can be achieved through </em></span><span style="font-family: Tahoma,sans-serif;"><em><strong>meditation</strong></em></span><span style="font-family: Tahoma,sans-serif;"><em>.</em></span></p>

              <p>The connection is intermittent... <br> <br> My third-eye chakra is still closed. But I am able to feel the pressure 
                  on my forehead during this morning meditation practice. My estimate is 
                  that I will need one more month of meditation to open it before I can 
                  start exploring my past lives.
                  <br> <br> Personally, I have asked myself a lot of questions and I got a lot of 
                  answers. Also, I am thinking a lot more about the present and the future too.
                   
                  <br> <br> The future feels so beautiful and wonderful. There is so much I can do 
                  in the future which I cannot possibly do now due to physical 
                  limitations.<br> <br> Unfortunately, the present feels so .... problematic. I can never 
                  understand why it is so hard for people to see through the illusions of 
                  life. ... sigh... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="icon_confused.gif"></p>

              <p>I'm very happy for you that you're making good use of your 'inner full-powered antenna and over-hauled engine'. I'm sure you'll enjoy your self-discovery ahead, but do remember not to just think and careÂ for yourself. We're currently heading towards a "Service to Others"Â future that you saw, from the current "Service to Self" world.Â :)</p>
              <p>And, like I explained to you the other day, not everyone is meant/ready to understand in this lifetime, so just let Nature take its course.</p>
              <p>With regards to your closed third eye chakra, centre your awareness on your third eye when you meditate. It will take persistent effort before it can be fully opened. All the best! :)</p>

              <p>I've always thought that if the Big Bang theory were true (and it is widely accepted to be so), then we are all made of the same stuff. One wouldn't consider the different cells in their body to be separate from one another. As above, so below.</p>

              <p>Big Bang did happen, but modern scientists are not aware of what started it, and why it started. Many scientific theories on it by scientists are just hypothesised theories, as they really have no clue about the beginnings and its purpose. Science alone is a man-made concept, which has severe limitations.</p>
              <p>Everything and every being in the Universe is made of Energy. Only difference is their level of vibrational frequency, and of course, level of Consciousness they have gained, or capable of holding. He whoÂ knows how to control Energy can control his reality.</p>
