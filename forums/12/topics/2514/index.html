            <div class='col-md body'>I have seen lots of posts most of them coming from "Chit Chat" saying that its good to have many relationships before u eventually got married? Now how true is that? Does it really mean that u cannot have ur first love as ur wife? Is it true that we must gain experiences from many relationship before we really learn how to love?<br><br>My answer is no. First love or the subsquent relationship after that all have different feelings. The first love can be the one that has the person u are going to spend ur whole life with. Rite? We are borned knowing how to love another person. But this only will come very clearly when we get more matured in thinking. Perhaps at the age of 18 for guys and 17 for girls. At this age, we will really know how to love and to cherish what we have. Ur relationship will no longer be just having someone to accompany u or to boast to ur friends. It will be a relationship that u will really think of marriage and the future. And yes, it will definetely be more romantic.<br><br>However, I have seen some rare case where the couple know each other during their early teens and hit it off all the way to marriage. But that is very rare. I have gathered that most ppl will marry the person they are in love with in their late teens or early adulthood. Am I right to say that?<br><br>Please comment.

            <div class='col-md body'>I do agree that it is not necessary to have many relationship before marriage. Just that many are fated to have many relationship before marriage. If one were to have many relationships before marriage , will you still trust your gf or bf?<br>The reason why have many relationship is mainly because he/she does not know how to handle relationship or they simply want to flirt around only.Maybe most are not committed to one another. LAstly, they have not meet the right one.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey Vampire Lord!! U better stick to your Nuwa hor.....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Anyway, to answer your query, my answer is yes. Most people nowadays jump into a relationship with many reasons. Crush seems to be the most common. Of course that are people I know who were happily married to their first and only gf.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Sometimes couples break up due to conflicting interests which they discover at a later stage. Hence, many tries at a relationship is common. We cannot tell everything from a person just in a day. Right??  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't agree that you need many relationships before you can finally marry, I do believe in the first love marry one.... but I think it still comes down to fate and maturity...... comments??<br>I guess when I had my first r/s, I was only 15, not that mature, but at that time I really believed that I'll marry my gf, I guess after 1 and 1/2 years, we were beginning to feel the strain, well we had frenquent quarrals and I guess as what she said I did not treat her well enough and did not treasure her enough and now, everything is over.... *sign*....... but I guess it's lessons learnt and who knows if destiny permits, we may still be together...hmmmm<br>Anyway, all the best to you ppl out there...<br><br>------------------<br>Treasure And Be Grateful For What You Have Today<br>Coz When You Least Expected<br>Everything Be Taken Away From You</div>
