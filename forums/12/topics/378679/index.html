              <p>Hi all. I have an issue which I wish to discuss with you guys.</p>
              <p>Let me kick off with some brief description.</p>
              <p>I have a female friend, who's married and with 2 kids now. She's currently working in the sales line, but yet to be confirmed as she's still under probation.Her salary is not that high. She's around 20, and her husband is around 24.</p>
              <p>Her husband had affairs outside for a couple of years already. For the 1st couple of times, the husband asked for forgiveness. However the third time it happened, my friend, who can't take it anymore, wanted a divorce.</p>
              <p>Currently, her son is staying with her mother-in-law, and her daughter is with a nanny as she is unable to take care of them on her own. Her husband's family likes her son more than her daughter, so you can roughly know how the situation is like for her. e.g. if anything happens between the two of them, most likely they will only take care of the boy but not the girl.</p>
              <p>Since the third time the affairs started, her husband has not been going home, staying at the woman's place all these while, only going back to get stuffs once in awhile. He didn't even attend or celebrate their children's birthdays this year.</p>
              <p>At the early stages, her husband still gave her money for the children's expenses. But I heard from my friend, he recently told her he do not want to bother about them anymore.</p>
              <p>Now, her mother-in-law told her that she wanted to help my friend to take care of her daughter, which in one way is good because she need not spend money on the nanny anymore. However what I think is not good is, what if both of her children get too close with her husband's family? What if, after their divorce, she isn't able to get the custody of at least her daughter, because she was the one who single-handedly brought her up to 1 yrs old before she was brought to her nanny, which is why, she is very very close to her daughter. We can't imagine what she will be like if her daughter was taken away from her.</p>
              <p>For your info, when her daughter was due to be born, she went to the hospital on her own by taxi. Her husband didn't even bother to bring her there.</p>
              <p>Any advice from you all, on how I can advice her on what to do?</p>
              <p>Anyway, I apologise for the wall of text, but I need to share this story, and help my friend. I don't want her to get into a state of depression because of her children, especially her daughter.</p>

              <p>1st, your friend need to get a job to prove that she can actually provide for the 2 kids .. Mothers usually get the kids unless she's really hopeless, iirc.</p>
              <p>2nd, she should really consult those family welfare thingy ..  And see wat help she can get.</p>
              <p>3rd, i got a friend whose situation is like hers .. Initially her son was close to her after she let her mother in law took care of her son .. Slowly, the son dunwan to stay by his mother side.. so your friend gotta really judge whether will their grandma poison their thinking or its purely just helping.</p>
              <p>This is wat i know i did help my friend thru her hard times.. She did visit the MP of the area but well, i dun really trust them.</p>

              <p>Hello..</p>
              <p>I had a cousin who used to face this also.. And her story is really really similar to your friend's..</p>
              <p>Since the husband is the one having an affair, it WILL benefit your friend if she gets hold of EVIDENCE of his misdoings (photos, videos, etc).. This way, if i'm not wrong will increase her chances of getting custody of her children.</p>
              <p>And she need to get herself a STABLE job to prove that she is capable of taking care of her 2 kids.</p>
              <p>I have a feeling that IF she lets the mother-in-law take care of her 2 kids, she might in the later days refuse to "return" to her.. If she brings it to court, the mother-in-law might just say that she had been the one taking care of them all these nonsense and i don't think it will do your friend any good..</p>
              <p>And what about your friend's mother? Maybe she can help take care of her 2 kids while she's at work?</p>

              <p>dunno.com &gt;&gt; i dunno if he said these to spite her. cos he seems very desperate to get divorced, but he dont want to spend money. his family has a shop, but business not really good, however he's involved in some illegal business which I don't wish to talk about in here.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>mid &gt;&gt; she dont have qualifications. she quit sch when she was in Sec 4. It's only when she gave birth to her daughter, she started working in the sales line. yea, one day will bring her down with her mum to the Social Welfare thingy as she's still under 21 and she need her guardian. for now, yea her son still will stick to her mum. but if given a choice, i think her son will rather stick to her mother-in-law. because it's like he's with them everyday, and my friend is like only able to see him once a week, due to her work.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>fireng &gt;&gt; but now the problem is, she cant bear to do that. her daughter was brought up by her all alone.. she loves her daughter very much from what i can see.</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Hi all. I have an issue which I wish to discuss with you
              guys.</p>
              <p>Let me kick off with some brief description.</p>
              <p>I have a female friend, who's married and with 2 kids now. She's
              currently working in the sales line, but yet to be confirmed as
              she's still under probation.Her salary is not that high. She's
              around 20, and her husband is around 24.</p>
              <p>Her husband had affairs outside for a couple of years already.
              For the 1st couple of times, the husband asked for forgiveness.
              However the third time it happened, my friend, who can't take it
              anymore, wanted a divorce.</p>
              <p>Currently, her son is staying with her mother-in-law, and her
              daughter is with a nanny as she is unable to take care of them on
              her own. Her husband's family likes her son more than her daughter,
              so you can roughly know how the situation is like for her. e.g. if
              anything happens between the two of them, most likely they will
              only take care of the boy but not the girl.</p>
              <p>Since the third time the affairs started, her husband has not
              been going home, staying at the woman's place all these while, only
              going back to get stuffs once in awhile. He didn't even attend
              or celebrate their children's birthdays this year.</p>
              <p>At the early stages, her husband still gave her money for the
              children's expenses. But I heard from my friend, he recently told
              her he do not want to bother about them anymore.</p>
              <p>Now, her mother-in-law told her that she wanted to help my
              friend to take care of her daughter, which in one way is good
              because she need not spend money on the nanny anymore. However what
              I think is not good is, what if both of her children get too close
              with her husband's family? What if, after their divorce, she isn't
              able to get the custody of at least her daughter, because she was
              the one who single-handedly brought her up to 1 yrs old before she
              was brought to her nanny, which is why, she is very very close
              to her daughter. We can't imagine what she will be like if her
              daughter was taken away from her.</p>
              <p>For your info, when her daughter was due to be born, she went to
              the hospital on her own by taxi. Her husband didn't even bother to
              bring her there.</p>
              <p>Any advice from you all, on how I can advice her on what to
              do?</p>
              <p>Anyway, I apologise for the wall of text, but I need to share
              this story, and help my friend. I don't want her to get into a
              state of depression because of her children, especially her
              daughter.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>It is unfortunate your friend married such a lousy guy.</p>
              <p>There is nothing wrong letting her mother-in-law take care of the kids during working hours, but she must make sure she fetch them back after her work , back to her home.</p>
              <p>The court will not award child custody to the mother-in laws just because the child spends a lot of time with them.</p>
              <p>Unless your friend has proven to be mentally unsound, is abusive, and/or uncapable of providing care to a child. Else, she do not have to worry.</p>
              <p>Why is it that she only gets to see her son ONCE a week ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Since her husband do not want to be the primary care giver, your friend should ensure she gets the court give her legal custody of both kids.</p>
              <p>When she has custody, it is still OK to let her in-laws do daycare for them. After all, the children still needs to have a relationship with the father's side of the family.</p>
              <p>A divorce does not mean the other side of the family is to be totally cut off.</p>
              <p>The court will award child support even though the father refused to "bother" about the children.</p>
              <p>So your friend needs to seek sound legal advise, and decide how she wants to proceed.</p>
              <p>Good luck to your friend.</p>
