              <p><br> No lah, me still in courtship, this is what my grandma told me. She
              said in a woman love, courtship is the most wonderful part, cherish
              it, and if next time your bf become yr husband, do not expect him
              to behave as per courtship love, many gals do not understand this
              natural effect, thus most end up thinking that their husband no
              more love them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The most common phrase out of a woman mouth to her husband
              is,</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>To say truth, I hope the man I will eventually marry be as consistent as his behaviour during courtship. That is also the reason why some girls are turn off when the guys are super-showy during courtship. They don't feel their attraction will last and hence they are not attracted to such guys in the first place.</p>
              <p>I understand the compel to impress, but for a long term partner, it's best to see how someone behave under normal circumstances too. Hence how he treats others, and then in comparision how he treats you during courtship is, imho, a very important factor to take note of.</p>

              <p><br>Precisely, guys carrying handbags don't look good, that is why I don't let bf or any guy friends carry my handbags.   It is more for positive reason I don't let them carry handbags, don't know why most react so negatively.    They want to help to carry bags, carry shopping bags, luggage, utility bags, are OK.   </p>

My friend is not allowed to fetch another girl even out of convenience or out of pure gentlemanly assistance. She yells at him in the public before me "He's like this one! So useless!" My friend bowed his head in shame when she did that.</p>

              <p>When my friend need to run an errand and he's not bringing her along because he's going to the workshop which is dusty, hot and boring. she yelled at him and sent him a reply on his phone 'F*CK YOU!'</p>

              <p>When I fetched a girl to meet our friends on a major outing since she stays near to me and the only logical choice is for me to fetch her instead of the others. I went to sit at the other table with my friend and my female friend also came along out of courtesy. My friend's gf saw it and forbids her bf to associate with me anymore. Because she thinks I am unfaithful to my gf.</p>

              <p>I think the thing is, the guy is just trying to show that he can be useful to you in this sense ba, Fantagf. Guys generally (imo) like to help girls, so if he really insist, then I guess let him be. Maybe, it might help to let those guys know that you think it doesn't look macho for them but you are very glad that he's offered his help and that is enough (bu shi bu yao ta bang mang). Next time got heavy things sure call him to come and help! Maybe that might make him happier instead of causing him to be so negative? Maybe they are used to helping girls carry their handbags so they feel rebuffed when you rejected them? Well... just a thought...</p>

              <p> Therefore, essentially, those husbands DO have to care a lot. Not blindly being submissive to her of course, but make her relax and understand where her insecurity stems from so that she can let go of being so controlling.</p>

              <p>hmmm on one hand, it can been seen as caring alot. on the other hand, it might be seen as stifling. so i guess it's subjective. hmmm, or can it be put in this way - that generally some females might be abit insecure that is why they wanna "control" the guys because they don't wanna lose them? whereas generally, guys might not have an insecurity issue?</p>
