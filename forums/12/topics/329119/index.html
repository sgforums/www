She said in a woman love, courtship is the most wonderful part, cherish it, and if next time your bf become yr husband, do not expect him to behave as per courtship love, many gals do not understand this natural effect, thus most end up thinking that their husband no more love them.</p>

              <p>I have a friend who has an absolutely mad gf. She is extremely possessive.

My friend bowed his head in shame when she did that.</p>

              <p>When my friend need to run an errand and he's not bringing her along because he's going to the workshop which is dusty, hot and boring. she yelled at him and sent him a reply on his phone 'F*CK YOU!'</p>

              <p>When I fetched a girl to meet our friends on a major outing since she stays near to me and the only logical choice is for me to fetch her instead of the others. I went to sit at the other table with my friend and my female friend also came along out of courtesy. My friend's gf saw it and forbids her bf to associate with me anymore. Because she thinks I am unfaithful to my gf.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>She wants to stick around him wherever he goes and throws her temper whenever she wants regardless of the environment and timing.</p>

              <p>Because of her, I have almost lost contact with my friend. But he secretly contacts me via phone sometimes to chat with me.</p>
