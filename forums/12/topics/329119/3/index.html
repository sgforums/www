              <p> That type one huh. I know a few good bros under permanent lock down. They are the kind of gf that when u r having a boys night and suddenly.. like ur mum or something come in spot check , create a scene n leave.  Like a typhoon that just swept past our table, after the passing storm , we see the guy gone. And our table in shambles. Everyone recovering from the sudden ruthless attack.N yes , he loves her. So.. what can we say.  But normally it somehow works on guys that were very playa before. lol.</p>
              <p>In terms of biologically they say, men wants to procreate , find as many mates as they can. While women , biologically, are to prevent thier man from acquiring other females. So.. yeah.</p>
              <p>About the handbags and stuff i dun mind la. Sometimes manja her a bit n do what she wants u to do la. Like .. wear pink.. to match her pink. lol.. under her pink umbrella.. carrying her pink handbag. I think its alright. Sometimes. Not everytimes. But some women like the men to carry thier bag. Its like saying , 'Look.. he's mine. Cause he is carrying my girly handbag.. so back off bitch' hahaha . Or because tian mi mi ma lo also. he he. So cute eh.  he he</p>
