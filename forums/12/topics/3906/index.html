            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by fedora:</div><div class="quote_body">Same same as moosey moosey =)</div></blockquote>So u normally treat a guy who gets along well with u as only a gd frd.  In the first place, did u ask yourself why u click so well with guys and not with girls.<br>Girls normally had a grp of same sex that clig well so that they can go out shopping,doing girl's stufff and talking abt girl's problems and secrets that u won't tell a guy, agreed?<br>R u sure u can share personal secrets with a guy, unless he's ur bf? Actually I belong to the other category and r giving u advice from my point of view.  If a girl gets along very well with me, I really can't help but fall in love with her as "ri jiu shen qing". If u r a chinese, u will understand this, it means that the longer u spend time with her, the more feelings will be developed for her loh.<br>But from your point of view, it's juz having a new friend. Thus, I trying not to misunderstand a girl's feeling when she gets too well with me.  Tell all of u a secret, I oso one who gets along well with girls rather than guys, hehehe, but it's bcos I dun like outdoor sports and activities as most guys wold prefer to do when they go out...<br>Ok, from both points of views,hopeu can handle your problem well...<br><br>------------------<br>Hope to b your frd forever, Mike signing off</div>
