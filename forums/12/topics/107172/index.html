But what can we do?<br>If you're spiritual, then pray.<br>If you're not, all you can do, is use him as a model. A model of someone whom you do NOT want to be when you grow up.<br><br>I'm doing the same thing, though my dad isn't really that bad, he has a lot of character flaws that i'm adapting to as i grow up, growing up to be the exact opposite of him.<br><br>I guess that's the only thing we can do. Of course, you could try talking to him, but i'm not placing any high hopes there. You could get your grand parents to talk to him as well, to try and whack some senses into him.<br><br>But this is a gray area that i don't quite know as well, maybe can wait for Yunhaier or someone else who knows to post..</div>

Just that you haven't met a worst case<br>than yours. If you have a religion, start praying and try to re-unite<br>and strengthen the family bond. Talk and discuss with your siblings that<br>you wanted a change, be it in the bahaviour of your dad or your<br>relationship with your siblings, and work towards it. If your dad is<br>succumbed to the evil path,  at least the rest of the family are still intact<br>and try to help him out of it. The process may be slow but if you are determined nothing can stop you.<br></div>
