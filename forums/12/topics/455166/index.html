              <p>Hi All,</p>
              <p>I feel tired easily even if I sleep 8hrs a day. I feel sleepy and breathless, also tensed.</p>
              <p>I noticed a similar trend for the past few years.</p>
              <p>When I am overseas, even if i sleep for less than 6hrs a day, i feel energetic, can breathe easily and my chest feel light and my complexion looks healthy. My nose block goes off and sneexing reduced by 80%. Even if I were away for many weeks alone, I can handle everything I faced with calmness.</p>
              <p>2 days before i return to Singapore, i feel little sad that my travel is going to be over soon.</p>
              <p>1 week after I return to Singapore, my nose start to block terribly (since i was 7yrs old) and lots of sneezing.</p>
              <p>2 weeks after i return, i feel my breathing is little heavier and I get angry and sad easily.</p>
              <p>As time goes by, my breadth gets shorter and chest feels heavy. I also feel tension in my body and mind. Sometimes it gets bad that I get headach, eye pain and nausea. Doctor diagnose that its tension. My work is not very stressful so If the cause is stress, I dont think its from work. My interest in daily life dwindles. Everything seems boring. My noseblock becomes very bad, so i have to breathe with my mouth 95% of the time. I always feel like sleeping, I can sleep alot.</p>
              <p>I am born and grow up in Singapore in my mid 20s. Am not over weight, have good apettite and can sleep alot.</p>
              <p>Is there something wrong with me physically / psychologically / both?</p>
              <p>These always happens when I am in Singapore and goes away when I am overseas.</p>
              <p>I want to feel happy, energetic and to breathe properly in Singapore as travelling to slove the problem is not a permanent "cure".</p>
              <p>Please Help and share your experience &amp; advice.</p>
              <p>Thanks Alot !</p>

              <p>It is quite obvious u are suffering from allergies that inflame your air passage. Singapore has air pollution problem. Or u may be allergic to pets or plants around your living area.</p>
              <p>The tissues in your respiratory tract expands and reduces oxygen to your lungs.</p>
              <p>Seek help from allergist to get prescription anti-histamine meds, they will also give u a skin prick test to find out what u may be allergic to.  get a reference to head, nose and throat specialist , u may need a surgery to clear air passage. Some people hav over growth tissues in their nasal area that becomes really bad due to allergies.</p>
              <p>If u have problem with sleep apnea, you may need to use breathing apparatus to help u sleep properly at night. This can be ascertained with a visit to a sleep lab.</p>
              <p>But I think u are likely having problems due to allergies, and the blockage is affecting your sleep. So you don't feel rested even after a full night of sleep.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>your mind liberated without you knowing while in oversea, contrary to a stigma of a 'self computated routine chore' of same 'old appearances' in Singapore. This is normal, but it should not be an indoctrination as it will damage yourself and those around you especially the youth. A favourable approach is that you may try to consider every environment of your life a refreshing one. For food wise, be more on green and fruit and lest oily stuff, simple exercise that perspire but in joys within your stamina would be helpful. May you be radiant and healthy.</p></div>

              <p>Many different condition within a person respirtory tract results in blockage. It is up to the doctor to diagnose. Nasal expansion is not the only option to treating nasal inflammatory problem. </p>
              <p>Flixonase is a corticosteroid, not everyone is suitable to use it, and it also hav side effects that need to be monitored by a doctor. </p>
              <p>Narcolepsy is a neurological sleep disorder, and he already mention his sleep problem only affects him while in Singapore. So it also rules out sleep apnea.</p>
              <p>First he needs to figure out Ifhe has tissue overgrowth or Irregular septum structure, the doctor will insert a Nasal scope to look at his nasal cavities to check for abnormalities. If everything looks normal, then he will be prescribed a allergy drug to combat inflammation.</p>
              <p>If it's due to allergy, then he will need to determine what are the surrounding allergens he is exposed to, and try to minimize or eliminate them.</p>
              <p>Or he can be given allergen shots to immunize against allergens.. But this is a slow and lengthy process.</p>
              <p>Continuous positive airway pressure machines will be administered first before any surgery is recommended. </p>
              <p>I know all these because my uncle has the same problem. He travels with his CPAPmachines and carries a set of Epi pen just in case he gets allergic attacks when outside his home environment.</p>

              <p>Flixonase is amazing.</p>
              <p>You are so wrong. I don't always use flixonase. But when i have nose block, I use flixonase, my nose block never come back for 3 months.</p>
              <p>TS has to find out what is wrong with him. We can't be sure. Firstly TS has got to look at his lifestyle.</p>
              <p>Does TS smoke? Does TS masturbate a lot? Does TS drink a lot of liquor? Does TS got a lot of work stress and always work overtime? Does TS not exercise enough? What about TS's parents, do they suffer from diabetics? hypertension? If so, TS got to check if he has any of these due to genetics. Could be a blood disease. Maybe not enough red blood cells, I know of people who suffer from chronic tiredness have this disease. We don't know for sure. So TS needs to do a comprehensive blood, MRI and body checkup. Recommend TS see a physicist.</p>

              <p>I suffered from the symptoms like you. I felt breathless and dizzy most of the time and could not sleep well at night. I visited an ENT doctor Dr Goh from Mt Elizabeth who diagnosed that I had a swollen turbinate in my nose which is blocking my airway. I underwent a simple surgery and am breathing very well now.</p>
