            <div class='col-md body'>hi guys its my first time posting here.  I have some inter-personal problems.. hope you guys can sound me out <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Story goes like this:<br>I like this girl from my class in the polytechnic, been classmates for exactly a year on. Last semester we started going out but its usually with a third person who is a female. Eventually i got to know her better and of course i was attracted to her. We even take the same bus from school to her transfer stop in town. During those times we would chat about school stuff.<br><br>Now in year 2, i've decided not to be a coward and made it clear to her in a letter that i like her. To my surprise, she gave a pleasant reply that she treats me "as a very good friend only". Personally it was the best reply she can give as i do not wanna risk into going into a relationship with her. That happened on a 1st Friday.<br><br>The week that followed was rather good as i can put down my guard and chat with her whatever i want. we even chatted about our personal stuff on the bus after school. However, on the 2nd Thursday (which is the next thursday after the first friday) i bought a toy for her, thinking that she would like it. I passed to her after school in the bus.<br><br>The week that followed was almost the total opposite from the previous paragraph. She starts to keep her distance from me. She seldom talk to me. She replies to me sometimes in a very "reluctant" and "buay song" way. Today is the 3rd Friday. Things aint getting better. I wanted to write her a letter to clarify things with her but my friends around me who know this keep telling me not to write and just let time pass.<br><br>What do you guys think? Should I write her the letter and go head-on with this matter? or Should I just let time heal the wounds and hope she will stop keeping her distance from me?<br><br>I seriously do not wanna lose a friend like her. Things seems to be as bad as it is.<br><br>P.S She's in the same project group with me for 4 modules.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>panic is right. she's trying her level best to sooth things... so let it cool. then maybe you still got a chance to go back to being JUST friends. nothing more. if you showed any trace of anything MORE, you'll prob lose her as a friend forever.<br><br>take heart. get over it. at least you still have a friend.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well....I reckon it will be best for you to tell her that, it alrite not to accept you...but just be friends....her signal is clear enough to you that she only wan you as a fren and not to complicate matters....So make it clear to her, and be friends, if not, it will be hard for u to concentrate on the project....<br><br>Gd luck...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>MMM...seems like a familiar case. Anyway, yes as wat other people have said, she want u as friend only. Pressure her somemore and u will lose her as a friend forever. I think u should know after u declare ur feeling for her, ur friendship with her might not be the same anymore. Because she might feel that if she treat u nice again, u might get the wrong idea.<br><br>And seems u like her, I think if u get back close to her again, u might fall for her again, thus start the misery of loving her but can't be with her.<br><br>If I am u, i will stay away from her till I making sure i ONLY want be friends with her. Any try not to do things which normal friends would not do, like writing a letter to her, buying a soft toy for watever. Finally, its up to her call whether she want to remain as friends with u after this suituation. If she still try to avoid u altot u treat her as friends, then let it be. Guys should have a little pride too and she does not deserve to be ur friend.<br><br>Good luck~~~!<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Basically she means for u to stop showing interest in her and treat her as a fren.

Ur case is much more complicated. It would seem at the moment not possible until things take a turn for the better ( until she can really forget ur intentions but i doubt it.).<br><br>I can frankly tell u that if u ask her for a movie now, u will be in more hot soup and by then we will not be able to help u anymore.<br><br>Let things cool down, dun think abt chasing her and dun tok abt it for some time.<br><br>The best solution will be to give up.

She's from a convent school for 10 years before coming here. almost 80% of her friends are girls. (just an estimate). Whether she believe guys and girls an be good friends is a questionable here. if she's from a co-ed school, i have no qualms about that. but she's from a convent school.. hard to predict also.<br><br>Letter drafted, edited and printed. it will make or break this friendship IMO. intend to pass to her after school today.</div>
