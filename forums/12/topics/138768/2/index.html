I have some inter-personal problems.. hope you guys can sound me out <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Story goes like this:<br>I like this girl from my class in the polytechnic, been classmates for exactly a year on. Last semester we started going out but its usually with a third person who is a female. Eventually i got to know her better and of course i was attracted to her. We even take the same bus from school to her transfer stop in town. During those times we would chat about school stuff.<br><br>Now in year 2, i've decided not to be a coward and made it clear to her in a letter that i like her. To my surprise, she gave a pleasant reply that she treats me "as a very good friend only". Personally it was the best reply she can give as i do not wanna risk into going into a relationship with her. That happened on a 1st Friday.<br><br>The week that followed was rather good as i can put down my guard and chat with her whatever i want. we even chatted about our personal stuff on the bus after school. However, on the 2nd Thursday (which is the next thursday after the first friday) i bought a toy for her, thinking that she would like it. I passed to her after school in the bus.<br><br>The week that followed was almost the total opposite from the previous paragraph. She starts to keep her distance from me. She seldom talk to me. She replies to me sometimes in a very "reluctant" and "buay song" way. Today is the 3rd Friday. Things aint getting better. I wanted to write her a letter to clarify things with her but my friends around me who know this keep telling me not to write and just let time pass.<br><br>What do you guys think? Should I write her the letter and go head-on with this matter? or Should I just let time heal the wounds and hope she will stop keeping her distance from me?<br><br>I seriously do not wanna lose a friend like her. Things seems to be as bad as it is.<br><br>P.S She's in the same project group with me for 4 modules.</div></blockquote><span style="text-decoration: underline;">"To my surprise, she gave a pleasant reply that she treats me "as a very good friend only". Personally it was the best reply she can give as i do not wanna risk into going into a relationship with her"</span><br><br>---&gt;  If she says about a good friend only... just forget about getting more than "a friend" to her ok... A girl usually wont tell anyguy "we're just friend" if she's interested to that guy, afraid that she will lose him and turn him off... "We're just a friend" means that she REALLY REALLY wants u to be a friend whom she can tell u about her problems, then can ask u to help her think about the solution.. or ask u when she needs help..

From the way I see it, you at least let her know what is going on from your point of view and accepting the facts or not is really up to her... OR you can just leave things as bundled up as they are now.... It's not like the chances of the situation getting any better would be high anyway without you making any move...
