              Dear all,
               I am in a relationship with this girl who is currently unmarried with a daughter.  We met each other two year ago in our workplace. Recently she told me that she has to go home to take care of her daughter.  By the way they are malaysians. For the past few years it was my girlfriend mother  and her younger sister who help to take care her daughter while she works in Sg. I been beside her for nearly two years and suddenly she has to go back Malaysia to take care of her daughter, reasons is her mother and dad is getting on age and her sister is planning to come SG to work.  I already have plans to get ROM with her. What should I do? Am i being selffish by not letting her go back? 
              
              I cannot think of a win win solution on what shall I do? Any kind soul can advise me?

              <p>Hi Derrickyap,</p>
              <p>Please do pardon me for saying so, but by forcing her to remain here in Singapore, it will indeed be very selfish of you. As Xiaoming has kindly stated, the most probable scenarios will be either that of you becoming a Malaysia PR, or that of her families moving over to Singapore and becoming PRs.</p>
              <p>The best thing for you to do now is to travel to Malaysia with her, and have a talk with her family about your plans to get married. This is to see what her family and herself have in mind. On a side note, I certainly hope that you have told your parents of your plans to get married.</p>
              <p>Anyway, only after you have converse with her family, then should you come to a conclusion as to which are the most appropriate steps of action to be taken.</p>
              <p>Cheers</p>

              <p>Your problem may be bigger and more complex than you think. It's not just about being selfish, but in the bigger scheme of things there is the Foriegn Affairs policies of both nations that you should worry about, with your plan to marry a foriegner.</p>
              <p>It isnt so easy as saying 'I do' in any country. Every nation protects its own society and will have screening and regulations for any foriegner marrying their own citizens. They would prefer citizen marry citizen.</p>
              <p>Education and earning abilities are the basic requirements or it may end up society taking up the burden to take care of them. Furthermore, abuses in the system caused by 'sham marriages' had led nations to be more catious and to go by the head, than by the heart, no matter how beautifully crafted an appeal can be, even from MPs.</p>
              <p>Not to discourage you, but at the end of the day, you may wonder - is it worth it all? If you still think it is, then I suggest you take a trip to MOM, ICA and MFA to find out more of what it entails to marry a foriegner, or you becoming another country's PR to help you decide. It may not be as clear cut as you presume it to be....</p>

              <p>Hi Derrickyap,</p>
              <p>I just found out, for a couple to file a notice of marriage in Singapore, the criteria is that at least one of them has to live in Singapore for 15 consecutive days. This applies for all regardless of citizenship.</p>
              <p><a href="http://app.rom.gov.sg/internet/reg_info/rom_preparation.asp">http://app.rom.gov.sg/internet/reg_info/rom_preparation.asp</a></p>
              <p>As for the application to be a permanent resident, your girlfriend and her daughter are eligible, but not her parents. Unless they take up skilled jobs in Singapore, otherwise the only other way for them to apply for permanent residency is to wait till their daughter becomes a Singapore Citizen.</p>

              <p>Derrick,</p>
              <p>Sometimes women give lame reasons to leave their men.</p>
              <p>If you are truly accepting of her being a single mother, you coulda help her bring her daughter to SG instead.</p>
              <p>In your case, I believe she is disillusioned by what you had offered her in times of "true needs".</p>
              <p>Perhaps after these couple of years, she realized you are not the kind of man generous enough, to be able to take care of her and her daughter.</p>
              <p>Think about it ya ?</p>

              <p>Hi Derrickyap,</p>
              <p>I just found out, for a couple to file a notice of marriage in
                  Singapore, the criteria is that at least one of them has to live in
                  Singapore for 15 consecutive days. This applies for all regardless
                  of citizenship.</p>

              <p>As for the application to be a permanent resident, your
                  girlfriend and her daughter are eligible, but not her parents.
                  Unless they take up skilled jobs in Singapore, otherwise the only
                  other way for them to apply for permanent residency is to wait till
                  their daughter becomes a Singapore Citizen.</p>

              <p>I hope this helps.</p>

              <p>Now that she is deciding to leave.. then you start thinking of marrying her... maybe too late already.</p>
              <p>You are merely marrying her out of <strong>fear</strong> of losing her.</p>
              <p>Women wants a man to marry her out of<strong> love, </strong> wanting to be with her for the long term.</p>

              <p>Read up here, on real life experiences, espacially from the replies, before you make any marrying decision with foriegners, which I think you both may be prepared to proceed, after knowing each other for 2 years and the only reason for going home is for her kid and parents,... Only then will you understand why I had written what I wrote earlier....</p>
