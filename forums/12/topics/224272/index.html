            <div class='col-md body'><strong>mistyblue</strong>: Responsibility is when you decide to stick to your decision, despite the setbacks. Some people find responsbility a chore; thus they usually prefer flings, and ONSes. These people are usually also those who do not persist during their work.<br><br>-----------------------------------<br><br>There is no one clear defined "suitable" age for a relationship. There are too many factors to consider.<br><br>Age is never a problem. Despite what <span style="font-style: italic;">some</span> forummates may think, maturity is not dependent of age. <strong>Maturity</strong> is the factor, not age. Are you sure you can handle the relationship?<br><br>At 18, the problems usually encountered is pubbing, and drinking. Generally, people of this year wants to have fun, wants freedom. Do you have the maturity to handle such a situation?<br><br>Money is a sub-factor. I think nowadays, the girls are okay with going dutch, or "subsidised" dutch - you help her to pay a portion, but she pay the rest. Of course, you cannot expect her to go dutch everytime, so you do need the extra money.<br><br>Despite all that, I say, just go for it! Like one forummate above said, if you two like each other, <strong>there's no time better than now!</strong></div>

We asked him to wait but he didn't want. Come divorce, he asked my mom what should he do. He didn't want to take responsibility for his action. Then further more, he didn't take any responsibility for his divorce and custody fight for his child. My father foot all the bills, till today, even the food he eats is paid by my 70+ yr old father who rummage through rubbish for scraps for money. My mom paid for his car installments till she ran out of money for her own medical bills, and she at 70 now, cooks, cleans and wash for his grown up man like his maid. But my brother did not take up responsibility all his life.  Now he finds a new girl. I just wonder.<br>Till this very day, he blames his life and how things turn out on everyone. On the parents for not providing his university education (so many out there work and study because family is poor). He blames his work issues on other people.<br><br>You know what is responsibility?<br><br></div></blockquote>woah... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"></div>
