What responsibility can anybody take other than for themselves anyway?<br></strong>[/quote]<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by mistyblue:<br><br>For one's actions.  Meaning whatever the chosen path the person takes, he shall not need his parents or anyone else to bail him/her out.<br><br>Most young adults and even immature old adults, when they screw up, they run back to their folks and their folks had to settle things for them.  For example: My own Brother and his wife had separated cause the wife wanted a divorce. However, back then, my parents told him he only know the girl at most 6 months and wanted to marry her. We asked him to wait but he didn't want. Come divorce, he asked my mom what should he do. He didn't want to take responsibility for his action. Then further more, he didn't take any responsibility for his divorce and custody fight for his child. My father foot all the bills, till today, even the food he eats is paid by my 70+ yr old father who rummage through rubbish for scraps for money. My mom paid for his car installments till she ran out of money for her own medical bills, and she at 70 now, cooks, cleans and wash for his grown up man like his maid. But my brother did not take up responsibility all his life.  Now he finds a new girl. I just wonder.<br>Till this very day, he blames his life and how things turn out on everyone. On the parents for not providing his university education (so many out there work and study because family is poor). He blames his work issues on other people.<br><br>You know what is responsibility?<br><br></blockquote>That's a lot of crazy people out there who do not know how to change. For example, the pampered lifestyle of the Kids nowadays. Parents complain about teachers when childrens play gangsters.<br><br>Now, what is actually being responsible? For your own offspring ? Or for your own accountability to conscience?  Then, do you want to define Conscience in tangible terms ? How much $$$ is your conscience worth?<br><br>Your story tells of how "responsible" for bringing up their kid for their own suffering, if you call that kind of "up-bringing" responsible ? Then you better have everyone follow the "Bible" of being responsible.<br><br>Being responsible : aka, able to respond to -<br>many times its more proactive to teach people to respond to situations rather than respond on their behalf.<br><br></div>

Then, do you want to define Conscience in tangible terms ? How much $$$ is your conscience worth?<br><br>Your story tells of how "responsible" for bringing up their kid for their own suffering, if you call that kind of "up-bringing" responsible ? Then you better have everyone follow the "Bible" of being responsible.<br><br>Being responsible : aka, able to respond to -<br>many times its more proactive to teach people to respond to situations rather than respond on their behalf. </strong></blockquote>Why Judge how other people Bring up their kids ?  So why does it bother if a person goes to his / her family or parents for help...That why it is called family...<br><br>Or maybe a person like you don't have a family to go to thats why you're saying things so harshly....<br><br></div>

Meaning whatever the chosen path the person takes, he shall not need his parents or anyone else to bail him/her out.<br><br>Most young adults and even immature old adults, when they screw up, they run back to their folks and their folks had to settle things for them.  For example: My own Brother and his wife had separated cause the wife wanted a divorce. However, back then, my parents told him he only know the girl at most 6 months and wanted to marry her. We asked him to wait but he didn't want. Come divorce, he asked my mom what should he do. He didn't want to take responsibility for his action. Then further more, he didn't take any responsibility for his divorce and custody fight for his child. My father foot all the bills, till today, even the food he eats is paid by my 70+ yr old father who rummage through rubbish for scraps for money. My mom paid for his car installments till she ran out of money for her own medical bills, and she at 70 now, cooks, cleans and wash for his grown up man like his maid. But my brother did not take up responsibility all his life.  Now he finds a new girl. I just wonder.<br>Till this very day, he blames his life and how things turn out on everyone. On the parents for not providing his university education (so many out there work and study because family is poor). He blames his work issues on other people.<br><br>You know what is responsibility?<br><br></div></blockquote>nice one... i also see my elder sis liddat.. until now so old liao still leeching my parent's  money. befoer she go to U, she all day nag say want to go to donnoe which U in Aust.  my parents bth then sold 2 properties for her to study U... in the end after she graduate, she say she dun want to find any job related to her studies...she just want to do community service. wth?!?<br><br>now i'm 18 still first year in poly.. and i'm already finding sponsorship for my own studies or even keeping my grades as A so that can go NTU liao.. i told mum i dun need their support for uni to higher education cos i know if i go U they will sell another 2 properties.. and if they are old.. how they enjoy their life? is it 2 person staying at home eating mee? or is it 2 person in oversea enjoying life using what they earn during their hard days?<br></div>
