Girls her age are not mature for a r/s issues. You mentioned she hinted? What exactly did she say?<br><br>No i think you should just treat her like your guy buddies. Don't pressure. The more you pressure the worse it gets. She gets uneasy because you pressure, period. Just talk to her like a friend and understand her more. Don't let her know you will be there around for her etc that kind of stuff. That is very wimpy. You have watched too many taiwan idol shows already.<br><br></div>
