I did suggest a few more moves before really acknowledging that she doesn't have any interest you but you still gotta try right. I mean if you never tried your best, you will never know... at least once you know you can move on find someone else...<br><br>1) Send a bouquet of flowers to her at work. Go to <a href="http://www.prince.com" rel="nofollow">www.prince.com</a>. I have taken the liberty of choosing two sets of flowers for you to choose from depending on your budget.<br><img src="http://www.prince.com.sg/Images/Products/78-6233-58.jpg"><br>Cost you $50 bucks... but hey its unique, it appeals to girls who lurve bags...<br><a href="http://www.prince.com.sg/Sg_ProductDetails.asp?ProductSID=7507&amp;CatSID=53" rel="nofollow">http://www.prince.com.sg/Sg_ProductDetails.asp?ProductSID=7507&amp;CatSID=53</a><br><br><img src="http://www.prince.com.sg/Images/Products/78-6237-65x12.jpg"><br>This one is $65. But its well worth it... people in the office will go ga ga and she will blush all over... and think of the person who sent this!<br><a href="http://www.prince.com.sg/Sg_ProductDetails.asp?ProductSID=7523&amp;CatSID=53" rel="nofollow">http://www.prince.com.sg/Sg_ProductDetails.asp?ProductSID=7523&amp;CatSID=53</a><br><br>Now, just write something short and sweet... like<br><br>"I hope you like the flowers. Look forward to our next date"<br><br>Cheers!<br>Your Name<br><br>This is a pretty striaght forward note, a really BIG hint that you like her and are confessing to her... if she doesn't respond nicely, drop her and move on...<br><br>If she calls you or emailing you back, thanking you for the flowers and asking when will you be free for your next date... thats a big HINT she likes you.<br><br>Hey take it as an experience... with each date, you gain experience and confidence! You get to improvise on the next one! = ) Like your recent date, she said that you were pretty quiet... maybe it was your moody but girls are very sensitive they can pick up bad vibes very easily... so maybe she feels that you're not happy being on a date with her... try to be more outspoken, say funny things, say how nice she looks, or say nice shoes or nice bag, tell interesting stories... etc<br><br>So, there's plenty of fishes in the sea out there! Take your time and pick another target to hunt down!<br><br>See, the benefit with us guys is that we can choose pick a target... girls usually have to wait to be picked then they get to decide whether or not the guy is a keeper.<br><br>Cheers best of luck man!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

If it takes you to apologise to your ex, then just give her a call during the New Years, and just tell her that you just made a new New Year resolution, that is to apologise to anyone whom you have done wrong. Do the same for your best pal... Move on...<br><br>Girls dun like guys who have low self esteem and confidence... so perk up!
