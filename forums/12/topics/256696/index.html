I have no first hand experiences and know nuts about BGR relationship so can someone please lend me a helping hand. THank U!<br><br>Scenario:<br>I recently got to know this girl through a very extraordinary way not like those common boy meet girl scenario. I known her for about 1 week but we never really chat except exchanging of HIs and BYEs. Then on this particular day i was quite bored so i just started to initiate a chat with her but the moment she open her mouth and started talking. I just got engrosed in it and out of a sudden there was a adrenaline rush and I had this funny feeling that is very difficult for me to describe. I try to cover up and quickly ended up my chat with her saying that i was going home. So it ended. The next day i was back there, i wanted to see her but i the moment i saw her my heart started to race and it was pumping fast. OMG so i decided to keep a distance from her and i didnt chat up with her except smiling at her at a distance to let her know that i am aware of her existense.<br><br>I have never felt this way before. For your information My work place have tons of girls but i never got into this awkward situation before. So any advices for me or wad do u think i should do? </div></blockquote>Take it easy... nothing to write home about. This is very common.<br><br>So what you should do is date her out and see if she accepts your dates... then get to know her better and see if you can get along with her... step by step like that...</div>
