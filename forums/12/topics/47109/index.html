What's your astrological sign and hers? Both of your birthdaes? And if you know her birth time, when is it?<br><br>I will reply you tomorrow, as I am getting too tired now. Don't ponder too much - love is a cycle.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>some people don't get over the one they love.<br><br>maybe she wasn't meant to be?<br><br>not too sure about the "women out there" because i was never "in the field" anyway...<br><br>all i know is that breakups suck.. no matter how amicable they are... it tears your inside apart and ruins you in so many ways... some people do not get over it.. but they learn to live with it...<br><br>take this time to ponder over things... how you may learn.. how this experience may enrich your life.. mourn, cry, wail, rant, rage if you have to... find a good friend to talk to, or something... try not to keep it bottled up...<br><br>how i am coping with my heartbreak is simple... i go back to what i believe in... and it helps.. i knew in the beginning that my philosophy will end up hurting me if things go wrong.. but i went on anyway... and it hurts so much one feels like walking into the path of a speeding bus...<br><br>i remember what i am.. love is.. to hell with the consequences... when loving someone, love with all your might... i did, and so did she.. however, things did not work out... things both of us couldn't change, or failed to change, tore us apart...<br><br>how the healing process (still going on) started for me started with my priest... his homily reminded me of my philosophy... love.. damn the consequences... and i was renewed...<br><br>i'll continue to love her... even if we are never going to be together, even if she does not want to see me again, i will love her...<br><br>your story is sad.. but it probably isn't unique.. these days in sgforums, there seems to be too many broken hearts.. we are all trying to support each other in our heartbreak, spilling our guts, offering kind words, sharing our stories... hoping that each broken heart knows they are not alone.. and therefore, know that everyone's pulling towards healing...<br><br>and hoping our sharing helps another towards being whole again.<br><br>i wish you peace,<br>i wish you serenity<br>i wish you luck<br>i wish you joy...<br><br>welcome to the club of broken hearts... may yours mend soon...</div>

At that point of time i'm really shock and angry. Then till now i still don't know wat to do. now i've just ORD and currently looking for a job. i've got alot of free time to think about wat have happened. and i really REGRET wat i've done. i try everything to be with her again but still failed.<br><br>so i advice to all the ppl who have GF/BF chrish wat u have don't do anything stupid or say anything stupid when u r in the HEAT OF THE MOMENT. something which will make u regret of the rest of ur life.<br><br>To be frank, i'm fat ugly and poor. And after wat have happened, i've loss all confidance in looking for "TRUE LOVE" already. IT's really a big REGRET of my life. i hope those ppl that see this topic can like to chrish those around u more and learn to be more understanding and patient.</div></blockquote>Hi BFB,<br>I used to be somewhat in your shoes some time ago (just that I'm the female role). My ex was in the army for his NS. I started picking on him about small little things because there were some things I don't like what he did. He didn't offer to make any compromises even when i brought it up to discuss. He just want me to change the way I feel about it. I got so pissed off with him that I broke up with him. within few months, I know I made a mistake. I realised how important he was to me, how I didn't feel it because I was taking him for granted (and vice versa).<br><br>So I swallowed humbled-pie and apologised to him for hurting him. I'm willing to start all over again, willing to change how I feel about those things I didn't like about. But he said he was very happy with his life.<br><br>*lightning strucks*(sound effects)<br><br>How come things have changed this way? One wrong step, and you will never have the same ending again.<br><br>Then, something unpleasant between us happened. (pleasant for him, not for me) That was like a slap from him to tell me that he's changed, we can't be together anymore kind of signal.<br><br>Thinking back, I don't know whether it could turn out another way if I held my tougue and cool down before I said those things. I don't know if it will still turn out this way if I just held my tougue.<br><br>What's done can't be undone. I don't hate him for the unpleasant things he did, nor, do I still love him to want to go back to him.<br><br>But I really cannot erase away all the memories we had together, nor stop myself from thinking if, in the future the both of us would turn our big circles and end up back together again. (Kinda inspired by BFB after NS syndrome - free, looking for job, nothing to do, keep thinking of the past; I wonder if he would think of me too?)<br><br>Right now, the feeling I have is bittersweet.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Winky, i can really understand how u feel. u r just like me.<br><br>Our impluse cause us our relationship. i think we should learn from our past mistake and learn our lesson. like me in the past i don't express myself well enough, i don't care for her when we r in front of our friends and family(BECAUSE I'M A MCP). It's not that i don't care or wat. It's i care for her just that i don't show it. i feels paisei and shy to care for her in front of friend and my family. BUT THATS STUPID~~~~~ it's my mistake i think there's alot of guys out there that do this also. treat this as a living example, son't do this cause it hurts ur relationship. don't just because of our "face" problem we hide our care and conern.<br><br>Wat done is done. wat happened had happened. i would really want to tell her how much i really love and miss her. but since she's happy with her life, i think i should not bother her. as chinese would say, "if u really love her, let her be happy". Now my only wish for her is for her to find someone that treat her good, caring and someone true to her. she's so native and simple minded, i hope she won't find someone as Ba#@!d as me. i really want her to be happy, thou she cannot be with me.<br><br>Winky, an advice from one of my friend. THERE IS NOTHING THAT REMAIN THE SAME IN THIS WORLD. the world keep on going and things keep on changing. Just treasure those around u, those that really care and loved u. don't be like me. i let my chance goes. IT's a REGRET in life, A Scar a uneraseable SCAR.... If can give ur relationship another shot. if fail then have to moved on. don't be like me for 2 years suffer alone no one and nobody knows. now i decided to tell is to let ppl learn from my mistake don't take the same path as i do.<br></div>

Singapore gals now set their standard so high. either u must have money, if not then u must have the looks. i don't really think there's anyone out there who wants someone which is fat, ugly and poor....<br><br>i have a few girl friends that go out with rich guys just so that they can showoff their BF and compare them. WAT's this world coming to? gals nowaday would like to go for money and looks rather then someone true to her??? this is y i felt so dispair and hopeless.
