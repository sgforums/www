Hmm...well, quite a number Singaporeans are like this...so I'm not surprised at all. One thing you need to constantly remember is...nobody owes you anything and every person is for themselves. You probably expects people to help you when you are in trouble, but think about it by yourself...since when is the last time you helped somebody/anybody and without any motive involved?<br><br>Sometimes the problem is like this, nobody will help anybody for no good reason unless that person is really that nice. I'm not saying that such people doesn't exist, but it would be very rare to bump into one nowadays. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>So probably the people around you are all not the kind of nice people that I've mentioned. And don't feel disappointed about it to a certain extent and start to adopt their mentality and behave like them. Be yourself and hold on to your beliefs, I'm sure you will be able to find somebody who will be able to help you sincerely. But make sure you appreciate them if you do ever come across one...okie? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I guess for the time being, just forget that you ever had any friends in school for a while...if it will make you feel better. Hmm...probably this stage of you life requires you to be independent in your own learning and also to realise that you cannot rely on anyone to help you in your life. You will probably faced with more similar disappointment like this in the future, but I can ensure you that you will only become stronger once you have overcome this obstacle in your environment. Until you have successfully overcome it, you have to be prepared for this kind of similar situations to keep coming back to haunt/test you.<br><br>I felt that life itself is a learning cycle, as long as you haven't overcome something...it will keep coming back to twist you in a different way everytime. Even I'm going through some form of twists in life right now...hehehe...have yet to overcome it though. ^_^"<br><br>Anyway, just to let you know that this is not the end of anything and don't feel so upset about it. If you have to feel bad about it, give yourself some time to get over it and please get over it after that period of time...say 1 week max? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Oh yah...as for those people who contributed to your disappointment, I can only say that they will keep behaving like this till the day they die. Ever wondered why some older people behaved childishly and some wisely? There is a huge gap difference between their thinking and acceptance to life itself. Anyway, choose to be those wise ones before you grow old. You have a choice to be who you want to be when you grow old...so don't disappoint yourself on this one yah. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Good Luck. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>
