              <p>if you read the between the lines .... what he really wanted is to be a stay out clerk ......Â </p>
              <p>now if someone comes in to whine cos he's in a siong combat unit, sleeping out in the open, getting drenched in the rain, being wet, cold, hungry and so dirty that you got sand in your underwear for days on a stretch, getting not enough sleep, being physically tekanned all day, having to eat cold combat rations, having to dig a pit to shit ... getting his weekends burnt on duties .... fine, he deserves a sympathetic ear perhaps ... doing that for 2 years is not easy ... kindred spirit knows it's not the most fun thing in the world.</p>
              <p>but this chap ... sitting pretty in an air-conditioned orpid, gets to sleep in a clean bunk bed every single day, gets to shit over a flushing toilet bowl, three warm, square meals a day, gets off work at 6 promptly, every single day, elects to come in to whine ......Â </p>
              <p>I would like to use some hokkien swear words here .... but I can't produce as great an effect I want ...Â </p>
              <p>and of course, what kind of girl would like a spineless, whining fellow that can't take even a little bit of hardship I have no idea (wait a minute, what hardship ?!?!?!) ... some girls are really short changing themselves nowadays ...</p>

However,Â I still feel depressed whenever i'm in the camp andÂ office (im a stay-in clerk) cause i just cant take it. This suffering is too long.Â I dont know how to overcome it.Â I miss my gf and family whenever im in the camp and whenever im out, im upset cause i have to book in on monday morning. i miss the freedomÂ people outside have, or at least those stay-out clerks have. I dont have any friends inÂ hereÂ because most people here are self-centered people.Â Anyone tell me how do i overcome this depression?Â I dont have mood for any meals, i just wanna go home.Â I seriously dont know how to go through this 2 years of ns.</p>

              <p><br>Some people have problems like TS, and some people don't have problems like yourself.</p>
              <p>It's so obvious that this forums are meant for people with problems.</p>
              <p>So have a little bit more empathy for others and don't really have to be arrogant just because you don't want to understand and open up for others like TS.</p>
              <p>But it's a different story entirely if this topic were posted in another forum. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p>Nobody will appreciate your "WAH LAU EH" when they took the step to share their troubles in here.</p>
              <p>I hope next time other people will also "WAH LAU EH" to you, so that you can understand what it feels like to be down and out. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>I've been serving ns for 2 months already. I'm given the opportunity to go nights out on tuesday and thursdayÂ for 3 hours (i needÂ an hour to get home and another hour to get back)Â and book out on friday evenings. However,Â I still feel depressed whenever i'm in the camp andÂ office (im a stay-in clerk) cause i just cant take it. This suffering is too long.Â I dont know how to overcome it.Â I miss my gf and family whenever im in the camp and whenever im out, im upset cause i have to book in on monday morning. i miss the freedomÂ people outside have, or at least those stay-out clerks have. I dont have any friends inÂ hereÂ because most people here are self-centered people.Â Anyone tell me how do i overcome this depression?Â I dont have mood for any meals, i just wanna go home.Â I seriously dont know how to go through this 2 years of ns.</p>

              <p><br>Why don't you also be a self-centered person in your camp?</p>
              <p>But if you really need to be one, make sure you be the MOST self-centered one in your camp. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p>If you are really experiencing difficulties at your camp, have you considered talking about it with your superior in your camp?</p>
              <p>Hopefully they can work out a better conclusion for you to fit in more easily in your own camp. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>Maybe TS really have a problem coping in his national service?</p>
              <p>Sometimes people must have a bit more compassion and give him the benefit of the doubt and take him seriously.</p>
              <p>I of course don't want to feel bad and be filled with compassion in sgforums ONLY AFTER TS has taken his own life in his camp.</p>
              <p>When there is still time to prevent a tragedy from happening, people usually stick to their own over-inflated ego and join in the crowd to deny suitable compassion for the victim. But once the tragedy has taken place, the same group of people will SUDDENLY developed some form of compassion and blamed themselves verbally over for what has already happened.</p>
              <p>Does people really have to cry over spilled-milk or should people prevent the milk from being spilled so that nobody will ever need to put on a magnificent act of the century?</p>
              <p>Regardless of who it is, TS is still one of our fellow Singaporeans (I hope he is!!!). So there's no harm extending a fraction of our compassion towards him. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>dude, I do have spinal problem and I've a specialist since I was 9 years old to back up with that. I seriously prefer to go back to PRC to train with my buddies than to stay on as a clerk here. Time pass fast as a combat soldier, but bloody slow as a clerk.</p>
