              It is good that you tell us your feeling here, this show that you are concerned and wish to make changes. You might need to get help and see SAF psychologist or Counselor if this goes on. 
              
              No need to be shy on these things. 
              
              Not all people are able to adapt to new environment readily. For me I have insomnia and lost of appetite for almost 2 months. And I really appreciate the whole platoon, sgt, officer, CO and OC for their understandings. Somehow they are experienced and they have come across odd people like us, and somehow I managed to pass my BMT with ease.

That is if u have no task on hand .U might want to speak to ur superior to see if TV or other stuff is allowed after office hours. If u are really too bored, u can help other clerks with their work. This can help to create a friendship bond also. <br><br>  There are (because i know it from personal experience) a few people who are 'friendless' intheir NS unit. This because <br><br>(1) they are knn way too keng, ie to say, they deflect every of their own task and job scope and other arrows to other people. <br>(2) hobbies/personality are too different from the rest. <br><br>I really hope that u really belong to the latter. As for ur nights out, u can choose not to go home and go elsewhere near. If ur gd is understanding enuff, she wld try to meet u near ur camp. If not, i really have nothing to say.<br><br>Lastly, if u belong to the former. Pls wake up ur own bloody idea. Do u think u own NS or that NS own u something? Trust me, alot of us would galdly trade their rifle for that pen of urs. Be happy about ur role and vocation. That may make u feel better, that u know u can bathe and sleep on a nice bed everyday whereas some couldn't sleep out in the cold for 10 straight days. Eating hot meals straight for the plate whereas some had just have biscuits to make do with and even run a risk having no portable water with him. <br><br>Some people, haiz, always have a signboard ontop of them that says "Come F me"</p></div>

              <p>BMT - Stay in ( 1st 3 weeks confined + My first day in NS was a Monday)</p>
              <p>Command school - Stay in for 9 months, (1st 3 weeks confined + uncountable other confinements + weekend duties + 5 weeks of overseas training)</p>
              <p>+ i was one of the bloody last batches of 2 1/2 years. There were people who enlisted later than me ... that ord-ed earlier than me.</p>
              <p>So .. i really cannot sympathise with you. imho you are very very very very blessed. Sorry.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>Don't think the gals have much sympathy to spare. From what I've read here, seems more like he's unwilling to change or adapt to his surroundings. And to TS: if you want change in your life, you hafta change. When you change, things around you will change - and that's coz you'll see things differently.</div>

              <p>Why the need to fuck him up? Needless....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But I would say that coldzero, u really sounded like a mummy's boy. Need to toughen up more mentally. Lower ur pride and go make more friends....When we think others are self-centred, are we looking at others thru our rose tinted pupils? Almost always than not, that's normally the case. Could you be focusing too much on yourself that you are not able to make friends there?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>NS clerical work is nothing compared to the harsher real working world.....no matter what mistakes you do, you won't be sacked. (Well of course, you wished you could be sacked right lol)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Start to make more friends and you will realise some of them are the ones who will help you thru ur NS life. I'm sure every NS bro here have their good NS pals and they will not disagree with me. It's 2 years, make the best out of this misery my friend.</p>
