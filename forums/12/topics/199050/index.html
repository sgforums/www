            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>Would like to get some advice from fellow forumites here... I am currently at the mid-career stage working in the health industry.  I have been in this MNC company for more than 3 years now. When I first join the company, I was really hardworking and managed to promote to a higher rank in just 2 years. I learned from my colleagues that it would usually take 3-4 years before one can be promoted as it is the norm here. That said, after the first 2 years, I am beginning to slack. Not sure of the reason why but I dun really have the interest to work hard anymore.  Even after I had successfully requested for a transfer, my attitude in the new position does not change.<br><br>Now, I am contemplating quitting just to rest and take my time to look for a new job and ponder over my aspiration.  However, I have my financial commitments... such as car loan, and the upcoming mortgage loan.  Also, I would not want to end up earning less than my peers.. as I currently command quite a good salary (I know this is kinda stupid and kiasu).<br><br>PLease advise... Thanks.</div>

Or maybe the loss of interest due to your bosses or those above you can also be a reason.<br><br>Or maybe u are just bored of your job. But ask urself whether u can find a better job or not.
