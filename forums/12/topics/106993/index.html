But i think i only sms her 1 or twice a week. Last time, most of the time she will be the one who sms me first and i will just reply her. Maybe coz last time i dun like to be the first to sms her that is y she got bored and resulted in the "cold" attitude.</div>

The results are actually quite interesting. When they know that you're chasing them back, they'll usually slack off a bit, cause they've got you in their hook~<br><br>That's when we're playing their game. Try to make yourself attractive(not just physically), and then they'll start chasing you again.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
