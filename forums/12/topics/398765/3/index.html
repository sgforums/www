              <p>First of all, who are these people? a) your family, b) good friends, c) casual friends, or d) people you don't consider your friends? If they even feel like "<strong>taking revenge</strong>" on you, I hope they're in group (d). If they are not in group (d), you must seriously ask yourself why are they even in group (b) and (c)!</p>
              <p>If they are in group (d), why do you bother wasting your energy and time thinking of them?? :)</p>
              <p>Thoughts carry energy, either positive or negative. The less negative thoughts you have all the time, everyday, the happier you'll become. Don't just take my words for it. Try it consistently, and experience it for yourself!</p>

              <p><br>True, but caution must be taken not to try and dictate our expectations on others. It's a <strong>VERY</strong> common problem where self-righteous folks think someone else has a certain weakness, and tries to force his way to make the other person change, or over-critisize the other person, when he himself has the same weakness or even more weaknesses within himself. It's a common case of self-denial of personal faults.</p>
              <p>First of all, everyone should try to ensure we're ready first, before we try to 'teach' others. If we're not healed ourselves, we should not try to heal others. Then there'll be so much less conflicts. Such conflicts happen at all levels in this world, from person-to-person to country-to-country level.</p>

              <p>But why are you carrying around a hard shell around in your life?? Isn't it a burden? :)</p>
              <p>Protective shells are often a make-believe external image that you wish to portray to the world, to hide and protect your inner and true self, usually out of fear of being hurt or discovered. When you're prepared to improve your inner and true self, you'll have no fear to show it to the world, and you can drop that shell forever.</p>
              <p>When people come together in genuine communication without any pretences, or protective shells, the relationships (friendship/family/romantic) will progress much better.</p>

              <p>My apologies. Thought you're referring to yourself. hehe...</p>
              <p>Of course, it takes practice, and effort, as it's often so much easier to just critisize people than compliment people (genuinely). But it'll definitely pay off for you and people around you. :)</p>
              <p>People who often have behavioural or personality issues, usually have a root cause that started the whole thing, way back in their past, either childhood times, or even past lives. So, it's not always fair to blame people for the way they are now, as often, they really can't help it, as it has gone into their subconscious mind. Actually, this affects almost everyone, whether we realise it or not.</p>

              <p><br>It's a good start that you can at least see goodness in people. Many people have goodness-blindness, no matter how good the other person is. :)</p>
              <p>The next steps are to be forgiving towards others, and work on your own weaknesses as well, as no one is perfect. I'm sure you'll want others around you to also appreciate you for the goodness in you, and not just focus on your weaknesses.</p>
