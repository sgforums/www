(I mean, it's quite obvious if he did, he wouldn't be pondering whether he could "make it" based on the list of activities listed). <strong>In essence, this is more a post that addresses the threadstarters' point of view rather than it being a general thread on what constitutes success.</strong><br><br>Heng@ : Ja, ich spreche Deutsch, aber ich konversiere selten in Deutsch.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> Ihr 'etwas' Deutsch ist nicht schlecht - Sie sind besser als viele AnfÃ¤nger.
