I'd be keen to know their budgets.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> ).

Just as he made the bold decision of plucking an untested Schumacher from Jordan - in fact, right under Eddie Jordan's nose which explains the hardly-cordial relationship the pair shared when both were still in F1 - after just one race brought Benetton success of unprecendeted proportions, he has made the same decision with Alonso which has reaped handsome dividends yet again...<br><br>Right, saying that, I'm no fan of Schumacher who, in my mind, remains one of the most unscrupulous - albeit successful - characters in F1.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by walesa:</div><div class="quote_body">Toyota had a grand 5-year plan when they first embarked on entering F1(I do not know if they've actually put that in place, especially given their less-than-promising - by the standards they'd set for themselves - achievements), but no one comes close to touching Ferrari/McLaren's budget which comes close to half a billion annually(have you got the figures for the other big players? I'd be keen to know their budgets.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> ). Prior to Toyota's entry, BAR had the third largest budget, although their results not commensurating with their ambitious goals resulted in them cutting back on their spending subsequently(started with the release of Jacques Villeneuve I believe).<br><br>Renault F1 operate on a budget similar to Benetton's and Benetton were never world beaters in fiscal terms even in their heyday when Schumacher took them to the back-to-back titles in '94 and '95 - in a nutshell, the success of Benetton and now Renault can very much be attributed to Briatore's eye for talent. Just as he made the bold decision of plucking an untested Schumacher from Jordan - in fact, right under Eddie Jordan's nose which explains the hardly-cordial relationship the pair shared when both were still in F1 - after just one race brought Benetton success of unprecendeted proportions, he has made the same decision with Alonso which has reaped handsome dividends yet again...<br><br>Right, saying that, I'm no fan of Schumacher who, in my mind, remains one of the most unscrupulous - albeit successful - characters in F1.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"> </div></blockquote>Toyota has a budget of about 500 million. Trust me. Even Ferrari and McLaren can't touch them.<br><br>Last report by F1 Racing, based on financial reports filed at Companies House, and projected forward to offer a representative outlay:<br><br>2005 Budgets<br><br>Toyota: $499.05 mil<br>Ferrari: $432.98 mil<br>McLaren: $419.95 mil<br>BAR: $ 360.16 mil<br>BMW-Williams: $360.12 mil<br>Renault: $287.81 mil<br>Sauber: 161.32 mil<br>Red Bull: $139.22 mil<br>Jordan: $104.20 mil<br>Minardi: $50.31 mil<br><br>Toyota protested to the article run by F1 Racing, and said their figures were closer to Renault's about $300 mil. When this revised figure was put to a senior member of McLaren who's a personal friend of the journalist, the McLaren man actually giggled. The journalist also put the revised figure to another personal friend, a senior figure in Renault, and he got a "spare me please" look in response to the revised figures. another senior figure in a back of the grid team responded "bollocks" outright.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
