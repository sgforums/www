I know it is easier said than done. But it is worth the while, parents will somehow understand that their child has grown up.

            <div class='col-md body'>your mother is just scared that you turn bad lah. sometimes the problem isnt with u. perhaps when she was young she saw alot of guys turn bad then it somewhat got imprinted in her mind and she decided to not go wrong on her son. she's simply erring on the side of caution. but really TS, look at yourself and compare yourself to the rest of the people your age. you must agree that no matter how unreasonable your mother may seem, she doesnt appear to screw up with u, at least in the character and academic aspect. you're clean, and have some success academically already.<br><br>and before u complain about ur mother, just think that there are worse cases out there. cite u an example. 2 weeks ago i organised a bbq with my frens at ECP. then 1 of my friend's ( 16 year old male ) mother didnt want him to go. then they got into an arguement, eventually his mother actually called me up a few times and asked me to tell him the outing was cancelled. and you know what were the reasons she gave for not letting him go?<br><br>1. o levels around the corner ( hello.. june - october? )<br>2. too near the sea, very dangerous ( i have nothing to say about this )<br>3. at night, also dangerous ( hello.. ends at 9.30pm )<br><br>maybe i could understand if my friend was a girl, but what the heck. there were girls at the bbq too and none of their parents created such a big ruckus.<br><br>so TS, appreciate everything you have, treat your mother's nagging as concern. it seems like its the only way she knows how to show her love for you. and be grateful that she isnt the worst out there</div>
