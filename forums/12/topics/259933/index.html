I use the word "nag" is actually to give a better impression on mothers...<br>I remember many years ago...<br>My mother badmouth me to my gf on the phone. Telling my gf that I have no future, gambler and always so late come back home... My gf told me after that. My gf also noes that what my mother say is not true coz it is not the truth. haha... until now... I still wonder y my mother do that. Probably, from my mother's point of view, she see that his son is really what as she say. Therefore, she wants to reduce his son's sins ... But I never  feel displeasure towards my mother. Coz, I noe my mother cares for her son.<br><br>The above case is much better than outside world. Haha... few care for u if u are against them. Therefore, u either have two ways. Follow them or Out smart them.</div>
