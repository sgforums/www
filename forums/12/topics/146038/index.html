            <div class='col-md body'>Recently, asked out a friend out for coffee and she told me the next day that she is 3 mths pregnant!! If she is around in her teens and gotten it, it would be devastating for her, but since she is in her 20s i suppose that she can deal with it like an adult.<br><br>Her ex bf and ex bf parents wanted her to abort the baby, she refused and her ex dumped her cos of that. knn, the guy is in his 20s too but then told her to do this outrageous thing!! knn i really pui chao nua to that guy.<br><br>but then she is a very intense person and highly emotional so I'm worried that she might do something stupid like... u know what i  mean right? So i told her that I am in no position to advise anything on the pregnancy but as her friend (i  have known her for 5 years now) i wish i could do something but i was afraid that i might say the wrong thing and she might get upset and do stupid things.<br><br>So can anyone advise??</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Stormie,<br><br>Ok, it's a relief to hear that she at least can look to her family for support, understanding &amp; help with the baby.  That's very important, it's Not good for her to be pregnant &amp; have her family screaming at her for wanting to keep the baby, the pressure would be enormous.<br><br>Unfortunately, there're some creeps in the world, people who go around planting their rotten seed, then disappear when the seed begins to sprout.  Next time, tell your friend to use contraception; condoms don't cost that much.<br><br>Since her family is providing her with the support she needs, then just be a friend to her, &amp; let her confide in you.  She'll naturally be very upset &amp; hurt that the guy turned out to be a jerk.  Counsel her to take care of herself &amp; the baby 1st &amp; foremost.  The rest can come later.  If the guy &amp; his family refuse to take any responsibility for the baby, there might be a legal way to make him take some responsibility?<br><br>If your friend needs legal help, let me know.  I might be able to furnish you with some contacts.<br><br>FeowFeow<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by stormie:</div><div class="quote_body">Hi feow feow,<br><br>she is the only child in the family so i reckon that her parents will support her decision to keep the baby.<br><br>i think in my own view, she wanted to marry this guy but its stupid lor.. know him for only short time then this happen, but its her decision anyway and besides she is an adult already should be mature enuff.<br><br></div></blockquote></div>
