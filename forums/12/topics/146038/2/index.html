            <div class='col-md body'>umm if she decides to be responsible for her action and give birth to the child...can she guar she can handle?? its very tough for being single parent and can she handle the stress bringing up a child by themselves, financially and many other prob ... can be a big problem...<br><br>if she give the child up for adoption....would she miss the child so much that she finds life miserable??<br><br>actually i think while its still early stage (not a baby yet), abortion is not necessary no good....cos being responsible does not necessary mean hv to give birth to the child....IMO<br><br>but of course she must understand that the action she takes is due to the circumstances she is in and must not look back and no point regretting....<br><br>if she can, to me the best solution is to abort....live on....just take it as a lesson of life....( i know its unfair for the girls but wat to do, our body is make with the giving birth equipment....when u find the rite one....this birth equipment is a great joy to hv...but not when u met the wrong fellow.)<br><br>sigh....hope your friend finds her 'rite' decision soon...and move on....<br><br>some guys are really DAMN IT!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by highway69:</div><div class="quote_body">Have the baby and get pregnant again.Love pregnant sex.</div></blockquote>reminds me of this show toking about this 'marriage' culture of one village in China...when the girl reach a certain age (16 i think)....she will be given a room with a back door...so when she likes a man or a man likes her....the man can find her house and enter her room thru the back door...one per nite of course....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>she will bear the babies and bring them up with her parents' help..the man has no obligation to come back to find her or be responsible for the child..and so if one man truly loves to be with her forever...they just remain these ways till they are old lor....living together in her room.(no wedding ceremony)...and with kids bore with other man/men all living together in harmony.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i think the guy thinks that he have no money to support the baby thats why he dumped her. N he told her earlier to abort the baby? She refuse to listen. They have no money to support the baby y he wants the keep it n let the baby suffer in this world? he is not ready for it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">  humm...</div>
