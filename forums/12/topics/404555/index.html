              <p>Just a word of friendly advice: You may like to work on your Self Ego issue first, then girls may find you more suitable as a long-term partner, instead of just a friend to hang around with. Your issue has nothing to do with curses or whatever.</p>
              <p>When you're the most genuine guy you can be, you'll attract the best girl who's suited for you. When you're not the most genuine guy you can be, you'll also attract the girl who's most suited for your personality, by Law of Attraction. Life is about your personal choices. :)</p>

              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"> Why even mystify a rejection to that of a curse? And seemed like you made a number of assumptions, which imho may not accurate through the eyes of her perceived reality.</p>
              <p>Surely there are reason/s for rejection - just because you don't understand doesn't mean it doesn't exist.</p>
              <p>Your perception that you are good enough is not as important as whether she feels that you are needed. From a marketing perspective, an excellent product may be a good, but if there is no need, naturally there will be no sale.</p>
