              Mind is running wild lately.. Had an annual body checkup and came across a charismatic doctor. He reminds me of my company doctor 5 years back.. Visited that doc every few mths for blood test, cough flu etc. After seeing him for 1yr he popped a really funny question. He asked me if I understand the specification data of a car engine chip. :D I remembered I was extremely stunned. Ok. I m a female engineer. And he is a pretty cute boyish looking doc. We started talks abt cars and he did show off a bit of what he knew.
              Anyway after I walked out of his room I had the feeling that he is looking for excuse to talk to me coz usu its juz the routine of q&amp;a. Anyway he kept me thinkg for a few days.. Didn't he see my wedding ring I was thinking.. I got to see him for just one more time and he was transferred to somewhere else..
              
              Sometimes I wonder.. What if I was single at that time.. Will he date me? He almost disclose his car plate number told me what car his uncle drive.. Pretty much for 15mins. :D. But is it right for doctor to do so?..mm.. Now here is this not so cute but pretty charismatic doc.. Makes me miss my cute doctor now... :).. And makes me wonder if I m going through midlife crisis where life is getting predictable and boring.. Or is it just me who fantasizes too much... Mm.. What if what if..
