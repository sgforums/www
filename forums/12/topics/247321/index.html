The girl must decide for herself what is good for her...<br><br>Anyway you got try talking to your best friend or not? Try to understand his point of view too instead of listening to the girl only. At least you cannot be accused of being an a**hole..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Between honor and fondness for your god sister, it must had been hard to make a decision.<br><br>Actually in my humble opinion, there isn't any extreme right nor wrong. It is very much a grey situation that you're in.<br><br>I feel that unless you deliberately seduce or lead your god sister to like you and all, then it's unhonorable. But well, if your conscience is clear. Then prepare to face the music like a man, be honest to your friend and be a friend enough to support and lead him out of this nasty situation.<br><br>Last piece of advice is that do not be impulsive - remember every decision, every step you choose to take will trigger another series of events. So take time to ponder and ponder and ponder till you're sure about things.<br><br>Good luck with your situation, may you have enough wisdom and calm to go through this little obstacle in life.<br><br>Detached</div>
