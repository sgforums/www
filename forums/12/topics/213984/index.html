            <div class='col-md body'>Well... I am not in your shoes so I not sure how "pek chek" you really are, but if you really cannot take it then take a break and go out for a holiday. Let them do all you did in the house and for the family. From what you said, you deserve a GOOD break. BUT its up to you to decide what you really want to do. You are afterall venting out and may go back to what you did as always after venting.<br><br>Some parents don't know how to appreciate what their children are doing and some children do not appreciate what their parents are doing. Different people requires different methods to let them understand what is being done and should be blessed and appreciated.<br><br>I, for instance, appreciate what my family is contributing and I do my fair share for the family too. I love my family. No matter how weird they can behave at times, I still love them. Don't let this negligance or unappreciation or whatever you want to call it affect your love for your family.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Stop and ask yourself why you r doing all yje things you do - housework, taking care of your mon, your sister, etc, etc......... I believe it is out of pure love coz I dun think wnyone will do all these things for nothing, let alone get brickbats. So if iyour doing everything is out of your love, why bother if you dun get the recognition and praise? The people around you might be blind but I'm sure God has eyes that see.

            <div class='col-md body'>Sry to hear abt that, girl.  My sis faced bias as a middle child.  I'm the eldest.  Luckily, we get along v well and I've helped her get past the bias by sharing my "spoils" and not taking advantage of the bias ^^.<br><br>A person who does not acknowledge your efforts may actually appreciate it, but never really thought that you need to hear the appreciation.  A common situation can be summed up this way : "But you know mummy loves you, whaaat (surprised face)."<br><br>Then again, the favouritism towards ur sis might be coz she's given ur mom grandkids and therefore her contribution to the family outweighs yours because she has "earned her keep".<br><br>These responses really depend on the type of person your mom is.  Try to communicate with her more often ( diplomatically and gently ) to tell her how you feel and understand what she wants.  You may be surprised at the response you get.<br><br>I think a good direction would be to try and establish your independence by forging a career for yourself and/or maybe marrying/having kids if you want.  That way, you can be "grown up" in the eyes of your mom and earn more respect within the household ^^</div>
