              <p>Hi Everyone,</p>
              <p>After these weeks of consideration I think I have a problem, but it look I m a irresponsible person. For many mistake I done and hurt someone I love, somehow I really felt I m a idiot.... For that perhap I really get no chances to be a good husband and a good father anymore. The way I try talking to her it really sound end of the realationship.</p>
              <p>I myself having some problem that I just realise whenever I make mistake I just keep quiet. But becos of my this problem in the end ppl around think i m a dishonest guy. For myself I just felt very sorry and do not dare to face them, if you ask me to talk to them I cant perform I cant speak, in the end I alway chose slient walk a side letting those who know and understand me be the one accept who I m. For my  character it hurt alot of ppl, I dun explain much I kept everything inside me. But ppl around me know whether I m happy or sad, still remember last few day a fren of my asking me a simple question. What wrong with me for the past few month, and I couldnt explain to him. That fren knew me for many years told me, I have a problem that is I dun say things out any problem alway kept to myself. Even the person that closest to me also dun understand me well.</p>
              <p>I letting my wife labour alone in the hospital, I letting her down so many times. And in the past her family member trying to stop us to be together, but she insisted to be with me. And for that I promise myself to fight whatever I have my last breath for someeone who trusted me so much. But things changed when I failed in my biz and even letting my own family looking down on me. My cousin said I m not good in biz I have not material for that, but before that when started and everything was going to be smoothly he said one day you be there.( The world is so true to me that someone I admirer saying words that hurt) Plus my wife saying that before starting the biz it not easy you not sure you can make it that day. I just need to hear some postive words but nothing hear. I falled Im lost that period and from the way I saw her family member I alway kept quiet by a side. I m a failure that dun dare to face the truth and face everyone. I alway choose to avoid everyone that asking me question how your biz. But when she sleeping beside me, while she closing her eye I kiss on her forehead and say (I can make it one day, I love you dear gd night).... Alway doing something that ohters never see, never hear from my mouth.</p>
              <p>I alway wanted to provide my family the best and comfortable life. But because of my insist I sometime taking too much risk for thinking really fast earning money. It alway a bizman game the more risk you took the more risk u end. But those who have capital will feel alittle pain but for those without will feel like it end of the world just like me lost. And that really hurting the people around me, and the ppl that care about me. But where on earth that ppl understand me.</p>
              <p>Now I lost my wife my kid!!!!!!!!!!!!! I lose to her to be honest to all of you............... There time I felt like dying but there too many unsettle things to me, I kept myself alive after I had finish I think I really will end it. Anyway everythings had been place in order my dad and mum was divored so dad home under my sis mum home will be under my bro. haha........ Since young I already make this planning......... Now I just want to try to treat her good and the baby as much as I can. They mean alot to me i dun think anyone here understand how much I had been through.</p>
              <p>I flying the highest once and drop all the way to the bottom.</p>
              <p>A never give up guy to finish my mission and leave. Maybe my time really left not much? Im going to settle most of my things soon like now setting up a beauty salon for my mum and my sis so in future maybe they can make a living out of it.</p>
              <p>What can I do to let me show I treat them(wife&amp;kids) nicer, like she alway reject me nowaday. So what can I do?  Im not a romanti man by the way, I dunno what is surprise and never give surprise to any girls before.</p>
              <p>Regards,</p>
              <p>Ricky</p>

              <p>Your havn't lost your kid yet lah.</p>
              <p>As long as your wife is not remarried , you still got chance.</p>
              <p>She reject you.. is because she is still angry about what you did to her.</p>
              <p>You abandoned her during the times she needed you most.</p>
              <p>Women will hold grudges for many years.. you just need to ride this out, patiently.</p>
              <p>Just continue to be the doting and supportive father to your daughter.</p>
              <p>She will see with her eyes, that you are a changed man and is now a responsible father.</p>
              <p>After all, she had a child with you. She also hope her child will have a good father, someone who will not run away and hurt the child again.</p>
              <p>Slowly, don't rush.. once she see you are now a solid provider , she may change her mind.</p>
              <p>Build a solid relationship with your daughter, most important now.</p>
