            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Chapter 10 (Part I)</strong></span><br><br>Rick thudded onto the cement-paved floor, face down. I could see his fingers wriggling weakly, attempting to muster some strength to pick himself upÂ… again. Rick was bleeding from corners of his lips and I could see him grating his teeth in futile fury.<br><br>I was physically restrained by three girls, with their hands over my mouth, insofar as to shield my maddening screams from blasting outwardly. I swung my arms randomly and kicked wildly, but was completely defeated in my attempt to rush forth and stop that brute from hurting Rick.<br><br>My eyes widened and swelled with tears as I could see the brute curling into a derisive smile, eagerly crushing RickÂ’s fingers beneath his worn-out Converse shoes like a helpless roach. I tried pleading, but my voice was lost beneath several thick layers of flesh and drops of tears were pressured to gush out of my eyes like a rueful maiden. Rick cried out in pain and his other hand immediately clutched the bruteÂ’s ankle, as if trying to push away his leg to release his tortured hand.<br><br>Â‘POLICE COMING!!Â’<br><br>I was freed from Â‘imprisonmentÂ’ and fell helplessly to the ground. The gang of assailants vanished as soon as they appeared, running helter skelter in separate directions. Crawling pathetically toward Rick, I reached for his uninjured hand and held it to my chest.<br><br>Rick didnÂ’t say anything, except to smile faintly. Even in times like this, he is still wearing that cheery faÃ§ade. His breathing was heavy, although there was some sense of relief in his rhythm.<br><br>By stroke of luck and ironically, it was the irritable family from sixth floor whom discovered the commotion and called the police. I saw the pesky kid running towards me, trying to help us up. In that blurry flash, suddenly, pesky kid looked so lovable and affectionate.<br><br>Â‘Oh my goodness, gangsters around our estate? The police better do something about it!Â’ exclaimed the mother from sixth floor.<br><br>(To be continued...)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Chapter 10 (Part II)</strong></span><br><br>I was in the hospital, still partially dazed from the unfortunate event. My eyes were staring, with no particular focus upon the alabaster-like wall right in front of me. Beside me stood a Filipino nurse attending to my wounds, wrapping and applying whatever necessary on my wounds. Though I felt burning sensation sizzling around my injuries, itÂ’s nothing compared to the anguish of seeing Rick getting hit in attempt to protect me.<br><br>Â‘HowÂ’s the other guy?Â’ I managed to snap from my drifting thoughts and constructed a sentence.<br><br>Â‘I donÂ’t know,Â’ said the nurse in her Filipino ascent, Â‘but heÂ’s over at the other room.Â’<br><br>As I lumbered my way towards the direction pointed by the nurse, my hands were desperately trying to find any form of reachable support to assist me, as the next worst thing that could happen to me is a bad fall and I want to prevent that.<br><br>Then I heard some blabbering hostile voice as I turned into the room. I paused by the door Â– a feisty woman, probably in her forties, was blasting her frustration and anger at a familiar figure.<br><br>The figure was Rick.<br><br>The woman swung her hands aggressively with every spoken word, completely displeased with the response she gets from Rick. Rick was silent, but his eyes had a defiant spirit, despite the rain of words the lady threw at him - she never did break his composure.<br><br>Suddenly, my feet felt ponderous; it seemed hesitated to inch anywhere further.<br><br>Â‘I donÂ’t understand why would you get into a fight like these? Have you been mixing with the wrong company? I know that dad and mum is busy at times, but that doesnÂ’t mean you have the prerogative to act like hooligans and fight like one?Â’<br><br>Â‘MumÂ… how many times have I explained that I DID NOT INITIATE THE FIGHT! I saw my friend getting hit by a group of <span style="font-style: italic;">ah lians</span>, obviously I canÂ’t leave her in the lurch right?Â’<br><br>Â‘You could have called the police Â– why take matters into your own hands? What if they had weapons with them? Do you know how dangerous that is? What if they hurt you with it? You could have died you know?<br><br>Rick folded his arms defensively and lowered his head a little.<br><br>Â‘These gangsters are crazy, they can waste their life fighting because they donÂ’t know what they want to do with their life. Son, THIS IS SINGAPORE! There is simply no room for trash like these. The next moment you will see some of these kids in the Straits Times committing bigger crimes and being a regular patron in jail. I donÂ’t want you to have any connection with such people nor lifestyle. You are a doctor-to-be and these people are going to be laborers, cleaners or end up salvaging drink cans from the trash bins in the future: you are not going to be like them.Â’<br><br>Â‘Mom, you are not being rationalÂ…Â’<br><br>Â‘Rational? Son, I telling you that your mum is being rational here. And who is this friend you are protecting? And pray tell me how do you know her?<br><br>My mind screamed an intuitive warning, but I lagged a second; Rick caught my presence and his eyes softened a little. Sensing the change in his visage, her mum looked over her shoulder and caught me standing by the door before I could escape out of view. Our gaze met and I could literally see her scrutinizing every fabric of my skin and clothing, like how my mum would check the freshness of fish at the wet market.<br><br>Â‘I donÂ’t remember seeing her at church Â– who is she?Â’<br><br>Â‘She just a friendÂ’s friend. I knew her from Alvin.Â’<br><br>Â‘ThatÂ’s a good attempt at lying son. Have you forgotten that aunty Celine is your mumÂ’s best friend? And noÂ… Alvin do not have <span style="font-style: italic;">such </span>friends.Â’<br><br>RickÂ’s mum then walked up to me, all the while gazing deep into my eyes. I was rooted at where I was standing, completely immobilized as if I was trapped by some formidable evil magic.<br><br>Â‘GirlÂ… I donÂ’t know how you have gotten to know Rick, but it doesnÂ’t matter actually.

And working? Why are you working? What are your parents doing?Â’<br><br>I grew extremely uncomfortable with her interrogation because I know her mum is trying to prove a point to her son about a wretched being like myself.<br><br>I did not answer her; I just spun around and ran towards the nearest stairs.<br><br>(To be continued...)</div>
