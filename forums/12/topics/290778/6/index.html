            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Chapter 11</strong></span><br><br>I ran.<br><br>I did not halt.<br><br>I did not speed.<br><br>I just ran and ranÂ… almost into oblivion of my surrounding and background. I whizzed passed countless of people and cars; bypass several weird stares darting into my way and even almost myself into an accident when a motorcycle precariously steered into my path. Fortunately, the driver narrowly missed ramming me down, but then again, even if he did, at that moment, it seriously doesnÂ’t really matter. Or at least that was how I felt so.<br><br>I donÂ’t know why I was so overly affected by the dialogue with his mum. Perhaps, her words did revealed certain subconscious self doubts; though I did not agree with her views, yet at the same time, I did not have the space to retort or defend myself. I stood there helplessly and got sheared relentlessly by the truth of her words, enlightening me about the very reality of our society. She didnÂ’t say anything I didnÂ’t understood; in fact every nuance of her sarcasm inevitably exposed a portion of my inferior complex, leaving it vulnerable for any siege attack. RickÂ’s mum managed to personify every aspect of my unloving life into something so ghastly negative in perception that I realized I cannot withstand seeing a wretched person like myself being around the man I adore.<br><br>It was like a street beggar claming that the king was once his best friend Â– utterly unimaginable.<br><br>She wasnÂ’t right, but ironically, she wasnÂ’t wrong as well.<br><br>Â‘Ouch!Â’<br><br>One uncle bumped into me recklessly as he was frantically trying to flag down the fleeting bus; I fell on my bump painfully.<br><br>Then I could see the bus driver glancing from the corner of his eyes at him, but he spare little sympathy to stop for this man. Checking the blind spot on his right, the bus driver switched lane and drove away. The uncle gave me an unapologetic look at me, as if I was the reason for his failure to board the bus and that itself Â‘even outÂ’ the accident.<br><br>Nobody bothered about me; I sat on the ground for almost one full minute, watching several pairs of shoes, slippers and sandals marched passed me. No helpÂ… no assistanceÂ… no nothing. People probably thought I must be some kind of nutcase and typically preferred to mind their own business.<br><br>It finally dawned to me that I can only learn to fend for myself in this acrimonious world where status matters much more than anything else, because nobody will give a damn about your plight if you are just some peasant trying to survive in this world owned by elites or people segmented as part of the upper tier in society.<br><br>Even love, which I once held its image so highly, has succumbed to the twisted yardstick of our society.<br><br>Or perhaps, I had finally grown up.<br><br>And I thought I <span style="font-style: italic;">could </span>love him?<br><br>Â‘<span style="font-style: italic;">What a bizarre thought</span>,Â’ I said to myself as I recalled my unworthy affection, before getting up.<br><br>I saw the uncle lighting up a cigarette and puffing away. Suddenly, I had the urge to smoke as well - this is especially so whenever I experienced a drastic change in mood. Emotional stress never fails to remind me about my cigarette break, but before I reached for my Â‘box of comfortÂ’, I saw the same uncle, slipping his left hands in his pocket and fidgeting the content. Drawing out and opening his palm, a deep furrow lined his temple as he examined the coins he retrieved from his pocket. Then his right index finger went over each individual coins, with his lips silently counting them, as if he was making sure that the amount is correct.<br><br>I realized I saw a mirror image of myself in that scene - whenever a pretty apparel dazzled me with its beauty and elegance, but hesitated my impulse with its retail price, I will somewhat demonstrate similar behavior Â– the same flow of calculations, thoughts and action.<br><br>I have never seen Rick exhibiting that sort of consideration before. Life to him is about whether he <span style="font-style: italic;">wants</span> it and not whether he can afford it.<br><br>Because the latter is never an issue.<br><br>Never.<br><br>We are such vast world apart; I reckoned the distance between Heaven and Earth might probably seemed nearer.<br><br>A drop of tear rolled down from my cheek.<br><br>Was I hurt?<br><br>Or had I finally see the light?<br><br>(To be continued...)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Chapter 12</strong></span><br><br>I didnÂ’t know how long I had cried the other day; it felt like eternity. The feeling of this gruesome sorrow felt like some deathly furnace that screamed unspeakable pain.<br><br>DadÂ’s temper has gotten worst these days; I deduced that it was due to his reduction in his beer intake. He has been complaining of chest pain and every time when mum tried to sympathize with him, he will make a lousy attempt at extortion again, since there wasnÂ’t any cash lying around for him to fiche. Wonders how stupid can he gets; how much can one pilferage from an environment with limited resources?<br><br>If this wasnÂ’t Singapore, it would be so much cheaper to buy a shotgun and shoot him, than to allow this leech to drain us financially and emotionally.<br><br>I lifted the curtains aside and stared out at the open window. Today, the night sky certainly looked gloomy.<br><br>It was exactly one week since I last saw Rick in the hospital. I recalled mum was so worried when she saw me in wounds and tears, but when I gave her a donÂ’t-show-me-concern look, she kept quiet.<br><br>My mum is simply weak beyond imagination Â– she even feared her children. With zero mote of courage, thereÂ’s simply no way she could sign the divorce letter in hoping to escape this hellhole, short of killing herself and gamble a chance to reincarnate in better environment.<br><br>Dad often claimed that when mum had me in her wombs, he implored my mum to abort me. It was my brother, nine years my senior, who fought with him to keep me alive. Yes, a nine years old kid telling his dad not to abort his sister away and as a result, getting slapped in his act of honorable defiance.<br><br>And it is also the very brother whom disowned his own the family and left without a word or contact.<br><br>I closed my eyes and saddened at the thought of this family tragedy. I did not blame him because he already did what he could and itÂ’s time to pursue a life that he needs.<br><br>ThatÂ’s why I told myself, I will never be like my mother. Never! I would rather be self reliant, independent and firm.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Â‘I am sorryÂ…Â’ </span>- It was an SMS from Rick and the ring tone broke my chain of thoughts.<br><br>I fiddled with my phone, with my thumb brushing gently against the keypad of my phone, wondering how should I reply him.
