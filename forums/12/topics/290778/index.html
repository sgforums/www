            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all,<br><br>This year has indeed been a fast year and unknowingly, I have been your Mod for about half a year. Firstly, I would like to apologize for my seeming lack of presence at times because my schedule now and beyond is really really really very busy and it will not reduce any bits.<br><br>And every year I always ask myself: what do I want to share you forumers here?<br><br>Usually, I will upload a story to share with you guys and therefore, for the year of 2007, the time has come.<br><br>Another thing to note is that because of my very busy schedule from this year onwards, I am afraid this might be just one of the last story I will upload. I may try to upload if I have the time to write again, but chances are slim - 24 hrs is really too little for yunhaier.<br><br>Also, I will try to upload an 1 original song composition for my story.<br><br>As always, please forgive me for language errors and stuff - it's only meant to be a simple story - not some great work.<br><br>Those who are interested can read and follow on. I will upload one chapter (or a part of one chapter) approximately every 2-3 days.<br><br>Remember to drop a post in here, so that I can personally thank you for following this through at the end of the story.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Yunhaier</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Chapter 1 </strong></span><br><br>ItÂ’s another typical day. So awfully insipid and uneventful that it almost became like a replica of yesterday. School was dead boring and nothing within the boundary of school seemed to interest me. I lit my Marlboro cigarette in one secluded school toilet and quickly puff the stick away before discovery.<br><br>I was an ah lian, joined some small time street gang and left, but still wrongfully labeled as a potential delinquent by my form teacher, Mrs. Seow. But as far as I am concerned, she is just being plain bias towards me. I dreaded attending her class and it tormented me as much as it did for her. Apart from being just as drudging as everything else in school, she has a knack of making me drowsy during lesson. Because of that, I dozed off several occasions because my eyelid refused to heed to my mental command of keeping it wide open. She said that I was disrespectful and the worst caliber of students she ever taught.<br><br>Well, who cares?<br><br>Although schooling, I am already encumbering my own financial responsibility at the age of fifteen. I had to work to pay for my school fee, educational needs and meal allowance. I remembered there was once I refused to purchase text books because I see no point in buying something I have no use for. I preferred to study my subject using notes and that notion almost got me into a heated argument with her.<br><br>Â‘You are incorrigible!Â’<br><br>Well, who cares? She never understands anyway.<br><br>The only moment I truly cherish is the time after school. Nope, it has nothing to do with CCA (in fact, I donÂ’t have any CCA to speak of as well. No time for MOEÂ’s gimmick of making sure that students spent their time adequately and Â‘constructively) - itÂ’s when I start work. Albeit the pay isnÂ’t anything fantastic, the money is enough to get my life going. And more importantly, I can leave the perimeter of the school and that kept me sane for the rest of the day.<br><br>I was planning to conclude my shop for the day, but Rick is still lurking around, gazing at our collection of Bear Bricks Â– a series of collectable toys that could fetch some good money in the collectorsÂ’ market, if anyone has gotten their hands on some of those limited ones. Also, it depends on the size of it Â– 100% refers to the standard size, followed by 400% (four times the size of the ordinary version) and 1000% (ten times).<br><br>Â‘How much for the 100% Kaws Bearbrick?Â’<br><br>Â‘Sorry RickÂ… thatÂ’s not for saleÂ…Â’<br><br>Â‘WahÂ… then why are displaying it when you have no intention to sell it?Â’<br><br>Â‘You how it works, you got to ask my boss about thisÂ…Â’<br><br>Rick sighed. This chap, standing seven feet tall and probably the same age as me, had the mien of some rich man son and I am probably right: the clothes and shoes he wore were of underground labels and that alone revealed almost one thousand worth in retail value. Of course, beyond those exquisite brands, he had deep sunken eyes with speaks. He had fair complexion Â– probably not the very sporty sort of guy. His deliberately-kept fringe swept over his forehead, with threads of copper-brown hair rested neatly on his eyebrow.<br><br>And Rick is a regular customer of mine.<br><br>He was here three nights ago and spent two hundred over bucks on those Bear Bricks. I thought that was madness. Two hundreds over bucks for those little toys? It could probably sustain my living for two to three weeks! My goodness. ItÂ’s crazy, knowing how people splurged their money.<br><br>Rick stood on akimbo while his gaze remained affixed on the 100% Kaws figurine, looking rather disappointed. That demeanor reminded me so much an image of a little boy, refusing to leave sight of his Â‘toyÂ’ Â– even when mummy says no.<br><br>Â‘Hey Rick, we are closing, but I got some good news for you: few days later, we are importing 1000% Â‘MastermindÂ’ Bear Brick. If you are really interested, you can pop by and reserve your set with down a payment.Â’<br><br>Â‘I can pay now actuallyÂ…Â’<br><br>Â‘But my boss strictly mentioned that we can only accept reservation and payment on that day to ensure fairness.Â’<br><br>Â‘Come on IvyÂ… itÂ’s not that you donÂ’t know me. Being your loyal and regular customer, I should have at least some perks?Â’<br><br>I leaned over and whispered into his ears.<br><br>Â‘Ok la, I will guarantee one place for you. Drop by one day earlier - leave your particulars down, so I can fill in for you when the reservation is open for public.Â’<br><br>(to be continued...)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Chapter 2</strong></span><br><br>My blank mind grew ponderous, like a sinking ship struck by a torpedo, with every inch closer back home. I deliberately slowed my pace, deluding myself in that sense that I wouldnÂ’t reach home so quickly. But how long can one stall time for a destination only a couple of minutes distance from the MRT station? Although a day of hard work can tired one easily, such fatigue is nothing compared to that of an emotional version. I would rather be shagged out physically, than to be gelded unscrupulously by my twisted life, threatening to suck every mote of essence in me.<br><br>I abhorred that feeling.<br><br>The moment I pushed the door open, a pair of hostile eyes was staring at me. It was dad, grasping a can of Tiger beer in his right hand and a remote controller on the other. Streaks of the gold liquid burst above the beer can like a geyser as dad tightened his hands around the can, demonstrating his usual annoyance.<br><br>Â‘Why you home so late?Â’<br><br>Â‘I had to studyÂ…Â’<br><br>I didnÂ’t even looked at him in the eye (I never wanted to), but I could sense his eyes trailing me with suspicion.<br><br>Â‘STUDY? SO LONG? STUDY SO LONG ALSO FAIL! STUDY FOR WHAT? GO WORK LAÂ’<br><br>My room door shut abruptly behind me and unfortunately, just enough to catch his last statement.<br><br>I ditched my bag on my marble flooring and hurled myself onto the bed. For the past one year, it was toilsome trying to hide my employment away from my ever prying-dad. Not that he would yell at me for working; on the contrary, he would be delighted about the extra stream of income, so that he could kindly extort it from me.<br><br>I used to envy other peopleÂ’s father, on being a positive role model and showering their kids with plethora of love and money. I never knew how it felt in that sense Â– a loving dad being a loving dad. Mine is the classic abusive dad that squandered the family resources and created domestic tragedy. My brother stormed out of home and never returned ever since he had an intense argument with dad, followed by few exchanged of fists. Dad fractured his arm during the confrontation and almost went to the police in rage to report his own son. If not for mumÂ’s teary intervention, this case would probably hit front page of The Newpaper, having the unfortunate opportunity of wishing our dirty linen in public.<br><br>Then a sharp shriek echoed audibly outside my room. I cuddled my piglet bolster and pulled my blanket nearer to my painful ears, trying my best not to be bothered by whatÂ’s going on outside the peaceful perimeter in my room. I wouldnÂ’t wish to trade the serenity I am enjoying within the boundary of this room to resolve the impossible out in that Â‘battlefieldÂ’. It wouldnÂ’t be too difficult to guess what dad was doing Â– boisterously trying to demand money from mum again. Mum would be pleading him (sometimes on her injured knees) not to take those valuables and waste a visit to some of these drabs down at the Geylang wh<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>orehouse.<br><br>Both brother and I did, innumerous attempt, to persuade mum to leave that useless man I called Father, but her weak archetype personality and that conventional (read stupid) mindset prevented her from registering those words of wisdom into a possible option. She is the kind of woman man loved to abuse, or rather, the kind of woman which will attract abusively mate and would foolishly continue to accept her cursed destiny of being abused until the day she pass on.<br><br>The entire house rumbled for a moment as dad slammed the main door, following by gradually fading of footfall.<br><br>I shut my eyes and coerced myself to sleep.<br><br>(To be continued...)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Chapter 3</strong></span><br><br>School bell went into orgasmic mode; school was over. However, I had to stay behind for some mundane humanities project. I had already informed boss about working later and fortunately, he is very understanding.<br><br>It was pair work and I had conveniently opted for the girl sitting next to me: Jane, the most civil minded, going-by-the-book girl I have ever knew in my life. She is a prefect and we were classmates for almost four years. Initially, she reckoned that I was some notorious ah lian, and fettered herself from any interaction with me. It was only until last year, she got herself entangled with some self proclaimed ah lians by booking them and I got her out of the hot soup, literally.<br><br>I took down the leader of the pack single-handedly and came out of that brawl almost unscathed. The gang leader, Chanel, challenged me to a one-on-one fight at the nearest staircase and I obliged. The next moment? She was lying on the floor and crying, asking that I stop pounding on her. They were a bunch of girl bullies that thrived on intimidating the weak and I have always hated them to my guts. Jane was the catalysis for me to act and it wasnÂ’t because I was heroic - I just wanted to teach them a good lesson.<br><br>From then, we became good friends. Her dad is a wealthy business man and more importantly, she was the teachersÂ’ pet. My background was totally opposite of her and, I was the teacherÂ’s nightmare.<br><br>What an irony! But the camaraderie turned out to be incredible.<br><br>Chanel and her cronies marched along the corridor, peering into my class, often trying to seize any opportunities to screw me up. Sadly for her, I donÂ’t go for recess, preferring to stay in class to recuperate from academic torture. In that sense, Chanel was never able to sabotage me, during break, without me knowing.<br><br>Regardless, I am leaving this damned school soon. Once I completed my Â‘OÂ’ levels, all these trashes in my life will vanish simultaneously and I am looking forward to that.<br><br>I felt daggers staring and when I turned around to catch those stares, Chanel and her cronies would then put their gaze away from me, childishly pretending to adore the great sky, while disingenuously commenting about the recent vagary weather. Usually it doesnÂ’t bother me, but there was once I was having PMS and she did just that. I followed her to the toilet and inflicted bleeding lips and gums upon her before stepping out of the ladies.<br><br>Ironically, because of Â‘faceÂ’ issue, she would rather die than to report such matters to the teachers. Words will get around easily and eventually the world would know; Chanel would rather suicide than to allow herself such ignominy.<br><br>I am not someone to be trifled with. My burgeoning years has taught me the theory behind survival of the fittest and this basic instinct kept me alive and protected all these years. Perhaps thatÂ’s why I always have this subconscious maternal instinct to protect the people worthy in my life and to fight aggressively to those who tried to bring harm upon them.<br><br>Â‘When is your chauffeur coming?Â’<br><br>Â‘Soon I guess. Anyway, we only have that bit left to do, I will finish it up for you,Â’ replied Jane as she began to pack her bag, Â‘you want me to give you a ride to your work place?Â’<br><br>I nodded gratefully.<br><br>Transportation by her chauffeur is nothing but a swift ride down town; soon after, I reached<br><br>I saw Alvin, my colleague, standing near the entrance of my store, probably waiting for my arrival.<br><br>Â‘Hey sorry man!Â’<br><br>Â‘DonÂ’t have to apologize to meÂ… apologize to him insteadÂ…Â’<br><br>My eyes followed where Alvin was pointing and my sight ended up at somebody familiar Â– Rick.<br><br>Â‘Rick has been waiting for more than two hours. I donÂ’t know what business you had with him, but I think you have asked him to pop byÂ…Â’<br><br>Whoops! My memories have failed me this time; I recalled asking Rick to drop by a day earlier to pass me the cash and I have forgotten clean about it. Then I saw Rick at one corner of my store, his visage filled with sarcastic expression, as he fiddled with his grindstone (or diamonds, who knows?) studded watch, subtly trying to remind me about the time now.<br><br>I grabbed Rick by his arms and pulled him out of the store as I stick out my apologetic tongue.<br><br>Then I turned over to Alvin.<br><br>Â‘I will go out for a quick lunch! Be back soon!Â’<br><br>And I closed the one-sided conversation with a wink.<br><br>(To be continued...)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Chapter 4</strong></span><br><br>Â‘<span style="font-style: italic;">Pai seh arÂ…</span>Â’<br><br>Â‘No worries; I am not angry or what. I was just pulling your legs just now,Â’ said Rick heartily, Â‘Have you eaten? I know I havenÂ’t.Â’<br><br>I shook my head gently and rubbed my tummy. My goodness, I never realized how famished my stomach felt. Before my lips could agree, I gazed at Rick with an appraising eye.<br><br>Â‘I thought we are just a Â‘customerÂ’ and Â‘retailerÂ’ relationship? WhatÂ’s with Â‘lunchÂ’?Â’<br><br>Â‘DonÂ’t be silly; I have always regarded you as a friend working in Action City.Â’<br><br>To my surprise, his right hand went above my head and patted it twice, before flashing two rows of insanely white teeth for a second.<br><br>Â‘ItÂ’s your treat!Â’ yelled Rick as he exited through the automatic doors of Heeren.<br><br>I pouted and quietly followed behind him.<br><br>Â‘Wah rao eh! Pat my head for what? Stupid guyÂ…gonna throw rock at him.Â’<br><br>Observing the direction Rick is heading; I reckoned late lunch is likely to be at CineleisureÂ’s Food Court. Great because I can only afford budget meal right now as I need to scrimp every cent possible. To be honest, I am actually contemplating on staying alone to escape this wretched home of mine, devoid of any warmth. And obviously, that would require some form of financial ability before I could strike out myself.<br><br>When will that be? I truly wondered.<br><br>Sigh.<br><br>Â‘What you want to eat? I will buy the same as you.Â’<br><br>Rick sheared my flow of thoughts. I stared at his face blankly, trying to recall my thoughts back from Pluto.<br><br>Â‘ErrÂ… help me buy Ban Mian? HereÂ’s ten bucksÂ…Â’<br><br>Â‘ItÂ’s ok my dear; this will be my treatÂ…Â’<br><br>Â‘How can? It was my fault leh!Â’<br><br>Â‘DonÂ’t worry; you can always treat me another day.Â’<br><br>I exuded one of my most feminine-mixed-alluring smile ever. Rick reciprocated likewise before he vanished into the short queue. Women are indeed the greater evil of the two sexes; they know they can afford to make mistakes and still get away with it easily. I would readily admit; I have occasionally known to take a little advantage from this. Hiak!<br><br>Still, I am not that evil; I will treat him another day.<br><br>I lifted my gaze at Rick from afar as he returned shortly with two piping hot Ban Mian. Top: Agnes B signature Tee. Bottom: Guess denim jeans. Shoes: Visvim shoes. I am beginning to suspect that his wardrobe doesnÂ’t have anything belonging to that of Â‘lesserÂ’ brands.<br><br>Then curiosity got better of me.<br><br>Â‘How much pocket money do you get Rick?Â’<br><br>Â‘About $800 per month? Why?Â’<br><br>Â‘ThatÂ’s close to the amount I am paid from working!Â’<br><br>Â‘You may think that I am crazy, but I think working is quite fun. At least from the way I see it.Â’<br><br>Â‘Fun? Why not you try working and studying at the same time?Â’<br><br>Â‘My parents disapprove it; I have asked before.Â’<br><br>Our conversation flowed with surprising ease and I discovered much about this guy, whom I previously only perceived him as my regular customer. Rick came from yet another wealthy family (gosh, everyone seemed to have good family background apart from me!) and studied in ACJC. He will probably be going overseas to pursue his bachelor degree as his dad has pretty much planned his futureÂ… the path to be a doctor.<br><br>Â‘WowÂ… I cannot even imagine me getting good scores for my Â‘OÂ’ level and somebody here is already a potential-future doctor to be.Â’<br><br>Â‘Well, but that doesnÂ’t say anything about happiness you know,Â’ mused Rick.<br><br>It was said in a deliberate softer tone, but I heard every single bit of it. Then I noticed a slight change in his demeanor, as if his thoughts leaped miles away and he had transitorily forgotten about my presence, revealing an unconscious true self of ten odd seconds Â– something that I have never seen in his skin before.<br><br>Â‘EhÂ… you ok?Â’<br><br>Rick curled his lips to a faint smile.<br><br>(To be continued...)</div>

Please keep writing, it has a pleasant start.<br><br>PS: The girl on your cover wouldn't rub her tummy in front of Rick. Women don't do that because it's neither feminine nor sexy.
