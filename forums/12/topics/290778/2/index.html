            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Chapter 5 </strong></span><br><br>I walked home alone; dreaded the feeling of coming back.<br><br>I hit the lift button and the door screeched open in protest, as a piece of real estate advertising pamphlet got itself wedged strategically in a small opening beneath the door. Obviously some mischievous kid probably got cheeky and decided to slot that spam mail into the opening.<br><br>And the culprit is likely to be from the household at sixth floor, because nobody else in the right frame of mind would do something like this. Once I caught the kid trying to burn the tail of a stray cat and sternly admonished him about his plain cruelty to the feline. To my disbelief and horror, his mum rushed over and yelled at me. I tried to reason with her, but she kept retaliating with screams of banshee.<br><br>Spare the rod, spoilt the child. If that was my kid, I would have slapped him senseless, so as to inculcate and teach him correct values about life, before he becomes wayward and ill-disciplined.<br><br>Praised the lord! Dad wasnÂ’t home, although the house is in quite a bit of a mess Â– itÂ’s the norm though. Dad had to flip through every corner of the house searching for hidden cache of money. Fortunately, I always kept my room locked, with only me having access to my own room. Fought with dad over this issue a million times and he finally succumbed to the fact that he will never be able to plunder my room without me murdering him outrageously. Anyway, even if he somehow managed to enter, thereÂ’s nothing valuable for him to loot literally.<br><br>Then my phone vibrated for a moment Â– there was an SMS.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Â‘Hey, Rick here. I am somewhere near the vicinity of your house. Wanna come down for a drink?</span><br><br>Although tomorrow is Saturday, I am actually quite drained from todayÂ’s work and travelling. Not wanting to appear like a disinterested prick, I decided to reply him tomorrow morning, citing the convenient lie that I was already sleeping.<br><br>At this moment, my nightmare returned; daddy was back and it was blatant that he was inebriated with booze as he was unable to conceal his drunken mirth. The horrible stench of alcohol and puke beset him and he wavered in his footstep, trying to make his way forward. In that instant, he reminded me so much of a zombie from Resident Evil and I chuckled at the thought of it.<br><br>Dad squinted at me, trying to figure out who the hell I was. In that blur state of mind, he started muttering incongruously as his index finger pointed straight at me.<br><br>Then somehow, from his gamut of dramatic emotions, his temperament started to vacillate to the other end.<br><br>Â‘YouÂ…andÂ…yourÂ…mother the sameÂ… CCB! HIDE THE F<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>UCKING MONEY EVERYWHEREÂ…Â’<br><br>I decided to give him a wide berth Â– but before I could even enter my room, he was there, trying to act as a barrier between me and my safe haven.<br><br>Â‘And whereÂ’s your mother huh? That b<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>itch!Â’<br><br>My phone vibrated, yet another SMS again.<br><br>I dashed out of my house without a second thought.<br><br>(To be continued...)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Chapter 6</strong></span><br><br>I am feeling weary from all the constant chaos and commotion going on in my house. It really desecrated my well being and health from all the clashes I had with people I called parents.<br><br>Â‘Lucky thing you SMS me, if not, I wonÂ’t know what to do man.Â’<br><br>Unconsciously, a crystal tear slipped out of my control and tracked nonchalantly down my cheek. In nick of time, RickÂ’s hand caught the watery droplet and courteously wiped it off with a piece of Scott tissue. Then he put his arms on my petite shoulder and squeezing it gently like a soft cushion.<br><br>Rick came near my area as he was on his way to his buddyÂ’s house. Probably to check out where I stay exactly as I casually revealed to him my address during lunch, being part of a typical conversation. It was beyond my calculation that he actually bother to pay me visit, although that was indeed a blessing in disguise given the circumstance earlier on. He parked his car just below my flat and we were inside, chatting and listening to some modern-infused-classical music that was lingering subtly in the background.<br><br>Â‘This piece is called Toccate and Fugue.Â’<br><br>I merely smile at his reply. An ah lian like myself wouldnÂ’t listen to such genre of music, albeit I thought the piece was beautiful.<br><br>Â‘Life is just that; we canÂ’t choose the way things are given to us, but certainly, we can choose what we want things to be in the future.Â’<br><br>Â‘ThatÂ’s easy to say,Â’ I mused, Â‘Â…but difficult to achieveÂ’.<br><br>Â‘Well, if you believe in it, it might just work out for you?Â’ encouraged Rick.<br><br>Rick then stretched forward and tapped the windscreen with his index finger a couple of times. Apparently, he seemed to be pointing towards the starless night sky.<br><br>You should always aim for the Moon and even if you fail to reach, at least you will hit the clouds.Â’<br><br>Â‘You are thinking that itÂ’s possible because you donÂ’t understand how itÂ’s like to be in a wretched family. I donÂ’t suppose you even know how it feels to maintain your personal upkeep or to pay your own bills?Â’<br><br>Rick did not anticipate this and I could see he was taken aback by my somewhat-provocative statement.<br><br>Â‘I am sorry.Â’<br><br>Rick shrugged his shoulders slightly.<br><br>Â‘Well, I guess you are right. I have not even paid any bills in my life. I guess even though I am two years older, you probably had more deals in life than I do.Â’<br><br>My mind started wandering after his reply; I was reckoning if it was indeed better, ultimately, to be in his situation. I mean coming from a sheltered environment is one that people would envy for sure, but in growth, I am not too sure about that. Put me alone in a no manÂ’s land and I would still be able to survive, but I wonÂ’t say for certain if it was Rick.<br><br>Â‘You may think I am rich; but hell, my friends are worst.Â’<br><br>Â‘Why am I not surprised?Â’ I murmured.<br><br>A series of honking, coming from an approaching BMW, shattered the gentle ambience and diverted our attention. The BMW then park itself by the side of the road and its owner began to walk towards our direction.<br><br>Â‘Well, my friend is finally here!Â’<br><br>Â‘Ok, I guess, I shall not hold you longer. It has almost been an hour and the half since you came.Â’<br><br>Â‘No issue my friend,Â’ replied Rick gentlemanly.<br><br>Â‘ThanksÂ…I appreciated it. OfficiallyÂ… I declare that we are now friends.Â’<br><br>Â‘What? You mean only now?Â’<br><br>Â‘Hahaha!Â’<br><br>(To be continued...)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Chapter 7 </strong></span><br><br>It has been months since we have knew each other. Rick would occasionally drop by my store and proposed dinner dates, provided I wasnÂ’t too busy with work. Juggling school work and a job has never been easy; I recalled during my aberrant years, I would probably be exhausting precious time away with bunch of other delinquents: chit chatting at the kopitiam, feeding tokens at the arcade, getting into girl fights, engaging in underage drinking and all other illicit activities that literally wasted myself away. Ok, I admit I am still smoking though, but has participated a lot less in those stuff.<br><br>Although I still do not have a pristine view of my future, nevertheless, my first priority is to gain independence and move out of my desolate household.<br><br>Â‘I realized that you are much tamer now,Â’ piped Alvin.<br><br>Â‘Really?Â’<br><br>Â‘I used to think that you are quite fierce, especially when you donÂ’t smile. At least now you are smiling more.Â’<br><br>We discover something new about ourselves everyday; I cannot help but to concur with his deduction. I do have that murderous look when I appeared serious or simply putting on a look without smiles. Alvin used to tell me that was how I subconsciously deterred men from approaching me.<br><br>Â‘So did it deter you from talking to me?Â’ I asked haughtily.<br><br>Â‘Sorry, but I have thick skin.Â’<br><br>I rolled my eyes and Alvin ended up laughing.<br><br>Â‘But I think you are getting pretty close to Rick,Â’ observed Alvin, Â‘maybe thatÂ’s why.Â’<br><br>Â‘ThatÂ’s why what?Â’<br><br>Before I could comprehend his insinuation, my phone rung at the moment - it was a message from Rick and he says he will be my driver for today. Yay!<br><br>Rick has recently signed up for a Fitness First gym package and they have a branch in Paragon. During one of our many conversations, I jokingly implored him to be my chauffeur if he is going back home after gym around the time I closed my store. To my surprise, he hooked my pinky with his and nodded in tacit agreement.<br><br>I bid Alvin a hasty farewell and hurried my way down.<br><br>In less than a minute, his car arrived and I eagerly hopped in.<br><br>Â“Woo, your fast!Â’<br><br>Â‘YouÂ’re not too bad yourself.Â’<br><br>I lifted my hands to hide my smirk.<br><br>There has never been a better time for me to revel in the cadence of wondrous music after a day of hard work. My tired eyes were hypnotized by the soothing rhythm to rest for a moment and although there were silence; it was a comfortable silence. This was precisely why I love being around Rick - no pressure or a need to mask my real identity.<br><br>I always believe that at times, a woman needs to feel like a woman.<br><br>Â‘See? I am honest; if I am around the vicinity at this time after my gym session, I will fetch you,Â’ said Rick, breaking the comfortable silence.<br><br>Â‘Ok laÂ… I am very <span style="font-style: italic;">gan dong</span> (touched). Is that enough?Â’<br><br>Â‘NoÂ… HAHAHAHHAHAHAHA! You owe me something now!Â’<br><br>Â‘What you want me to do?Â’<br><br>Â‘Tell you next time,Â’ said Rick friskily as maneuvered his car into the carpark where my flat is and stopped at the side most convenient for me, in view of the lift.<br><br>Â‘Then I will give you a down payment first.Â’<br><br>I arched over and hugged him.<br><br>Â‘ErÂ…Â’<br><br>Â‘HAHAHAHHAHAHAHA! Now you owe me something instead!Â’<br><br>Without allowing him the chance to complete his sentence, I raced out of the car, flushing with slight redness.<br><br>(To be continued...)</div>
