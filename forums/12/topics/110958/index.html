And the way you are treating her is also pretty normal as a friend. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I know that you like her...but do give yourself and her the chance to know more about each other first. Be her friend and know more about her first and allow her to know more about you first. For all you know, you may not be the one she is looking for...as in the personality, appearance and behaviour. And she might not be the one you are so in love with after you have know her long enough. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>And yes, you are really getting your hopes too high up. Don't flatter yourself by thinking that she will like you simply without knowing you enough. Girls are not as easy as you imagined. They have their insecurities as well as concerns. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Well...in a relationship, girls are usually the ones who lose out. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> So they have to make sure that this is the right guy for them first before they are prepared to go into a relationship with the guy.<br><br>I can only tell you to take things naturally as it comes. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>One tip though...if a girl is interested in you, she won't and will never do anything to cause you any hurt...before she step into a relationship with you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Hehehe..hahahaha....good luck!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well ~numb~, I've read ur replies. Looks like the previous one u sounded a little hopeless, helpless and feel like giving up. Am I right? Or am I wrong?<br><br>Anyway.. if I were you, I'll take things a step at a time. Being friends with the girl you like or are attracted to is not a wrong option. But the big MISTAKE is to be TOO nice to the girl you r attracted to, which gives her a signal that you r falling for her.<br><br>Below are some tips tt may help u, maybe not for the current situation but it's meant for future uses... if need to.<br><br>Some tips though:<br>1. Take two steps forward and one step backward.<br>2. Mystic is the key to turn on the attraction.<br>3. Men are on/off switches, women are volume knobs.<br>4. Never be too nice to a girl (even if u know one for quite some time), because they will very soon take you as a normal friend once you overdo it.<br>5. If there's any chance, try to get her to chase you around trying to beat you up for what you said or done to her.
