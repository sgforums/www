You panic and your emotional structure collapse violently, leaving you nothing but a piece of wasteland. Even if wasn't stated, I am pretty sure that this 8-years relationship was a very difficult one. By love itself, it wasn't substantial - many other factors shaped and affected your attitude towards love.<br><br>When you hit the lowest stage of your life; someone came and you immediately cling onto him to salvage whatever fatal damage done to you. From there, you pick yourself up and at the same time, gain a relationship.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Your outlook on love and relationship seriously need to revise and re-package if you wished to achieve fulfillment from it.<br><br>Parental pressure? Condo? These are crap reasons for you to accept marriage. Love doesn't run like a school - doesn't mean if you date for 4 years means you will be married eventually and everything else (in consideration of age, etc). You could be dating for 8 years and this man doesn't end up with you - So what's the big deal with 4 years? Nothing in fact.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU WANT </span>and end up trying to employ the same psychological method to get out of your mess - the clingy style, which saved you previously. Its real strange and ironic that <strong>you are willing to contact your ex and be a runaway bride, than to stand like a rock and reject this marriage proposal, which is much easier. </strong> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Your attitude towards love bends on making you suffer and adopt the destructive habit of avoidance.<br><br>Ah ha! Your colleague came into the picture and he is able to satisfy this emptiness cum dis-satisfaction in you. He is your 'savior' and the entire cycle repeats itself - you start to cling onto him and repeated your own history.<br><br>You think your colleague loves you? This is highly questionable and his character is getting dubious, considering he saw through your days of getting married and now accepting an affair with you. This affairs <strong>WILL</strong> be a sexual one and now at the back of your head, you are wondering if he would be a good choice and not something like your current husband again.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> You are playing with fire and would be burn to certain death eventually. I can see the root of problem lies with you and it will take more than just a post to let you understand or change your fate.<br><br>P.S: Are you a pisces? (Scorpio or Cancer?) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>
