            <div class='col-md body'>No. I just flipped out. Man sometimes i dunno wat's wrong with me. Its just that Mrs R in the past kept scolding me, she thinks i purposely skipped her class when i am absent from school on the same day. She always makes sarcastic remarks and is just kinda antagonistic, i fear talking to her, feel angry sometimes that i can't do anything bout it.<br><br>Anywayz, spent a week out of school doing A level coursework, and its due tomorrow, i've finished it and can go back to school. Just fearful of more reproaches from her. But then my friends in class said that she did ask about me and was pissed at first, then when they told her i got art to do, she then said nvm.. so that sounds reasonable.. just wait and see wad happens. Maybe i think too much and stereotype future situations coz of past situations???</div>
