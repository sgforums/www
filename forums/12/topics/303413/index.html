I just told him this: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>'Unlearn what you learn in Love previously and relearn everything again.'</strong></span><br><br>He looked at me with this blank look, thinking that I was crazy or something.<br><br>I will tell you the same thing; however, in addition, I will explain why.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>***<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Love is freewill; true love cannot be forced upon by threat, violence, demand, anger, abuse, terror, fear, guilt or habit. If it does, the relationship will no doubt be intense and unfulfilling.<br><br>And you know what? This is but the very rudimentary understanding in Love - that we all must see the logic, in which Love is a choice and the choice made to stay in a relationship must be attributed to the individual's freewill. If not, misery will follow suit closely.<br><br>Therefore, what if your woman's choice is the desire to be 'out', despite wanting to be 'in' previously?<br><br>Would you still see the same rationale?<br><br>Chances are, you can't really answer me - because there will be fear in agreeing.<br><br>Love is never stagnant; like dough, it constantly remakes and renews itself. You believed that a change in environment brought about the change in her, thus the change in your relationship.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>But the truth is that Love is an inside thing, not outside job. </strong></span><br><br>If an environment could so effortlessly affect the Love in a person, it basically goes to suggest how enervated and languid this Love he or she claims to have. Or there might be litany of unspoken grievance or frustration felt within her, causing severe friction as it ran through her emotions for many years, unattended and uncommunicated.<br><br>Basically what I meant is that you know next to nothing about the sudden drip in your relationship. All these years, you probably assumed that you know what's going on, both inside and outside, and that everything is marching towards to the direction you have point out so prominently.<br><br>Your assumption in your relationship presumes that you are a loving couple.<br><br>Your assumption in your relationship presumes that she will always spend all her time on you.<br><br>Your assumption in your relationship presumes that she will always want to marry you. Never mind the future - her words will guarantee the future commitment as well.<br><br>Your assumption in your relationship presumes that you are the one for her. No one else has the prerogative to that.<br><br>Ironically, if your assumptions are all right - you won't be posting here.<br><br>That's probably the cusps of the problem; you think you knew your relationship, but it appeared more like a stranger to you when it blatantly placed right in front of your face and you suddenly realized you didn't recognise the shape, which you have always reckoned it to be your Love.<br><br>If you do not unblock this linear thought and relearn to love your relationship, like a child, all these assumptions will continue to widen, like the income disparity between the rich and poor in Singapore.<br><br>You relearn by:<br><br>I) Eliminate your linear mindset - Quit pressuring her with this marriage thing. Quit thinking that this relationship is already years in making. Quit thinking that your have invested far too much. Quit thinking that you are unable to live without her. Quit thinking that Love is irrevocable.<br><br>II) Communicate with her, as if you have never spoken before. She must be comfortable to speak to you without fear and you have to find some means for her to be able to exude that level of frankness. Basically have a heart-to-heart talk. Minus guilt-pressuring. minus overly emotional speech, minus finger pointing.<br><br>III) Understand your relationship from her perception. Enquire from different angles and seek to understand the struggles, which are not transparent in your vision, which might have taken place beneath your nose. Learn to learn your relationship from an alternative perspective and not view it like the way you always do.<br><br>You can only move forward, if you have establish the fact that her decision is still a 'yes' to this relationship - it must not be a diplomatic yes, but straight from the bottom of her heart. Then you can seek to address whatever problem that is degenerating this relationship and remove the source.<br><br>But if it isn't the case, then you might want to ascertain how much damage has been done and if there's a possibility that you can rectify the problem and overcome it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>She is reconsidering her options. She will either decide that your "package" is still the best one or that she can do better.<br><br>If she won't talk to you it's because the deciding factor cannot be found in what you say. She has probably already mentioned the factors to you but you did not address it and are using other means to pressure her decision.<br><br>You can either wait for her to decide. Or you can find some private alone time and ask her what she is afraid of and let her talk about her fears. Don't make promises, don't make light of it, don't tease her, don't question her, don't get angry, don't ask for proof, don't pass judgements, don't defend yourself, though some of the things she says may be very painful for you to hear.<br><br>All you have to do is sit and listen and encourage her to speak, which will be more difficult then you think.<br><br>It still may or may not be enough but it is something within your control that can sway her decision towards you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I believe she still has feelings for u, and its unlikely that she has another 3rd party. Girls are really hard to understand and are more fickle minded than guys before marriage.<br><br>Instead you should stop questioning her, asking questions regarding marriage and future, give her some space and let everything comes natural. She will come to realised and treasure the relationship. However if u keep askin these questions, it will just remove on its flame and romance.<br><br>keep it natural, simple, give her opportunities to miss you. It will work out.</div>
