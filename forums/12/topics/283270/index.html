            <div class='col-md body'>My gf is currently preparing for a major exam which will start in around 4-5 weeks.  It will end in around 7 weeks...<br><br>Her school is one of the top schools in SG and as such, her teachers are pushing her (and her sch mates) very very hard.  When I hear her school revision lessons schedule and the amount of homework she has to do, I'm really afraid that she will burn out.<br><br>I've suggested occasionally that she takes it easy sometimes so as not to burn out, cos sometimes she gets really really tired and even falls sick...most likely is due to schoolwork.  The amount she has to do each day is not humanly possible to finish...<br><br>The school is also purposely VERY strict with marking so she keeps getting discouraged.  I've been telling her occasionally that she's not stupid and that she's smart.<br><br>But sometimes I feel it'll be very 'naggy' for me to keep reminding her to relax, don't study until too late at night etc. it might even irritate her...<br><br>What else can I do, as a bf, to support her through this tough period?<br><br>I'm considering suggesting that we should meet up less often or for shorter periods or stop meeting up totally until her exams are over.  It's a very painful prospect, but I know she's very 'gan cheong' about her exams...btw usually we only meet once a week on saturdays...<br><br>I feel very helpless...can't do anything while she's feeling all the stress and swamped in mountains of notes to study and assignments to complete...</div>

It's a common practice in many schools...even mid-range ones.  Much less the elite schools.<br><br>The point is, she gets quite demoralised whenever she fails internal exams.  I'm a year older so I've been through the same exams, and I always tell her that it's standard procedure for schools to give students crap grades in internal exams so they get 'scared' and mug hard for the real thing...</div>
