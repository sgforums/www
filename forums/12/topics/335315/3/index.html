              <p>Nope, you are not wrong to reject her. It was just a casual dinner, shouldn't have any strings attached to it. Don't succumb to her attempt to make you feel guilty when you haven't done anything wrong</p>

              <p>She is not even worth to keep as a friend, not to mention about starting relationship with her.   She sounds emotionally disturbed.  Could be she had bad encounters with some men before.    No worry, TS, you made a good choice to ignore her.</p>

              <p>it had me mentally tormented for some days.... and there you are making fun of it?</p>
              <p>man, i think i'm gonna faint. :(</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i mean, if it's just for friendship, i don't mind how she looks.... but the kinds of questions she asked and the susequent rude smses are not what even a normal first-time friend would do, right?</p>
              <p>even if they were meant as jokes, i think the jokes were carried too far already.</p>
              <p>by the way, she looked like she was in her late 30s or early 40s.... so shouldn't she display some level of maturity in her words, thoughts and actions?</p>
              <p>i really felt like i was in contact with someone who's mentally unsound or disturbed.</p>
              <p>sigh! :(</p>

              <p>You know.. Some ppl, no matter men or women, once they felt a sense of rejection from someone they will become demanding and nasty. You are right to ignore her, 'cos if you just keep on replying her there'll be no end to it.</p>

              <p>Yea...but it is so desperate that it gets scary...sigh. It is probably this kinda scary behaviour that causes all her other potential boyfriends/dates to run off in the past.</p>
              <p>Guess TS is just unlucky to meet such a person. Just ignore totally or block the number from now on. Dun need to give "face" if the other party ain't giving you any.</p>
