              <hr style="color: #f1fcff;">
              <div>ok, this is my story.<br> <br> don't ask me why, don't ask me how. this was what happened.<br> <br> recently, i got to know a woman online.<br> <br> it was after some months before we agreed to meet up last
              sunday.<br> <br> although when i first saw her, i knew she was not my type. still, i
              played a good host to her by treating her to dinner, and then
              coffee at Coffee Bean. i just treated it as making a new
              friend.<br> <br> however, here comes the problem. during our conversation, i felt as
              if i was criminal being interrogated by the police. she was
              bombarding me with all sorts of embarassing and very private
              questions. examples like " how much you earn? got 4k? or 5k?", "
              how many exs you have? do you "do" with your exs?", " and when you
              don't have gf, how do you release yourself? go geylang?", etc,
              etc....<br> <br> i was simply dumbfounded..... surely, this isn't something that
              first-time friends would discuss so openly about, i thought.<br> <br> i felt my modesty had been insulted.... it was really an ordeal,
              and i was feeling very uncomfortable. so after we finished our
              coffee, i made up an excuse that my friends were asking me to join
              them at coffeeshop for kopi, and we parted ways.<br> <br> i thought it was all over, until she began to send smses to me
              right after our meeting.... and calls in the next morning. all of
              which i didn't reply, as i didn't want her to misunderstand.<br> <br> then, her smses became more offensive.... even branding me a
              "bastard", simply because i didn't respond to her.... so i replied
              an sms to her saying, " hi,xxx. look. i've already treated you to
              dinner and coffee... so i dun owe you anything already. now what is
              yer problem?"<br> <br> her reply was a sharp rebuttal asking me why i was so angry,
              etc,etc.... i was again dumbfounded.....<br> <br> ok, so i tried to use a softer approach....by smsing her an apology
              and asking her " to cherish the good memories of our 1st meeting,
              and move on. thks".<br> <br> then i got an even more shocking reply from her.... she said that
              the first meeting was too short to have any good memories. then she
              offered me an NSA relationship, and asked if i'd love it... to
              which, i didn't reply, as i thought it was nonsensical.<br> <br> an hour later, she smsed me that she was just joking and "didn't
              want a man who was already "close" with his exs... dunno whether
              got HIV or not."<br> <br> at that point i was really mad.... what did i do to her to invite
              such an insult, not just on myself but also my exs.<br> <br> i replied in a rather stern manner. i texted, " hey, u damn free,
              is it? dun talk like u r so noble leh. true frens dun do those
              kinds of things u r doing to me. pls stop yer call/sms right now.
              i've kept records of all yer smses. stop it now, b4 i lodge a
              report."<br> <br> i thought that sms ought to end it all.... but to my dismay, she
              sent me yet another more insulting sms this time, calling me a
              "pervert" who made her want to vomit, and ordered me not to msg and
              disturb her again, saying we are now enemies, no more
              friends.<br></div>
              <div>yet again, i was struck dumb.</div>
              <div><br> ???? man, did this ever happen to you before?<br> <br> it's probably one of my worst nightmares, my date from hell.<br> <br> so far, i've not received anymore calls/smses from her.... i hope
              it stays that way.</div>
              </div>

              <p>I've met this kind before. She tried to bluff me for a dinner, tried to bluff me for a music CD, etc. I guess if we exhibit a navie, easy to be taken advantage of kind of character, there will be people precisely trying to do that to us.</p>
              <p>Nowadays,  I'll response back with an equal annoying question.</p>
              <p>" how much you earn? got 4k? or 5k?", ==<span style="text-decoration: underline;">yourself? What do you spend on? Do you buy stuff for your boyfriends?</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"
              how many exs you have? do you "do" with your exs?", " and when you
              don't have gf, how do you release yourself? go geylang?"==<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Haha. Do you look for toyboys? I guess you all need to pay more for toy boys right? </span></p>
              <p>If they response with a "I ask u first" type. I'll just ignored them.</p>
              <p>You get the drift.</p>

              <p><br>I think you have misunderstood. Men will only want a woman who will stick by her man even during times of advesary. And for a woman to be able to do that, she needs to have a certain degree of morals.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Some women who pride upon their virginity and insists that "only after marriage" are quite often women who demand everything from the man to accomodate her. I am not talking about sex only. This will include severing ties with friends she does not approve of, her bf/husband not allowed to take up certain jobs that does not fit her unreasonable demands, not allowed to maintain a healthy relationship with his own parents/siblings whom she does not like etc. Such women think too highly of their own moral standards that they become hypocrital. Sexuality is something between 2 persons on mutual agreement. It has only little to do with moral hypocrites.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There're some women who goes around scouting and filtering men. And her criterial is always materialistic. Such woman will stick to any man who meets her criterial in order to grab a good catch. Who doesn't want a good catch? But in order to grab a good catch, the woman only targets at the man's wallet, that makes her no different from a slut. And most men will never be serious with such women. Playboys will only treat them as a fling.</p>

              <p>Anyway, this isnt new.</p>
              <p>1. had experience with guys who buys you a dinner and expect you to go to their house for sex.</p>
              <p>2. another are guys on the internet, promising this and that, but demanding that you meet them so they can verify the 'goods.'</p>
              <p>3. had a experience with a prospective employer, that tells me to go to his hotel room to meet him and then further discuss the employment contract.  But he never even read my resume.  Then he further try to smoke me by insisting that things will be looked thru by the lawyers and I tell him that I know lawyers, I can speak to the lawyer if he tells me which firm he uses.</p>
              <p>That guy after various attempts to smoke me anymore, tells me that I am a 'whore'; I let people do me because I am online user and that his multi billion business dont need ugly people like me.</p>
              <p>So to me.  Anyone that dares to tells others are ugly and unwanted, are people that are insecure about who they really are worth.</p>

              <p><br>haha... agreed. No normal healthy man on earth is not interested in sex. So there's no reason why should anyone hide it and pretend to be 'upright'. Only hypocrites do that.</p>

              <p><br>It is sometimes entertaining to see such behavior. An excellent illustration can be found in the movie 'Virgin Territory'. I couldn't help laughing at times while watching the show. Sometimes the hypocrisy on how 'moral' they are towards sexuality looks so amusing.</p>

              <div>ok, this is my story.<br><br>don't ask me why, don't ask me how. this was what happened.<br><br>recently, i got to know a woman online.<br><br>it was after some months before we agreed to meet up last sunday.<br><br>although when i first saw her, i knew she was not my type. still, i played a good host to her by treating her to dinner, and then coffee at Coffee Bean. i just treated it as making a new friend.<br><br>however, here comes the problem. during our conversation, i felt as if i was criminal being interrogated by the police. she was bombarding me with all sorts of embarassing and very private questions. examples like " how much you earn? got 4k? or 5k?", " how many exs you have? do you "do" with your exs?", " and when you don't have gf, how do you release yourself? go geylang?", etc, etc....<br><br>i was simply dumbfounded..... surely, this isn't something that first-time friends would discuss so openly about, i thought.<br><br>i felt my modesty had been insulted.... it was really an ordeal, and i was feeling very uncomfortable. so after we finished our coffee, i made up an excuse that my friends were asking me to join them at coffeeshop for kopi, and we parted ways.<br><br>i thought it was all over, until she began to send smses to me right after our meeting.... and calls in the next morning. all of which i didn't reply, as i didn't want her to misunderstand.<br><br>then, her smses became more offensive.... even branding me a "bastard", simply because i didn't respond to her.... so i replied an sms to her saying, " hi,xxx. look. i've already treated you to dinner and coffee... so i dun owe you anything already. now what is yer problem?"<br><br>her reply was a sharp rebuttal asking me why i was so angry, etc,etc.... i was again dumbfounded.....<br><br>ok, so i tried to use a softer approach....by smsing her an apology and asking her " to cherish the good memories of our 1st meeting, and move on. thks".<br><br>then i got an even more shocking reply from her.... she said that the first meeting was too short to have any good memories. then she offered me an NSA relationship, and asked if i'd love it... to which, i didn't reply, as i thought it was nonsensical.<br><br>an hour later, she smsed me that she was just joking and "didn't want a man who was already "close" with his exs... dunno whether got HIV or not."<br><br>at that point i was really mad.... what did i do to her to invite such an insult, not just on myself but also my exs.<br><br>i replied in a rather stern manner. i texted, " hey, u damn free, is it? dun talk like u r so noble leh. true frens dun do those kinds of things u r doing to me. pls stop yer call/sms right now. i've kept records of all yer smses. stop it now, b4 i lodge a report."<br><br>i thought that sms ought to end it all.... but to my dismay, she sent me yet another more insulting sms this time, calling me a "pervert" who made her want to vomit, and ordered me not to msg and disturb her again, saying we are now enemies, no more friends.<br></div>
              <div>yet again, i was struck dumb.</div>
              <div><br>???? man, did this ever happen to you before?<br><br>it's probably one of my worst nightmares, my date from hell.<br><br>so far, i've not received anymore calls/smses from her.... i hope it stays that way.</div>
