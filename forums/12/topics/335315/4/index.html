              <p><br>It was no joke.  Or if she tries to insist its joking only.  Its in bad taste and if you want to tolerate it, its up to you.</p>

              <hr style="color: #f1fcff;">
              <div>ok, this is my story.<br><br>don't ask me why, don't ask me how. this was what happened.<br><br>recently, i got to know a woman online.<br><br>it was after some months before we agreed to meet up last sunday.<br><br>although when i first saw her, i knew she was not my type. still, i played a good host to her by treating her to dinner, and then coffee at Coffee Bean. i just treated it as making a new friend.<br><br>however, here comes the problem. during our conversation, i felt as if i was criminal being interrogated by the police. she was bombarding me with all sorts of embarassing and very private questions. examples like " how much you earn? got 4k? or 5k?", " how many exs you have? do you "do" with your exs?", " and when you don't have gf, how do you release yourself? go geylang?", etc, etc....<br><br>i was simply dumbfounded..... surely, this isn't something that first-time friends would discuss so openly about, i thought.<br><br>i felt my modesty had been insulted.... it was really an ordeal, and i was feeling very uncomfortable. so after we finished our coffee, i made up an excuse that my friends were asking me to join them at coffeeshop for kopi, and we parted ways.<br><br>i thought it was all over, until she began to send smses to me right after our meeting.... and calls in the next morning. all of which i didn't reply, as i didn't want her to misunderstand.<br><br>then, her smses became more offensive.... even branding me a "bastard", simply because i didn't respond to her.... so i replied an sms to her saying, " hi,xxx. look. i've already treated you to dinner and coffee... so i dun owe you anything already. now what is yer problem?"<br><br>her reply was a sharp rebuttal asking me why i was so angry, etc,etc.... i was again dumbfounded.....<br><br>ok, so i tried to use a softer approach....by smsing her an apology and asking her " to cherish the good memories of our 1st meeting, and move on. thks".<br><br>then i got an even more shocking reply from her.... she said that the first meeting was too short to have any good memories. then she offered me an NSA relationship, and asked if i'd love it... to which, i didn't reply, as i thought it was nonsensical.<br><br>an hour later, she smsed me that she was just joking and "didn't want a man who was already "close" with his exs... dunno whether got HIV or not."<br><br>at that point i was really mad.... what did i do to her to invite such an insult, not just on myself but also my exs.<br><br>i replied in a rather stern manner. i texted, " hey, u damn free, is it? dun talk like u r so noble leh. true frens dun do those kinds of things u r doing to me. pls stop yer call/sms right now. i've kept records of all yer smses. stop it now, b4 i lodge a report."<br><br>i thought that sms ought to end it all.... but to my dismay, she sent me yet another more insulting sms this time, calling me a "pervert" who made her want to vomit, and ordered me not to msg and disturb her again, saying we are now enemies, no more friends.<br></div>
              <div>yet again, i was struck dumb.</div>
              <div><br>???? man, did this ever happen to you before?<br><br>it's probably one of my worst nightmares, my date from hell.<br><br>so far, i've not received anymore calls/smses from her.... i hope it stays that way.</div>

              <p>Tough luck pal, I have met such women before which scare the living daylights out of me. What I think is that such women demand too much from the men. And in the first place if the woman is not able to bring herself up to the standards equal to the one she demands from her man, then she should compromise.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There're just such women who're out there to find a man yet she has an argumentative and an overly 'self righteous' character. Just avoid such women and preferably not meet the woman alone. In case she accuses you of things you have not done. Months back, there was an incident involving a SGF moderator being accused of indecent acts against another female SGF member when they met. How much truth is there in the allegation is still a mystery. But nonetheless, it made it into the print media and the moderator subsequently stepped down.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You may be there because it's just a harmless private outing. And your agenda is there to increase your network of friends. But the other party may not think that way.</p>
              <p><br>At the same time, I have also seen women who think too highly of their moral character. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0437954/">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0437954/</a> This funny movie best illustrates the 'extreme morality superiority complex'. So much that it becomes hypocrital. Perhaps it's coincidence, for the people I know are all christian girls.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So the best for all guys out there, stay out of the lives of women whom you do not know. There're always such women who prey on the naiveness of men. Go out in group outings. The chances of such a women preying on you will be greatly reduced.</p>
