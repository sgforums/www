            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah man.. He can't be called ur friend to start with. He is more like a parasite. Just ignore him. And like suggested above ignore his call and don't answer it in the first place. And if you happen to pick it up then just say "Hey I am busy now will call you back later" and of course you won't call him later.<br><br>Certain people are like that. They make frens to make use of u. They see whats ur strong point and always use u when they are in need of it..<br><br>I have "acquaintances" who suddenly call me up out of the blue after being "conttactless" for 1 or 2 yrs. They just call up to ask some computer problem. Just imagine! They only think of me when they get computer problem?<br><br>In the beginning I used to help them but soon I realised that they were making use of me. So nowadays whenever I get these kinda "acquaintances" calling me, I just say I don't know whats the problem.. lol.. Although I am like laughing my head off thinking that its such a stupid n simple problem..<br><br>So just ignore them pal..  =)</div>
