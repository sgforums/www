              <p>..... have you ever have such an experience before, and wat does it mean if she don't close eyes???</p>
              <p>to explain the full picture... theother day i was dating this girl. we knew each other before hand already through a mutual fren but never go 1 on 1 outing before. About 2 or 3 times we met beforehand it was always with a group... so in one of the last group outing, i ask if she wants to go for drinks sometime and she say yes, so everything set for next date! on the date.. i took the trouble dress up a bit better than usual... wear nicer jacket.. by the way this was in korea so weather is much colder so need jacket.. and she is korean</p>
              <p>anyway, cut story short... we went for dinner with some drinks.. after dinner went pub to continue with more drinks... conversation was going well and we were really engaged with each other stories and jokes.. then sway sway her parents called ask her why so late and what time she back.. sian liao lor.. so have to call it a night.. actually it was close to morning by then and sun going to rise</p>
              <p>so i play gentlemen and send her all the way to her door step.. and then of course i was thinking cannot waste golden opportunity, so before she open door i lean over very close to test test... no resistance! set lah! so i lean over some more and kiss her.. she response and kiss back... so i pull her closer and sort of like one hand held the back of her neck and theother hand around her waist.. i don't know about you, but i thought usually this sort of intimate moment will be the signal for both of us to close eyes... but wtf... she had her eyes open the whole time! i closed my eyes a few times during that 1 to 2 mins and I thought she will follow but she still kept eyes open.. everytime i open my eyes i will see her looking right at me!</p>
              <p>somehow it kind of freak me out so i decided to stop then and we say our goodbyes... she still seem happy then and was smiling happily when we part.. but this has been bugging me the whole week and i'm not sure why... but it just don't seem natural to kiss in an intimate moment and she doesn't know how to close her eyes?! i never ever have such an experience previously....</p>
              <p>anyone has any possible explanations, or experience same thing before???</p>

              <p>As a gal, let me tell you the truth, nothing but the truth, today, we gals wear lots of false eyeleshes, especially so are jap, taiwan and korean, so when we kiss a guy, inorder not to hit our eyeleshes which can shift or detach under force, we need to open our eyes. Full stop, dun listen to those old people and guys too much, they know nothing nuts about us.</p>

              <p>hmm... i guess most people here don't seem to mind if the partners they are kissing neber close eyes... maybe i am too sensitive about it....</p>
              <p>so if there is a next kiss with her... i will just close eyes and dun bother whether she looking or not looking! <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
