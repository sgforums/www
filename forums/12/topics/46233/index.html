            <div class='col-md body'>let me work on the premise that there may be no problems with the reln. in other words, he still likes/loves you, there's no third party, no super time-consuming things like exams, huge project at work, family probs.<br><br>if this is the case then we must look at the different levels of commitment you both are putting into the reln. for some couples, seeing each other once or twice a week is more than enuff, the rest of the time spending with friends or family. some couples live together and are happy with waking up seeing each others' faces everyday.<br><br>problems arise when a couple can't "decide" wat both of them want. obviously this "decision" has to be the same. it's not like it'll work when one person wants to meet twice a week and the other wants to move in!<br><br>this is something u may have to figure out, besides wat yun mentioned, that the reln may need reviewing.<br><br>u can choose to "sweep it under the carpet" but the junk is just gonna pile up and it's gonna be even harder to clean next time. nip the problem in the bud now. good luck~!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
