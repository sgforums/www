              <p>I'm a seventeen-year-old girl waiting to enter Ngee Ann Poly, and due to inadequate O Level results - 11 for L1R4, 14 for L1R5 (including CCA points) - I did not make it into Mass Communication (10), my dream course. Indeed, I had missed the cut-off by one point, a fact that almost had me smashing my head against a wall.</p>
              <p>I was, instead, assigned to Advertising &amp; Public Relations (12). It was my second choice, since I was adamant to stay in Ngee Ann Poly's environment instead of applying for Mass Comm in other polytechnics.</p>
              <p>All my siblings have gone on to study in good universities in Singapore, and I plan to do the same. However, none of our local universities actually have degrees exclusive to Advertising/Public Relations, and I'm not sure that I can afford to go to a university overseas.</p>
              <p>I do understand that Advertising &amp; Public Relations go hand-in-hand with marketing or business studies, but those aren't exactly relevant to my interests. I want to be doing something I love in the future, and that love is <em>media</em> - writing and journalism, preferably.</p>
              <p>Since APR is somewhat similar to Mass Communication, I was wondering if I could still take Mass Comm, or a media-based course related to it, in a local university. This is, of course, based on the assumption that I will do well in Poly.</p>
              <p>Any help would be greatly appreciated! :)</p>

              <p>its too earlier for a yougn person like you to see the future - right before what reality brings.</p>
              <p>when you cum out and work - its about a copncrete jungle when its every men for himself. so if you want a dream job you do not really need a cert. youcan define as dream job but if you have suck cock and suck jibai colleagues - you will never define having a job. might as well like me don;t woerk <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Mass communication and APR are completely different, Mass communication cover a wider aspect and APR is just one of it module. So, please dun fool yourself, Mass communication is the highest intake in today market. It cover IT, entertainment, journalism, business, psychology, international, politic and social economy.</p>
              <p>If you want to go specific on a course, go thru mass communication first, when graduated, then apply for the specific course to be a specialist in it. No need to go University. Just like me, specialise in entertainment business and psychology.</p>

              <p>Paper qualification is important.. it's used as a formality which helps open doors for interviews. But do take note that experience counts a lot too. I am mass comm grad from a private institution.. my advice to you, is to go with the flow. Just like you, I did not qualify for a mass comm course in Poly as my cut off point was 19. I could have taken just any course as long as I can get into poly but i was persistent. Thank goodness for supportive parents. :')  I took the private route and went all the way.. if you want something, go get it. Look out for opportunities.. they're always there. Anything related to the field you want to speacilize in will do. All the best :)</p>

              <p>You are right NP's mass com is hard to get in. 10 points right?</p>
              <p>But, you can also opt for Temasek poly's mass com. It isnt that bad.</p>
