              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>I'm 22, SIngaporean, though still feel like a kid without any knowledge to live through difficulties. Trouble with my languages... totally off being singlish or english. Unable to speak out, bad in speeches. Plus, hate my current career.</p>
              <p>I wish to take 'O'lvl and find a suitable course. Now currently earning for my classes needs.But i have my Diploma exams need to be re-taken, thought hate the course but it's a way to easy earn.</p>
              <p>Friends/some of my family members says it's a waste of time to take it but most of the elders says I should take up the studies. Both of them right, I'm total lost. Afraid I would fail but yet wish to upgrade myself.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So, been searching for classes/private/ITE part-time for 'O' lvl. They are too expensive. Is there anyway I could have a better price? my income hardly in 4 digits. Also wondering since now the ecodomy is not doing well, heard purhaps next year every cost will be expensive.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway help? thank you so much if do.</p>

I guess you can always approach community helps for decent tuitions and such, go into a religion, you could be more at eased, affirmed, and reassured that there is hope, and the fact is there are many hope, im sure there are many who are willing to help, as long as you take the effort to help yourself first. It's alright being lost, dont be to picky, luck is only when preparation meets opportunity, so you got to equip your self to welcome all opporunities, and dont be too quick to reject, remember that these opportunities might not be available to everyone else, so que sera sera, what will be will be, just be contented about what you are being offered, and strive to improve yourself in all areas.</p></div>

              <p>is really being an account asistance that boring ? i thought of being of one when i grow up too. "laughs". anyway, if u are looking for good english tutor, u can try your luck at transligual language center  located at penisular shopping center 4th lever. Their fee are reasonable but i dont know whether they are still operating because it is a very old school. the principal is very particular on singlish so u wont pick up any there.. and i think maybe u can try to study the o level's subject urself if really couldnt understand then find a tutor. o level can be quite easy to pass if u are hardworking by doing all the tys qns! </p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>I used to be accounts assistant too- and hated it! I also do art, painting, making jewellery etc.  I think its hard being a creative person who enjoys doing things with their hands and being stuck in an office job can be quite frustrating.  You start to lose sight of what you really want out of life. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I really think Loor's advice of volunteering is good- it can open up many opportunities.  You wil meet new like minded people and open new doors for you.  Maybe try new hobbies and a short course at a college to learn new skills.  Broadening your mind and your skills will really help you explore what you might want to do with your future. Enjoy it! Life is full of adventures.</p>
              <p>Good luck!</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>I'm 22, SIngaporean, though still feel like a kid without any knowledge to live through difficulties. Trouble with my languages... totally off being singlish or english. Unable to speak out, bad in speeches. Plus, hate my current career.</p>
              <p>I wish to take 'O'lvl and find a suitable course. Now currently earning for my classes needs.But i have my Diploma exams need to be re-taken, thought hate the course but it's a way to easy earn.</p>
              <p>Friends/some of my family members says it's a waste of time to take it but most of the elders says I should take up the studies. Both of them right, I'm total lost. Afraid I would fail but yet wish to upgrade myself.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So, been searching for classes/private/ITE part-time for 'O' lvl. They are too expensive. Is there anyway I could have a better price? my income hardly in 4 digits. Also wondering since now the ecodomy is not doing well, heard purhaps next year every cost will be expensive.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway help? thank you so much if do.</p>

              <p><br>Go e2i at redhill, they provide lots of course, free for singaporeans. If you want to work in casinos or like my pubs, just go there, they will train you, send you to USA if you want to be the casino bankers, and so on. There are chef, bakeries, hairdressing and all kinds of courses, only exclusively for Singaporeans</p>

              <p>U better find out what u wanna do. Go ask around, people who have done the work u r interested to dwelve in. You should do thorough research because once you enter the industry, you will be doing this for the rest of your life.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have met people who is doing their jobs until one day they reach 30 or 40, decide to change field because they found it too stressful, not earning enough money, they don't get along with their bosses, etc. It is not impossible but the older u r, the harder the transition.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is why u need to really make careful consideration before you enter that field.</p>

              <p><strong>angel7030</strong>, you'er right that working smart and putting effort is much faster. Though the problem is, I can't even speak or explain well + I'm slow learner. And every interview I have been before , they always look is my grades and certs..... There isn't anyone whom is close to me to support or recommand a job which I basically feel right in. I have to balance in mental &amp; physical    P.S. u have a cool job &gt;////&lt;</p>
