            <div class='col-md body'>first, establish the following facts:<br><br>1) do you like him<br>2) does he still like you<br>3) do you want him<br>4) does he like the loud gal<br>5) are you prepared to WORK to get him<br><br>judging superficially by the way you are flustered by the loud gal's attention on him, you do care about him in a romantic sense. (if you're not, it can only mean you're only missing his attention on you.) so if you like him, you have to give him the chance to attract you. my guess is that you're playing too cool. not responding to his...er... advances. you see, guys need encouragement also, inthis dating game.<br><br>let me ask you this. how did you react to his stalking and stuff?? pretend you never see him? act cool? or put on a very indifferent face? if so, you're only pushing him away. a guy can only "chase" a gal that long before he thinks he has no hope and stops (for normal guys anyway).<br><br>if u like him, give him encouragement. show that you appreciate what he's doing. heck, ask him out for lunch even. whether or not the loud gal is in the equation doesnt matter. if he likes you, the gal shouldnt matter at all...<br><br>good luck gal. just know what you really want ok?</div>

What do you think of guys falling in love with another in such a short time? </div></blockquote>sometimes u can c ppl who always clam that they r in love.<br>the reson some ppl fell in love very fast is because they r falling in love with love and not the person since felling in love is such a wonderful thing, many young ppl juz wan 2 expernice(no harm anyway)</div>

Since this is girl's problem, I skip the guy's part . Use the 1000 yrs old girl's method , play it hot and play it cold. Make him thinks you like him very much, but when he is a bit sure , and wants to take some actions, give him chance to go after you , ignore him and let him work hard. (If he cannot make it) He give up halfway , give him a hot again , like message him a good morning , suggest a date , depends how demoralise he is. Then ignore him again .<br><br>Never give a sure reply unless it is a confirm no. When you see him in your everyday life , juz smile very very sweetly and ( turn your head for him ) look into his eyes for 3 sec and walk away without hesitation.<br><br>However, it is possible one. First , get his attention again. Do something he wants dearly and will never expect to come from you. What you do in the past, do exactly the 180 degrees way. Examples are , suggest a dinner after work la, take the initiative to talk with him ( this is wad the other girl is doing I think). This will at least give him a message " hey, I am giving you one more chance to make your decision" , he might slow down with the other girl and rethink again.<br></div></blockquote>seriously which guy can tahan this? if you don't like him then just let him go lah, don't go n do this kinda things.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Xlashes:</div><div class="quote_body">You seemed to like him very much initally then suddenly you are not willling to give up your drama for him, W*** T** H***. You agreed to go out with him, then you are so mysterious. You are juz like a puzzle, the little boi is already inside the maze , he will want to solve the puzzle even if he dun like to solve it.</div></blockquote>+1<br><br></div>
