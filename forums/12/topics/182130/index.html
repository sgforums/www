Unless the girl don't mind getting dumped after sleeping with the boy, then it is better to let the boy make the first move. She might encourage him a little but not "go for him."!!!!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

In my school.. any girl who shorten's their skirt, all the boys will label them as prostitutes... and they stay FARRRR away frm them..<br><br>well the best advice would be building some communication then playing hard to get... attraction is actually made by the person himself... the person will think about you.. alot.. but in a neutral way.. then later they start thinking about happy thoughts with you... the more they think. but more attracted they are.<br><br>So keep playing hard to get and make him think of you.. do something to grab his attention and think of you at a positive manner.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>oh whatever... let nature take its course... just play cool and calm... people can sense it when you're nervous around them.

            <div class='col-md body'>Haha, I think I know wad to do. What I am going to tell u is damn dangerous  to all guys and girls . Use it only on those who really worth it.<br><br>All girls and guys go into relationships for positive feelings. Since this is girl's problem, I skip the guy's part . Use the 1000 yrs old girl's method , play it hot and play it cold. Make him thinks you like him very much, but when he is a bit sure , and wants to take some actions, give him chance to go after you , ignore him and let him work hard. (If he cannot make it) He give up halfway , give him a hot again , like message him a good morning , suggest a date , depends how demoralise he is. Then ignore him again .<br><br>Never give a sure reply unless it is a confirm no. When you see him in your everyday life , juz smile very very sweetly and ( turn your head for him ) look into his eyes for 3 sec and walk away without hesitation.<br><br>Handsome guys ( like me ) got so many choices , everyday got so many girls hint here and hint there. However , like all humans, they are cheap, they want those they cannot have . However, because they really got few chance to work very hard on girls, their threshold of failure is very low. That's why , when a not bad girl , shows her feelings for him, he will juz forget about working hard on another girl and go for the easier target.<br><br>However, it is possible one. First , get his attention again. Do something he wants dearly and will never expect to come from you. What you do in the past, do exactly the 180 degrees way. Examples are , suggest a dinner after work la, take the initiative to talk with him ( this is wad the other girl is doing I think). This will at least give him a message " hey, I am giving you one more chance to make your decision" , he might slow down with the other girl and rethink again.<br><br>Next when he " has take you for granted" , bite him hard and leave some scars. When he thot, lol, I am so handsome, this girl is smitten by me . Suddenly, he sense this girl has suggested 2 dinners after work but I haven hear from her for 1 week already , where is she ah ? will there be a third time ? Is she with so other guys or not ? I better check her out. He will call you or sms you. Say you are busy and keep the talk short, sms him yea, these few days got something to work on lo.<br><br>Then he will think of all the plans that you will agree to go out with him. When he ask you , tell him you cannot confirm and will let him know later. Reply him only after 2 days and cut the date short , by saying you are not going to miss some drama that you have been watching everyday. I bet now, he will think of you day and night<br><br>In all his days as the handsome guy, no girls dare to " punish" him in this way. You seemed to like him very much initally then suddenly you are not willling to give up your drama for him, W*** T** H***. You agreed to go out with him, then you are so mysterious. You are juz like a puzzle, the little boi is already inside the maze , he will want to solve the puzzle even if he dun like to solve it.</div>
