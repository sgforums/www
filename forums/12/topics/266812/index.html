            <div class='col-md body'>Well i guess there are many ways to define a flirt. But i guess your friend is not really sure about the qualities he want to find in his other partner ba. In my opinion, hes not a flirt as he did not officially stead with them for a long period of time. They can be just close friends first. I have seen gals who are like this too. Going out with different guys one on one but treat them as friends. Chatting with a gal constantly online does not make you a flirt ba. Its just that your friend is in need of female friends</div>

It's very likely that he does not have the wisdom to begin any BGR with any of those three girls. And that could explains why he couldn't get attached to any of those three girls.<br><br>By the way, you seems awfully concerned for this close friend of yours. Does his behaviour bothers you? And why do you think it bothers you?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i think some guys are like that. surprisingly many gals like such type of guy - some sort of charisma he holds and the ablilty to sweet talk gals. i had a frend also like that. one day he was drunk when i went up and call him - he asking me who i was???  (he name a few gals still cannot tell my name) i walk away anyway he was drunk. few years later, saw him with a baby, talk to him and know that he somehow got the lady pregnant and settle down. some guys are like that, ons or flirting (whatever), until they got someone pregnantd and that someone become his wife, even if he doesnt know her well. that's some guys life.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
