              <p>Dear All,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Please bear with me. I have no one else to turn to. And hope someone could give me good sound advise or solution to the problem. I am very deeply traumatized and stressed now.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My parents are't fond of my gf. In fact one of my parent hate my gf to the core. And swore to disown me and cut me off completely if i were to marry this girl. One of the few reasons for this are my gf are from a inferior and a lower class society. In fact, this is nothing serious. The major part is she is a very slow person and not very street smart either. In other words, a hindrance and a burden in life. Not only that, she is very weak in health and is loaded with all kinds of little little minor illness. Any guy who have the sane mind to date this type of woman are digging his own grave and only brings more headache more financial stress and other unseen probs.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I do see and understand my parent's harshness for their point on this. They only mean good for me and my future. I do not blame them. And i have moved out from my parents and stay with my friends along with my gf for now.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My gf is expecting now. And i am in a dillemma. Due to unstablity,lack of money,stress on parent unacceptance,and many more other things. I decided best is for her to go for termination for now. She do not want to. And have went missing.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Please advise the best way out for me. Thank you</p>

              <p>Dear Pitot,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Please do get it wrong.I do spared a thought for her. And i am serious about her and not what u just said. I loved her greatly. In fact, i do not allow her to work. As i like her to stay at home and relax and enjoy life. Although i am not a wealthy person. I feel the tiredness is worth it. At times she abuse me both verbally &amp; physically. So please understand i am a victim too in this case. I am sort of stuck. She is no all at an timid and innocent angel. I cant describe it..Something between an ah lian and a uneducated lazy slow person. You get what i mean?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There afew time, she stuck me with a wooden chair,objects and a knife deep into luckily my forearm. I was send to 24 clinic to get the stab stitched. I have the records and scars on me to proved. So who is bullying who.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I do not want to get off. three things in my mind now. Lack of money , parents unacceptance, Uncertain relationship. She casually called me and said she will have sex with other guys and find a new person. She doest need me and will not return and will survive.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I do not want to end this relationship. It is just that this is not the time yet. Do u get what i mean Pitot ? I dun even have money to eat a mcdonald meal let alone fund a birth operation fee that cost thousands.</p>

              <p>You are screwed big time dude.</p>
              <p>In any case, I dont think asking her to go for an abortion is fair to her, no wonder she ran away. I guess you should try talking to your parents and telling them the dilemma your in, perhaps they would understand and could very well help out financially.</p>
              <p>Since your in such a lack of money, I guess theres no other way out, talk to your parents. And please do not abort the baby, its innocent.</p>

              <p>I think i am screwed big time just as you guys said. I guess there is no way out except to kill myself. Both my parents are from the elite society. And there is no way they will accept my so called 'uncivilized' gf and even worse the child. To them, is it a image thing and reputation. And that their socialist/capitalist frens will mock at them and how silly their son has gotten in life. They will disown me 100 percent.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for me. I do not know wheater i could live with such a abusive ungrateful wife. I caught her stealing one time from her aunt bag. She denied it. And put on a very good show. She was't like this the 1st time we met. All sweet and demure. The stealing part was suspected on me as i was sleeping in that room. I just keep silent as i do not want to exposed my beloved gf. But she show no remorse or help to argue when her aunt said i took it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for screwing her, I do not even recall when likely the process taken place. Sex was almost none existance and stressful. I could not even hug her when sleeping.</p>

              <p>You can either continue to be your mummy's or daddy's blue-eye boy or you can grow up and be a real man and dad-to-be. </p>
              <p>You should just decide what is best for you.  You will be spending your better half of your latter life with your gf or wife-to-be who is bearing your child, and not with your mummy dearest or daddy dearest. Just grow up.  You cannot be so irresponsible and insensitive to tell your gf to go for an abortion.  You are not a chicken, right? You are a man.  C'mon, straighten out your thoughts and just get married.  For better or for worse, your wife should be the one you choose yourself, not someone chosen by your mum or dad.</p>

              <p>if she's really that weak and both of u are not financially stable, i think the baby comes at the wrong time.  Abortion may be good for her and the child.</p>

              <p>I duno your stand.. whether u really love her, whether u asked her to abort solely bcos of her weak health and ur financial situation.. or is it bcos u dun believe the child is yours?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>whatever it is, from the way u describe her, she seems to be having some mental problem or have an abusive nature.. in the long run, i can't imagine what will happen if no proper treatment is given.</p>

Do you really think ur friends will judge you on yourself or your GF?<br><br>2. I dun get it? Sex was almost none existance.... Sorry to say this bro... But u say she is low IQ, but you, i dunno who has low IQ here.... You had unprotected sex with her, without knowing her period and cant recall if u had sex? Sheesh...WTF<br><br>3. Too late now I guess.. talk to your parents to accept her.</p>

              <p>Le Toro,</p>

              <p>Let's put your parents's approval aside.. that is the last thing you should be concerned about.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Her behavior and IQ wasn't an issue to you when you had unprotected sex with her. So why is it such a big issue now ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Because of the baby ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sit down and think clearly.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>How did you find out about her pregnancy ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What about her own parents ? Are they willing to help take care of the baby while both of you try to establish your finances ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just because you are financially unstable now.. does not means you will be forever.... think long term.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Starting a family is not easy... you will need time and effort.</p>
              <p>Panicking only results in killing an innocent life. So stay calm.</p>
              <p> </p>
