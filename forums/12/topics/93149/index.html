            <div class='col-md body'>All i could say is that she is not ready to have a BGR with you. The time come too early for her and now i guessed she must have regretted getting into this relationship and wana to back out of it now and focus on her own things, like studies and friendships?<br><br>So if you really love her and want to be back with her again, you have no choice but to be patient and see how things develop.<br><br>But take my advice, the success rate of getting her back is quite low at this moment, nevertheless you be heartbroken but what to do?<br><br>You must be prepared to undergo heartbreak if you get into relationship as you never knows how things migh turn out to be unless you get into relationship and try it out, but if it can't work out, then got to move on from it.<br><br>Time will heal you slowly.........Take CAre!</div>

Frm where i am reading, i can see that although its a 1 yr r/s.. she does not feel comfortable with u cause of your possessivenes.. She has mentioned that she is busy with her school work.. If she is really busy, than let her be.. I agree that although she is your first love, she wants certain things to be her way and such..<br><br>Sit down and think for yourself.. There may be other girls suitable still for u.. Leave ur options open.. let her concentrate on her studies.. If you really love her.. wait for her.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Chill down a bit dude. Back off and give her some time and space for now. Maybe she will think things through and patch up with you. Trying to force a patch up now will show you being over possessivenes. Start by apologising for your past behavior, say you respect her decision but ask to remain as friends. Try rebuilding the relationship from this stage, showing you are capable of changing your nature. Show concern and care for her bit by bit but demand nothing from her. But you must really be capable of changes becos if you revert back to old ways, thing going to get real worse.</div>
