My father will complain, wtf is she here for? She doesn't do housework? She doesn't cook for me? Come here eat and sleep only, you know why see here? Because she got no place to go! Your uncle don't want take of her! ( Not really true, because her default home is at my uncle's, just that she stays with us to take care of my sister and me. ) So after many many years, he finally chased her back to my uncle's house, this time for good. And I thought it would be over...<br><br>Then he started complaining, you think do housework easy ar? You think cook for you easy ar? Ya rite... he barely doesn anything besides throwing the clothes in the washing machine, and cook, wash plates, nowadays he don't even bother to cook, most of the time go out and buy back... don't even mop the floor lor, last time my grandmother around still got people mop the floor de...<br><br>Nowadays still scold my mother when she comes back from work say she never do housework...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Usually, he quite normal de lah, won't complain anything, but when he drunk he will anyhow say things de lor, everything also explain... sometimes I thinking don't bother liao lah, EVEN if he really has nothing to do liao, just nid to eat and sleep, he also will complain, YOU KNOW I EVERYDAY VERY SIAN OR NOT?!!!!!

Quite similar to mine. It's been more than 15 years since he started those nonsense. NOw he got no house to stay, I've not seen him since 2003 Aug, Just know that he's still alive, but with no money. He divorced my mother last year. Thinking he'd get 50% of the house since he only paid only couple of thousands, it'd be a great opportunity to earn back. In the end, the courts paid him only 20%. 5% lesser than what my mother initially agreed to give him.<br><br>TS, Don't worry, his retribution will come. But you yourself must understand the importance of being a person. That you must learn how to be strong, how to be independant. Be the pillar. People rely on you and need your decisions to survive. Aim for that.</div>
