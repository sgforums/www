              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">I am the
              second child in my family </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">My parents
              have 4 children in total and the youngest is 13 this year</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">My parents
              have borrowed and accumulated the interest of up to $200k from 20 over
              different LS. Yes, my mum is foolish, but all was done out of her love for her
              children</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">My parents
              CPF have been depleted to pay for the house they bought but there is still an
              outstanding amount of a few hundred thousand(5RF) and have to pay cash every
              month, on top of the expenses that they family spend, which is just barely
              enough</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Finally their
              saving have been depleted and friends and families shun from then, fearing that
              they might borrow more money, she borrowed from the LS to pay of her current debt,
              hoping to pay the LS asap, but interest compounded and her debt just
              skyrocketed, they derived a plan to lend from a LS to pay her current LS debt
              and hope to pay them slowly but it was just too much and they have to sell the
              house to pay for the LS payments and they rented a house from my aunt</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">It was
              still insufficient to pay them all and the situation got worst when LSs refused
              to lend her any more money(coz of the plan they derived) and the amount totaled
              up to over 200k, which my parents have no ability to pay. The LS payments have
              to be paid but my parents’ income was just too little to pay them all without
              the help of another loan and my mother ended up not paying most of them.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">They called
              day and night to pester my parents and sends threat sms to my family, they
              doped my mother into giving them our residential address and now, they are
              knocking at our door daily</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">I was
              terrified at first, after learning about this but we are also the cause of her
              current problems</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">My mother told
              me that she would go to jail if we called the police and the LS would not let
              us off. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">She talked
              to us about her situation and told me the procedure to claiming death insurance </span><span style="font-family: Wingdings;       " lang="EN-US">L</span><span lang="EN-US"> should
              anything happened to them </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The income
              my parents earn everyday is paid to LS leaving then penniless and they have
              less than 100$ with them and we are surviving thru bread and financial
              assistance in school. They still owes many payments from many different LS</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">I don’t blame
              them but I feel that they are really silly to borrow $ from LS in the first
              place</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">I really
              wish that someone could help my parents out of this situation </span><span style="font-family: Wingdings;       " lang="EN-US">L</span><span lang="EN-US"> I know I am a little naïve to ask
              the people from this forum to help with monetary issues, especially such a
              large sum but even a little help would do…</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">I really
              want to help them but what could I do. Does anyone know any job I can take up
              to help to settle at least some of their debts? ( I have remedial lessons

              It is not an offence to borrow from unlicensed money lenders. Please seek assistance from Police immediately.

              You are not alone. Many have sought assistance from Police. Nothing have happened to them or their family members. 
              
              Don't worry. Just stop all forms of payment and make a Police report immediately. And never take any loan from Ah long to service the payment. 
              
              Lastly, remember to alert Police immediately if you are asked to do or carry out illegal "business".

              <p>TS, you are 16 now and the most important thing you need to do is to get your O-level/N-level certificate. As much as I hate it, grades are still very important and die die you must at least get an O-level certificate.</p>
              <p>Forget about your parents (You can't care too much), remember that you are still a kid and kids can't take care of kids. </p>

              <p>But the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) needed Ah Gee's help to track down the wanted criminal.</p>
              <p>Several investigators had tried to speak to the chauffeur, but he refused to reveal any information about his employer.</p>
              <p>In the end, a resourceful CPIB officer, Deputy Director Teng Khee Fatt, spoke to Ah Gee and gained his trust.</p>
              <p>Moved after being called a "good man" by the officer, Ah Gee finally gave the CPIB details that helped force Ah Long San's hand.</p>
              <p>The case involving Ah Long San is one of 18 cases highlighted in 
              CPIB's coffee table book titled The Journey - 60 Years of Fighting 
              Corruption in Singapore.</p>
              <p>The 120-page publication was launched on tuesday on the bureau's 60th anniversary commemorative ceremony.</p>
              <p>Besides the Ah Long San case, other high-profile cases involving 
              offenders from all walks of life are also included, such as former 
              ministers, policemen, football players and senior executives of 
              companies.</p>
              <p><strong>Feared criminal </strong></p>
              <p>Ah Long San was an infamous moneylender and criminal in the 1990s.</p>
              <p>He owned a number of legitimate businesses like karaoke pubs, but he was also involved in illegal moneylending.</p>
              <p>Despite being a feared criminal, he was not caught for a long time.</p>
              <p>That was because those who had information about him preferred to 
              keep mum, fearing for their safety and the safety of their loved ones.</p>
              <p>And Ah Long San had moles within the police force who tipped him off to raids.</p>
              <p>In all, he managed to bribe nine crooked cops, all of whom ended up behind bars.</p>
              <p>The highest ranking was a former assistant superintendent of police, 
              who was 29 years old when he was jailed 18 months on Jan 11, 2000.</p>
              <p>The former cop, who used to work as an air steward, first met the loan shark at a 24-hour Geylang food stall in 1994.</p>
              <p>Ah Long San later became aware of the younger man's desire to join the police force and encouraged him to do so.</p>
              <p>He also sponsored the ex-policeman's education in law.</p>
              <p>Before he joined the police force in October 1997, the former cop had accepted various sums of money from Ah Long San.</p>
              <p>This included a S$20,000 advance in 1995 to complete his law studies 
              in Britain after he failed his second-year external law examination 
              here.</p>
              <p>The younger man remained in close contact with the loan shark through the years.</p>
              <p>It was the former cop who introduced his other colleagues to Ah Long San.</p>
              <p>The ex-policeman was convicted on four corruption charges - for 
              receiving three bribes of S$1,000 each and one of S$5,000 between 
              November 1997 and January 1999.</p>
              <p>He took the money and used his office and contacts to influence the outcome of investigations.</p>
              <p>And when the loan shark's brother was arrested, Ah Long San used his 
              moles in the police force to check on the status of the case.</p>
              <p>The crooked cops were also told to treat Ah Long San's sibling nicely.</p>
              <p>Ah Long San was later convicted and sentenced to 18 months' jail for bribing a then-police officer.</p>
              <p>Knowing that he could be serving more jail time, he went into hiding 
              after failing to appear in court when the appeal against his 18-month 
              sentence was heard.</p>
              <p>But The New Paper managed to score an exclusive interview with him in June 2001 while he was on the run.</p>
              <p>Speaking to TNP then, he said: "My jail term is 18 months. But I 
              still have several cases pending.... I will be in jail for a long time."</p>
              <p>But he was arrested on July 9, 2001, after he surrendered to the authorities.</p>
              <p>He was jailed for 10 years on Oct 4, 2001, when he was 45.</p>
              <p>It was then the heaviest sentence meted out by the courts for graft.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">PLEASE READ, ITS KiNDA LONG BUT I NEEEEED HELP! </span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">i know a lot of you have good intentions to help me, my mother have stopped paying</span><strong style="line-height: 1.231;">almost all</strong><span style="line-height: 1.231;"> of the LS, </span><strong style="line-height: 1.231;">except for the few who know my mothers whereabout</strong><span style="line-height: 1.231;">. but you have to understand calling the police is one thing, angering the boss of the money lending company is another</span></p>
              <p>yes, you all have guessed it, <strong>they attacked my old residential area</strong> and add all the cliche nasties, and yes, the police might help to a certain extend, they can catch the people who borrowed the money to my parents, and all the runners but they will not be able to catch the boss of the 'company'  as they are too discreet, if they are really successful, why is the rate of loan shark harrassments still so high? policemen are also prone to corruption and they are <strong>not able to protect you 24/7 and from everyone</strong>, especially if my parents <strong>stopped paying as many as 20 LS at once</strong>. you cant denie that something is bound to happend... they would hunt my parents down and probably do some nasty things to them. the loan sharks are capable of all brutal acts and i cannot afford to lose my parents. <strong>they are still not telling me everything despite probing and i am really worried as they are telling me to save some important numbers in case somethng happend to them ( " accidents" ), as if they have encountered some really terrible problems</strong></p>
              <p>i can boldly say that <strong>i am richer than my parents</strong>. they are <strong>penniless now (literally) while im left with $10. </strong>they dont even have the<strong> capital they need to buy the ingredients for their business</strong>, and all my relative shunned us further when they recive their call for help. it doesnt matter if we are looked down on but i really want my family to be safe and sound. <span style="line-height: 1.231;">all the phone bills remain unpaid and services gets disconnected one by one, red reminder letters from SP and the cheque for their  food stall rent got bounced...</span></p>
              <p>i want to help them, i <strong>REALLY</strong> do! but i am incapable, and it would affect my studies if any traumatsing events were to occur...  my parents are keeping quiet about everything and really concerned about their children's (us) safety... those who are a parent would know ( i suppose) . its easy to say " call the police, the police will help you" but when you are put in a situation were the police are not capable of protecing your chlidren 100% vs sacraficing your own life for your children's safety what yould you do ? i am incapable answering the Q and only my parents can make the right decision... all i know is that i do not wish to lose my parents......<span style="line-height: 1.231;"><strong>i have advised my parents to call the police<span style="color: #ff0000;">*****</span></strong></span></p>
              <p>i do not know what to do...  but i know that i have to <strong>raise enough money</strong> (not for the LS)<span style="line-height: 1.231;"> to keep the family going, e.g, for my <strong>parents to continue working and for my sibilings</strong> who are much younger then me. but How ? i need help. desperately.... im<strong>willing</strong> to do <strong>anything</strong>!(Legal)... am i able to raise money from forums?</span></p>
              <p>i am <strong>actually scared </strong>of being attacked by loan sharks on my way home from school, being followed by them and the <strong>loan sharks harming my sibilings and parents</strong>...</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">*****</span>if my parents were to call the police and assist the police in the capturing of LS,<strong>would they go to jail?</strong> especially when my parents are the ones who <strong>borrowed $ from them in the first place?</strong> and <strong>are they and their children safe</strong> from the <strong>attacks from the LS</strong>?  as there have been unreported case of brutal acts by the LS even after police reports have been made... what would you guys have done? knowing that you have owed more then 200k dollars with interest still compounding from LS? </p>

              part of Police’s strategy in the fight against loansharks is the 
              involvement of the community. Police officers cannot be omnipresent; 
              however, residents and those working in the housing estates are 
              constantly present and can effectively help the Police as well as the 
              community. </span></p>

              the Police with their vigilance and immediate reporting of suspicious 
              persons and loanshark harassment activities in their neighbourhoods. 
              Police seek the public’s assistance to provide detailed descriptions of 
              such persons and to work with the Police to solve the case. The public 
              should however avoid doing anything which would put them in harm’s way.</span></p>
              <p class="miccontenttext">To provide Police information on 
              loansharking activities, members of the public can call the Police 
              Hotline at 1800-255-0000 or to dial ‘999’ if urgent assistance is

              not want to approach the Police directly may call the National Crime

              (1800-X-AH-LONG)
              (9am to 5pm from Mondays to Friday) to provide the information which 
              will be channelled to Police to assist us with our investigations. All 
              information will be kept strictly confidential.</p>
              <p class="miccontentheading"><strong> Victims of loansharking activities<br> </strong> <span class="miccontenttext">Victims of loanshark

              required. Police will investigate into all reports of loanshark 
              harassment. They can also consider installing CCTVs at their residence 
              to deter harassment and to provide Police with footage capture to assist
               with our investigations. </span></p>

              Community Safety and Security Programme
              (CSSP). COP groups are trained by Police on safety, observation skills 
              and crime prevention measures. COP help augment police patrols by being 
              the 'eyes and ears' for the Police during their patrols. COP will alert 
              the Police when they see suspicious activities or persons loitering 
              within their neighbourhood, thus helping to detect and prevent crime and
               security threats. Volunteers under the COP scheme would be encouraged 
              to pay attention to HDB void decks and other HDB common areas in their 
              routine patrols. During COP patrols, should they notice any crime in 
              progress or any persons behaving suspiciously, the volunteers would call
               for the Police.<br> </span><br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="miccontentheading">Neighbourhood Watch

              Neighbourhood Watch Groups (NWGs) at affected locations. Neighbours 
              living beside, below and above affected units are engaged to form NWGs, 
              informing the Police at the onset of any suspicious activity. This is 
              critical in the early detection and intervention before the harassment 
              can cause any injury to persons or damage to property.<br> <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="miccontentheading">How to join</span></span><br> <span class="miccontenttext">If you are keen to play a

              <p class="miccontentheading"><strong> <strong> Engaging the Community</strong> <br> </strong><span class="miccontenttext">Educational posters on
               the consequences of loanshark harassment or borrowing from loansharks 
              have been displayed at 
              
              locations such as
              the notice boards of HDB lift lobbies, and advisories against loanshark 
              harassment are also distributed to residents 
              
              to create awareness amongst the public. Officers from Neighbourhood 
              Police Centres (NPCs) have also gone house-to-house to engage residents 
              and to give them advisories by hand to encourage them to do their part 
              against this scourge. 
              
              Police have garnered the support from the grassroots and community and 
              embarked on various CSSP Projects to combat the UML situation. The 
              essence of these initiatives involves engaging the community to be the 
              extra eyes and ears of the Police, reporting cases immediately when any 
              suspicious activity is sighted within their neighbourhood. The 
              involvement from the residents and constant vigilance to look out for 
              suspicious persons/activities would ensure that their neighbourhood 
              remains safe and secure.
              Grassroots organisations, 
              
              schools,
              and town councils 
              
              other agencies are also encouraged to
               
              
              engage the community
               to educate them on the consequences of borrowing from loansharks as 
              well as in the dissemination of crime prevention materials. If required,
               the materials can be obtained from the Resources section in this

              <p class="miccontentheading"><strong> Parents too, have a part to play <br> </strong><span class="miccontenttext">A worrying trend 
              observed is the increase in the number of youths (seven to 19 years) 
              caught for their involvement in loansharking and harassment activities. 
              In the first half of 2011, 98 youths, about half of whom were students, 
              were arrested for loansharking activities as compared to the 78 youths 
              arrested in the first half of 2010. Amongst those arrested, 
              investigations revealed that most were recruited by the loansharks to 
              conduct acts of harassment, while others had assisted the loansharking 
              syndicates by providing bank accounts for their illegal operations. Some
               of them were also involved in the distribution of namecards, pamphlets 
              and flyers advertising ‘easy-loans’ for illegal moneylenders. </span></p>
              <p><span class="miccontenttext">Youths are easy prey for 
              loansharks who dangle easy money as an incentive and provide false 
              assurance that if caught, they would only be punished with probation. 
              This is a myth, as youths may be sentenced to Reformative Training 
              Centre, even for their first offence. Also, Under the Moneylenders Act 
              2010 (Revised Edition), it is also now an offence for persons who cause 
              or procure persons under 16 to engage in such acts of harassment. This 
              is punishable with imprisoned up to seven years, a maximum fine of 
              $300,000, and a maximum of 12 strokes of the cane. </span></p>
              <p><span class="miccontenttext">Police seek the public’s 
              continued cooperation in our fight to stamp out the scourge of 
              loansharks from our community. Parents should also be mindful of their 
              children’s activities and to educate them so that the youths do not fall
               prey to these unscrupulous criminals. They can do so by reminding their
               loved ones about the severity of loansharking-related offences and 
              intervene promptly should they display tell-tale signs of being under 
              the influence of bad company.</span></p>

              all</strong><span style="line-height: 1.231;"> of the

              few who know my mothers whereabout</strong><span style="line-height: 1.231;">. but you have to understand calling the
              police is one thing, angering the boss of the money lending company
              is another</span></p>
              <p>yes, you all have guessed it, <strong>they attacked my old
              residential area</strong> and add all the cliche nasties, and
              yes, the police might help to a certain extend, they can catch the
              people who borrowed the money to my parents, and all the runners
              but they will not be able to catch the boss of the 'company'
               as they are too discreet, if they are really successful, why
              is the rate of loan shark harrassments still so high? policemen are
              also prone to corruption and they are <strong>not able to
              protect you 24/7 and from everyone</strong>, especially if my
              parents <strong>stopped paying as many as 20 LS at
              once</strong>. you cant denie that something is bound to happend...
              they would hunt my parents down and probably do some nasty things
              to them. the loan sharks are capable of all brutal acts and i
              cannot afford to lose my parents. <strong>they are still not
              telling me everything despite probing and i am really worried as
              they are telling me to save some important numbers in case somethng
              happend to them ( " accidents" ), as if they have encountered some
              really terrible problems</strong></p>
              <p>i can boldly say that <strong>i am richer than my
              parents</strong>. they are <strong>penniless now (literally)
              while im left with $10. </strong>they dont even have
              the<strong> capital they need to buy the ingredients for their
              business</strong>, and all my relative shunned us further when they
              recive their call for help. it doesnt matter if we are looked down
              on but i really want my family to be safe and
              sound. <span style="line-height: 1.231;">all the phone bills
              remain unpaid and services gets disconnected one by one, red
              reminder letters from SP and the cheque for their  food stall
              rent got bounced...</span></p>
              <p>i want to help them, i <strong>REALLY</strong> do! but
              i am incapable, and it would affect my studies if any traumatsing
              events were to occur...  my parents are keeping quiet about
              everything and really concerned about their children's (us)
              safety... those who are a parent would know ( i suppose) . its easy
              to say " call the police, the police will help you" but when you
              are put in a situation were the police are not capable of protecing
              your chlidren 100% vs sacraficing your own life for your children's
              safety what yould you do ? i am incapable answering the Q and only
              my parents can make the right decision... all i know is that i do
              not wish to lose my parents......<span style="line-height: 1.231;"><strong>i have advised my parents to call the
              police<span style="color: #ff0000;">*****</span></strong></span></p>
              <p>i do not know what to do...  but i know that i have
              to <strong>raise enough money</strong> (not for the
              LS)<span style="line-height: 1.231;"> to keep the family
              going, e.g, for my <strong>parents to continue working and for

              i need help. desperately.... im<strong>willing</strong> to
              do <strong>anything</strong>!(Legal)... am i able to raise
              money from forums?</span></p>
              <p>i am <strong>actually scared </strong>of being
              attacked by loan sharks on my way home from school, being followed
              by them and the <strong>loan sharks harming my sibilings and
              parents</strong>...</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">*****</span>if my parents were to
              call the police and assist the police in the capturing of
              LS,<strong>would they go to jail?</strong> especially when my
              parents are the ones who <strong>borrowed $ from them in the
              first place?</strong> and <strong>are they and their
              children safe</strong> from the <strong>attacks from the
              LS</strong>?  as there have been unreported case of brutal
              acts by the LS even after police reports have been made... what
              would you guys have done? knowing that you have owed more then 200k
              dollars with interest still compounding from LS? </p>

                          residence were harassed by loansharks. The 49-year-old was at Hougang Ave 9. He had also failed to

              <p>Loan sharks splashed paint over three vehicles in a Hougang carpark 
              following a three-month campaign of harassment that has left neighbours 
              fearing for their safety.<br> <br> The illegal lenders scribbled messages threatening to set houses on fire if "Kelvin" did not pay his debt.<br> <br> Residents awoke yesterday to find the two cars and a van covered in red,
               yellow and black paint near Block 651, Hougang Avenue 8.<br> <br> They said loan sharks had been targeting a particular flat for the past three months, but the debtor did not live there.</p>
