            <div class='col-md body'>Same age as you bro... but your mentality sucks. To be honest. If you're are getting a GF just because "everyone else has it"... I really pity your partner-to-be.<br><br>I'm just like you... not in a relationship yet. Just to sidetrack abit, there's this girl i'm after. She knows I like her... and I heard from her friend that she once had a crush on me. But why isn't anything happening? Truth is, she told me she isn't ready. At that point, I realised... she is right! We aren't ready... she's too caught up with her life... i'm too slack with mine. I realised at my current status, I might not be able to dedicated wholely to her (Because i'm very dedicated to video gaming, though i would give it up for her if she asked). It just came upon me that... "Shit, I think it's abit too early". I still love her alot... and I know she knows it. We still keep in contact even thought I'm away from school and waiting for my results. We hardly see each other without school as a medium. She's taking her O levels so it'd be busy for her.<br><br>Anyway, I just hope you realise... when she comes... she comes. If she don't come... it means you are expecting too much... or you are sleeping. Don't get a GF just because your buddy has one. In fact, the life of solitude may not be as bad as you think...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Peace</div>
