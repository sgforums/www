            <div class='col-md body'>My good fren and his girlfren also broke up but later reconciled and is now married. They were together since their JC days and when they broke up, it was already like you 9 years into the relationship.<br><br>After they reconciled, I asked him why the break up in the first place, their situation is almost like yours...their relationship is at a bottleneck and they dun know how to progress as a couple anymore...as a result, they start to quarrel and find faults with little things with each other and my fren even start to consider dating other girls....<br><br>They decided to break up and through the few months of their break up, they continue to meet up as frens to tok and they realised that they still love one another. They also realised, as boyfren and girlfren, there is only so much they can give to each other in terms of emotions, physical and mentally....they need to bring their relationship to another level and that is marriage....they told us they felt that if they do not get married, then they should stay apart.<br><br>Dun get me wrong, you should not get married just to save a relationship. You should see marriage as a progression of your relationship. Its like working, no matter how long you work as a salesperson, being a sales manager is another level of committment and experience, you cannot get that while you are a salesperson.<br><br>So sit down and tok to your BF and see whether you all should consider getting married. No matter how long you have been a couple, getting married is another level of committment and experience for both of you. Marriage can bring your relationship to a greater height.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To be fair, I suppose it cannot be easy to be going through what you're going through now, but forgive me for being blunt, marriage is something that you shouldn't even consider at this point in time(nevermind the 9 years, it still wouldn't be right even if you had been together for 90 years if you two ever came to such conclusions!).<br><br>As some have pointed out, there're so many possible reasons as to why your bf feels the way he does - be it because he has fallen for someone else, awakened to the reality that you're not the one he wants to spend the rest of his life with(even if that has taken 9 years on his part to realise, but to be fair, these 9 years are very special times in anyone's lives as people will invariably have a change in mindset of goals in lives - which in turn would affect the kind of partner they want - as they move from adolescence to adulthood), or maybe, he is just bored with the sort of routine you're going through and nothing more - and without knowing your bf and you personally, it is indeed quite hard for anyone to advise which category your bf falls under. Hence, I wouldn't like to speculate on the reason for your bf feeling the way he does because my guess would only be as good as yours...<br><br>Nevertheless, I suppose you ought to only change if you think what he says makes sense(and you genuinely want to change) and not make those changes exclusively for him because he wants it and you want to salvage the relationship - it might work for the time being, but there is absolutely nothing to safeguard your future(as you might be tempted to think). If anything, it might actually be a cause of contention later on in your relationship(whether you're married to him or not) and might spark off more dissent. Basically, I don't believe anyone should change himself/herself solely to accomodate his/her partner - if anything, he should learn to accept you for who you're and if he can't, then I think it might be better you let this relationship go. As a last resort(and cruel as this may sound), I think you'd be better off living with 9 years of a relationship gone sour than a wrecked marriage that would haunt you later on.<br><br>Then again, of course no one is in a better position to find out why your bf has had this sudden change of heart than you - perhaps, a heart-to-heart talk with him to iron things out might do wonders if this was simply a case of him getting bored with the mundane routine you've gotten up to for 9 years. At least, he has been honest enough with you to tell you what he feels - and hopefully, the chance he has provided for you two to work something out will prove sufficient to salvage your relationship...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Afterall, both of you have been together for 9 years and the moments and experiences that both of you shared can never be forgotten or erased...it can only be overtaken.<br><br>Applying changes to yourself according to what he want will need to depend on what exactly are the changes that he has requested. Of course don't be silly and go change into the clone of another slut that your bf has been fantasising about at his workplace. Change only those critical flaws that will impact your relationship, and ignore his nonsense request which are irrelevant. If you really feel that a particular changes will improve your relationship with your bf without losing who you really is, then by all means...go ahead. But think thoroughly if those changes are really necessary at all before you even try to go pretending that you have already changed.<br><br>Keep your options open and your eyes open wider. Since your bf has already hinted to you that he is very easily interested in every other girl except you, you could be a little bit indifferent towards him unless you're desperately trying to bind him to you forever. Nothing is forever, and it's a choice that either one of you can easily make to abandon this relationship. You wouldn't wanna try your best and waste all your time to hold onto a sinking ship like Titanic, wouldn't you?

It'll be good to prick his jealousy at this time, so that he will realise how important you are to him once again.
