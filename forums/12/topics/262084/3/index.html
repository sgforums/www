They are slowing killing your already low self-confidence and esteem.<br><br>2) Bring out all the positive stuffs and thinking. What's the best thing you can do? Gaming? Writing? Crafts etc? Indulge yourself more in it, make it become your forte. It will help build up your confidence, open more doors to meet new friends and have more topics to talk about when you talk to girls.</div>
