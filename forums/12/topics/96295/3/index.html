            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Princess...<br><br>I think good advices have been pretty much given out to you by the others to you...<br><br>I just wanna highlight that if you find spending much time on your studies to no fruits.. Learn to destress yourself at the same time... Learn to study smart...<br><br>About studying together with the one you're interested in... It'll be great if things can work out... Don't have too much doubts in yourself but don't carry too high a hope too...? Understand that whether things work out for the both of you (if things don't work out that way, you probably should still try and keep him as a good friend if you can....? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> ), you'll still need to meet your studies requirements... You'll never know if you might meet someone more suitable further down your life... Don't be dishearted... He don't necessarily have to appear now.... All the best for your studies...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

Since I was under a scholarship, every year there would be a meeting for all of the scholars...it is a compulsory meeting where they would discuss our grades and stuff like that.<br><br>So today I went and so they started calling people to give out certs to those who did well in the previous semester. And they gave out warning letters to those who didn't do so well. Never did I expect to get one of those warning letters. Never in my whole life have I been so embarassed...and I am especially humiliated because he was there and he was one of the recipients for the 4.0 perfect score cert.<br><br>So after I got the letter, I sat down for a while, trying to digest everything...then the tears started to want to come out so I ran to the nearest washroom and cried there. After a while, i went out and it turned out that he has been waiting out of the washroom for me, he told me that he was scared I might do something silly. I asked him why is he so good to me, I told him I am dumb and stupid, i can't even keep a promise to myself to get good grades. We spent two hours talking but I still feel inferior and dumb right now. I dunno why...I am afraid that I might lose him soon, when he started to see all these bad sides of me...just when i started to like him...and another thing is I disappointed even myself, I have always told myself there is a standard that I have to fulfil and now I can't even keep that promise to myself...I feel so useless and helpless right now...<br><br>why things like this always happen to me... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> Fell like crying again...<br><br>i.c.y</div></blockquote>Dear icyprincess,<br><br>Don't worry.. There's nothing in getting bad results and letting him see you in such state.. at least this point of time.. you know he cares for you.. Don't feel inferior.. be confident! Don't think about losing him.. think about how you wanna know him more.. In this way.. it will keep you going.. rather than everytime think negative.. that wont help you in any way.. or maybe worse! RIGHT?<br><br>If you believe in yourself.. and have faith in it.. I'm sure you can do it.. right now.. you keep telling yourself.. you ain't good.. you are this you are that.. By saying all these.. you think it will make you a better person?? NO!! it wont! It'll jus make you worse than ever...<br><br>You ain't useless.. you jus need time to prove.. Helpless?? No.. you can ask for help if you willing to.. like asking him to tutor you.. a way to get to know him better.. and oso.. at least can spend some decent time together.. right.. If you are dumb.. you wont even be in the scholarship program.. My dear girl..<br><br>Don't think that all these are your bad sides.. take it as a lesson.. tell yourself.. no such thing will repeat again..<br><br>Cheers..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sorry if this sounds offensive but if your self complex is affected by ur grades, then i feel that you will be a very sad person in future.  We are who we are. Studies, relationships, friends, looks are what we have not who we are. What we have do not determine who we are.  If our moods and lives are determined by what we have or do not have, this world will have many sad people.<br><br>I know its not nice to get bad grades, i wanted so badly to get ACEs when i was in Uni, well I got some, i did not for some.  Well I tell myself, will I die if i dun get good grades? Well I wun! unless I choose to lah.  Recently I also got a very big setback in my career path and I am seriously considering quitting because I find that I am not being valued despite my contributions. Not ashamed to say, I cried the very night while I was driving back after I confronted my boss. I cannot stomach it lah. But after that, I just tell myself, If i lose this job, will I die? I wun! Therefore I feel better now knowing that I still got a beautiful life to look forward to with my friends and family hehehe.<br><br>Anyway I think you may just be temporarily saddened by the bad results lah, I believe you will do better if you believe in yourself, in who you are.</div>
