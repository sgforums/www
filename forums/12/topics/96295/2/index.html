There are so many other girls who are better than me in a thousand of ways...most of them smarter, prettier, and I can list a lot more...I do not believe that I can have him in my life...he hasn't asked me to be his gf yet actually, but everyone is saying that they can tell he likes me a lot...i dunno why but there is a voice in me which keeps telling me he wun like me as much anymore...i mean there is such a big gap in between us, esp when it comes to who is smarter...*sigh* I wish I can be on par with him but yet I am afraid I cudn't...I realize now that i am actually afraid to lose him but mebbe it is better to get out of this now than later..then I will be hurt even more...<br><br>I used to have a lot of self esteem. but since I came here, it has been dropping...dropping...just when I thought I had seen a light at the end of the tunnel, it is now flickering and threatening to disappear again...it has always been that way for me...i cud never get what I wish for most...<br><br>i shud have never let myself to fall for him so fast.<br><br>i.c.y</div></blockquote>In the first place, don't compare urself with other people..Everyone is different and sometimes the different is the thing that make the person special..If u feel that he wun like u as much as before because he is smarter..Than he is not a good person to be with..Being together shouldn't have any judgement of who is better..Everybody is afraid of losing somebody..But how could u lose somebody without having them in the first place..Hold on to this relationship, who knows it might work out soon..<br><br>Before loving someone else, u first have to love urself..Love urself, build back ur self-esteem..With self confidence, wat ever u do will be easy and u will have a happier time in doing it..I am also like u, i can never get what i wish for most..But this doesn't mean is the end of the world..Who knows i might get something even better in the future..When it comes to relationship, there is no time limit to how fast one person fall in love..</div>
