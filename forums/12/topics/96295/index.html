            <div class='col-md body'>Hi icy princess,<br><br>Be strong. If you give up now, you WILL lose him... if not doing well enough will mean a risk in having him out of your life, wouldn't giving up do more damage than anything?<br><br>It's a scholarship that you are talking about... you are GOOD... i even failed a simple local module, so should i start looking for my mum's dishwashing liquid and gulp it down???<br><br>I look upon you in high esteem... if you had made it here... YOU WILL MAKE IT THERE!!!!!<br><br>Trust me, don't give up. Be strong.. let the fear of losing him not be a deterrent and pressure... instead take it as a propellant... Go forward! Don't backslide!!!<br><br>Here's the utmost support from a stranger, hope it'll help lift u up a little!</div>

I feel like I'm better than poly students because I do believe than I am smarter than most of you poly-'kia's as you call yourself. See? You and your dialect-littered-speech? In fact, I even feel superior to some of the students in JC. Because I know I am smarter than you.
