            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Chapter 4</strong></span><br><br>It has been three months since we knew each other, virtually. We have exchanged MSN contacts and occasionally chatted at night when she logged on Â– I am always online anyway. The bizarre thing was that after that time, we have not met each other in the lift coincidentally. Not even once. It seemed that fate tactically brush us separately; either I went back home before she did or vice vista Â– but never the same time. We could talk about most things online, but seriously speaking; I doubt it could be the same in reality. I always imagine seeing myself simultaneously with her in the same lift, but, completely dumbfounded.<br><br>That would look so stupid on me.<br><br>Â‘Hey, you there?Â’<br><br>Upon seeing her message, almost immediately, my fingers dashed through the keyboard in such amazing speed.<br><br>Â‘Ya?Â’<br><br>Â‘My mum told me that you failed your finance paper last term.Â’<br><br>My mum again! I wouldnÂ’t be surprised if Snowy knew when I stopped drinking from my milk bottle, what size of shirt I wore or even my PSLE results. Suddenly, I felt my privacy being invaded as though my personal life is being reported to people outside this house. Kaoz.<br><br>Â‘You knowÂ… women always gossipÂ… keke...Â’<br><br>Yes and there are three women in total. You know what they always say: twoÂ’s a company, threeÂ’s a crowd? Too much information spreading across causal conversation would results in embarrassment to the party you people are talking about.<br><br>Â‘You mean you? LOL!Â’<br><br>Right. Namely, itÂ’s me. Anyway, I have little interest in finance and I would probably offer all my finance notes to the paper shedder after this semester. To top it up, my tutor sucked big time. Ok, maybe not him personally; itÂ’s his teaching method. I canÂ’t seem to absorb all those figures, theories and stuff; I am the marketing sort of guys.<br><br>Â‘Hahaha! Really?Â’<br><br>I guess soÂ… resigning to fate. I donÂ’t want to fail my supplementary paper or I risk retaining one year. Tomorrow, I would burn some joss sticks and pray for some miracle to happen. If that final resort doesnÂ’t work, I am so screwed.<br><br>Â‘Hahaha, you are so cuteÂ… I could teach you if you want.Â’<br><br>I beg your pardon? Teach me? You and me? Two people? <span style="font-style: italic;">Futari? Liang Ge Ren?</span><br><br>Â‘=PÂ’<br><br>Is this one example of girls playing the favourite passive guessing game? I mean, what is Â‘=PÂ’ suppose to mean? A yes or a no? And whatÂ’s with that tongue? An expression of something cheeky? Is Snowy some kind of psychopath, as we meet up, she would murder me, cook my kidneys and consume them?<br><br>Â‘HahaÂ…SiaoÂ… Cloud, you think too muchÂ…Â’<br><br>Sigh. The other time someone tried to teach me, ended up, he was stuck with temporal derangement and intense agony from tutoring me.<br><br>Â‘ItÂ’s okÂ… I have lots of patience. =) Anyway, I gtg liaoÂ… weÂ’ll meet at the Payah Lebar Starbucks tomorrow at 7.30 ok?Â’<br><br>There was hesitation and my fingers froze.<br><br>Â‘AlrightÂ…Â’ my fingers relented, Â‘ will message you againÂ…Â’<br><br>(To be continued...)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Chapter 5</strong></span><br><br>I was there early.<br><br>My emotions were racing all over my body, occasionally shot right into my head for a brain-freeze as I pondered over the thought of a Â‘hiddenÂ’ date like this. I was just thinking, could this be considered a date? After all, it was plannedÂ… it was discussedÂ… it was agreedÂ… it was a mutual meetingÂ… there was a locationÂ… there was something to do. So does that justify a date?<br><br>Maybe studying was just a faÃ§ade Â– this was probably an unofficial date to me.<br><br>I stared into my books and my eyes canÂ’t seem to read past the third sentence. Every time when I read till that point, my mind started to wander around and my concentration was broken like a thin thread. When I gathered myself again, I re-read the whole thingy again and the process repeated like a spell routine.<br><br>Â‘Come on dudeÂ… THIS IS A FRINGING STUDYING SESSION LAR. Never study with girls before meh?Â’<br><br>I had to wake myself up. Hello? This Â‘thoughtÂ’ sounded damn crazy lor. People are just being helpful to assist you in your lousy finance, please do not interpret anything else.<br><br>Having to indulge in my own mental realm long enough to see a familiar figure in a distance, I quickly took a quick peek at my watch Â– sheÂ’s on time. And being early isnÂ’t exactly very helpful to calm down my excited inner self. It was like sparkling juice; much awaiting and anticipation.<br><br>Snowy made her way to where I was sitting, gave a slight embarrassed smile before settling down. There was still no wordsÂ… yet.<br><br>Â‘ErmÂ… hi?Â’<br><br>I just felt that I had to initiate something to break the first silence.<br><br>Then she burst into a small laughter.<br><br>And for some reciprocation reasons, I burst into a small laughter as well.<br><br>Â‘Wah kao ehÂ… you mean awkwardness can also be humorous?Â’<br><br>Â‘You had your dinner yet?Â’ I asked.<br><br>Â‘Not yetÂ… what about you?Â’<br><br>Â‘ErmÂ… same.Â’ I replied with 0.4 seconds of hesitation. The truth was, I just ate McDonaldsÂ’ big Mac value meal AND drank one large Ice-blended Mocha, thinking that she would probably consume her own dinner and also to calm myself through my very own food therapy.<br><br>Â‘Shall we eat then?Â’<br><br>Â‘Woah, right on. I am getting famished,Â’ I replied such gusto that I felt it was a little over-doing it. I licked my lips a little, before rubbing my stomach. Hungry or completely full?<br><br>Â‘CloudÂ… you are a liar.Â’<br><br>This was the scene to our first meeting.<br><br>(To be continued...)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Chapter 6</strong></span><br><br>Â‘Ok, just refer to this table, equate this andÂ…Â’ said Snowy as she pinpointed and explained one particular finance question which I got a whooping zero marks. Snowy is just incredible and I really meant it. Everything seemed so easily comprehendible, under her gentle guidance and words. I find myself understand MORE than what my lectures and tutorials put together.<br><br>Something must be quite wrong somewhere.<br><br>Â‘So you understand?Â’<br><br>Â‘EhÂ… almost,Â’ I replied as my line of sight entered into the path of her gaze.<br><br>Seriously, I thought I saw her eyes smiling at me. Electrifying moments that caught me in a sudden.<br><br>Â‘Why? You donÂ’t understand anything?Â’<br><br>Hello? I think it was you who was looking at me that way; I just happened to look into your path of sight.<br><br>We burst into a short laughter.<br><br>Â‘Ok, I think you have enough for the day,Â’ remarked Snowy as she dump the stack of finance notes into her girly pink Roxy bag.<br><br>It was only then did I begin to study her, physically, in details. Apart from her cutesy appearance, something else caught my eyes; it was her thin wrist - there were layers of red markings, among several old scars, as though she has been badly wounded around that region recently before. The protective male instinct surged forth and immediately, I was overwhelmed by intense concerns.<br><br>Â‘This?Â’<br><br>Snowy raised her right hand and examined it causally. I noticed a tint of sorrow lingered in her eyes as she glanced over it. It seemed to speak of apathy, depression and a provoking past. There was an unusual flow of silence circulating around us as though her sweet voice had difficulty in saying something. I realized this wasnÂ’t difficulty Â– it was hesitation.<br><br>Â‘ItÂ… was the result of an attempted suicide.Â’<br><br>What? My world was stunned momentarily. What on Earth could have happened to constitute such behavior? Life is so precious! I canÂ’t never imagine how one would take life for granted, given that there are so many unfortunate souls who desired to live, but didnÂ’t had it as an option.<br><br>Snowy simply stared into blank space. I sensed a deep grievance in her.<br><br>Ah ha! I think I know what it was.<br><br>A relationship with a jerk ex-boyfriend.<br><br>At this current moment, I dared not question too much. She seemed very affected emotionally.<br><br>Â‘Snowy,Â’ I said, in a soft tone, Â‘you know why woman always think a lot and affects them longer? Because when a woman falls deep in her thoughts, she would take much longer to return back to Earth, compared a man - considering that woman are Venus denizen and man are Mars aliens; Mars is so much nearer to Earth.Â’<br><br>It caught her unexpectedly and Snowy giggled in amusement. Although I have succeeded in bringing her back to reality, gawd, that was SO lame!<br><br>Â‘Come on, itÂ’s getting late. LetÂ’s goÂ’<br><br>A good thing about an outing with her is that sending her home is going home! Hiak!<br><br>Â‘YesÂ… so I wonÂ’t feel guilty for you having to send me home. CloudÂ… you knowÂ…I definitely need someone to send me home oneÂ…Â’<br><br>Woah! High expectation? Noted!<br><br>Â‘ItÂ’s calledÂ… safety.Â’<br><br>(To be continued...)</div>
