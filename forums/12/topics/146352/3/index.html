            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Chapter 7</strong></span><br><br>It was holiday period; a time where all students rejoiced at the gift of abundant freedom and liberationÂ… except me, who was busy preparing for my finance supplementary paper next week. Everyday passed like a daily ritual, which comprised of a compulsory MSN chat with Snowy, somewhat half cyber-tutoring and half talking cork. Somehow, this has become an integrated part of my life. And if this sequence was to remove from me now, without her virtual presence, I feel weird.<br><br>Â‘Wah really mehÂ…? What is missing..?Â’<br><br>I donÂ’t know. Something just seemed to be missing; probably became a habit. Just like I used to have a bunch of good friends, who could really click well, but that was all in the past. We could talk about everything - girls, school, work or life, but they, well, were busy with their life now and could hardly spare the time for lengthy chat like this.<br><br>Â‘Â…oh dearÂ… thatÂ’s sadÂ…Â’<br><br>When a man got attached to a woman, their friends will eventually appear to be second-grade citizen, literally. The chilling out time would be reduced to near-nothing as all guys need to accompany their girlfriend. This fact always overruled - an inevitable part of life I guess.<br><br>Â‘Â…But when you have a girlfriend, you will definitely want to spend time with her whatÂ… wonÂ’t you?Â’<br><br>I willÂ…balance the equation. Even if it tears my mind into deciding how I should go about doing it - I will find a way. I donÂ’t know; to me, friendships are very special and shouldnÂ’t be degraded into second class citizen just because someone new entered into your life. But that doesnÂ’t mean I love my girlfriend any less; I sees it as an essential part of relationship adaptation.<br><br>Â‘CloudÂ… you are a good friendÂ… but what if your people leave you in a lurchÂ…?<br><br>That stumbled me.<br><br>I donÂ’t know.<br><br>Â‘Being accommodating doesnÂ’t always mean good you knowÂ… people will leave somehowÂ…Â’<br><br>WhatÂ’s with the negativity? Ok fine, nothing of that sort ever happened to me yet. I am still friends with my male buddies and when I needed them, they appeared from all corners of the world. Perhaps, being left in a lurch really sucks to the max.<br><br>There was no reply, as though the conversation came to a drastic end. I was thinking, maybe I should just begin a new topic and walked away from this serious stuff.<br><br>Â‘HeyÂ… shall we go out after my examination? I promise to treat you dinner, for all the valuable help so far.Â’<br><br>There was a reply after about a minute, as though she is considering my date proposal on the other side. I was beginning to lose the nervous self and I didnÂ’t even flinch when I type the words out. Darn! I am getting better at this.<br><br>Â‘OkÂ… =)Â’<br><br>Â‘I will let you know the details laterÂ…Â’<br><br>WOOHOO! My heart rejoiced in ecstatic happiness.<br><br>(To be continued...)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Chapter 8</strong></span><br><br>I was scribbling frantically, yet with glaring confidence.<br><br>I knew this paper was a complete walkover. These were the rare times when you know deep inside your heart that you could do all the questions with decent answers and mind you, I do not have the academic brains, so such phenomenon does not really happen to me very often.<br><br>I tucked my favorite pen into my shirt pocket cautiously, as if it would damage my shirt material. Then, I raised my right hand and alerted one lady invigilator to hand in my examination paper. I had all the time in the world, but anxious was constantly shrouding me Â– today is my official date with Snowy. I felt this immerse urge to leave as soon as possible, in preparation for my first date. I canÂ’t wait for everyone to finish as the entire bunch of people would pack the bus to its brim and I may be Â‘squeezedÂ’ out, waiting endlessly for my bus.<br><br>I was the first to finish and left the room feeling completely awesome. Made a quick sneak into the gents and styled my hair meticulously. Adjusted the collar, flatted the shirt and lowered my Levis jeans a little to give that Â‘baggyÂ’ feel. Every impression counts and I have to make sure it does or there may not be a second date.<br><br>Without wasting too much time, I hurried my feet to the bus stop.<br><br>We agreed to meet at Takashimaya as she needed to get some books from Kinokuniya. As it is probably the heart of Orchard, we could also decide where we want to have our dinner.<br><br>The bus-changed-MRT ride down to Takashimaya was pretty uneventful and before I knew it, I was thereÂ… waiting placidly at third level, eagle-eyeing onto level one Â– the location we agreed to meet. I have my reason for positioning myself at higher grounds; so that I could admire her beauty from afar momentarily before meeting her directly. AndÂ… that was definitely a better view to check out the other town babes strolling beneath me as well. Hiak!<br><br>As I was having my share of eye candy, something interesting caught my eyes - it was a petite girl, whose familiar back was facing me. One tall-freak, guy, was standing directly in front of her and acted as though he was seeking for her forgiveness-kind-of-melodramatic behavior, with the girl completely unmoved by it. Folded arms and tilted head, the lady displayed strong resisting body language. The scene attracted quite a few curious bystanders and from what he was doing, nothing seemed to be working.<br><br>Then, the girl made a complete turnabout; it was Snowy.<br><br>WHAT?<br><br>Snowy appeared to initiate a walk away, but her attempt was faltered as the man caught her left hand. Then, Snowy aggressively shook off his hand and ran. The man gave a short chase, before resigning to fate. He must have thought that somehow, it was futile even if he caught up with her. And then, more curious bystanders gathered, observing their tiff exchange.<br><br>Gawd! What was going on? I hoped she wonÂ’t tell me that the date is canceledÂ… NoooooOOooOooo!<br><br>Â‘Who is this guy? What does he wants? Why did she ran away?Â’<br><br>I could see doubts and confusion ballooning from my befuddled mind. I hastily check my watch, it was at least forty-five minutes prior before our date. So that means I have a fighting chance to see whether my date would continue.<br><br>My mobile phone beeped.<br><br>Â‘Sorry, will be late. Mind if I meet you one hour later?Â’<br><br>(To be continued...)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Chapter 9</strong></span><br><br>This has probably to be the longest hour I ever waited for someone. Nothing to do with the length of time - more like the theory of relativity. I kept thinking about the best course of action to undertake; whether to tell her frankly I saw what happened just now and to question her whyÂ… or to pretend that I am ignorant and to act like one?<br><br>I felt a small tap on my shoulder. I lifted my head to see who it was - it was Snowy. I could understand why she needed an additional hour before the meet-up; her eyes were puffy and appeared like she had just cried. She probably made used of the time to mask her act of crying. Although the redness in her eye had subsided, it was quite blatantly obvious that tears have fallen.<br><br>Â‘WhyÂ… you looked so drained? Something happened?Â’<br><br>Â‘Oh nothingÂ… I am just tired. You knowÂ… itÂ’s the woman thingÂ…Â’<br><br>Oh man, this has to be the best excuse ever. I swore that if I did not have knowledge of what took place just now, I would have believed her reason completely. The best cover-up tale ever!<br><br>Â‘Have you bought your books then?Â’<br><br>Â‘YeahÂ… got itÂ… shall we eat something? CloudÂ… you decideÂ… I am fine with anything.Â’<br><br>We arrived at Wheelock Place, Big O, in no time. Throughout the journey there, I felt that Snowy was trying very hard to be normal and cheerfulÂ… so much trying that it appeared unnatural. Maybe, I am just hyper-sensitive, but there are times when you communicate to someone and you could see their mind and soul isnÂ’t here physically.<br><br>A good thing was, our causal conversation didnÂ’t cease Â– it just kept pouring in and just kept getting more interesting with every passing minute. Our meals came and as we dined our food, I could see her spirit gradually returning back to Earth. Snowy seemed more lifted up emotionallyÂ… the real Snowy I know since day one. We were like frozen in timeÂ… chilling out in our own world.<br><br>Â‘CloudÂ… I am so glad that you are so confident about your supplementary paper. I know that you would passÂ…Â’<br><br>Love is miraculous. It instilled an innate strength and belief to weak humans, so that we could hold a fighting spirt to combat what lifeÂ’s nemesis has in store for us. Challenges never stop and kept swarming in as we struggled to keep these adversaries at bay. A simple remark from her is like Love brandishing me with the weapons, enabling me to succeed in my attempt to strive forward.<br><br>I never discover how much untapped potential I have; Snowy unlocked the chamber to myself. I was a procrastinator, a lazy bum, a happy-go-lucky fellow, but all will change, when you realize some people care about your well-being and future and you never want disappoint these people.<br><br>The duration of the meal was short; Snowy mentioned that she needed to go back early today. I respected her decision, call for the bills and paid everything.<br><br>Â‘HereÂ’s my shareÂ…Â’<br><br>Â‘Come on, guys should pay for their first dateÂ… itÂ’s ok. Treat me another dayÂ…Â’<br><br>It was heartening to know about her intention to go Dutch, but the masculine ego in me refused to relent. After all, she had an extremely bad day today and the least I could do is to treat her to some good food.<br><br>When we reached the bus stop, the bus came almost instantaneously. We hopped on and picked the end seats.<br><br>Then, Snowy reached into her bag, took out her I-pod and stuff one ear-piece into my right ear. Twitching her I-pod a little, she stopped at a song titled Â‘Tong Hua.Â’ I was expecting this song to be sung by Guang Liang, but it was a same name, different thing.<br><br>Â‘I found this song by chanceÂ… send to me by a friendÂ… and this is an original compositionÂ… nice horÂ…Â’<br><br>I nodded my head in response.<br><br>The journey was magically quiet, reveling in the essence of a soothing song. Both of us were just enjoying the music and comfortable silence that saturate around us. From where we were, there were three groups of people. One couple, as though reverting back to their early childhood, playing like untainted childrenÂ… tickling one another; One lance corporal NSF, silently messaging with his phone, probably to his girlfriend; one middle-age woman, staring outside the window, probably thinking about her kids at home. The beautiful song running in the backgroundÂ… the bus sceneÂ… and my Love beside meÂ… this was the most amazing thing.<br><br>Love is all aroundÂ… kept in our hearts and blossomed from within.<br><br>We reached home soon enough - back into the memorable lift where we always met but yet to know one another.<br><br>Â‘CloudÂ… I wonÂ’t be on MSN so often from today onwardsÂ… I would be very busy doing some holiday projects.Â’<br><br>I felt a hairline crack in my Â‘beautiful momentsÂ’. It was too sudden I guess.<br><br>Snowy reached over and hugged me, then, she whispered into my ears.<br><br>Â‘Thanks for everything today and before. Really enjoyed your company so far.Â’<br><br>The hateful lift door opened; Snowy disappeared as she walked out and brought me back to realityÂ… abruptly ending my Â‘beautiful momentsÂ’.<br><br>The best part? I didnÂ’t even say a thing.<br><br>(To be continued...)</div>
