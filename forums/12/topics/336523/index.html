              <p>I think he's just insecure.. I assume your relationship with him is not that long? Less than a year? And yeah Seoti is right, he just wanna remain friends with you.. But I don't think his love for you is that deep. Perhaps its just affection. Love is really really selfish by right. I don't think I can take it if my partner hooks up with another if I really really love her.</p>
              <p>Don't dwell on it. Be happy with your current =)</p>

              <p>He is just being coward to keep you by his side. If he stil love you, why break up. This guy can never bring u any secure because it will make you feel like "When will be break up again" ," SHIt, this  guy like me, should I tell him? Will he give up on me for him?" . This feeling is so irriting, feeling so insecure. And security is one of the most impt thing in the relationship.</p>

              <p>Well, I broke up with my ex abt 3 months back. It was terrible, esp after knowing that she was probably seeing another guy behind my back. She's currently attached but I still contact her occassionally after the depression stage is over. Unlike what other posters mentioned, I merely wanted to keep her as a friend because the 3 year relationship means a lot to me.</p>
              <p>I no longer have hopes that she'd return to me, nor can I openly say I've forgiven her for the hurt she'd caused. However, I could not bring myself to hate her as well.</p>

              <p>two mths is quite recent... so it's natural tt u will still be thinking abt it... after all u were tog for almost two years... (not a long time, but not a short time either) i believe he just wants to be friends and still keep his options open... he's confirmed tt he doesn't want to be wif u, yet he still wants u to know tt u're in his heart... hmm he's not being nice here, he's being a bit selfish... even tho he knows tt u've moved on, he still wants to keep u "bonded" to him... i'd suggest u leave it as tt, dun read too much into it or it might affect ur current relationship...</p>
              <p>i'm saying this fr only my personal experience but maybe it's not the same for ur ex... i tried to remain friends with my ex who says he doesn't want to be wif me, and is glad i'm moving on. but he would call up for dinner on days when he knows i have dates with another guy... it made me confused for a long time... i cldn't let go of the rs and move on... when i finally asked if he still wanted to be tog with me...he said no, he really jus wants to be friends... i've recently cut off contact wif him completely cos i tink hanging on like tt will make it hard for both parties to move on.</p>
              <p>hope this can help u have a better idea of what's going on. if u really have feelings for ur new guy and are not on the rebound, do treasure what u have now... if ur ex had loved u enough, he wld not have let u go in the first place... u must remember tt...</p>

              <p>it's different from saying i want us to stay in contact because of the memories and connection we once had as compared to saying, i'm glad you found a better someone but i still love you even though we can't be together. the latter is damn selfish</p>

              <p>Well, I broke up with my ex abt 3 months back. It was terrible, esp after knowing that she was probably seeing another guy behind my back. She's currently attached but I still contact her occassionally after the depression stage is over. Unlike what other posters mentioned, I merely wanted to keep her as a friend because the 3 year relationship means a lot to me.</p>

              <p>So that is the different between u and TS ex bf. And in her case, she might not want to even be friend with him. Anyway.. don't be a jerk to always think of yrself. Think for others too...</p>

              <p>u know if u keep giving in to those thoughts of hope, this can drag on for years even.. and it's very draining to your spirit... although i don't believe in that phrase - that if he love you enough he won't let you go in the first place, i think it's a good phrase to begin with for you</p>

              <p>actually asharae, ur ex has hurt u in the past by ending the rs cos of a third party... u mentioned smth abt depression in ur post. will u be hurting urself by keeping in touch with her? does the sight of her wif her new bf still brings back bad memories of the hurt she caused? if yes, then i tink u're better off not contacting her anymore.</p>
              <p>it's one thing to treasure the memories.. but the past is the past. does she feel the same way as u? does the past mean anything to her? maybe u can learn fr what she's doing and try to move on wif ur life. find a new gf. and only contact her when u've really moved on and forgiven her...</p>

              <p> There is a possibility, of cos. But shall we realistically look at the situtation.</p>
              <p>There is a also a possibility of striking the $1million toto. So are u going to keep the option striking $1million toto as yr most possible chances??  Or are u going to rely more on a career path building up  to yr $1million dollar mark?</p>

              <p>i was the one who broke up with him but regretted it. it was on my another post "when he says he needed more time"..</p>
              <p>anyway, i am not hoping for us to be together anymore. i just want this to just go all away. so i can forget. when i totally am able to forget then the hurting will stop. but how am i supposed to do that when im in the process of forgetting, he will suddenly remind me that he is still there. it puzzles me cosh he always do this.</p>
              <p>he kept saying, he is not gd enough for me. that i better find someone better than him but still, he loves me. and its hard not to think of me.</p>
