              <p>maybe he is doing it precisely cos he knows it will affect u. dun let it get it to u... i'm guessing tt u either broke up mutually or he was the one who ended things. i agree tt it can drag on for a long time and is tiring... u felt better when u didn't hear fr him right? if he wants closure, then just reply him, thanks for ur good wishes. be nice but dun let his words mess wif ur thoughts. it's not fair to ur current bf tt u continue to dwell on this...</p>
              <p>since u're now in an rs, it's best for u tt u work on ur current bf. tink abt how he makes u happy, and how ur ex has made u unhappy in the past. there's a reason why a rs ended. u may still have some feelings for ur ex.. but it's better not to be in denial.. he has already said tt he can't give u what u want... what do u tink it means? do both of have v diff life goals? v diff personalities? even if u do get back tog, there's a high chance tt it won't be a happy ending.</p>

              <p>but u must ask urself honestly... is tt really what u want? if u don't want to help urself get over him, then our suggestions also won't help much. :(</p>

              <p><br>He doesn't want you to move on first before he does. And he's probably jealous and feeling angry that the world is unfair to him since you're the person who really doesn't deserves to find happiness in another relationship faster than him.</p>
              <p>Tell him you would love to continue to see him and talk and smile with him, but TOO BAD HE IS ALREADY AN EX!!!</p>
              <p>And let him know that EX will NEVER have anymore chance with you, unless he want to be your EX-EX. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">i definitely still love him. but do i still want to be with him?? sometimes yes, sometimes no. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">sometimes, i think its worth fighting for. but then, i find dat its too tiring and tasking for me now... its been so long. y now?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">there are some points taken that i got in some advices. yeah, i find him rather selfish. he still loves me but cant give me as much as i wanted to?? erm... not to me, but he can give as much to other gerls? is that wad he is trying to say? </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">its a good thing that i think negatively. it would be easier to make a choice. </span></p>
