If you do, definately you would give her the freedom to do so.<br><br>She thinks you need to be more mature? Maybe its time for you to do some reflection and ask yourself what prompt her to think that way.<br><br>Do what you think is in the best interest for you and her. If you think it can erase the pain, go ahead. If she refuses to accept it, tell her why. She as a Christian should be able to understand that at the moment, both of you need to clear this relationship (between you 2) off the mind in order to focus on other things. (For her, being a faithful Christian. For you, to recover from this heartbreak.)</div>

She spends so much time with him, showers him with love, gives him small presents and attention and what she receives in the end is "I think we aren't compatible with each other.
