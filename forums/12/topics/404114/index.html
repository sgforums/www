              <p>Hi people, i need some mature advice from forum's guys and gals.
              As i am feeling very vex and confuse right now and don't really
              know how to handle it.</p>
              <p>There is this guy in my office, who has just join us a month
              ago. And we actually hit it off quite well, He will actually made
              attempt to tell me his lifestyle, past relationship and when we
              went out he would take care of me "buy food / drinks etc.. for
              me.</p>
              <p>recently over the sms during the chat unwittly, he asked if i
              like him ? But the 2nd sentences was " Better not, i will avoid you
              if you do"  i asked why did he ask that ? he said it was human
              instincts.  </p>
              <p>when i press further how he felt for me " his responds was " you
              are comfortable to be with, but to get together and be together is
              different. And we are not suitable."</p>
              <p>So i told him, i have interest initially but then lied to him
              that after knowing him i dnt coz of his lifestyle doesn't fit into
              mine.<br> (i said that because he say if i confess he will avoid me)
              humh...</p>
              <p>now after few weeks, things get into confusing stage.</p>
              <p>We have been exchanging sms these few weeks during the nite, he
              also will unwittly tell me where he is or reaches home late. i am
              puzzle by his respond. He is interested in me or not ? 
              Arrhh...</p>
              <p>Last night he told me he is looking for companion and marriage
              to talk about that later..<br> (the statement was a general statement, and i am not sure if its
              meant for me ?)</p>
              <p>I doesn't want to go into a companion mode with him not knowing
              if it will lead me to no where ?  Or should i go into
              companion mode with him, and develope relationship from there
              ?  he keep telling me he is free during weekend, and with the
              workload and OT quite difficult for him to find GF and maint one
              relationship..<br> Arrhh.. i am confuse.. Help me pls..</p>

              <p><strong>Farnee - This man is playing with you and your brains.</strong></p>
              <p><strong> <br>He is saying things to you to program your subconscious. <br></strong></p>
              <p><strong>He suddenly ask do you like him ? will force you suddenly analyse your feeling for him - which already yes, after all the effort he have put in. <br> </strong></p>
              <p><strong>" Better not, i will avoid you if you do" "we are not suitable" - is to get your mind thinking of thousand and one reason why not ? Also a little danger excitment to simulate your mind to get it hook. After your subconscious run through 10 possible reasons against it, you actually program your brain - that he and you is totally possible.</strong></p>
              <p><strong> </strong></p>
              <p><strong>He will be super nice, caring and close to you, will give you all the non-verbal signs that he is interested in you and will drop certain statement here and there - all these are to program your mind. Notice that sequence of statements, it have slowly change from "I am not suitable for you" to "looking for companion and marriage", well you are at the edge of the trap now.</strong></p>
              <p><strong> </strong></p>
              <p><strong>Time to wake up !!!. Ask yourself if a man really love you, why is he not openly to it, why playing all these games. </strong></p>

              <p>love is not an "On" and "Off" button or YES or NO thing. It take time to build up.</p>
              <p>So just respond accordingly, go out for a date and eventually see how things goes. If the feeling is right then go for it. If the feeling is wrong then nevermind.</p>
              <p>On one part the guy is running by emotion as guy is attracted to girls and on the other part the logical part of the brain run in parallel to tell him to think logically. Hence you will be expecting confusing statements time to time </p>

              <p>I will say give yourself more time to understand him if you really want a serious relationship. Understand more about his character first and find out his views on relationship and understand what type of guy he is. And does all of that suit you.</p>

              <p>Hi people, i need some mature advice from forum's guys and gals. As i am feeling very vex and confuse right now and don't really know how to handle it.</p>
              <p>There is this guy in my office, who has just join us a month ago. And we actually hit it off quite well, He will actually made attempt to tell me his lifestyle, past relationship and when we went out he would take care of me "buy food / drinks etc.. for me.</p>
              <p>recently over the sms during the chat unwittly, he asked if i like him ? But the 2nd sentences was " Better not, i will avoid you if you do"  i asked why did he ask that ? he said it was human instincts.  </p>
              <p>when i press further how he felt for me " his responds was " you are comfortable to be with, but to get together and be together is different. And we are not suitable."</p>
              <p>So i told him, i have interest initially but then lied to him that after knowing him i dnt coz of his lifestyle doesn't fit into mine.<br>(i said that because he say if i confess he will avoid me) humh...</p>
              <p>now after few weeks, things get into confusing stage.</p>
              <p>We have been exchanging sms these few weeks during the nite, he also will unwittly tell me where he is or reaches home late. i am puzzle by his respond. He is interested in me or not ?  Arrhh...</p>
              <p>Last night he told me he is looking for companion and marriage to talk about that later..<br>(the statement was a general statement, and i am not sure if its meant for me ?)</p>
              <p>I doesn't want to go into a companion mode with him not knowing if it will lead me to no where ?  Or should i go into companion mode with him, and develope relationship from there ?  he keep telling me he is free during weekend, and with the workload and OT quite difficult for him to find GF and maint one relationship..<br>Arrhh.. i am confuse.. Help me pls..</p>

              <p><br>Easy, change your focus completely to another guy friend and start to go for lunch with that new guy friend.</p>
              <p>Then have fun seeing how your "cool" guy crumbles...</p>
              <p>If you suspects he isn't true to you, then you are probably right.</p>
              <p>Guys who are true to you, will always remain true to you and not go to shoutbox and talk nonsense about you when they think you're not logged on. (example)</p>
              <p>So many guys out there, so don't be afraid to strike them out if they failed to catch one ball.</p>
