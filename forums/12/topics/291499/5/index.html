              <p>Hello to everybody. We have decided to get married on 2008 Feburary 14th.<br><br>We would not have an extravagant wedding and will get small one held at YMCA hotel with just a few tables for close friends and families. I have a saving of 20K and she has around 10 k more then me. We plan to spend about 15K on the wedding, but really depends on the hotel. She wanted to do it at other places, but i would not want her to miss out on what every woman deserves.<br><br>The rest of the money would be used for our house downpayment's, and hopefully we would be able to convince the owner of her rented apartment to sell it to us, as it is a beautiful place with great memories.<br><br>I would be graduating in 2 years time, and meanwhile, i would still be working full time and studying part time and she would still get on with her career.<br><br>We figured that financially, it would hopefully not be a problem. At the most, i take on more jobs during free time.<br><br>Now, its just about convincing both parents, and friends.<br><br>Thanks everybody here, the advices and questions you guys posted helped alot, and yes, we would definitely be smiling as we walk down the aisle.</p>

              <p>I know a poor chinese bloke many years back had an Indian gf. He wanted to marry her and buy a 4 room HDB estate and buy a Honda Civic. He didn't really have the absolute acceptance from his in laws initially. But being a very dynamic person, he proved his worth. They now have a son and runs his own business. By the way, he drives a Lamborghini and stays in a bungalow now. His wife also runs a retail chain. They went on TV sometime back to talk about his success in his business.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And naturally, his in-laws were convinced their daughter didn't choosed the wrong guy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is all about the content of the man that matters most. Racial discrimination, age, appearance are merely fleeting images that will fade with time.</p>

              wow o.O I'm so impressed! I haven't logged in for a while and am glad that I did to see this post.
              
              I agree with someone out there saying age is not a guarantee of maturity. I have met older guys who were far more immature than younger guys, and they still don't seem to get it I guess till today.
              
              Congrats to TS for registering their marriage.
              
              It's always so heart-warming to know that there're such brave people around. 
              
              It's a beautiful story.
