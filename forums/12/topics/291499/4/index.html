We have decided to get married on 2008 Feburary 14th.<br><br>We would not have an extravagant wedding and will get small one held at YMCA hotel with just a few tables for close friends and families. I have a saving of 20K and she has around 10 k more then me. We plan to spend about 15K on the wedding, but really depends on the hotel. She wanted to do it at other places, but i would not want her to miss out on what every woman deserves.<br><br>The rest of the money would be used for our house downpayment's, and hopefully we would be able to convince the owner of her rented apartment to sell it to us, as it is a beautiful place with great memories.<br><br>I would be graduating in 2 years time, and meanwhile, i would still be working full time and studying part time and she would still get on with her career.<br><br>We figured that financially, it would hopefully not be a problem. At the most, i take on more jobs during free time.<br><br>Now, its just about convincing both parents, and friends.<br><br>Thanks everybody here, the advices and questions you guys posted helped alot, and yes, we would definitely be smiling as we walk down the aisle.</div></blockquote>yoz how's your wedding preparation going?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Congrats for going ahead with the wedding despite the mountains of obstacles...my advice is to write down all the agonies ,frustrations and objections so that when your marriage encounters any problems along the way...such writings can prove to be motivating force to let U appreciate each other more and reinforce the relatiponship further.<br><br>for the wedding,be a true gentleman invite all those who strongly objects other than than your parents and in-laws..even friends nd distant relatives who frown upon your marriage should be invited too...<br><br>Best Wishes and a Happy,Lasting Realationship <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>
