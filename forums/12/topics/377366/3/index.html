              <p>TS -</p>
              <p> If one listens to sth/anything which is 'true' there is no question of disagreeing. If it is 'untrue', naturally one disagrees with it. But as to whether one's agreeing/disagreeing:<strong> <em>is it coming </em>from the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the prejudiced mind</span> <strong>OR</strong> from the the <strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">unprejudiced heart?</span></em>. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Listening is of the heart, and hearing is of the mind, </strong></span>the latter is superficial. And cos the heart has ' immeasurable depth', any word that enters one first has to encounter the mind. The mind thinks -<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> 'many' </span>to deal/<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">rationalize </span></strong>with 'what IS' even before it reaches the heart. Hence one is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">conflicted within</span>. One simply deludes oneself that one is being wise.</strong></strong></p>
              <p>
              </p><p>
              </p><p>Muse over this</p>
              <em>A man is at the bar n another man walks up to him n asks him, "Are you Ernie Smith?" <br>The man says, 'yes"<br>The man then says, 'Were you in Boston a few days ago?' <br>Ernie says, "Just a min," n from his bag takes out a notebook, turns some pages, and then says, "Yes, I was a few days ago." <br>The man says, "Were you in rm 5?" <br>Ernie looks into his notebook n says, "Yes." <br>The man says, "Did you meet Mrs.Dorothy in rm 6?" <br>Ernie scans his eyes on his notebook n replies, "Yes." <br>The man says, "Tell me, did you make love to Mrs Dorothy?" <br>Ernie looks into notebook again, says, "Yes, I made love to Mrs. Dorothy." <br>The man says, "Well, I'm Dorothy's spouse n I don't like it." <br>Again, Etrnie looks in his notebook and utters, "You know, that's funny. I didn't like it either."</em><p></p>
              <p></p>
              <p>This is what <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">hearing is all</span></strong> about. One agrees perfectly, but one <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">hears only what one wants to hear</span></strong>; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">one <strong>understands only </strong></span>what one<strong> </strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">wants to understand. </span>The mind (ego) has clouded and eclipsed the heart that reflects what is! The mind is a mechanism - to be used and put aside (eg at work, tasks,business or what-have-u); the heart is a 'presence' - n <span style="text-decoration: underline;">always present to what IS</span>!<br>Sadly, this is the predicament of everyday situations n ... knowing understanding, accepting n hopefully <span style="text-decoration: underline;">being cognizant</span> would go a long way transcending one's fractious mind.</p>
              <p>PS - mind 'games' work for a while, what is repressed will surface.</p>

              <p>Dude, read through properly ya ? He already made full disclosure about his status.</p>
              <p>The fact that she still agrees to go out with him, makes his ego bloats like a puffer fish.</p>
              <p>Mid life crisis I should say.</p>
              <p>Who'd think a young pretty girl would date a married mid 30s man with 2 children ? Hohoho.. he must think he struck lottery or sumthin.</p>
              <p>But nothing ain't free my friend. There's always a price to pay after the happy hours.</p>
              <p>He ain't the first guy to bite the dust. And we all seen it happen so many times.</p>

              <p>Dear all, i really appreciate all your comments/feedback/suggestions on my issue. I thanked you for the articles that your guys/girls have attached too. I still love my wife. In fact, she's just sleeping right beside me as i write this. My wife and i had been together since 19 y.o. (married for &gt;10 years)</p>
              <p>I would not blame the girl either as it was not her who suggested going out in the first place. It was me. She just said yes all the time. She is not aggressively after me either.</p>
              <p>I believe its more towards feeling in a way that i have not felt for so long. The thrill of the chase, the excitement, going out together, being anxious, thinking about her, may be. Actually i have not actually thought of what i really want from her. May be say Yes to me. </p>
              <p>I was also rationalizing that we are just going out as special friends and eventually she may not want me and leave.</p>
              <p>In terms of putting her in my company, i did that as i feel its not so proper to be going out with her and if she part time at my place, i can see her and go out on most days, without fixing up dates.</p>

              <p>One who seeks fulfilment outside of one's relationship/marriage is simply finding excuses (rationalizations) outside of him/her to be/do. The truth is this person is trapped and the security that one had all along beleived and subscribed to is an albatross around one's neck. It is a cage that no longer is freeing.</p>
              <p>In this instance here, there is no one to relate to - the house is a 'thing', the wife is a 'thing', the children are all things. Relationship is a thing. Hence, the dearth of love and the death of love.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Relating is qualitative</span>; relationship (all) is quantitative. The former relates to what is, a presence and being present.</p>
              <p>The latter relates to what was or what can be. There is no presence or being present to what is.</p>
              <p>Ts is feeling the 'high' now lar. he is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">relating</span> but without even knowing that lar. This gal is an uncertainty. His wife , his .. all certain. Of course, it is not out of love, no' it is out of fear = fear-based love, ego-based needs/expectations masquerading as love.</p>
              <p>PS - there is no love in a marriage, no love in a relationship, only love in one who can first and foremost <span style="text-decoration: underline;">relate</span> to oneself and share that love. Otherwise, it is simply 'trading' for security' for other needs. Being honest about it may help otherwise the same drama the same pain, the same misery.</p>

              <p>He can decide to end it all n stay in the marriage and be faitful loyal, or stay out of duty but what is inherently latent within him - <strong>if not</strong> reconciled/integrated is something that would surface.</p>

              <p>ã€€A loving person who is self-fulfilled - shares his/her love (kindness, appreciation, gratitude,) with others around him - and yet intuitively does not n never cause destruction to oneself or another (married or unmarried makes no difference) - cos real love does not hurt - it is the agenda, motives. parading/masquerading as love. When it is not met - the pain, the misery. why? cos one purports to have it or misintrepreted as having .. - the reality one is a closet beggar! One is actually seeking out another to fulfil what one lacks or falsely interprets as having!</p>
              <p>Two persons in a marriage/relationship <strong>lacking in</strong> self-love are bound to exploit each other till one succumbs or one escapes (or wants to escape). Love can be shared, appreciated but cannot be possessed!  Also, when the needs/expectaions are met (eg, having a house, having children, having a ...) - there is nothing else - all is finished, the full stop has come. Why? cos the other was a means to one's end. When the end is realized - the other is no longer of importance - in other words, one or another was 'used', 'put aside', 'used' and now .....</p>
              <p>PS : The <span style="text-decoration: underline;">biggest betrayal </span>is to pretend to ... to conform when the heart feels otherwise - of course, it is a risk. The dualism of mind and the non-dual heart has to be integrated. Whatever it is,<strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the responsibililty for what one is being now or is going to be is always sth one has to accept. If what others are is an excuse for one's bheaviour - it is mind games and deluding oneself.</span></strong>
              </p><p>Lest its misconstrued - my meaning of love is not to be confused with licentiousness.</p>
              <p>TS - I <strong>surmise</strong> : Your desire to 'own' this gal is symptomatic of what is lacking IN u - it is for u to know or ignore. There is no 'wrong' nor is there 'rite' Life is just the way it is - <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>acceptance frees, resistance binds.</em></span></p>

              <p>I think the temptation of excitment and beauty is difficult to resist but maybe you have to take into consideration two things- your two children as well as the commitment you made as a husband and the man of thehousehold.</p>
              <p>Really its like you got to be more practical and stuff, a family can give you a long term stability and the support kind of thing but the other woman won't be able to give you all these.</p>
              <p>Putting her in your company is like really not a very good idea, perhaps it would be good if you could reconsider this.</p>
              <p>Also its like, you've got to have self-control. Think of your history with your wife and how far you have come with her and the family you two built.</p>
