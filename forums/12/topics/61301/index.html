My first try @ O level - I got a D7 but I tried very hard ( just a matter of practice) - got a  A2 following year O level. I proceed to JC &amp; did A maths - &amp; got a B3 . I knew a lot of Pp out there have the same story as mine ( from a fail grade to A grade just thru simple practice - just finish the Ten yrs series &amp; know the answers to the Qs - you shld be fine) .<br><br>If you choose to avoid it you'll face the same problem as I faced later @ Uni level. I was invited to take a Honours  yr due to my good grades in Economic subjects but later my professor realised that I didn't do the required maths economic subjects so did not qualify for it. I are very passionate about doing economic &amp; inspire to be a economic analyst then. But, I am afraid to takes these maths econ. subjects so avoid them totally until I realised that they are still required when you need them most to fulfil your utilmate dream. ( I also avod so tt I don't hv to pay extra $ for my OS Australia Uni. cse - one subject cost a few $k) can't afford to take &amp; re-take too costly.<br><br>So if you have so many PP telling you at such early stage in your life - why not take up the courage &amp; face it . Don't be like me regret so late when I almost complete my uni, cse.<br><br>Finally, if you cld afford get a private maths tutor. If you can't find one let me know - I can help if you really need one . PM me @ rickw@pmail.ntu.edu.sg<br><br>from a maths dummies.<br><br>Take Care !!<br><br>So<br><br></div>

When I couldn't make it through, I felt quite in despair as I just have to choose a course in Polytechnic... Since then my life has started its 2nd phase of CHANGE... People around me started to change ONCE AGAIN.... Anyway, though unwilling I just picked up something... Poly life really isn't as bad as I think... The course was ok too... After that, didn't managed to further study nor get the job I wanted... But still... I guess life isn't really that 'bad' with this current job... Cannot imagine with I just ended up with NOTHING... Won't know where I would be standing now...</div>

Not exactly the kinda job I'm looking forward into... I'm more into research and development... But I don't have the qualifications and I understand that those kinda jobs are usually more 'competitive' and in a sense unstable nowadays... I RESPECT Science. I would love competition in research in a positive sense... But in reality it's usually NEGATIVE. To get to where they want, people usually backstabs each other and do many despicable things... I think it's an INSULT in the SPIRIT of SCIENCE. The very spirit which brought MOST of the humans to where we are today.. TECHNOLOGIES and fighting of DISASTER and DISEASES...<br><br>I've been thinking quite ALOT for the past few years... As a human... As a Devil... Reluctant to do anything... But TODAY, I think I finally RECOGNISE what I want. It's gonna be a TOUGH JOB probably... But somebody's gonna do it?<br><br>UGLYNESS... HUMANS... DEVILS....</div>
