I wonder when you say succumbing to temptations dat means you R in love with the other person or jus in love with the affection and love the person gives? if you find someone who can fill the so called void. then leave the other? its unfair to both, when u R enjoying urself while the 2 shower their care n concern... you deprive them of devoting their attn and time to those who give them the full love and attn (not divided ones)...<br><br>sometimes i find it kind of difficult to differentiate btwn liking the person and liking the attn and care given by that person... and when the other party ever finds out that their partner 2 timed i think its difficult to ever regain the trust again... at least for me its no more trust. and since r/s R based on trust, i doubt the r/s would last... cos when there's once, there'll always b the 2nd time, the 3rd time etc., u'll b scared.<br><br>i wonder how many of you ppl here will give the other party another chance?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi again,<br><br>By succumbing to temptation, I was referring to the temptation to have another, whatever the reason may be.  It could be love, sex, attraction due to gestures of affection, boredom/monotony (need to look for a new 'toy'), or money.  Or a combination of the above.<br><br>As you said, its unfair to both.....but it does happen.  And often, the one outside (the 3rd party) will know that he/she is being two-timed too...but doesn't mind.<br><br>Nowadays, there are also cases where all three parties know, but doesn't mind....especially in the case of swingers.  This is a case of two-timing purely due to sex.  In anticipation of your possible next comment that love and sex should be associated with each other.....I will say that many people can separate love and lust.<br><br>Rest assured that you're not the only one who is confused about love and gestures of affection - I'm a guy and I'm just as confused! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Its hard to sit down behind my PC and say whether I'll forgive or not.  But I suspect that it will depend on each case.....and the severity of it.  It will depend on who and why.  Maybe I will not only forgive, but will improve myself?  I know some cases where people have two-timed, but later become very faithful (ie. temporary distractions).<br><br>PS:  I suspect that a barrage of replies may come in after this post, with wannabe angels preaching about morality, etc. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br></div>

I was struggling to believe everything he said to me and crying (when I was alone) because I was questioning everything about him.  Building trust back into our relationship was difficult but we managed to work things out together.<br><br>Breaking up, I feel, is much easier to deal with. Trusting someone who's lied to you or cheated on you is a whole different matter. If both parties aren't willing to seriously work things out, I wouldn't dare hint at giving the other party another chance even though I've gone through it myself.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Guess one thing that we would have to realise that no one likes to cheat, or rather most people will not like to cheat. It depends very much on the openness of a relationship.<br><br>Did u get into a relationship to bound a person, and keep him within a boundary?<br><br>Did u get into a relationship becoz u love him, and would want him to be happy, or do u just want to possess the person, and the person thoughts and keep them within a boundary that u think is acceptable?<br><br>When a relationship is not strong or open in the first place, there will be a lot of restrictions and tapes, which is the cause of a lot of argument and clashes.<br><br>Being human, we are highly adaptable, and to prevent the crashes in such instances, we will tend to hide things which our partners do not like to know. and we will tend to talk about those things with people that are open to such things which we are talking about. Slowly it will b a bonding.<br><br>Hence in a relationship, it's important that both are open and are able to accept and talk things out. It's important about the boundary that the two person has, and it's also important that things are communicated, so that both can learn and grow together.</div>

However there's another type of guy who just hope for trills or rather short term fun, where they will still return to their gf after getting sick or rather trill is no longer a trill to them.<br><br>Well, if u are really in a r/s, u shld'nt be thinking of anyone else as her or him, the one whom u luv, unless u already feel tired &amp; the luv to the person must becoming watery. Yes, try to be as committed &amp; faithfully as u can, nothing shld be taken for granted. It's just a sequence of time that every r/s is still developing over the time.</div>
