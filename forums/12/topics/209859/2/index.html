This is something that I'm still working hard on.   [/b]</blockquote>But as time goes on i still think of her sometimes , i have lots of friends who help me to forget her. When i thought that everything was over, i dreamt of her again , i wonder why god would wan to punish me like that jus because of a foolish mistake i make that makes her leave me . I tried to get her back such as leaving a message outside her house with the fear of her parents knowing it . She saw the message but she never say anything . Even though i am only a teen i could know what i really want , I dun mind giving up everything for her. Some of the forumites might think that i am naive , but i am sure without her my life will be colourless , i miss the days where we are walking down the lane behind ur house , hand in hand<br><br>Diana I love you enternally , i swear it</div>
