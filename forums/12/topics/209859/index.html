Many people just take love for granted but its just there.<br>No effort put in, just a simple excuse and their off.<br><br>Many people are searching for the right one.<br>but the truth be told,<br><br>Anyone can be the right one.<br>Its just how you treasure him/her.<br><br>Here's one question for you people,<br>IF you really treasured him/her, and in the end she leaves you.<br>Will you blame yourself ? or will you feel dishearten and never to love again ?<br><br>never feel dishearten, Knowing you've give all you've got in a relationship leaves you room for little regrets.<br>But ladies if its about sex and stuff on it, its more on if you wanna save it for your husband, or just any other guy ?<br><br>But we cannot say that a relationship can survive with or without sexual activites. Some people can, while others can't.<br><br>Nope this aren't and shakespear romeo and juilet. but lets just say this for me that is, Falling in love isn't just for a reason or 2, but its about caring and making both parties happy with a little compromise and understanding, of course with some time with each other making sure each other knows the way each other feels.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Falling out of Love</strong></span><br><br>Somethings many people dread.<br>Reasons wise, there are many too,<br>but people will just give a shake and just say its bullshit.<br>never the last falling out of love sometimes it painful.<br><br>But you can never forget, the pain.<br>memories will always stay within your mind so are you going to look at it as a painful reminder or something as a past you must learn from ?<br><br>Many people told me, why they fall out of love.<br>Few reasons :<br>He/She doesn't love me anymore<br>I don like the way she's/he's doing things*<br>He/She is not my type<br>I don't think I love him/her anymore.<br><br>* use your imagination people =)<br><br>Some reasons are always crappy,<br>but lets face it people.<br><br>When you fall out of love, someone always hurts.<br>no matter the reason given.<br>The reason there is just to forgive one's self.<br>Or a reason to break away from commitment.<br>For some they feel they never really love the guy/girl<br>Simply put as they are just testing.<br><br>People get hurt in these course of action along the way.<br><br>Not enough commitment, not enough this not enough that.<br><br>Here's 1 big problem there I always see around in singapore :<br><br>Couples are hurt by each other actions,<br>and they don't tell one another,<br>And yet they expect each other to understand ?<br><span class="small">What are you psychic ?
