            <div class='col-md body'>for me..i always experience emptiness...friends..come and go..<br>got peak period whereby u keep on meeting dem, life is so wonderful..<br>at school..<br><br>den suddenly you woke up..you realised..u got nothing..<br>you count all your achivements.. and u take a look in the newspapers<br>recently, 18 year old scholar become president scholar directly go MIT<br>(massachusetts institude of technology) meanwhile u gotta slog in singapore<br>for NS<br><br>anyway im just saying this.. Why President Scholar serve NS after getting<br>perfect A lvl grades and getting a Ph.D from MIT.<br><br>Why do we have to serve at 18 and 19..and bo chance to get degree first..?<br><br>Those president scholars do serve NS but at a later period and for their NS<br>they get cushy jobs..HAIZ!<br><br>Every human is born with the same brain..considering other den<br>people of lower mental capability , the retarded and people with downs syndrome..<br><br>Sometimes i really wonder , is the government really making use of us..<br>and sometimes i wonder whats the point of going through the main stream<br>education.. Its like MY ENTIRE life is CHARTED!<br><br>as a human , we are supposed to be unique , and when a baby is born from birth til old , you will definitely know what will happen to him in his life.<br><br>From 4-6 years old , the kid will go into kindergarden , from 7- 12 the kid will go into a primary school , and from 13 to 16 he will go inside the secondary<br>school and he will take a o lvl..and poly/ite/jc..the guy will stay here<br>and work til 55 and he will get CPF..and so and so..<br><br>And basically he will spend his life watching Channel U and Channel I<br>and Channel 5 and Channel 8..<br><br>And from birth til NS period..<br>And basically i juz feel that the environment around us is all very artificial<br><br>Wonder if any other singaporeans experience..<br><br>We don't hear any bad press about SG Govt, even though the governance<br>might be one of the best , but however as we know as human beings,<br>there can't be some thing called perfect and therefore there has to be flaws<br><br>For me ..im seriously thinking of migrating.... Because from a human's pespective i seriously don't think that elitism should be continued<br>Why?<br>Because Chinese/Malay/Indian/Others all have the same mental capacities<br>and capabilities and potential....Cause i don't believe that someone with<br>A 100% cert and degree constitutes = PERFECTNESS<br><br>I also don't understand..why creativity has to be promoted so openly..<br>when graffiti painters are arrested , Creativity has to come from within<br>Arts...you can't promoted creativity by creating art class..<br>Creative technologies all evolved from the imagination ...<br>And somemore the teachers in school..catch us..simply for..<br>DayDreaming..Basically whether Bill Gates or a african boy also daydreams..<br><br>For Me, I wanna live a carefree live..in the outside..with the gal i love most<br>away from the urban areas..NO carrying of SAR-21 and btw im also a man full of peace too.. whats the point of equipping , Why also spend 8 billion SGD<br>when u can help countless of old people homeless in tanglin road??<br><br>If everyone on earth disarm and stop fighting ..wouldn't it be better?<br>Of all the evolutions from Stone age til now..Humans have never stopped in developing technologies to kill each other..from stone axe to GUNS.Have we evolved? No..If only those $$ used to developed weapons were used to promote the continuation of human race..20 more years before oil runs out<br>and ships..planes will not have any fuel left. Why fight?<br><br>and if u ask me whats my race , im Human Race , basically divided into yellow brown and black..also don't understand why government blocks pple from discussing about race/religion in mainstream TV. RACE/RELIGION are the things which WE humans should be the most proud of.<br><br>Religion makes our lifestyle worthwhile and we know that there is a greater being in life..Race creates our own identity...<br><br>Im proud of CNY and im proud that China is a growing superpower<br>Whether you are malay/indian , i respect you too , peace out<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sometimes do you even wonder??<br><br>you live in life..just to pay the countless singtel bills..<br>or the internet bills<br>its just that i dowan my life to be charted down..<br><br>You struggle so much in life , just to buy a car and a hdb..<br>yet pple sit in the office , earns almost 10 times of what you earn..<br><br>Don't you all feel that..over few billion of people have died on earth..<br>Mother teresa is one of the greatest person who lived..Why??<br>She is not re-owned for war..not re-owned for any other stuffs..<br><br>Anyway every human have to die sooner or later..<br>Therefore in my lifetime..i will try to impact people the most..<br><br>Isn't it sad to be born on this beautiful earth..<br>only to know that in the future , you will die??<br><br>Also don't understand why death sentence for people..<br>and drug traffickers.. i always believe in 2nd chance..<br><br>killing someone who killed someone makes you a murderer as well.<br><br>There is no justification in killing..whether right or wrong..<br><br>Last time don't know if you all heard of the stories..<br>a man once accidentally killed a guy he knew..<br>The man felt intense remorse coz the guy he killed was his good friend<br>and the guy had a mother to support..<br>so the man went to help..and support the guy's mum..<br>by providing food everyday..<br>At last the man confess to the mum..and the mum forgived him..<br>why? because it was accidental and it cannot be reversed back..<br><br>Why i oppose death sentence? Cause people not given a chance<br>to turn over a new leaf..You execute immediately after the person has commited murder..he has not been given a chance to reflect on his wrongs<br>and know what wrong he did...and he won't feel the guilt within..<br><br>Life itself is so precious and even though drug trafficking may be wrong<br>i don't think it should have a death sentence ..Why?<br>It only build on the seeds of hate..just imagine the child of a dead al-qaeda fighter will become the next osama..So what if there's 1 osama?<br><br>But all i know is that IF my family members was sentenced to death<br>due to drug trafficking..i would certainly be a rebel and avenge my members<br>Why? Cause Life itself the experience should be maximised as much as possible..life is a opportunity..and a person who is dead isn't given a chance<br><br>Everyone knows that killing someone is of wrong morally..<br>but what makes them want to kill ?<br>Does the American Government know that most of al-qaeda..<br>consider each other as family..and that by killing of one them<br>you are killing thier family..<br><br>If anyone tries to touch my family , i would also react heavily..<br><br>Whats the point of being armed to kill when you know that<br>your life COULD be anything..For me i don't want to have my life charted out<br>i don't want to sit in the same old bus..stay in the same old house..<br>i don't want to be "made used" in a killing organisation..<br><br>I don't want to be labelled Seventh day adventist or whatever..<br>War and Fighting all evolves from insecurities..thats why so many billions spent<br>over 10 trillion spent and september 11 attacks cannot be prevented..<br>it only proves 1 thing..as long as EVEN 1 person has the will..<br>the human way is still there.<br><br>Even if 1 DAY I DO SHOOT THE ENEMY..<br>i will think of this..the enemy's family..children..are they enemy as well?<br>What makes me know that i will be happy after shooting him??<br><br>I know its a question of either i die or you die..<br>Why not both live??

Why do us humans gain so much delight?<br><br>Why can't humans be satisfied ? Why must humans judge each other IQ and Education ? Anyway when it comes to me.. I Believe i am As Good As any Bangladeshi worker and as good as any RJC student when it comes to being a human itself.<br><br>Im just laughing at people who are supposedly smartest and contented with digits in a piece of paper , just wondering if they could take that paper away with them to live with in the future.<br></div>

I think you have a high tendency to think too much and momentarily confused. Not too healthy. By the way, I used to be like you...

Maybe what you've said could be right. Some people are die-hard bikers. Some even risk their lives for thrills of sorts. You are probably right about a car being more safe for the user as compared to the car. But if accidents are to happen. There's no guarantee that the people in a car could be safe?<br><br>If the reason is as stated by me.. Tactless. Then MORE people might die in a car compared to a bike? And the damage a car could to doing to the people around its surroundings compared to a bike?<br><br>And accidents aside.. Many other factors to look into... Like traffic control..? We can simply go on...<br><br>Many of the things you've mentioned in your previous posts in this thread are of such... I did not reply to them because it's simply too long-winded. I think ya got my point?<br><br>Nobody would be able to live forever. Maybe not even god. I was having your 'crisis of death thoughts' at 9. Long over it..<br><br>Being forgotten is not the worst thing. It's really whether you've made your life a meaningful one?<br><br>Almost everything would be forgotten or replaced eventually..?<br></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi swaykia,<br><br>Guess i am not the only one going through this "mid-life" crisis thing. Mine pretty much started when i began poly. I have just graduated and about to embark on another chapter in my life, NS. Life has not been the best for me at this point of time. I've been thrusted into many unhappy situations and people during this course of time. At the end of the day, all these left me to reflect whether is it just me, or the world that i am going against.<br><br>Your thoughts and feelings are not uncommon. Religion has been the only thing that keeps me going at this point of time. Else, i would not dare imagine what i would have been like. To the others who have replied, quit whining, i do agree with you to a certain extent. Yes, we should always channel most of our energy to working towards what we want. However, that is if circumstances and situations have given you the chance. It is rather like catching air into a bottle(haha, weird analogy). Hey, swaykia, guess you're not that bad or infact pretty fortunate, having a place to study after your NS, SMU rite? For a couple of us, we still have to chart our paths and forge ahead in search of a route.<br><br>If i do sound contradicting or whatsoever, do pardon me. At the point of writing, my mind's in a whirl trying to organise my thoughts and feelings and penning them into words. In summary, you are not alone in this pithole swaykia, and i really appreciate others whom have been through the same rough patch to share and enlighten us. We could always learn more from one another. 2 brains is always better than 1. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
