If she is still in love with you she won't mention that she is giving another guy chances as well.<br><br>If your scenerio is the same as mine, she has already given up on you. Baby steps to salvage the relationship won't even work.<br></div>

Maybe not as bad as what I was in before but seriously it is difficult to regain the love you once had. It is going to be very difficult. You really have to know what went wrong and fix it once and for all and not fix it just to get her back and after a while, things just slide back to how it was.<br><br>If you can convince her that this is really moving forward and the past is the past, maybe.</div>
