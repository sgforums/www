She have her social life too leh<br><br>b) Can I ask you why you did not call her ? Why would she want a bf who only knows how to sms and do not know to pamper her?

It only shows that you do not understand her feelings well enough to be her bf. Thats why she call for a final break. You have already lost to yourself, how can you win her back?<br><br>3)   "but i've prayed to God, and told him that if it's in His will, we'll be together, if not so be it.

That shows her he is desperate to patch back and is willing to overlook anything simply to get back into his comfort zone. Being desperate will immediately put you into a disadvantageous position.<br><br>It's like a little kid who cries and tries to embarass you in public when she doesn't get what she want. If you pamper her for all the crap she throws at you and gives her what she wants, you are programming her to think that everytime she does something wrong, she gets a reward for it.<br><br>But I do agree with the rest of your post though.<br><br><strong>To Gustowind,</strong><br><br>I think you've learn something valuable.<br><br>I know how difficult it is to let go and think in a logical manner in a relationship but when the lady wants a breakup when she knows you are going through a rough patch in your life. She no longer cares. Her interest in you is officially zero.<br><br>You should have moved on back in October and could have retain some dignity and respect.<br><br>Good luck with your future sarges.<br><br></div>

Your presence is a stumbling block to her new relationship.<br><br>When you are tired of studying, go out and do some exercises...jogging or swimming.

            <div class='col-md body'>sorry freguson.. i was too anxious to post my replies..<br><br>thanks curious orange for your replies.. appreciate them very much..<br><br>i think this thing abt breaking up has been boiling below the surface for a while..<br><br>cant really blame her for breaking up.. has nothing to do with the timing of my mom being sick.. think our feelings for each other must have become less and less .. ( that's what she told me )<br><br>anyways I have a deep feeling that she might have someone else she's interested in in her life..<br><br>well as what zeny said.. it's all my fault i didn't treasure her to know her feelings well enuff.. problem is i never get to talk to her deep enugh.. my fault for not spending time with her...<br><br>perhaps it was the communication gap.. i dunno for sure..<br><br>thanks for the advice for getting myself occupied ... i'll go to the gym later...<br><br>i dun wan to throw her pictures away.. cos i still love her.. but it hurts even to climb stairs cos when i first talked to her i was climbing the stairs from 1st level to my floor... it hurts to do even that.. remembering it all is not pleasant..<br><br>guess i'm just spamming here now.. well.. at least better than thinking abt it all<br><br>regards,<br>gust of wind</div>

( that's what she told me )<br><br>gust of wind</div></blockquote>Im not saying you should blame her. The blaming game is never my cup of tea.<br><br>I mentioned what happened to your mum because I want you to observe your gf's ACTIONS during that period and think logically.<br><br>When a gal pesters you to break up even when she knows you are going through a whole load of sh!t...you have already lost her. No amount of pampering is going to raise her interest in you (and there is no point in keeping her by your side anyways). Always pay more attention to the gal's actions.<br><br>Like what I said in your previous thread, somewhere along the relationship...you probably screwed up...by being complacent, by not giving her enough  excitement in the relationship to keep her interested.<br><br>Those points are still relevant to you right now. You need to improve on them...FOR THE SAKE OF THE NEXT RELATIONSHIP.<br><br>You should be thinking about how to change so that the NEXT relationship will be better. After the exams, invest more time on self-improvement. This new relationship will start even before you meet her.<br><br>And when you finally meet her, you will be ready to show her you are the prize to be won.<br><br>Change your mindset. Take this as a rehearsal/ learning experience for the perfect lady you WILL meet in future. Plenty of fishes in the sea.</div>

Did not take that into account becos I did not know about your past.<br><br>I hope to get you back on your feet asap and prepare a few guidelines for you.<br><br>First I need to get your mindset straight first<br><br>1) you have broken up with your gf is final. Get a good grip of that. She will no longer be there when you are sick to take care of you anymore. She will NOT be there to take care of your mum. She WILL NOT be there to help you in your exam.<br><br>2) What should you do first<br><br>a) Tell yourself the relatuonship is over there is nothing you can do about it but now you have more time with your family and friends.<br><br>b) Take good care of your mum once she see that her son is strong enough to handle a breakup like a man. She will be more happy in her fight against kidney failure.<br><br>c) WORK VERY HARD for your exam. You had already work until here and your exams will determine your future why waste your chance to grad earlier becos of a gal who broke up with you ?  Stop wasting your time with silly thoughts of chances to be together and wake up your idea! So what when you think of the past ? She will never be there for you again. So wake up and study.<br><br>d) For sunday buffet dinner with your tuition student, I suggest that you go and announce that you have offical broke up with your gf. They are not in your relatuonship and they deserve some time off after their exams. Go out and have fun no point mopping at home too right? It takes guts and courage to step out and tell others but trust me is a faster way to recover as your students will rely by your side and help you through the diffcult times.<br><br>No matter what take good care of yourself first. Eat right and sleep well.<br>Girls expect guys to led and can take good care of them. If you are not strong or weak how can you do it ?</div>
