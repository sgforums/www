Hitting the gym or swimming frequently is a good idea. Fix a schedule and work out often to get a better looking body and improved posture.<br><br>Stock up on some hair and skin products and cologne that suit you. While your aim is not to enter Mr. Universe competition, you have to let people notice that you know how to take care of yourself properly. A neat and clean appearance is the way to go.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Money and Power</span></strong><br>Do some serious thinking about your career aspirations and how you are going to achieve them. A common interview question that sprang to my mind right nowÂ…Â”where do you see yourself in 5 years/10 years time and what have you done so far to realize that aspiration?Â”<br>Notice why people like asking this question? People in general like someone who has a plan and knows where they are heading in their life. Allocate more time to your studies and read up more on investment books which can give you more information on managing your finances properly.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Confidence</span></strong><br>Improvement on your looks and finances would have done wonders to your confidence. However, confidence alone will not get you dates. You need to improve on your conversation skills, which is the difficult part.<br><br>What works for me might not have the same effect on you. A few days after I was dumped by my ex., my bros arrange a sarge session. We went over to Zouk and had a competition. We went to random girls in the house and hit on them and tried to get their numbers. The loser (the one who get the least numbers) will win free drinks from all the other bros. We are not learning to be players or jerks here. The idea is to get used to rejections from women and have fun at the same time.<br><br>Imagine one day when you see Mrs. Gustowind walking on the street, how would you feel if you missed out just because you donÂ’t know how to approach and strike up a convo? Rejection is better than regret.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Passion</span></strong><br>You must have a passion in your lifeÂ…something you like to do and can continue doing for the rest of your life. Live out your dreams. A man who has passion and dreams is never boring. He is always working on some projects he thinks is important regardless what others say. His life is buzzing and people are drawn by the enthusiasm he displayed.<br><br><strong>Getting a girl is not the success. </strong><br><br><strong>Getting a girl who is willing to accommodate your passions and dreams Â…that is the real success a man can have.</strong> A relationship will never lack excitement when 2 parties can work together and explore new things to do.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Never lose that passion in your life just because she wants you to</span></strong><br>Make this a motto in your life<br><br>Â“The day I lose my passion will be the day I lose happiness and pride of myself as a man.  No woman can replace that.Â”<br><br>Be willing to walk away rather than compromise.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic;">And many moons later, Mrs. Gustowind will sit down with all your grandchildren and tell them, Â“ I met your Grandpa 50 years ago, it was love at the first sight!Â”<br><br>But you know she is wrong, the relationship started before you met her.</span></span></strong><br></div>

So why should she be different if she wants to be a friend?<br><br>You are treating her different because you still harbour some thoughts of eventually patching up with her. I'm sorry to bust your balls...it's not going to happen.<br><br>Next time you see her in church, give her a friendly nod and a smile...nothing more unless she initiates convo with you.<br><br>I will not attempt to contact her anymore.
