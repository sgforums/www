              <p>Hi all, i'm posting this post to get more ideas what is the best way to handle this situation.</p>
              <p>My fiance share a room with his bro who is getting married. To cut the story short, his bro wife is a pr &amp; currently renting a shared room. </p>
              <p>Option 1 is for my fiance to shift out of the room &amp; slp in tbe hall.</p>
              <p>Option 2 is for his bro to shift out on their own.</p>
              <p>Simple but!! Thing is tat their expenses will go up much higher! Not our problem.. Haha.. Sticky sticky thing is that.. Our new house might be coming in anytime from now.. Expected to be end of this yr to early next yr.</p>
              <p>Our wedding plans will be end of next yr &amp; regardless we wont be moving in till aftrer we married. Therefore in this yr if our house comes it will be left vacant.<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: sans-serif; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">
              </span></p><p style="display: inline !important;"> </p>
              <span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: sans-serif; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">
              <p style="display: inline !important;">Then it seems so selfish to let his bro rent a room outside whilst we leave our new home empty. my fiance of coz not v keen to have to slp in the hall for a year! also I'm not keen for him to shift in alone first then after our marriage then i move in. </p>
              <p style="display: inline !important;"> </p>
              <p style="display: inline !important;"> </p>
              <p style="display: inline !important;"> </p>
              <p style="display: inline !important;"> </p>
              </span>
              <p> </p>
              <p></p>
              <p>
              </p><p> </p>
              <p></p>
              <p>
              </p><p> </p>
              <p></p>
              <p>
              </p><p> </p>
              <p></p>
              <p>
              </p><p> </p>
              <p></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It doesn sound right that here on one hand we have our own house left vacant yet his bro is renting a room out there </p>

            <div class='col-md body'>perhaps u can ask yr future sis in law to stay at the rented room even after they got married until yr flat is ready then u can rent a room to them and yr finace can stay in another room.  this way yr fiance can keep an eye on them n at the same time make some passive income...u can move in end of next yr when u officially married to yr fiance.</div>

              <p>Ahkico,</p>
              <p>The best way is to let his brother's wife continue the shared rental room outside until both of you move into your new home.</p>
              <p>Do not be a sucker for his brother's problem.</p>
              <p>His brother needs to resolve his own problem.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Stop wiping his ass for him.</p>
              <p>The brother's wife can wait.. just because they are married does not mean they must share a single room. If the brother cannot tahan sleeping without his wife.. he can go find a home elsewhere.</p>
              <p>There is really no need for you to bend over backwards just so that brother can hug his new PR wife to sleep at night.</p>
              <p>Stay out of the problem.</p>

              <p>quite simply they want a perfect start to the marriage at all costs.</p>
              <p>they can even let the brother stay there first but you know to avoid trouble best not to right?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>riiiiiggghhtt of the bat I can already say your relationship with your brother in law is most likely crap.</p>
              <p>for your fiance to even consider these things he's either ball-less around you or he has a shi.tty relationship with his brother too.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and once they finalise everything and move out , the already not good relationship between brothers will deteriorate to a point when you only meet each other during CNY or best if you don't meet. all with the blessings of you my dear.</p>

              <p>Yah lah yah lah... it's the women at fault again.</p>
              <p>As if the shit from men don't stink.</p>
              <p>Men do stupid things.. and the women hav to wipe their asses for them issit.</p>
              <p>Your wife should have divorced you if you even have one.</p>
              <p>What a fool you are.</p>
              <p>If one of your son is doing stupid things like marrying a gal when he couldn't afford a place himself.. and your daughter in law has to bend over backwards for that stupid son of yours...</p>
              <p>You should be giving your stupid son a lecture and knuckling his empty skull instead of making things difficult for the other son and his wife.</p>
              <p>Teach your son how to be a better human being instead of blaming the daughter in law !</p>
              <p>Stupid men like you can only raise stupid children. SMH</p>
