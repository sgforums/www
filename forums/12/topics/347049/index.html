              <p>It's been 2 years since I last had a gf. In between, I haven't been dating much. Kinda' forgot how it feels to be in love.. or would I say, to woo someone. It's always those simple and usual ways.. asking her out, text messages, etc.</p>
              <p>We knew each other around 5 years back, even before the last gf of mine. That time, we both were only friends and only been out a few times. A few times I admit I wanna know more and have much more than just friendship alone but there's always a barrier in between. Either she's in a relationship or I'm attached. </p>
              <p>Until recently (1 month +) I popped into her shop were she was working, as usual caught up and found out she broke up with her partner. Like I've said, I wanted to know more and have a closer r/s with her, now's the chance, since she's single and I am too. First we hit off really well though most of our conversation is over msn. Asking each other's horoscopes, finding out what's the each other's compatible signs. We started talking everyday in msn and text messages. She would call me 'love' and seldom by my name. I don't know if it's because the no. of years we knew each other or it's just her usual way of calling her friends.. Whatever that reason is, I, been hurt badly by my past, I didn't dare to use 'dear' or any other intimate names to call her, other than her name. A few times, she asked me out but somehow we didn't get to meet.  A few times. It seems like she's more in this than I am. </p>
              <p><br>Now, the problem is.. the other way round. I seems to be reaching to her every other time. Somehow she just gives me mixed signals. Last time she would initiate messages, ask me about my day. Now it's the other way round. I'm always the one to text her first. And it seems like now I have troubles asking her out.</p>
              <p>Eg. Her friend is leaving for Australia for studies on Monday. She asked if she should send her friend off. Cause if she do, she would cry on the way back alone! if she doesn't obviously she would have to wait till months later then could she be able to meet her. I told her to go. And that if possible, I could drive her back home after sending her friend's plane off. She said "REALLY?! :)" Judging by this, it seems like we're meeting on Monday.. not till yesterday during our random chat in msn, we talked about sending her home on Monday. I said, "hey, if I'm not able to get the car, then I could still accompany you home!" immediately, she said, "haha, no.. but my friend's mom is sending me back after sending her plane off!" I was shocked to read that. If I haven't mention about sending her home on Monday then wouldn't I be a fool to message her on Monday morning on what time to pick her in the evening?! Apparently, to her it wasn't a offical date. She just changed her plans with me without informing me..? She didn't even say 'sorry, i was about to tell you' or something along the line.. I'm confused.</p>
              <p>Now our text messages are getting lesser, lesser topics, and now asking her out is getting tougher.. what's happening? Was it becos I didn't dare to show her or haven't I give her enough 'signals' that she find it's a waste of time to further our f/s that's why she's giving changed signals?</p>
              <p>btw, we still call each other by intimate names.. but just not so often..</p>

              No, bro, she's just your friend =) IMO i may be wrong... seriously 5 years of friend. That's what I call it, I've got a 6~7 year friend and we're kinda close... We can call each other by many many different names! However that is just a way to show we care for each other AS A FRIEND. Yet again I may be wrong, its all case by case.
              
              When you do the horoscope mixing and all, do you people do it jokingly? Or was it supposed to be sweet and all? 
              
              What I feel is that she is too comfy with you already, to a point that she doesn't think that putting you on aeroplane will make you angry or anything. From what I see so far, you've just treated her as a friend and you portray to her that as well. From that you're drawing a clear line in-between.
              
              HOWEVER sometimes, don't give in to relationship and blow up your 5 years worth of friendship with this girl. Sometimes, making the wrong step, doing the wrong thing will land you into further regrets! Think what you want bro=)
