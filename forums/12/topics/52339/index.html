            <div class='col-md body'>i m not in a much better situation myself, but i m quite lucky to find someone who is willing to be a pauper's gf. I just graduated, still job hunting, she is the same age as me so its kinda like wat u say. not all gals will be dat materialistic n be attracted to u on the basis of wat your pocket can offer them..but rather on the basis on how much your personality is compatible and how the both of you can complement each others lives.. its really more than fancy restaurants..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm... dun worry too much abt the money-side of things. Good advice here.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  It's true, when u r younger, sincerity and effort counts more than pure $$$.<br><br>However, u still have to deal with it some time, later or earlier.<br><br>I'll give u two examples:<br><br>1) Say you are in your early 20s... prob get to know the girl, just started work. u r still schooling. maybe just a few months into a job, you'll prb have a good relationship. No expensive presents are ok, no restaurants are ok, no vacations are ok. Small time stuff makes the girl happy  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  because you are sincere and devoted.<br><br>But lemme tell u that once "The FUTURE" is talked about, inevitably, money will come into the picture. Not so much the lovey-romantic stuff but the "quality of life" you'll lead together. Is it enough for her?<br><br>2) How about comparisons to her ex-es or her close guy friends? They earn a lot more than you do and possibly, more than u'll prob attain in your life (maybe unless ur a bookie or loanshark).<br><br>She'll inwardly compare u to what sort of lifestyles they had been leading. So, even if she is all nice-sweet-unconcerned-abt-wealth, she'll still think of the $2K allowance she gets from her i-banker boyfriend who actually employed a maid because she says she don't want to clean the house they share.<br><br>Oh heck, decide for yourself. Just telling u the ugly side since most here are very nice and sweet and ideal.</div>
