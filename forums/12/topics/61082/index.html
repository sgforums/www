She, may/may not be in that group, but certainly her appearence is related to these new guys he just made friends with. To keep mum about the relationship because he may wished to know her better, without turning her off in the begining with 'I am attached' sign hung on him. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>II) Possessive nature sets him a fear to allow guys to learn about the existence of his gf. In a way, he is 'protecting.', although it's psychologically unhealthy. He loves to company of the guys no doubt, his suspicious and easily jealous nature stems this behaviour. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Regardless of whatever reason it is, there is defintely more than meets the eye.

You agree with the former, latter, or simply dunno?<br><br>II) Any criticial problem occur in your relationship before?
