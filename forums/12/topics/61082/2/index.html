I think both of you have to talk through them if you want to treasure this relationship.<br><br>glad that you treasure the harmony and peace now but that does not mean compromising on clearing the doubts(if any) between couple.<br><br>I am a male and hey, I am shy till I can go unnoticed when giving class presentation or public speech. But I am never ashamed that friends or acquaintances would make fun of me when I introduce my gf. No offence really, but I find the answer abit blatant.<br>But still, pointing finger is not gona help at any point of time.<br><br>Wish both of you all the best in working out the relationship.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yeah that intro to gals thing is a concern  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  but what i feel is that if he doesn't feel like telling ppl about it there's nothing i can do and nothing i will do because the decision is mainly up to him... i don't think he has any other gals to his liking out there but we spend a lot of time together(with me at his place all the time) his schedule is pretty fixed and roughly i know where he'll be at what time but still there's a chance right?<br><br>maybe if he really has someone out there that he's interested in, i'll get to know sooner or later and perhaps the happy thing by then is that i'll know the truth and also i'm not the one who cheated...<br><br>true it hurts to know that he prefers to keep me a secret and perhaps as a woman i find it hard to put complete trust in him all i could say is that i'm trying my best to take whatever decision he made... it may not be reasonable but i respect him and his decisions because love is not about changing a person but rather compromising and giving in...<br><br>thanks all for giving valuable advice... speculation may not be accurate but at least i have an insight at how a guy may think... thanks</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>don't see yourself that way... You're not an extra baggage or whatsoever, just that he probably got a new 'toy'. you know that kind of feeling... Well, I always feel that people should always have something fresh to show their partner from time to time to keep them entertained. It will just help to strengthen the relationship, for what you know something novel that you do may be one of his/her interests too, and thus both of you would find something more in common. It's really the quality of time that counts not the quantity. Rather than lock yourself up in his place, I would suggest that you pick up something new yourself. Then when both of you meet up together, you can talk about the things that you learn. A r/s is a mind game, to maintain the flow of the game, you have to keep the other party interested, and in some cases, in suspense. Then the person will have something to investigate and explore everytime..</div>
