            <div class='col-md body'>hi, juz feel puzzle.. why not your gf convert to chinese religion instead? In my church there are a few Malays converts..tink nowadays most Sporean Malays are more modern and become more open to accept other religions already ..<br><br>Did you find out more about the muslim teachings? Try attending some mulsim classes after your exams to understand more about your gf's culture and God. Then make the decision. Of course, if possible find a solution that you can get the girl but will also not break your mum's heart. Its really happy to see two pple from different races fall in love.. shows how great love is, overcoming cultural barriers, races and languages. I believe that one day the two of you will have very beautiful children! All the best  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div>
