I have something to share here, and will like to seek some opinions and advice on a relationship matter..it may be very complicated and i expect to draw some flak. but just want to be honest here and get some thoughts on this.. (Caution: Long post ahead).</span><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;">This is my first post here, and i am a guy who is 27yo, with a lovely gf, W, who is currently studying and away from S'pore for 8 mths. I am now 6 mths into my first job upon graduation. The story began in this first job.</span><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Beginning</strong></span><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;">I came into the new office and worked with this project with a colleague, S, who was already in the project. Things were very professional and I was very serious in my work. S, as i learnt when i came into the office, will be getting married in about a year's time and it was already known to the whole office back then.</span><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;">I had totally no imagination or liking for S at all, because i am already attached and she is already going to marry her bf of 2 years, J. However, I must admit that S is attractive and she is very serious in whatever work she is doing. Our working level relationship were pretty much the norm for the first 5 months, except that around the 3rd-5th months, we did start to chat a little bit, sidetrack abit from work during work conversations in whatsapp or email. But there were still no signs of flirting at all. Pure chit chatting with a colleague - friend. Along the way, S was busy preparing her new home, her wedding, and work. I, on the other hand, was basically work, and occasionally skype sessions with my gf, W.</span><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The catalyst</strong></span><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;">Now, during one day in the 5th month, after a meeting, when all had left the room except for S and I, S told me that she was going to tender her resignation soon. I was in a state of shock, which later turned into disappointment. We stayed behind in the meeting room. We talked, I remained cool, and I asked her the usual questions like why did she want to quit, going to where, when, and so on. More importantly, I asked her to reconsider it because I would like her to stay, and I couldnt bear to see her go as I felt we were just in the beginning of the making of a good working tag team. I felt upset at that time, but I didnt show. She didnt tell me any reasons for wanting to quit, and the place where she is going too. We basically ended off with no conclusion.</span><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;">For the next few days, I would try to persuade her to stay, as I realised as the days go by that I cant bear to see her go. At first, I thought it was because of the high turnover rate in the office (around 5-6 ppl had left during my short time there), but I realised that I really enjoy working with her and the understanding we had in work.</span><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;">S did tell me that she would see first, but she already had an offer in another office. Somehow, this topic faded away for around 2 weeks after this, because of the hectic workload we had. What happened during these 2 weeks besides work was instead a dinner out together, and a series of unexpected events:</span><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Attraction</strong></span><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;">The dinner was due to my request. Sometimes when u know a person is leaving you start to be more appreciative. In my case, I tried to use such opportunities to try to talk S round. What started off pretty simple ended with a slow walk out to the main road and at that time, both of us felt something.. attraction.</span><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;">The other event that happened was on april fools' day. Again, we worked late. The whole office only had the 2 of us left. We were looking on my computer and half discussing work, half chit chatting, when suddenly she asked: 'can i kiss u'? To be honest, I was used to her harmless tricks and antics, so i was wary. I didnt think that she was really going to kiss me. But i sat still. She came closer.. until her lips were 3cm from mine. True enough, she suddenly pulled back and said 'bluff u!' and returned to her seat.</span><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;">I was not surprised really, and didnt asked anything immediately after, and continued doing my work. We finally got our work done at around 2am, and were walking out the office and switching off the lights. It was then that I casually asked: 'u really were joking about kissing me huh? Can joke about this kind of thing one huh?' S replied: 'i am serious'. I realised she must have felt i thought she was joking or not taking her seriously. In that 1 moment, I moved my face closer, saw her..S got suddenly nervous and eyes were flustering. I moved until my lips touched hers. for 3 seconds. then i pulled back, and we left the office and for home separately.</span><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;">The next day was the same. We worked till late. Only that this time, we were abit shy and more friendly to each other than before. As we left the office together, reached downstairs (which was a shopping mall), i was prepared to go to the taxi stand with her and go home. But she asked: 'Can we walk around for a while?' I agreed, and we just walked for a bit. We came to this spiral stairs that we had never went up before and talked about the stairs. Then we decided to explore what was upstairs. We locked lips the second time up the spiral stairs. This time, it was longer, and she asked if she could hug me. And we hugged. The night when I was going home, in the taxi, I thought: 'this is going to be complicated and get serious'. I kept thinking about my gf, W, but S kept hovering at the back of my mind. Subsequently, things became more ai4 mei4 and beneath the work we shared, we began to share many other things, like breakfasts, dinners, jokes, and chats.</span><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Shocked</strong></span><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;">Until one day, when I was in boss' office and discussing about work, boss suddenly told me: 'do u know S tendered her resignation yesterday?' I was in a state of shock. I tried very hard to maintain composure, and finished the discussion. After which, I pulled S to outside the office, and asked her about it. We decided to talk about it after work.</span><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;">The talk after work that day was emotional. I kept emphasising how much I would like her to stay. Only that this time I suddenly wasn't sure why I was asking her to stay. Was it because I really need her in the project, or want to develop the budding working chemistry we have so perhaps in future we can become partners of our own business, or because I realised I really couldn't bear to see her go? Perhaps it is all. I teared. What she told me kind of surprised me but it was something that I had thought before. She said part of the reason was me. She could not focus on her work and her bf. She realised that even when she was with her bf, she kept thinking of me. She knew this would get her into trouble. She had to leave. Her other reason was work-related. After much talk, eventually, the conclusion that night was she would reconsider her resignation. Something which gave me hope but I knew subconsciously that she had made up her mind and i was merely delaying the formality. The main point from me for her decision to 'reconsider' was that I would prove to her that I would not be a negative distraction to her. Instead, I would become a positive distraction and try to motivate her to conc on her work and her bf. In a way, it was like saying I would be someone who will toe my line and try to make her life happier from a distance.</span><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;">Eventually, she told me she really did not want to sink deeper and would stick by her decision. I still tried for a few days more but to no avail. I was disappointed and upset.</span><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>About S's bf, J</strong></span><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;">All this while, she told me alot about her bf of 2 years, J. J was someone who gets suspicious easily, and he would keep calling S and ask her where she is, what she is doing, when is she going back, why, how, etc. S said she found it annoying. S also said that when J proposed to her overseas last year, she really did not want to agree because she didnt feel prepared at all. But looking at J, who knelt down and looked so disappointed, she relented. When I heard about all these, I felt I had 2 sides of me: a devil side and an angel side. And I have done both. I told her that it was obvious that she isnt happy and her feelings for him are not strong enough. She also said that J likes her more than she likes him. I told her that supposedly if she finds that i am more suitable one day, will she give up the wedding plans and chase her happiness? She said she cannot afford to lose everything. It would be too much of a risk. And I am attached. I knew I should not bring this up at all. The other side of me, the angelic side, would tell her that she has to think carefully before committing, for this is a decision which will impact the rest of her life. I told her that if she indeed realise that someone else is more suitable one day, and this feeling gets so strong until she believes in it, she should follow her heart and do it. But i made it clear that it must be from her and she must be clear about it. It cannot come from that someone, or from me. And if she manages to stay committed and learn to appreciate the good of her bf and grow old with him, I would give her my blessings too. When I said that, I started to become unsure if I was saying that because I want her to be happy and not make the wrong decision, or because I want her.</span><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;">but looking at her, i knew she is in a huge dilemma. she isnt happy at all. I received 2 missed calls from her at 2.30am one night but i was asleep. I called her the next morning, and she told me that she had actually wanted to tell me the previous night that she wanted to cancel the wedding. but she said she was relieved i did not pick it up. what could i say. i could only listen.</span><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Gradual acceptance?</strong></span><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;">I tried to persuade S time and again to stay, and each time i tried, i realised she was very determined. I grew to accept it and thought about what it would be after she left. On the working front, the project will be left to me alone. I felt alittle daunted and empty inside. This project was the project which S fought so hard for, and it was still in the beginning stages. I felt upset that S is giving it up. Many a times, when i was taking a break from office and went downstairs for a short puff, i became emotional at the thought of it. I even toyed with the idea of quitting, because i knew things will never be the same again. I wondered if S and me will stop contacting. S did tell me that her leaving would be best for both of us, given that both of us have own partners, and if she leave, things will become temporal suffering. Feelings will fade, or so she said. I told her that what if feelings wont fade? And if it will fade, it will also fade if she stays. If it won't fade, it will not fade no matter where she goes. I could not control myself and said all these, knowing i have a gf who is at overseas.</span><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;">I did not feel well one day and went on MC. S actually got so worried that she took urgent leave and came my house to look for me. We talk again about the same things, and got close..but did not do anything.</span><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Did wrong.</strong></span><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;">S and myself didn't have a good recent week. She had difficulties in focusing on work and bf, she is preparing for handover, for a transitioning period, she is preparing for her wedding, she is handling her bf's questioning of where she is going, what she is doing when she was with me, and she is distracted by me. I had tried and tried to make her stay, i had tried to comfort her, make her happier, make her stay focused and giving her my wishes. But deep down, i knew i am not happy. I also had to grapple with the prospect of not having her around as a working partner in office. I was contemplating leaving, too.</span><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;">S was supposed to go on a short trip over the fri/sat weekend with a few colleagues. On the friday, i asked if I can spend time together with her on sat night, at her home or somewhere else. I just wanted to spend time with her. S said that it wasn't appropriate for me to go to her home..and I knew I should not ask her that. In the end, S told her colleagues that she had smth on and would not be going to the trip and called me instead. She asked if we could spend time together on fri after work instead. she actually put her trip off. i wrapped up my work, and went downstairs where she was waiting for me. I asked her, so how should we spend the night? she told me she would bring me somewhere. she had booked a room. For the first time and night, we didnt talk much about her staying/leaving. i began to tell her that she has become more of a regular feature in my mind. we mostly talked about her needing to commit and stick to her wedding. she hugged me and kissed me. she was in a struggle. and i reciprocated. and we spent the night together. In a room.</span><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>matters of the heart</strong></span><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;">S told me she wanted for us to be friends because if we let our feelings rule further it would cause us both lots of trouble. She said that her bf is already suspecting something, and they have been quarreling over all kinds of things. They were supposed to go choose gowns in the bridal studio, but they had a quarrel and called the appt off. S called me, wanted to meet me, but in no time told me again that she would again meet her bf to go to the bridal studio again. It was, to me, like an action to prove that she wants to fulfil the wedding promise. I replied her that i hope their quarrel would subside when they meet, and let me know again if she wants to meet me after that, though it would not be very possible because her bf would definitely question her. </span><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;">A few things are clear: she is leaving, she wants to stay committed to her wedding, she likes me alot, she wants to be with me but she could not. </span><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;">Many things are unclear: will this be temporary, do we want this to be temporary, how will this pan out, is she ready to commit to this for the rest of her life, will she be happy. On my part, when i see my gf in 1.5 month's time, how will i feel? what do i exactly want? Even if i know what i want, what can i do? I would want to remain committed to my gf. She is really an awesome girl. But what if my feelings grow stronger by the day?

              colleague, S, who was already in the project. Things were very
              professional and I was very serious in my work. S, as i learnt when
              i came into the office, will be getting married in about a year's
              time and it was already known to the whole office back
              then.</span><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> <br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> <span style="font-family: Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> I had totally no imagination or liking for S at all, because i am
              already attached and she is already going to marry her bf of 2
              years, J. However, I must admit that S is attractive and she is
              very serious in whatever work she is doing. Our working level
              relationship were pretty much the norm for the first 5 months,
              except that around the 3rd-5th months, we did start to chat a
              little bit, sidetrack abit from work during work conversations in
              whatsapp or email. But there were still no signs of flirting at
              all. Pure chit chatting with a colleague - friend. Along the way, S
              was busy preparing her new home, her wedding, and work. I, on the
              other hand, was basically work, and occasionally skype sessions
              with my gf, W.</span><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> <br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> <br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The

              left the room except for S and I, S told me that she was going to
              tender her resignation soon. I was in a state of shock, which later
              turned into disappointment. We stayed behind in the meeting room.
              We talked, I remained cool, and I asked her the usual questions
              like why did she want to quit, going to where, when, and so on.
              More importantly, I asked her to reconsider it because I would like
              her to stay, and I couldnt bear to see her go as I felt we were
              just in the beginning of the making of a good working tag team. I
              felt upset at that time, but I didnt show. She didnt tell me any
              reasons for wanting to quit, and the place where she is going too.
              We basically ended off with no conclusion.</span><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> <br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> <span style="font-family: Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> For the next few days, I would try to persuade her to stay, as I
              realised as the days go by that I cant bear to see her go. At
              first, I thought it was because of the high turnover rate in the
              office (around 5-6 ppl had left during my short time there), but I
              realised that I really enjoy working with her and the understanding
              we had in work.</span><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> <br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> <span style="font-family: Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> S did tell me that she would see first, but she already had an
              offer in another office. Somehow, this topic faded away for around
              2 weeks after this, because of the hectic workload we had. What
              happened during these 2 weeks besides work was instead a dinner out
              together, and a series of unexpected events:</span><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> <br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> <br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Attraction</strong></span><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> <br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> <span style="font-family: Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> The dinner was due to my request. Sometimes when u know a person is
              leaving you start to be more appreciative. In my case, I tried to
              use such opportunities to try to talk S round. What started off
              pretty simple ended with a slow walk out to the main road and at
              that time, both of us felt something.. attraction.</span><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> <br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> <span style="font-family: Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> The other event that happened was on april fools' day. Again, we
              worked late. The whole office only had the 2 of us left. We were
              looking on my computer and half discussing work, half chit
              chatting, when suddenly she asked: 'can i kiss u'? To be honest, I
              was used to her harmless tricks and antics, so i was wary. I didnt
              think that she was really going to kiss me. But i sat still. She
              came closer.. until her lips were 3cm from mine. True enough, she
              suddenly pulled back and said 'bluff u!' and returned to her
              seat.</span><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> <br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> <span style="font-family: Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> I was not surprised really, and didnt asked anything immediately
              after, and continued doing my work. We finally got our work done at
              around 2am, and were walking out the office and switching off the
              lights. It was then that I casually asked: 'u really were joking
              about kissing me huh? Can joke about this kind of thing one huh?' S
              replied: 'i am serious'. I realised she must have felt i thought
              she was joking or not taking her seriously. In that 1 moment, I
              moved my face closer, saw her..S got suddenly nervous and eyes were
              flustering. I moved until my lips touched hers. for 3 seconds. then
              i pulled back, and we left the office and for home
              separately.</span><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> <br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> <span style="font-family: Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> The next day was the same. We worked till late. Only that this
              time, we were abit shy and more friendly to each other than before.
              As we left the office together, reached downstairs (which was a
              shopping mall), i was prepared to go to the taxi stand with her and
              go home. But she asked: 'Can we walk around for a while?' I agreed,
              and we just walked for a bit. We came to this spiral stairs that we
              had never went up before and talked about the stairs. Then we
              decided to explore what was upstairs. We locked lips the second
              time up the spiral stairs. This time, it was longer, and she asked
              if she could hug me. And we hugged. The night when I was going
              home, in the taxi, I thought: 'this is going to be complicated and
              get serious'. I kept thinking about my gf, W, but S kept hovering
              at the back of my mind. Subsequently, things became more ai4 mei4
              and beneath the work we shared, we began to share many other
              things, like breakfasts, dinners, jokes, and
              chats.</span><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> <br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> <br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Shocked</strong></span><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> <br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> <span style="font-family: Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> Until one day, when I was in boss' office and discussing about
              work, boss suddenly told me: 'do u know S tendered her resignation
              yesterday?' I was in a state of shock. I tried very hard to
              maintain composure, and finished the discussion. After which, I
              pulled S to outside the office, and asked her about it. We decided
              to talk about it after work.</span><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> <br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> <span style="font-family: Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> The talk after work that day was emotional. I kept emphasising how
              much I would like her to stay. Only that this time I suddenly
              wasn't sure why I was asking her to stay. Was it because I really
              need her in the project, or want to develop the budding working
              chemistry we have so perhaps in future we can become partners of
              our own business, or because I realised I really couldn't bear to
              see her go? Perhaps it is all. I teared. What she told me kind of
              surprised me but it was something that I had thought before. She
              said part of the reason was me. She could not focus on her work and
              her bf. She realised that even when she was with her bf, she kept
              thinking of me. She knew this would get her into trouble. She had
              to leave. Her other reason was work-related. After much talk,
              eventually, the conclusion that night was she would reconsider her
              resignation. Something which gave me hope but I knew subconsciously
              that she had made up her mind and i was merely delaying the
              formality. The main point from me for her decision to 'reconsider'
              was that I would prove to her that I would not be a negative
              distraction to her. Instead, I would become a positive distraction
              and try to motivate her to conc on her work and her bf. In a way,
              it was like saying I would be someone who will toe my line and try
              to make her life happier from a distance.</span><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> <br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> <span style="font-family: Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> Eventually, she told me she really did not want to sink deeper and
              would stick by her decision. I still tried for a few days more but
              to no avail. I was disappointed and upset.</span><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> <br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> <br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>About S's bf,
              J</strong></span><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> <br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> <span style="font-family: Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> All this while, she told me alot about her bf of 2 years, J. J was
              someone who gets suspicious easily, and he would keep calling S and
              ask her where she is, what she is doing, when is she going back,
              why, how, etc. S said she found it annoying. S also said that when
              J proposed to her overseas last year, she really did not want to
              agree because she didnt feel prepared at all. But looking at J, who
              knelt down and looked so disappointed, she relented. When I heard
              about all these, I felt I had 2 sides of me: a devil side and an
              angel side. And I have done both. I told her that it was obvious
              that she isnt happy and her feelings for him are not strong enough.
              She also said that J likes her more than she likes him. I told her
              that supposedly if she finds that i am more suitable one day, will
              she give up the wedding plans and chase her happiness? She said she
              cannot afford to lose everything. It would be too much of a risk.
              And I am attached. I knew I should not bring this up at all. The
              other side of me, the angelic side, would tell her that she has to
              think carefully before committing, for this is a decision which
              will impact the rest of her life. I told her that if she indeed
              realise that someone else is more suitable one day, and this
              feeling gets so strong until she believes in it, she should follow
              her heart and do it. But i made it clear that it must be from her
              and she must be clear about it. It cannot come from that someone,
              or from me. And if she manages to stay committed and learn to
              appreciate the good of her bf and grow old with him, I would give
              her my blessings too. When I said that, I started to become unsure
              if I was saying that because I want her to be happy and not make
              the wrong decision, or because I want her.</span><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> <br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> <span style="font-family: Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> but looking at her, i knew she is in a huge dilemma. she isnt happy
              at all. I received 2 missed calls from her at 2.30am one night but
              i was asleep. I called her the next morning, and she told me that
              she had actually wanted to tell me the previous night that she
              wanted to cancel the wedding. but she said she was relieved i did
              not pick it up. what could i say. i could only

              tried, i realised she was very determined. I grew to accept it and
              thought about what it would be after she left. On the working
              front, the project will be left to me alone. I felt alittle daunted
              and empty inside. This project was the project which S fought so
              hard for, and it was still in the beginning stages. I felt upset
              that S is giving it up. Many a times, when i was taking a break
              from office and went downstairs for a short puff, i became
              emotional at the thought of it. I even toyed with the idea of
              quitting, because i knew things will never be the same again. I
              wondered if S and me will stop contacting. S did tell me that her
              leaving would be best for both of us, given that both of us have
              own partners, and if she leave, things will become temporal
              suffering. Feelings will fade, or so she said. I told her that what
              if feelings wont fade? And if it will fade, it will also fade if
              she stays. If it won't fade, it will not fade no matter where she
              goes. I could not control myself and said all these, knowing i have
              a gf who is at overseas.</span><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> <br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> <span style="font-family: Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> I did not feel well one day and went on MC.

              deep down, i knew i am not happy. I also had to grapple with the

              if we could spend time together on fri after work instead. she
              actually put her trip off. i wrapped up my work, and went
              downstairs where she was waiting for me. I asked her, so how should
              we spend the night? she told me she would bring me somewhere. she
              had booked a room. For the first time and night, we didnt talk much
              about her staying/leaving. i began to tell her that she has become
              more of a regular feature in my mind. we mostly talked about her
              needing to commit and stick to her wedding. she hugged me and
              kissed me. she was in a struggle. and i reciprocated. and we spent
              the night together. In a room.</span><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> <br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> <br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>matters of the

              feelings rule further it would cause us both lots of trouble. She
              said that her bf is already suspecting something, and they have
              been quarreling over all kinds of things. They were supposed to go
              choose gowns in the bridal studio, but they had a quarrel and
              called the appt off. S called me, wanted to meet me, but in no time
              told me again that she would again meet her bf to go to the bridal
              studio again. It was, to me, like an action to prove that she wants
              to fulfil the wedding promise. I replied her that i hope their
              quarrel would subside when they meet, and let me know again if she
              wants to meet me after that, though it would not be very possible
              because her bf would definitely question
              her. </span><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> <br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> <span style="font-family: Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> A few things are clear: she is leaving, she wants to stay committed

              be temporary, how will this pan out, is she ready to commit to this
              for the rest of her life, will she be happy. On my part, when i see
              my gf in 1.5 month's time, how will i feel? what do i exactly want?
              Even if i know what i want, what can i do? I would want to remain
              committed to my gf. She is really an awesome girl. But what if my
              feelings grow stronger by the day? This is not something within my

                  lovely gf, W, who is currently studying and away from S'pore for 8
                  mths. I am now 6 mths into my first job upon graduation. The story

                  colleague, S, who was already in the project. Things were very
                  professional and I was very serious in my work. S, as i learnt when
                  i came into the office, will be getting married in about a year's
                  time and it was already known to the whole office back
                  then.</span><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> <br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> <span style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> I had totally no imagination or liking for S at all, because i am
                  already attached and she is already going to marry her bf of 2
                  years, J. However, I must admit that S is attractive and she is
                  very serious in whatever work she is doing. Our working level
                  relationship were pretty much the norm for the first 5 months,
                  except that around the 3rd-5th months, we did start to chat a
                  little bit, sidetrack abit from work during work conversations in
                  whatsapp or email. But there were still no signs of flirting at
                  all. Pure chit chatting with a colleague - friend. Along the way, S
                  was busy preparing her new home, her wedding, and work. I, on the
                  other hand, was basically work, and occasionally skype sessions
                  with my gf, W.</span><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> <br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> <br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The

                  left the room except for S and I, S told me that she was going to
                  tender her resignation soon. I was in a state of shock, which later
                  turned into disappointment. We stayed behind in the meeting room.
                  We talked, I remained cool, and I asked her the usual questions
                  like why did she want to quit, going to where, when, and so on.
                  More importantly, I asked her to reconsider it because I would like
                  her to stay, and I couldnt bear to see her go as I felt we were
                  just in the beginning of the making of a good working tag team. I
                  felt upset at that time, but I didnt show. She didnt tell me any
                  reasons for wanting to quit, and the place where she is going too.
                  We basically ended off with no conclusion.</span><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> <br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> <span style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> For the next few days, I would try to persuade her to stay, as I
                  realised as the days go by that I cant bear to see her go. At
                  first, I thought it was because of the high turnover rate in the
                  office (around 5-6 ppl had left during my short time there), but I
                  realised that I really enjoy working with her and the understanding
                  we had in work.</span><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> <br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> <span style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> S did tell me that she would see first, but she already had an
                  offer in another office. Somehow, this topic faded away for around
                  2 weeks after this, because of the hectic workload we had. What
                  happened during these 2 weeks besides work was instead a dinner out
                  together, and a series of unexpected events:</span><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> <br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> <br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Attraction</strong></span><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> <br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> <span style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> The dinner was due to my request. Sometimes when u know a person is
                  leaving you start to be more appreciative. In my case, I tried to
                  use such opportunities to try to talk S round. What started off
                  pretty simple ended with a slow walk out to the main road and at
                  that time, both of us felt something.. attraction.</span><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> <br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> <span style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> The other event that happened was on april fools' day. Again, we
                  worked late. The whole office only had the 2 of us left. We were
                  looking on my computer and half discussing work, half chit
                  chatting, when suddenly she asked: 'can i kiss u'? To be honest, I
                  was used to her harmless tricks and antics, so i was wary. I didnt
                  think that she was really going to kiss me. But i sat still. She
                  came closer.. until her lips were 3cm from mine. True enough, she
                  suddenly pulled back and said 'bluff u!' and returned to her
                  seat.</span><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> <br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> <span style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> I was not surprised really, and didnt asked anything immediately
                  after, and continued doing my work. We finally got our work done at
                  around 2am, and were walking out the office and switching off the
                  lights. It was then that I casually asked: 'u really were joking
                  about kissing me huh? Can joke about this kind of thing one huh?' S
                  replied: 'i am serious'. I realised she must have felt i thought
                  she was joking or not taking her seriously. In that 1 moment, I
                  moved my face closer, saw her..S got suddenly nervous and eyes were
                  flustering. I moved until my lips touched hers. for 3 seconds. then
                  i pulled back, and we left the office and for home
                  separately.</span><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> <br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> <span style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> The next day was the same. We worked till late. Only that this
                  time, we were abit shy and more friendly to each other than before.
                  As we left the office together, reached downstairs (which was a
                  shopping mall), i was prepared to go to the taxi stand with her and
                  go home. But she asked: 'Can we walk around for a while?' I agreed,
                  and we just walked for a bit. We came to this spiral stairs that we
                  had never went up before and talked about the stairs. Then we
                  decided to explore what was upstairs. We locked lips the second
                  time up the spiral stairs. This time, it was longer, and she asked
                  if she could hug me. And we hugged. The night when I was going
                  home, in the taxi, I thought: 'this is going to be complicated and
                  get serious'. I kept thinking about my gf, W, but S kept hovering
                  at the back of my mind. Subsequently, things became more ai4 mei4
                  and beneath the work we shared, we began to share many other
                  things, like breakfasts, dinners, jokes, and
                  chats.</span><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> <br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> <br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Shocked</strong></span><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> <br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> <span style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> Until one day, when I was in boss' office and discussing about
                  work, boss suddenly told me: 'do u know S tendered her resignation
                  yesterday?' I was in a state of shock. I tried very hard to
                  maintain composure, and finished the discussion. After which, I
                  pulled S to outside the office, and asked her about it. We decided
                  to talk about it after work.</span><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> <br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> <span style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> The talk after work that day was emotional. I kept emphasising how
                  much I would like her to stay. Only that this time I suddenly
                  wasn't sure why I was asking her to stay. Was it because I really
                  need her in the project, or want to develop the budding working
                  chemistry we have so perhaps in future we can become partners of
                  our own business, or because I realised I really couldn't bear to
                  see her go? Perhaps it is all. I teared. What she told me kind of
                  surprised me but it was something that I had thought before. She
                  said part of the reason was me. She could not focus on her work and
                  her bf. She realised that even when she was with her bf, she kept
                  thinking of me. She knew this would get her into trouble. She had
                  to leave. Her other reason was work-related. After much talk,
                  eventually, the conclusion that night was she would reconsider her
                  resignation. Something which gave me hope but I knew subconsciously
                  that she had made up her mind and i was merely delaying the
                  formality. The main point from me for her decision to 'reconsider'
                  was that I would prove to her that I would not be a negative
                  distraction to her. Instead, I would become a positive distraction
                  and try to motivate her to conc on her work and her bf. In a way,
                  it was like saying I would be someone who will toe my line and try
                  to make her life happier from a distance.</span><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> <br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> <span style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> Eventually, she told me she really did not want to sink deeper and
                  would stick by her decision. I still tried for a few days more but
                  to no avail. I was disappointed and upset.</span><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> <br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> <br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>About S's bf,

J was
                  someone who gets suspicious easily, and he would keep calling S and
                  ask her where she is, what she is doing, when is she going back,
                  why, how, etc. S said she found it annoying. S also said that when
                  J proposed to her overseas last year, she really did not want to
                  agree because she didnt feel prepared at all. But looking at J, who
                  knelt down and looked so disappointed, she relented. When I heard
                  about all these, I felt I had 2 sides of me: a devil side and an
                  angel side. And I have done both. I told her that it was obvious
                  that she isnt happy and her feelings for him are not strong enough.
                  She also said that J likes her more than she likes him. I told her
                  that supposedly if she finds that i am more suitable one day, will
                  she give up the wedding plans and chase her happiness? She said she
                  cannot afford to lose everything. It would be too much of a risk.
                  And I am attached. I knew I should not bring this up at all. The
                  other side of me, the angelic side, would tell her that she has to
                  think carefully before committing, for this is a decision which
                  will impact the rest of her life. I told her that if she indeed
                  realise that someone else is more suitable one day, and this
                  feeling gets so strong until she believes in it, she should follow
                  her heart and do it. But i made it clear that it must be from her
                  and she must be clear about it. It cannot come from that someone,
                  or from me. And if she manages to stay committed and learn to
                  appreciate the good of her bf and grow old with him, I would give
                  her my blessings too. When I said that, I started to become unsure
                  if I was saying that because I want her to be happy and not make
                  the wrong decision, or because I want her.</span><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> <br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> <span style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> but looking at her, i knew she is in a huge dilemma. she isnt happy
                  at all. I received 2 missed calls from her at 2.30am one night but
                  i was asleep. I called her the next morning, and she told me that
                  she had actually wanted to tell me the previous night that she
                  wanted to cancel the wedding. but she said she was relieved i did
                  not pick it up. what could i say. i could only

                  tried, i realised she was very determined. I grew to accept it and
                  thought about what it would be after she left. On the working
                  front, the project will be left to me alone. I felt alittle daunted
                  and empty inside. This project was the project which S fought so
                  hard for, and it was still in the beginning stages. I felt upset
                  that S is giving it up. Many a times, when i was taking a break
                  from office and went downstairs for a short puff, i became
                  emotional at the thought of it. I even toyed with the idea of
                  quitting, because i knew things will never be the same again. I
                  wondered if S and me will stop contacting. S did tell me that her
                  leaving would be best for both of us, given that both of us have
                  own partners, and if she leave, things will become temporal
                  suffering. Feelings will fade, or so she said. I told her that what
                  if feelings wont fade? And if it will fade, it will also fade if
                  she stays. If it won't fade, it will not fade no matter where she
                  goes. I could not control myself and said all these, knowing i have
                  a gf who is at overseas.</span><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> <br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> <span style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> I did not feel well one day and went on MC.

She had difficulties
                  in focusing on work and bf, she is preparing for handover, for a
                  transitioning period, she is preparing for her wedding, she is
                  handling her bf's questioning of where she is going, what she is
                  doing when she was with me, and she is distracted by me. I had
                  tried and tried to make her stay, i had tried to comfort her, make
                  her happier, make her stay focused and giving her my wishes. But
                  deep down, i knew i am not happy. I also had to grapple with the
                  prospect of not having her around as a working partner in office. I
                  was contemplating leaving, too.</span><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> <br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> <span style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> S was supposed to go on a short trip over the fri/sat weekend with
                  a few colleagues. On the friday, i asked if I can spend time
                  together with her on sat night, at her home or somewhere else. I
                  just wanted to spend time with her. S said that it wasn't
                  appropriate for me to go to her home..and I knew I should not ask
                  her that. In the end, S told her colleagues that she had smth on
                  and would not be going to the trip and called me instead. She asked
                  if we could spend time together on fri after work instead. she
                  actually put her trip off. i wrapped up my work, and went
                  downstairs where she was waiting for me. I asked her, so how should
                  we spend the night? she told me she would bring me somewhere. she
                  had booked a room. For the first time and night, we didnt talk much
                  about her staying/leaving. i began to tell her that she has become
                  more of a regular feature in my mind. we mostly talked about her
                  needing to commit and stick to her wedding. she hugged me and
                  kissed me. she was in a struggle. and i reciprocated. and we spent
                  the night together. In a room.</span><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> <br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> <br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>matters of the

                  feelings rule further it would cause us both lots of trouble. She
                  said that her bf is already suspecting something, and they have
                  been quarreling over all kinds of things. They were supposed to go
                  choose gowns in the bridal studio, but they had a quarrel and
                  called the appt off. S called me, wanted to meet me, but in no time
                  told me again that she would again meet her bf to go to the bridal
                  studio again. It was, to me, like an action to prove that she wants
                  to fulfil the wedding promise. I replied her that i hope their
                  quarrel would subside when they meet, and let me know again if she
                  wants to meet me after that, though it would not be very possible
                  because her bf would definitely question
                  her. </span><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> <br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> <span style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> A few things are clear: she is leaving, she wants to stay committed
                  to her wedding, she likes me alot, she wants to be with me but she
                  could not. </span><br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> <br style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> <span style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px; background-color: #f4f8fb;"> Many things are unclear: will this be temporary, do we want this to
                  be temporary, how will this pan out, is she ready to commit to this
                  for the rest of her life, will she be happy. On my part, when i see
                  my gf in 1.5 month's time, how will i feel? what do i exactly want?
                  Even if i know what i want, what can i do? I would want to remain
                  committed to my gf. She is really an awesome girl. But what if my
                  feelings grow stronger by the day? This is not something within my

              <p>Regardless of which angle you are viewing, technically, both of you have betrayed your respective partner. You are cheating on emotional and physical plane dualistically - reinforcing each aspect in a tight model (e.g. the more you are emotionally attached to her, the more you feel that need to be around her vice versa). This is the most arduous form of betrayal to reverse. I won't be dealing with the morality of this issue, but what probably holds true is that the decay in your own relationship will rapidly spread and this effect is gangrenous. </p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Each conscious attempt to proceed forward with her is an indication and permission for the rot to gnaw at your current relationship inwardly.

              <p><img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"> You want to stay committed to your gf, but you do not seem to want to let S go. Sounds like an ideal plan - but in reality, this is the true source of your misery. The misery of infidelity lies with the perpetual feeding of ambivalence to your situation. You cannot make a decision by taking the good of two separate decisions and call it a choice and hoping to discard the negative consequence of your option. How good would life be for me if I could have money and not work for it - so in the same way, how good would life be for you if you could have two girls and keep it that way?</p>
              <p>Being dysfunctional would be the likely outcome. This will persist until you come in terms with the fact that you have to deal with each relationship separately.<span style="line-height: 1.231;">There is no way that you could prevent a hurt from happening at this juncture. Surely, someone in the picture would be devastated; the only difference is how contagious and intense this pain would manifest itself to the parties involved. </span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Although she claims that she wants to 'do the right thing', the poor foundation of her own relationship would not allow her reasonable chance to 'carry on life as per normal'. In fact, the catalysis has already transformed the landscape of her relationship. It is likely that the long hours of work she has invested and the robust passion she has for you is merely a facade for the long suppressed avoidant-coping stance used to deal with her dysfunctional relationship. </span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Hence the passion may not necessarily be love, but a form of twisted courage to get out of the relationship she is unhappy with. This is especially true for those that appears to be meek in a power-unbalanced relationship, waiting for the condition to revote. </span></p>
              <p>You presented the condition. Hence the revolution will take place (or has it already begin?)  <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="icon_exclaim.gif"></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">***</span></p>
              <p><img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"> <span style="line-height: 1.231;">When you measure love as an output and neglect the process, this is where most people end up with a product totally not what they originally thought it would look like. The main driving force of love is but a collection of cosmic lessons waiting to be taught. The process of learning about love is what love will teach in one's lifetime. It's not about the efficient output that we fancy and pray that the soup would somehow taste good if we put all the components together (e.g. Get HDB, propose, wedding dinner, get married, have babies, etc). If she accepts the marriage proposal through placating and avoids raising issues concerning her own love future because she does not know how to communicate her own needs, then she will pay for the consequence (with interest) until the time when she learns to take responsibility of her choice and by working on those two aspects.  </span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">The point I am driving is that if she needs the condition of a divorce to 'graduate' from this lesson, then it will eventually happen. </span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">You might be a 'course material' - not necessarily the model answer. </span><img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="icon_idea.gif"></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">***</span></p>
              <p><img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"> <span style="line-height: 1.231;">This circumstance presents good opportunity to review your relationship. What is happening 'outside' the relationship may have malicious factors, but you have to decide if your current relationship is something that you still want to embrace. If so, this choice actually comes with a commitment to ensure its longevity.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">You cannot claim to keep it, but yet still proceed with S. </span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Similarly, if you have decided that you want to drop your current relationship, then it also comes with a commitment of not 'closing the door, but leaving the windows open'. That will only serve to prolong your own suffering.</span></p>
              <p>Being brutally honest with yourself and having deep sense of awareness will help you to decide if what you are doing is but an excuse to keep status quo. Don't get me wrong, surely you can keep status quo since it holds the best of both world. However, this is not sustainable and will collapse into disequilibrium. </p>
              <p>Then, you will be paying for the consequence of your choice. <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="icon_idea.gif"></p>

              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333015441895px; line-height: 10.666666984558105px;">Being dysfunctional would be the likely outcome. This will persist until you come in terms with the fact that you have to deal with each relationship separately.<span style="line-height: 1.231;">There is no way that you could prevent a hurt from happening at this juncture. Surely, someone in the picture would be devastated; the only difference is how contagious and intense this pain would manifest itself to the parties involved. </span></p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333015441895px; line-height: 10.666666984558105px;"><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Although she claims that she wants to 'do the right thing', the poor foundation of her own relationship would not allow her reasonable chance to 'carry on life as per normal'. In fact, the catalysis has already transformed the landscape of her relationship. It is likely that the long hours of work she has invested and the robust passion she has for you is merely a facade for the long suppressed avoidant-coping stance used to deal with her dysfunctional relationship.</span></p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333015441895px; line-height: 10.666666984558105px;"><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Hence the passion may not necessarily be love, but a form of twisted courage to get out of the relationship she is unhappy with. This is especially true for those that appears to be meek in a power-unbalanced relationship, waiting for the condition to revote. </span></p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333015441895px; line-height: 10.666666984558105px;">You presented the condition. Hence the revolution will take place (or has it already begin?)  <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="icon_exclaim.gif"></p>

The main driving force of love is but a collection of cosmic lessons waiting to be taught. The process of learning about love is what love will teach in one's lifetime. It's not about the efficient output that we fancy and pray that the soup would somehow taste good if we put all the components together (e.g. Get HDB, propose, wedding dinner, get married, have babies, etc). If she accepts the marriage proposal through placating and avoids raising issues concerning her own love future because she does not know how to communicate her own needs, then she will pay for the consequence (with interest) until the time when she learns to take responsibility of her choice and by working on those two aspects.  </span></p>

What is happening 'outside' the relationship may have malicious factors, but you have to decide if your current relationship is something that you still want to embrace.

              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333015441895px; line-height: 10.666666984558105px;"><span style="line-height: 1.231;">You cannot claim to keep it, but yet still proceed with S.</span></p>

Don't get me wrong, surely you can keep status quo since it holds the best of both world. However, this is not sustainable and will collapse into disequilibrium. </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Yunhaier, thank you for your reply. Your reply is very insightful and thought-provoking.</p>
              <p>It has been exactly one month since this mis-step happened. and one month later, i guess it is all over, hopefully.</p>
              <p>1) Guilt</p>
              <p>Yes, this past month had alot of happy moments with S, but there are also lots of guilt and heavy baggage that came with it. The state of having 2 girls at 1 time is very unbearable. On the one hand, the intense sense of guilt that keep oozing out from my heart. On the other, the constant worry that i / we would be found out, no matter wad we do, be it talking in office, walking on the streets, etc. THis feeling is unsustainable and at times, driving me crazy. recently, i am watching a taiwanese drama about marriage and 3rd parties. can totally relate to the feelings portrayed in the drama. Even the progression phases are the same. From sweet innocent Ai4 mei4, to managing both parties, to unbearable feelings to breakdowns. Its as though i am living the drama.</p>
              <p>2) 'Twisted courage to get out of her relationship'</p>
              <p>U are right, but not totally on this. It is very true that S is unhappy in this relationship w her bf. But she kept emphasising that there is no turning back for her. The passion or liking she has for me might or might not give her a fleeting moment of courage to leave her bf. But 2 things held true, and probably still will: if she will indeed leave, it will not b me as the reason (at the very least, i cannot be directly involved); and she knew she cannot do this.</p>
              <p>3) about her impending marriage as an output.. </p>
              <p>Again, i feel u r right. But i can only hope that she and her bf will end up better in time to come. she said to me before, she will be happy. she can make things better and things will be back to normal and she can focus on her bf. Will that make her happy? It's no longer about me anymore.</p>
              <p>4) about my gf.</p>
              <p>I am very relieved that there are still alot of spark between us. at least over long distance calls and video chats. Some recent events woke me up and i realised that its my gf whom i really want to be with. i took more initiative to video call her, to tell her how much i miss her (i really do, even more so after these events), even if once in a while i may have a split thought on whether i miss my gf so much is because i feel lonely that S is 'gone' or not. I would like to think its not, it's more of i really want to cherish my gf. A fundamental question, will think about this when things are more cooled down.</p>
              <p>5) Some recent event..</p>
              <p>Some recent event changed the entire face of this relationship between S and me. i would prefer not to go into details, but in summary, it went smth like this:</p>
              <p>S's bf got very suspicious about S and me and he did some drastic measures. S and me got very worried at certain points, worried that her bf might jeopardise everything and tell whatever he knew / thought to everyone. It is a truth that S and me have betrayed our respective partners emotionally and physically. But it is really not true that we will snatch each other away from our partners. We both agree that we cannot be each other's reason for leaving our partners should the day comes. and S also said she will see through her marriage. So if her bf manages to find something, he would find the truth (about the liking part) and might link it to thinking that i am around to snatch S away from him. (which is not true). But come to think of it, wadever its true or not, doesn't matter anymore. I have sinned, and that's a fact.</p>
              <p>So we got very worried, and in particular, me. Because i did not want to jeopardise everything and hearing S's bf's threats, about wanting to go to my gf, family and friends and tell her about me, made me very uneasy. Maybe its my cowardice, or maybe its the moment that made me think why i was in such a situation. I had to protect the people around me and not let them come to hurt. (maybe some of u may feel instead that i am protecting myself, but i really did not want anybody to be hurt, including S and her bf).</p>
              <p>So i decided, and made up my choice. </p>
              <p>S was very, very disappointed and upset and she has since returned to her bf, even though her bf did something very very drastic which disgusted her and she said she would give him one last chance. S is avoiding me now.</p>
              <p>THis is what had panned out. One of my friend told me that it is considered a better ending already. still, a tinge of sadness remains, seeing how S got so upset and resigned herself to the decision she made before. i still have feelings for S, but i know i cannot have hers. If i have both, my sufferings will only be more and prolonged. But for S, i don't know when i will be able to get over her.</p>

              <p>S itself is also a willing party in this betrayal of r/s... so it is not entirely TS's fault, both parties have to share part of the blame.</p>
              <p>No need to stay single TS, just learn from this and not have it happen again anymore.</p>

              <p>So i decided, and made up my choice. </p>
              <p>S was very, very disappointed and upset and she has since
                          returned to her bf, even though her bf did something very very
                          drastic which disgusted her and she said she would give him one
                          last chance. S is avoiding me now.</p>
              <p>THis is what had panned out. One of my friend told me that it is
                          considered a better ending already. still, a tinge of sadness
                          remains, seeing how S got so upset and resigned herself to the
                          decision she made before. i still have feelings for S, but i know i
                          cannot have hers. If i have both, my sufferings will only be more
                          and prolonged. But for S, i don't know when i will be able to get
                          over her.</p>

              <p><img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"> In love, there are two classic dimensions which are often in state of conflicts or confusion: one ruled by reasons and the other governed by emotions. Hence, it is rather a common pattern for one to 'say one thing and feel another'. I will quote your own personal experience: similarly, you have decided to do what is the 'best' for your situation - essentially the lesser of the two evils - but that does not mean that you remain unscathed from the choice you made. </p>
              <p>Why would I say this? <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="icon_question.gif"></p>
              <p>If reason had the stronger hold on her, then it makes no sense for her to feel 'disappointed or upset' - since this choice is rationally efficient (having her needs fulfilled before she pays the full cost of infidelity) and it is supposedly the outcome that both of you have expected and anticipated. Obviously, the presence of disappointment would naturally mean that there must be an unspoken expectation on her part, likely to be hidden deeper in her psyche, away from prying eyes.</p>
              <p>Hence, I would still maintain the point that she is waiting for 'someone' to rescue her from the pits of hell.</p>
              <p>Her unfortunate revelation is that eventually she figured that you are not the armored knight she is hoping you would evolve to be - descending into the pits to face the demons. Facing the morality of your own fears and actions, she has nothing other than full acceptance in the brute reality of your incontestable choice: simply described as insufficient amount of love for you to do anything beyond this point for the relationship.</p>
              <p>There is nothing to be ignominious about; it's just a matter of the kind of cosmic lessons desired to be taught by love through the presence of this circumstances. You figured out what you want to do and how this episode has revealed about your relationship with yourself and your gf. Great.</p>
              <p>In time to come, she would also figure out something critical, relative to her experience. </p>
              <p>The last chance she is giving him appears more like a last chance she is giving herself. The point is that without catalysis, the likelihood of her bf remaining the way he is stands high. Hence, whatever feeble chance she has decided to give without communication and negotiation of needs will likely to fail.</p>
              <p>But that's not for you to manage.</p>
              <p>Unless you have decided to unsheathe your sword and plunge into hell gloriously.</p>
              <p>And that's probably another topic for another day. <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="icon_idea.gif"></p>

              <p>Do not diminish his guilt by blaming the other party.</p>
              <p>Nobody points a gun at his head , nor stuck a knife at his throat.</p>
              <p>The choices he made was solely his own doing.</p>
              <p>He is responsible for his actions and how his choices affects others close to him.</p>

              <p>The guilt is his alone to bear. And will deeply affect his relationship with his current girlfriend.</p>
