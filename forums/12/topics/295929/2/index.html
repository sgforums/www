I do wat u do also .... WE ONLY WORK FOR 5$ per Hr u think it is worth?</div></blockquote>Of course I dun think your job is easy. I'm sure you do things beyond my imagination. I'm sure u even solve the management problems. I'm sure u had countless injuries on your body that is painful. I'm sure you only work for $5 an hour which is much too low for you.<br><br>But at least you are employed.<br><br>You dun have to depend on this $5/hr to survive.<br><br>You dun have to worry about what a child can buy for a bite for recess at school.<br><br>You dun have to worry for a child's self esteem when he got laughed at and bullied by his classmates just because his mum couldn't have time from work to iron his uniform and couldn't afford to replace his hand-me-down school shoes, bags, and socks.<br><br>You have internet access to post and complain to us. A child have to share his bed with 3 siblings, because their whole family of 6 had to squeeze into one room. Their landlord was gracious to waive their already extremely low monthly rent of $70 per month for 3 mths.<br><br>You dun have to worry about the future. You know this job is now forever. A child dun even know if he can afford to take MRT to school without going hungry for a week during recess, if he misses his school bus. Not that he can buy a lot of things to eat with his $2 a week pocket money.<br><br>I know people working for 12 hours a day, 6 days a week, carrying rocks, bricks, heavy stacks of stuff to support a family. When I say 12 hours, i meant 12 hours. It does not include their break time. If u wanna take 1 hour break, then total time will be 13 hours. And they are paid $650/mth with 1 lunch of 1 meat 1 vege with rice per work day.<br><br>I know people who work 6.5 days a week earning $400 per month.<br><br>Hi TS. I'm almost sure you have a hp. I too feel for you that you had been treated unfairly and exploited beyond what you are required to. But pls imagine how those families/people whom I mentioned above feel if they read your post.<br><br>If you can't feel for them, you can PM me. We can take a visit to an org that  help these people. Maybe then you may see something else that you may not, now.</div>

I'm sure you do things beyond my imagination. I'm sure u even solve the management problems. I'm sure u had countless injuries on your body that is painful. I'm sure you only work for $5 an hour which is much too low for you.<br><br>But at least you are employed.<br><br>You dun have to depend on this $5/hr to survive.<br><br>You dun have to worry about what a child can buy for a bite for recess at school.<br><br>You dun have to worry for a child's self esteem when he got laughed at and bullied by his classmates just because his mum couldn't have time from work to iron his uniform and couldn't afford to replace his hand-me-down school shoes, bags, and socks.<br><br>You have internet access to post and complain to us. A child have to share his bed with 3 siblings, because their whole family of 6 had to squeeze into one room. Their landlord was gracious to waive their already extremely low monthly rent of $70 per month for 3 mths.<br><br>You dun have to worry about the future. You know this job is now forever. A child dun even know if he can afford to take MRT to school without going hungry for a week during recess, if he misses his school bus. Not that he can buy a lot of things to eat with his $2 a week pocket money.<br><br>I know people working for 12 hours a day, 6 days a week, carrying rocks, bricks, heavy stacks of stuff to support a family. When I say 12 hours, i meant 12 hours. It does not include their break time. If u wanna take 1 hour break, then total time will be 13 hours. And they are paid $650/mth with 1 lunch of 1 meat 1 vege with rice per work day.<br><br>I know people who work 6.5 days a week earning $400 per month.<br><br>Hi TS. I'm almost sure you have a hp. I too feel for you that you had been treated unfairly and exploited beyond what you are required to. But pls imagine how those families/people whom I mentioned above feel if they read your post.<br><br>If you can't feel for them, you can PM me. We can take a visit to an org that  help these people. Maybe then you may see something else that you may not, now.</div></blockquote>let see if masteryap can do it?<br><br>a job is just a job, they pay for you to work and u got to work.<br>Thats life!<br><br>you want to try what i had in the past?<br><br>Imagine working in construction site condition, seeing your friend kena kill by falling bricks, eating your lunch beside shit which are full of white maggots, pay so low and you wonder why you work, kena scream at by supervisors, manager and boss when is not your fault, going home in mud,dirt and shit all over you 7 days a week.<br><br>Wake up lar kiddio, there are worst jobs out there, at least yours is a job where ypu need not worry if you ever see your family again.<br><br></div>

I would say it's good training - training you to work under pressure and moulding you into a more resilient character to face a harder work environment in your future. Also it helps you to learn to be more understanding, more tolerant as a would be supervisor to your subordinates should you one day come into position and not repeat what your previous supervisor has done to you. But then usually, those like TS who has 'suffered' before will tend to do unto others when they themselves come into power someday. He will naturally return the 'favour' by bullying his subordinates as a form of revenge for what he has gone through before.
