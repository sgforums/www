            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, I'm touching on the topic love. First of all, I would like to enunciate that I'm greatly incited to write this topic and I would like to add that at this point of writing this post, I'm single and my views on love would not change in the present, or in the future if ever I'm attached.<br><br>Talking about love, the topic itself is very general. I guess when I say the word 'love' in front of people, first thing might come into their mind would be boy-girl relationships. And for some people who are sick in their mind, sex would be what they are thinking.<br>And also for the word love, it can be also in many aspects. Such as a person's love for an item. It can be a MP3 player, new TV set, a cellphone and etc. It can also be a love for longing good health, a successful career, be wealthy and etc.<br><br>But right now, I'm touching about relationships. You see, love have its beauty and its ugliness. Its beauty could make you feel the happiest person in the world. And its ugliness might give you the feeling of 'might as well don't live in this world.'<br><br>Let me go to the goodness of love first. There is a saying goes like this: "To loved and be loved is the greatest existence of happiness in the world."<br>How more correct can this citation be? It is actually very simple to understand what it means. Just ask yourself this question. Would you be as happy when you have all the money in the world, but no family, no kins, no spouse to share whatever fame, glory and status you have with you? Or you barely have any money to have 3 meals a day, but you have a wonderful family and kins and a splendid spouse?<br>I believe each of everyone of you reading this post will choose the second choice. For those who are in a relationship right now, and I mean a blossom type. Do you guys enjoy the times you had with your beloved? I believe yes you did. It can be just talking on the phone for hours, or even going together to the movies. I believe every little bit of time you guys spend together, or should I say quality time, you guys would surely savour.<br><br>I know a friend who just really don't mind spending hours sitting in a bus, which the bus would go one round from Ang Mo Kio then Changi Airport, without the bus stopping at a particular interchange, then back to Ang Mo Kio again. Each loop would take at least 1 and a half hour. And he can do it for 2-3 times.<br>I know its very lame to do such things. But you see, with him is the person he loves, as he can sit there, chat, clinch and hug his beloved. Although is only sitting in a bus, but it is being with his beloved that you can do such things like 'playing bus'. And do he enjoy? I asked him this question and boy, yes he do.<br><br>Talking about myself, if ever I got a choice, I won't spend time being with my beloved in a bus. I would rather spend time cuddling and embrace my beloved on the couch, walking barefooted along the beach, watching the sunrise upon the ocean's horizon and many other things, as long as they are quality time spended.<br>For me, I'm not a wild person. Well, its like if a person would ask me would I rather go and play bowling and pool with my beloved. Or spend time with her, lying down side by side at a grass pitch, admiring the stars under the blanket of warmth and love, hand in hand.<br>I would choose the second choice. Therefore, between wild and romantic, I'm more to the romantic to the wild type.<br><br>Nevertheless, let me go to the part which love can bring you sadness and misery.<br>Love can be so cruel. Its misery could deny you of happiness and it could also bring you great pain and despair, making you feeling very dejected, or some depressed.<br><br>I would really like to mention another friend of mine, who because of love, he feels that he barely can find any happiness if can't be with the person he loves.<br>For this, I can't deny that he's wrong. You see, as I said earlier. You can have everything in life, but if you're not with the person you have truly in your heart, your life would be like a jigsaw puzzle, missing a piece of itself.<br>For this friend of mine, till now he's been longing for a girl he loves for 3 years. I really do not know you guys reading this post feel that 3 years is short or a long period of time. But I dare to say that he truly deeply love that girl.<br>As a close of friend of his, I really can see that this girl really makes his life. I can see that every SMSes from that girl, or every phone calls to her could really make his day. Or to put it short, she's his source of happiness.<br><br>I believe that there are thousands of people in this world who are also like him, as happiness has not knock on their door yet. And I really like to add that I really sympathise those people outside there, who are like my friend wooing the stubborn kind of people. And to make it more heinous, obstinate is the word.<br>I really do sympathise my friend. Although he do really love that girl, nothing positive still comes out of it after 3 years. If you guys reading this feels that perhaps this friend of mine love for the girl is not true. I can't say is true or not true. I can only use the point that it has already been 3 years.<br>Because basically, he's not given a chance at all. Not a single chance at all. He has no chance to give and commit what he could to the one he truly loves and I remember him telling me that for now, only the heavens, and himself would know and feel how much he loves that girl. Simply because, he is not given a chance at all to commit and give what he can.<br><br>But sometimes, love can be so weird and funny. As love can also be that you liking a girl in your school, you could only each time see her at your school parade square early in the morning during flag-raising as she's in the next class and she always sits just right in front of your class and seeing her back only could make you feel content for the day.<br>But too bad, you can only see her during flag-raising and also you don't know her and neither she knows you. As I believe, if only they are friends and they know each other, things might go beyond a certain boundary.<br><br>Going to a more serious note, I believe your own education do play a part to determine your future. To think in a long-term view, just ask anyone. Would they rather be together with a person whose job draws a 5 digit sum of money per month? Or be together with a person whose job barely draws around 1-2K only?<br>Okay, you can say my love for Mr/Miss XXX is true love. No matter what, I will always be with him/her forever. But you see, your true love and passion for each other will never die. But do you ever think in the future, how are you going to survive? I'm bringing this up because one of the reasons is because I'm a Singaporean. In Singapore, you can't afford your financial condition to be no good. Because I believe if thats the case, suffering can be the word which can describe your life.<br>Of course, as I said earlier, you can barely have any money to have 3 meals a day, but you have a wonderful family and kins and a splendid spouse and you can still be happy. But life would be very hard you, espically if you live in a place called Singapore.<br><br>Nevertheless, I would like to end this post by saying that in the dictionary, I like the word 'cherish' the most. No matter what are you doing, always cherish things around you no matter whether are they items or people.<br>As I said to many of my friends. For a couple or a marriage to be successful, love, commitment and trust are a must-have in a relationship. As I believe that they are the pillars of a relationship to be able to subtain for a long time, or maybe a lifetime.<br>Without one of the 3 important factors, everything would just crumple down.</div>

You see, as I said earlier. You can have everything in life, but if you're not with the person you have truly in your heart, your life would be like a jigsaw puzzle, missing a piece of itself.<br>For this friend of mine, till now he's been longing for a girl he loves for 3 years.

And to make it more heinous, obstinate is the word.<br>I really do sympathise my friend. Although he do really love that girl, nothing positive still comes out of it after 3 years. If you guys reading this feels that perhaps this friend of mine love for the girl is not true. I can't say is true or not true.

He has no chance to give and commit what he could to the one he truly loves and I remember him telling me that for now, only the heavens, and himself would know and feel how much he loves that girl. Simply because, he is not given a chance at all to commit and give what he can.<br><br><br><br>Nevertheless, I would like to end this post by saying that in the dictionary, I like the word 'cherish' the most. No matter what are you doing, always cherish things around you no matter whether are they items or people.<br>As I said to many of my friends. For a couple or a marriage to be successful, love, commitment and trust are a must-have in a relationship. As I believe that they are the pillars of a relationship to be able to subtain for a long time, or maybe a lifetime.<br>Without one of the 3 important factors, everything would just crumple down.</div></blockquote>I agree with what partly what you said regarding love. Yes, love can be sweet and bitter at the same time.<br><br>Doing something for the person you love, esp when you do not know whether the person returns your feeling or not...you have to do it sincerely. Without expecting anything in return. It doesn't mean that if you have waited for the girl for 3 years or 5 years or even 10 years she will return your love or give you a chance. This is just the fact that everyone has to face. When you give something in the name of love, do it without tis mindset: Oh, I give up so much for her, so she must give me something in return in the end. I know this might sound unfair, but life is that way.<br><br>I said this based on my experience of waiting for someone for 4 years, only to be told that I am just a close friend. But do I regret? Do I blame him for not returning my feelings. No. I just accept that there is no chemistry between us (more like he cannot see a future with me) and move on. Time waits for no one...so one shouldn't hang on to the thinking that the more I give up for someone, the more likely this person is to return the feeling.<br><br>It is not about them not cherishing what you have done for him/her. When you do something for someone, it is called a sacrifice. It is no longer a sacrifice once you think that this person must be forced into giving something back. Of course it would be better if you reserve all these efforts and give them to the right person, and only then you will understand the meaning of how to cherish, and being cherished <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Â¡ÃšTearsofTheMoonÂ¡Ãš:</div><div class="quote_body">Yes, I'm touching on the topic love. First of all, I would like to enunciate that I'm greatly incited to write this topic and I would like to add that at this point of writing this post, I'm single and my views on love would not change in the present, or in the future if ever I'm attached.<br><br>Talking about love, the topic itself is very general. I guess when I say the word 'love' in front of people, first thing might come into their mind would be boy-girl relationships. And for some people who are sick in their mind, sex would be what they are thinking.<br>And also for the word love, it can be also in many aspects. Such as a person's love for an item. It can be a MP3 player, new TV set, a cellphone and etc. It can also be a love for longing good health, a successful career, be wealthy and etc.<br><br>But right now, I'm touching about relationships. You see, love have its beauty and its ugliness. Its beauty could make you feel the happiest person in the world. And its ugliness might give you the feeling of 'might as well don't live in this world.'<br><br>Let me go to the goodness of love first. There is a saying goes like this: "To loved and be loved is the greatest existence of happiness in the world."<br>How more correct can this citation be? It is actually very simple to understand what it means. Just ask yourself this question. Would you be as happy when you have all the money in the world, but no family, no kins, no spouse to share whatever fame, glory and status you have with you? Or you barely have any money to have 3 meals a day, but you have a wonderful family and kins and a splendid spouse?<br>I believe each of everyone of you reading this post will choose the second choice. For those who are in a relationship right now, and I mean a blossom type. Do you guys enjoy the times you had with your beloved? I believe yes you did. It can be just talking on the phone for hours, or even going together to the movies. I believe every little bit of time you guys spend together, or should I say quality time, you guys would surely savour.<br><br>I know a friend who just really don't mind spending hours sitting in a bus, which the bus would go one round from Ang Mo Kio then Changi Airport, without the bus stopping at a particular interchange, then back to Ang Mo Kio again. Each loop would take at least 1 and a half hour. And he can do it for 2-3 times.<br>I know its very lame to do such things. But you see, with him is the person he loves, as he can sit there, chat, clinch and hug his beloved. Although is only sitting in a bus, but it is being with his beloved that you can do such things like 'playing bus'. And do he enjoy? I asked him this question and boy, yes he do.<br><br>Talking about myself, if ever I got a choice, I won't spend time being with my beloved in a bus. I would rather spend time cuddling and embrace my beloved on the couch, walking barefooted along the beach, watching the sunrise upon the ocean's horizon and many other things, as long as they are quality time spended.<br>For me, I'm not a wild person. Well, its like if a person would ask me would I rather go and play bowling and pool with my beloved. Or spend time with her, lying down side by side at a grass pitch, admiring the stars under the blanket of warmth and love, hand in hand.<br>I would choose the second choice. Therefore, between wild and romantic, I'm more to the romantic to the wild type.<br><br>Nevertheless, let me go to the part which love can bring you sadness and misery.<br>Love can be so cruel. Its misery could deny you of happiness and it could also bring you great pain and despair, making you feeling very dejected, or some depressed.<br><br>I would really like to mention another friend of mine, who because of love, he feels that he barely can find any happiness if can't be with the person he loves.<br>For this, I can't deny that he's wrong. You see, as I said earlier. You can have everything in life, but if you're not with the person you have truly in your heart, your life would be like a jigsaw puzzle, missing a piece of itself.<br>For this friend of mine, till now he's been longing for a girl he loves for 3 years. I really do not know you guys reading this post feel that 3 years is short or a long period of time. But I dare to say that he truly deeply love that girl.<br>As a close of friend of his, I really can see that this girl really makes his life. I can see that every SMSes from that girl, or every phone calls to her could really make his day. Or to put it short, she's his source of happiness.<br><br>I believe that there are thousands of people in this world who are also like him, as happiness has not knock on their door yet. And I really like to add that I really sympathise those people outside there, who are like my friend wooing the stubborn kind of people. And to make it more heinous, obstinate is the word.<br>I really do sympathise my friend. Although he do really love that girl, nothing positive still comes out of it after 3 years. If you guys reading this feels that perhaps this friend of mine love for the girl is not true. I can't say is true or not true. I can only use the point that it has already been 3 years.<br>Because basically, he's not given a chance at all. Not a single chance at all. He has no chance to give and commit what he could to the one he truly loves and I remember him telling me that for now, only the heavens, and himself would know and feel how much he loves that girl. Simply because, he is not given a chance at all to commit and give what he can.<br><br>But sometimes, love can be so weird and funny. As love can also be that you liking a girl in your school, you could only each time see her at your school parade square early in the morning during flag-raising as she's in the next class and she always sits just right in front of your class and seeing her back only could make you feel content for the day.<br>But too bad, you can only see her during flag-raising and also you don't know her and neither she knows you. As I believe, if only they are friends and they know each other, things might go beyond a certain boundary.<br><br>Going to a more serious note, I believe your own education do play a part to determine your future. To think in a long-term view, just ask anyone. Would they rather be together with a person whose job draws a 5 digit sum of money per month? Or be together with a person whose job barely draws around 1-2K only?<br>Okay, you can say my love for Mr/Miss XXX is true love. No matter what, I will always be with him/her forever. But you see, your true love and passion for each other will never die. But do you ever think in the future, how are you going to survive? I'm bringing this up because one of the reasons is because I'm a Singaporean. In Singapore, you can't afford your financial condition to be no good. Because I believe if thats the case, suffering can be the word which can describe your life.<br>Of course, as I said earlier, you can barely have any money to have 3 meals a day, but you have a wonderful family and kins and a splendid spouse and you can still be happy. But life would be very hard you, espically if you live in a place called Singapore.<br><br>Nevertheless, I would like to end this post by saying that in the dictionary, I like the word 'cherish' the most. No matter what are you doing, always cherish things around you no matter whether are they items or people.<br>As I said to many of my friends.
