Tell him all that you haf been through and how u feel. See if u 2 can reach a conclusion to things.<br><br>I also feel that u shld be happy and move on... Since he can still haf feelings for his ex, he shldnt be with you to hurt u at all..  u cant say tt whenever hes feelings for sm1 is back u 2 break off again.. this is going to be very hurting for u....<br><br>I suggest u tell him to get clear his mind 1st... Who does he really love most? you or the ex? Why would he want to be with you when his feelings for the ex is not over? Sorri that i may be harsh, but i hope u live happily and not bound by such a selfish guy...<br><br>If he cant bury his past and not mention abt feelings for his ex coming back anymore, tts gd.. IF he cant put them down, lets move on to find a better guy.. I am sure there are alot more gd guys better than him out there as u mentioned...<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> BUt pls be assured u can haf all the fresn here to support u...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

How old are you and your bf...? Do you still love him...? ( &lt;-try to be as frank as you can in this question) If the answer is 'yes', next question is WHY?<br><br>Ask yourself what ya want in this relationship... Perhaps you should ask him what he wants too? (not in an interrogating manner pls....)</div>
