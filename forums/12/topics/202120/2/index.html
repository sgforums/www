Its up to you to decide wat you want to do about it. Man, i mean its already 2 years. Shouldn't you try to let go? Or maybe see things from a different angle.... that all could be a blessing in disguise.<br><br>My ex gf was wif me for 5 years before she said that we are not compatible. She caught me off guard and i was actually depressed about it. It was not until i did some checks on her and found out that she's wif another man. Then 6 months later, she called and asked me if i still love her? I turn her down and her exact words are "I dun need a boyfriend, I need a husband" ....<br><br>Now that i'm happily married and have a 3yr old daughter, there's nothing more i could ask for. I look back in memories ........ those were the days.</div>

I think you get the drift.<br><br>I don't suppose there's a lot more to add on which hasn't already been suggested - in essence, go figure out if she's <strong>the one</strong> for you(you could have been quarelling frequently - and might continue to do so in all probability if you ever got reacquainted on an intimate level again - but for some couples, that's just part and parcel of what makes that relationship unique) and I think you would know better what is perhaps the most appropriate next course of action for you after straightening your thoughts...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well i was the one who initiated the breakup 2yrs ago, i do not regret making that decision based on the circumstances then.

She confided in me when they quarrelled and as much as i didnt want to know, she told me stuff about him/them, and his/his family's faults.<br><br>this was when i realised i may lose her forever... so i took action and met her a couple of times, where i really voiced out a lot of stuff and my feelings. From the time we were together, she had been for the most part my soulmate.<br><br>as her vacation was ending, she told me to wait for her decision as she would be busy with school stuff... and so i did. At that time... it seemed i stood a good chance. When we contacted again, she told me she had 'went back' to that guy during that time to see if it could still work out... it was heartbreaking as i didnt expect her to lie to me (or at least didnt say the truth).<br><br>we met again, but this time i was tired and not in the mood... and so the meetup passed by uneventfully with me being quiet mostly.<br><br>i duno what shes thinking but since then... she has been very cold towards me and told me to put everything aside for now...<br><br>due to -some- reason... i think she has gone to be with that guy. But i have not confirmed.<br><br>just posting this because tbh amongst my friends there isnt any really close one to confide in, and just duno what to do now.
