            <div class='col-md body'>she contacted me when they quarrelled, which was like soon after they became an item (~2 weeks after knowing each other). At that time my exams were nearing, when i found out i didn't try to 'snatch,' like what you mentioned, all i did was to listen to their stuff (which i didnt really want to, would you? if you are the ex-bf who still has feelings for her) and try to calm her down because she said she wanted to breakup with him.<br><br>after that, we met twice, you can say i shouldnt have done that but why not? even though yun said it could be more for the 'impending loss,'  at least i tried doing something, its not like they were stable and all and together for a long time.<br><br>anyway, i dont know if shes with him now or not, and i wont know because she doesnt respond to me, not even to a simple sms just asking her about her school stuff. if she is with him, and decides that ignoring me is what she's gona do, then what can i do?<br><br>yes i am jealous, i am unhappy, i dont have a clue as to what i should do now, so no matter comments good or bad, at least i found a place to vent my frustration, because i have no close friend to confide in.

From the time we were together, she had been for the most part my soulmate.<br><br>as her vacation was ending, she told me to wait for her decision as she would be busy with school stuff... and so i did. At that time... it seemed i stood a good chance. When we contacted again, she told me she had 'went back' to that guy during that time to see if it could still work out... it was heartbreaking as i didnt expect her to lie to me (or at least didnt say the truth).<br><br>we met again, but this time i was tired and not in the mood... and so the meetup passed by uneventfully with me being quiet mostly.<br><br>i duno what shes thinking but since then... she has been very cold towards me and told me to put everything aside for now...<br><br>due to -some- reason... i think she has gone to be with that guy. But i have not confirmed.<br><br>just posting this because tbh amongst my friends there isnt any really close one to confide in, and just duno what to do now. And there's still the financial problems to juggle...<br><br>p.s. after reading the 'old or new bf?' thread, realized its somewhat similar =/ </div></blockquote>its hard to forget or leave behind the gal since she is ur soulmate but u reali need to leave her n more on with ur life... there better gals to be ur soulmate...</div>
