I like doing Mathematics and Writing Story for English. I enjoy writing essay but whatever essay I wrote, there are gramatical errors and I am not really good in uisng beautiful phrases. Mine is simple ones, kind of like Primary School Essay :/ I don't really like Physics and Chemistry. I have done quite well in Principle of Accounts but I am not interested in business related stuff. As for my career persuation, I am not sure how to start. I like to do what I enjoy doing but I do not know what I like to do. Are there any centre or course where I can test out what my interest is in?</p></div>

              <p>I am doing it for both, money and passion. I like to do things that I like and earn income for it. I have done admin in my National Service and I doesn't like it. I keep screwing things up and most of the time, I try my best in doing it but I still screwed it. For example, one of the event was when I was doing filing, my senior asked me to sort the document from the newest to the oldest and destroy the old documents that are more than ten years. I tried my best to do the job but in the end, I messed up the documents where I accidentely destroyed some of the new documents and did some of the filing wrongly. My chief supervisor get angry with me and kept giving me confinement constally. I am not sure if there are something wrong with my brain as I keep muddle things up. I have even try to do it properly but I still can't.<br><br>Most of my colleagues were annoyed by me and they wanted to set me up using my muddleness as my weak point. One of them purposely put my office's contact list into my bag although I have no proof and evidence of it and I am completely sure that I did not open my bag on that day. When I was on off day, one of them phone me and asked if I have taken the contact list home and when I checked my back, I was shocked to find that it was in my bag. My chief got very angry and gave me more confinement. She even glare at me most of the time. If it was my job career, I would have been fired and all my colleagues will celebrate with beer: <img src="http://s1.totalprosports.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/stone-cold-steve-austin-double-beer-smash-chug-beer-gifs.gif" alt="" width="320" height="240"> just like what those people in my office after I have ord.</p>

              <p>While searching around some of the job search website, there are some of the job i can do<span style="line-height: 1.231;">, such as i can help to pack goods in the store or warehouse for preparing the goods for sales, i can also help to print documents, scanning documents, sorting or arranging documents or goods, counting and measuring of goods, or maybe in a stationery shop, i can help to sort out goods like repacking them to be ready for sale. I can also work in the library to sort out and rearrange the books, i might enjoy doing these. But most of them needs experience, good communication skills, interperson skills, working in a team and buying selfhelp books of those doesn't help much, i would be glad to attend an interactive activities of these skills so that i can improve on my communication, team and interperson skills. Also, i figure out that i can't do multi-tasking, i often screw things up like what happen when i am serving national service in my admin unit. Seems like i need to attend some workshop on these field. Can anyone provide a seminar interactive course of where i could improve on these? I can't seems to find it anywhere.</span></p>

              <p>Mugen, you are looking for a cure for your low self esteem.</p>
              <p>Instead of focusing so much on what you can't do , focus on what you can achieve.</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">A hostile environment is not a nurturing environment. </span></p>
              <p>I have heard plenty about the sufferings of NS.</p>
              <p>A place where they glamourise the strong , enforce conformity and mocks the weak , is not a place for creativity, innovations and growth.</p>
              <p>Let go of that past in that horrid place and seek your place elsewhere.</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">If anyone can do what you do, your marketable value will be low. </span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">For now you need to find your self-confidence, then find your niche and expand on them.</span></p>
              <p>As long as you keep an open mind and be receptive to constructive criticisms, you can learn and be better at what you do. </p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Hi Mugen, you sound very confused. You are graduating, from where, poly or ITE? What have you learnt in your studies? if you cannot find that, any other courses or studies WILL NOT help you!</p>
              <p>When you write essay, what is important is what are you writing, a few gramatical errors does not matter, as long you are able to express yourself. Simply words will enable your essay to be read by simply people. If your essays can make people understand you better, learn from you, identify with your thoughts, ....that is a great achievement! So focus on the rigth things.</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">If you screw things up during national service, even in an admin
              unit, don't blame NS. Have you learnt after the screw up? Most Singaporean have so much to talk about, tough training( but we pulled through), lousy food (but we survived and grew stronger), stupid corporal ( so it was us the private who got the things done), idle platoon mate ( whom we gave blanket party, siok!) ....Armed Forces is a place where we work as a team, no rambo or self proclaimed general. If you went through NS with the discipline for team work, you should have many good friends to contact after ORD, if you have learnt from the mistakes that you made, you have grown!!</span></p>
              <p>If you take a job to find you interest, you are wasting your employers time, your colleagues trust....Try your best in everything you do, every job you take, you may learn to like many things. Sometimes interest comes from the effort you put in your persue of excellence.</p>
