            <div class='col-md body'>Physics is not thata difficult actually. Well since you said you taking business in the future, I think you should take H2 Maths Chem Econs H1 Phy or any other art subjects. For me mine Is Maths chem phy.

            <div class='col-md body'>I would recommend that you take Math, Econs, Physicc and Chemistry -- all of them at H2 level.<br><br>Economics is one of the more manageable contrasting subjects you can take, don't try to "stretch" yourself by taking History or Literature even if you think you will cope fine; you will suffer. I take H2 History and am grappling with the subject. Physics would be good, as is Biology (depending on your level of interest in the respective subjects). You can actually try taking H2 Biology since it's very similar to Chemistry (our syllabus is focused on molecular biology) and in many ways different from O Level Biology; I wouldn't discard that option actually.<br><br>Try not to take anything at H1 level as it wouldn't constitute a "real" subject.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmm first off, which jc are you choosing to attend for your 1st 3 months? your 1st 3 months mean a lot to your year 1 life.. it's like a kickoff, when you start slow, your momentum and pace suffers for the rest of the year..<br><br>next, taking 3 h2s and 1 h1 or 4 h2s right? well to put it simply, your options are not closed at all.. it doesnt mean you cant take bio in jc when you didnt take it back in secondary school.. you CAN in fact take biology at h2 standard.. in fact, h2 and h1 have extremely little difference for the following subjects - chem bio phy hist geog.. in h1 for the mentioned subjects, you study the SAME stuff as h2 students, except that h2 students have around 20% more chapters compared to the h1 syllabus..<br><br>looking at your plea for help with subject combinations, i guess you have no goal for beyond jc? it's high time that you take a good look at yourself and plan ahead.. what subjects are required for you to take your desired module in university? do not think it would be just like the o lvls, when your subject grades add up to escort you to the college of your desires.. subjects count more in the a levels.. think well..<br><br>h3 is another issue.. for starters, you can only take h3 in your 2nd year at college, however, it is NOT an advantage to your certificate to have a h3 subject unless it's a good grade, which would help with your scores for a levels.. students who do not take h3 subjects share the same foothold as you when choosing university modules, unless the h3 subject you have chosen has DIRECT relevance to the module you have selected for university.. (e.g. h3 math --&gt; math module or h3 economics --&gt; economics module) it is not advised to pick a h3 subject, for travelling time and lesson timetables will cause you to miss lessons and many other factors would affect you.. it will be elaborated upon when you start school next year..<br><br>have you only one choice of 3 h2s and 1 h1? try taking 4 h2s at j1 standard.. i feel this way as i can see your difficulty in picking subjects.. having 4 h2s may help you understand better the hastened pace of jc education and the density of topics covered that'll prove rather different from secondary school.. you wont have much chances to ask questions in jc so do take notes diligently..<br><br>i suggest that you pick the popular choice - Phy Chem Math Econs, 4h2s.. physics is pretty much the same as back in secondary school.. if you find it too difficult, you can drop it to h1 standard or choose another subject combination after the 1st 3 months.. good luck next year alright? do mention which jc you have been allocated to for the 1st three months.. pretty sure the friendly ppl here who are in the same college as you would help you.. =)</div>
