As long as you have some common sense and understand the concepts at the same time, it is easy to score once you get the hang of it.<br><br>Geography seems useless unless you are confident to score well in that subject.</div>

(e.g. h3 math --&gt; math module or h3 economics --&gt; economics module) it is not advised to pick a h3 subject, for travelling time and lesson timetables will cause you to miss lessons and many other factors would affect you.. it will be elaborated upon when you start school next year..<br><br>have you only one choice of 3 h2s and 1 h1? try taking 4 h2s at j1 standard.. i feel this way as i can see your difficulty in picking subjects.. having 4 h2s may help you understand better the hastened pace of jc education and the density of topics covered that'll prove rather different from secondary school.. you wont have much chances to ask questions in jc so do take notes diligently..<br><br>i suggest that you pick the popular choice - Phy Chem Math Econs, 4h2s.. physics is pretty much the same as back in secondary school.. if you find it too difficult, you can drop it to h1 standard or choose another subject combination after the 1st 3 months.. good luck next year alright? do mention which jc you have been allocated to for the 1st three months.. pretty sure the friendly ppl here who are in the same college as you would help you.. =)</div></blockquote>hi, thanks so much for your long advice.

            <div class='col-md body'>Just to share some info, i'm currently taking H2 chem H2 econs H2 maths and H1 geog. Hmm, as far as i've heard, H2 physics is rather tough but still manageable compared to the old syllabus. As RaaRaa has eariler on suggested taking the combi of H2econs H2chem H2maths and H1phy would be a suggestable choice since u've decided on the business route. And i would like to allay any fears that H2 econs would be tough. So long yr willing to put in effort(lots of it), its really easy as compared to other subs like phy, which is much more mind-straining. Btw, never ever pick geog unless yr interested in studying landforms and volcanoes. It was a harsh decision i hope u wont commit if u lack that area of interest!</div>
