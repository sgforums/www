            <div class='col-md body'>Your boyfriend has his reason to feel jealous and he feels like you are still "looking for options" while you already "having" him.<br><br><strong>What would you feel if your boy friend always go out with a girl, who you don't know or who has ex-relationship with him.</strong><br><br>Also, it may be true that you are faithful to him and you know what you are doing when go out with other guys, but, how do you know the guys that you going out with have no intention on you at all? This is a very big question mark.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"><br><br>Put in this way, if a guy already has a girl friend, would this guy goes out with you alone? <strong>NO</strong>, right? This guy should have already enjoyed the companion of his own girl friend, so this guy will not bother so much to go out with you, right? Hence, it's Simple, that guy have an intention to "date" or "see if still got chance to court" you, though the guy knows you already got a boy friend.<br><br>So, to be fair to your boy friend, stop going out alone with a another guy. If still want to go, go together with your boyfriend. <strong>If you "know what you are doing", you shouldn't afraid of letting your boy friend joining you and your guy friend.</strong><br><br>Feel very weird as your boy friend doesn't know that guy well??? <strong>In my opinion, as a girlfriend,  you have the responsibility to introduce your friends (whether guys or girls) to your boy friend. If not, how are you going to spend the rest of your life with your boy friend.</strong> The same theory applies to your boy friend as well.</div>

But now my current bf, he allows but he really shows that he hate it and becomes sad. I have talked to him about it and even alone with guy friends really friends only that kind he also do not quite like. He says why go out with them alone when i have him. He say that its like i want to know them better but i have him already. I know that he loves me alot and wants to protect me. I would have long broke up with him if it were the last time me. But now i understand his intentions thus i'm trying to change for him. Dun know is this the right thing cos i have changed super alot for him. We are doing on well but its always this thing that makes us unhappy. Its because of my past and character that he's so afriad to lose me i think. But i dono sometimes i really think he is too possessive yet i know he just cares abt me.<br><br>Any advise?</div></blockquote>Hi piggie,<br><br>I do have the similar situation before, but now no more...not that i have break off with him but cos he scare of me ....hahaha...<br><br>since he want you to go out with him only right, then be a super glue until he scare.....whenever i am free, he is not, i will call and disturb him ..until he said ok go and have your own activities...and it takes me about few months to make him understand that i cant always wait for him to be free then go out with me, and i want very much to have my own activities too... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>anyway, it is not good just to change yourself for him...cos you have your own freedom also right?? don you want it??<br><br>btw, he is also very possessive....haha...now not so bad anymore</div>
