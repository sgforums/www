            <div class='col-md body'>Just putting it the other way round.... would you feel nothing if he did the same thing of going out alone with gals??<br><br>I wouldnt say he's over-possesive at this point of time... probably just over protective.... It's the insecurity that he's feeling here you see....<br><br>It all depends on how much you love him... since you alreadi said you had changed a lot for him... think you shld let him know....you have taken a step in making this a better R/S...<br><br>Maybe you could talk to him and discuss this topic of going out with guys alone with him.... Let him know your intentions of doing it so that he's more aware of wat's going on and would understand you better in the process</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It shows that he loves you and that he is insecure, he doesn't want to lose you.<br>I would be glad if my bf (if I had one) would be "possesisve and protective" because it would mean he doesn't want to lose me. I think this a correct level of "possession" , it would be not good when he would forbid you to meet your friends and be angry becasue of this.<br><br>Introduce him to your friends, once he knows them and sees they are no "danger" for him, he should feel less insecure. Also when your frieds know him and like him, they will be less likely to try to "get you" becasue they will respect your relationship. They will do that only if they are your true friends.<br>Try to ensure him that he is the one who you love, no matter with how many guys you will go out. You must often ensure him that you love him and that there is no competition for him. You must show him that he is your priority, your number one.<br><br>Good luck!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

He may be insecure and protective but it's not a blanket excuse to control you.<br><br>I recommend that you be completely open to your boyfriend about your male friends, who they are, what they do, how did you know them, etc.  Introduce your boyfriend to your friends.  Be honest and accountable when you're outside, let your boyfriend know where you are, who you're with.  Your boyfriend has to learn to trust you; you have to be responsible, and show him that you are behaving responsibly, when out with friends.</div>
