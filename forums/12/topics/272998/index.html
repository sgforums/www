            <div class='col-md body'>Hi. I am a girl studying in a junior college. Recently, i feel very stressed up and i tend to get agitated easily. It started with this. Me and my three other friends went to the same junior college and we go to school together sometimes in the morning if they are not late, we will meet each other. We seldom talk nowadays and i realise i have nothing to talk to them. I start to think that i am a boring person.<br><br>One of them is in the same class as me. Recently, she stopped talking to me in school. I felt hurt, didn't know what was wrong even i asked her many times. Then, one of this friend told me her emotions backfired. I could not understand what was that and i just cried in school. Then, she told me she needs space but she continues to talk to others, just not me.<br><br>Nowadays, i only talk to friends whom i started to know in jc. We have a common interest in gaming but all we talk about is that, and it gets boring and we will be quiet once it stops.<br><br>Promos are coming but i just cannot focus with the numberous problems on my mind. They tell me to leave her alone but i just can't do it. I have many failed friendships in secondary school. One ended because i was too possessive. I tried to overcome it but i just couldn't. And my friend who does not talk to me in school keeps telling me she like this other friend in our clique whom i think she is getting very close to. I feel jealous and hurt and hatred somehow seem to build up. I don't know what to do. Everyone's giving different comments and i just get upset easily.<br><br>Please enlighten me on what i should do.</div>

That's good. For most teens, friends are more important than even their own family members. They feel a need to 'belong', to be 'accepted', not to be 'ignored'. These feelings stem from a lack of self-confidence, being afraid of rejection, being alone, or being outcast.<br>Friends come and go. New friendships are formed as old ones die. It is not the number of friends you have that is important. In fact, those who have 'many' friends are actually the insecure type. Good friends are actually very few and can only be counted on the fingers of one hand!<br>The important thing is yourself: Are you friendly?<br>So, don't get depressed over such a small emotional issue. There are so many interesting things to learn, to do, to achieve, to read, to write, to help than be emotionally affected by one friend who didn't want to talk to you. Its her perogative. Don't be possessive. Talk to me!</div>

I was ultra friendly in my first three months and made lots of frens but when i switched to another junior college, everything changed but i still made frens, just lesser. And now its kind of awkward to be in class with her since she does not talk to me so i talk to my other two friends whom i feel comfortable with but i can't stand one of them but am trying to accept her. I am quite a sensitive person so thats why i get upset over small things.<br><br>In secondary school, i keep having illusions that they are speaking behind my back and i just get more paranoid. Maybe i treasure them too much to let them go. We had a very nice friendship but now its stagnant though she claims she is able to talk to me online, just not in real life and is going through some stage in her life where she just needs space from me. So i leave her alone nowadays, but just could not control my emotions.<br><br>Studywise, i think i really need help.

            <div class='col-md body'>Your situation is not depression. Just sadness and maybe upset, I guess.<br><br>Maybe for some who wants to know more about depression, read on.<br><br>When a person suffers from depression, he/she will have a big behavioural change. He/she don't have appetitie to eat. Listless and can't sleep at nite or only manage short sleep for weeks. To him/her there is no meaning in life. Everything is like the end of the world. In worst cases, some even have the thoughts of committing suicide. This can be cause by a failed relationship (breakups), financial problems, demised of a loved one, etc.<br><br>In depression, you need help. You can't solve it yourself alone. Call someone to talk to. You need to pour out your tots and tell someone about your problems. A close friend will be very helpful. Parents may not be ideal and they may probably aggrevate the situation. There are some helplines like SOS to call.<br><br>Perhaps you may want to see a doctor too. They can prescribe some medication to help ease your mind, like sleeping pills and relaxant. But medication can't perform magic.<br><br></div>
