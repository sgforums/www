            <div class='col-md body'>i think there's no such thing as a perfect courtship.<br><br>it differs with everyone....<br><br>one thing u can do, be a perfect gent. do all the things for her that u don't normally do for others....<br><br>but in the end, can you upkeep this behaviour? even after you got her?<br><br>if not, won't she feel 'cheated' in a way? I got to gether with a perfect gent, but now he's........<br><br>so my advice is, just be yourself. if she is attractted to the YOU that she knows, then it's the YOU that she is getting. you won't have to 'put up a show/act for the courtship.<br></div>
