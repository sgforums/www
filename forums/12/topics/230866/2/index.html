How Important is Courtship?<br><br>i've searched for past threads on this but haven found a satisfactory answer<br><br>recently, there is this thread on ' how to test water' and this guy was like eager to know whether this gal he is interested in is attached?.. but the moment the TS mentioned that the gal didn't want to go out with him... doko feels that he's out.. so no point chasing?<br><br>yes.. i know courtship begins with dates.. so u have to get her out 1st rite?<br>but .... doesn't courtship begins right at the start?.. b4 u even start dating?<br><br>if the gal likes u, she will make things easy for u.. yeah i know..<br>then wat if the gal is not that into u?<br><br>i know ultimately the gal's interest in u is the most impt. no way to raise it?<br><br>doko seems to feel that if the gal is not into u.. then u r out.. no point chasing..<br>so that means a guy shld NEVER attempt to chase a gal if she is not interested? hmm..<br><br>how do u define interested anyway? i mean where do u draw the line? as in stop chasing her completely<br><br>i'm sure there are cases where the gal is totally not into the guy, but in the end they got together after some courtship.<br><br>Aunt yun offers some brillant advices on courtship. on how one shld behave etc. but doesnt really touch on this point.<br><br>Past threads i'm always seeing doko and Aunt yun having diff perspectives and arguing.. etc<br><br>another question..<br><br>the perfect courtship<br><br>ok.. with regards to the 1st question.. we have a follow up on the perfect chase? lol<br><br>generally.. threads posted here are answered on a case to case basic..<br><br>and to tell u the truth... most of the threads here are abt broken relationships. and threads become more of a counselling thread.(nothing against that) just that wouldn't it be better to know how to handle a relationship b4 someone suffers from another broken heart?<br><br>such as ok.. this guy thinks he's into some r/s trouble and decides to seek for help here.. but in actual fact.. the relationship is already in tatters.. he has been doing too many wrongs and any amt of advices can not aid his cause since the damaged has already been done...<br><br>so the perfect courtship starts right at the start b4 u 2 are attached all the way till the both of u get married.<br><br>hmm.. might want to phase this question to.. the proper behavior of a guy??<br>see.. i cant seem to think of the most ideal question to express my thoughts.. lol<br><br>Aunt yun.. kindly advice.. saw some of your replies damn chim..don know wat CloUdiSm thing.. lol kk<br><br>Let's hear some truth on this<br><br>PS. not here to pin point on any one, or start any trouble.

Some girls just love the feeling of that or believe in these, so they choose to incorporate 'courtship' into their relationship process...<br><br>Others... Which I think is likely to mean the majority...? Probably doesn't fancy you as much equally... Hence the longer you take for 'courtship' to work, it MIGHT suggest that initial 'liking' she holds for you is relatively not that high or significant... So end of the day she'll probably still be stuck with more or less of the same 'feel' while in the relationship with you, even if you manages to get her somehow...? Unless something sort of drastic happened during the courtship sotr of made her change her 'feel' of you almost totally... (Which I must say is relatively of a much lower chance of happening)..<br><br>Just like you've suggested... Courtship might not have even existed in the 1st place? If the 'bond' and 'feel' is good, do you think the other party would even as easily let go of you? (unless she has extreme inferior character) Just that sometimes some things just don't happen for no reason... That's when 'courtship' (pre-relationship) comes in in various forms...</div></blockquote>ya, totally agree.<br><br>i think that this topic has got too many to define and many scenarios to describe.</div>
