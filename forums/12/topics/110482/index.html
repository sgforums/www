            <div class='col-md body'>Jenni, next time if u like a guy, must ask for his number too. Dont just give the guy ur number only, because that makes u a passive person who is without control, u cant do anything except to wait for him to call. If he doesnt call u, then the opportunity pass away. So next time, take initiative to ask for the guy's number too ok?<br><br>For now, if u want to take initiative, I agree that u can try asking ur mom or other relatives etc, try to get his number.<br><br>Another thing, after u can get in touch with him, slowly get to know him better etc, then at the right time, u must ask him whether he want to breakup with his gf and make u his gf or not. If not, dont be sad, just forget the whole thing and move on. There are many other cute guys in this world. If yes, then u happy with him loh. U must make the issue clear so that he doesnt keep 2 gfs. But dont ask him so soon. Must get close with him first and the timing must be good.<br><br>Somebody said, if he breakup with his gf then next time he can breakup with u and go for another girl too. Yes, of course, so what? Dating is not like marriage. Dating is still a process of finding and exploring a partner. Any of the two parties still have a right to breakup and find someone else more suitable. After marriage, then they are supposed to settle down. So, dont let his current status as a dater with a gf stop u. U should only stop if he is a married man.<br><br>So, all the best to u ok.....</div>
