Just feel fortunate that you're stuck with loneliness instead of REAL TROUBLES....<br><br>And... I don't think feeling a gf just because you're feeling empty is such a good idea (not that it's not an acceptable idea...).... But think of yourself going NS soon...? What would happen to your gf and relationship with her...?<br></div>

I'm not trying to scare you, but you will definitely know more buddies in army and it's perfectly ok not to have gf at this stage of your life.  I saw many friends of mine who break up just because they neglect their gf due to the hectic life in army...<br><br>------------------<br>Hope to b your frd forever, Mike signing off</div>

When it happens, i suggest you to think of more positive stuff, it may be hard, but its worth a try. Like maybe telling yourself things that u have done well in or indulge in tots of happy stuff.

Though usually such a 'panic attack' can leads to harsh consequences if not well-controlled like you've mentioned...<br><br>The thing he's trying to say I've experienced before... In the more extreme case, it can leads to 'slow death thought'.... Just like a person slowly losing himself/herself and soon from the thought transfer to the Life and reality.... Then at some point Life seems quite meaningless... It's not really an 'agitated' state but a calm one... Often occupied by loneliness, some regrets about Life or a philosophical 'awakening' (Obviously in the wrong direction)..... Just like a person slowly suffocated.... Life draining away....</div>
