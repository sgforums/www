If she don't dislike you, she will still allow you to be her friend and give you a chance. If she never wanted anything more to do with you other than hello-goodbyes friendship, then it's not bad that you've found out now rather than later after wasting few years of admiration for her only to see her surrendering her body to another guy's pleasure. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>It's isn't everyday that you've someone coming up to confess their feelings for you. And it doesn't means that after confession, things will become awkward. It depends alot of how mature both of you handled the situation. And it doesn't necessary need to be awkward. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>If you do not let her know that you're interested in her, how can she take notice of you and what you have done for her and will be doing for her in the future? Don't you also want her to consider you too?<br><br>But before you go ahead and tell her your admiration for her, ask yourself this. Why do you like her? Is it because you're enthralled with her personality, charm, beauty, appearance? Or is it because you already know her and she have already know you and you can't stop thinking about her.<br><br>Will you regret not letting her know? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Good luck. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A posting I put in another topic<br><br>Liking someone is a very interesting thing.<br>We can easily like someone, but turning into love is another thing.<br>I liked my gal (now wife), and after confessing that I liked her, it developed into love.<br>I liked another gal, and now she is my sworn sister whom has a really good relationship with me.<br><br>The issue is, gals, esp those who are passive, do not think about that SORT of 'like' which you want your gal to like you with. She likes you as a friend, a close friend, and until you declare you like her in that way, she might not even noticed it.<br><br>Most gals whom I know, tell me they are passive, and can like many guys in their passive way. However, if the guy doesn't explicitly say that he wants to go into that sort of relationship, most of them would just take you as a good friend. Only when you indicate your seriousness, will they seriously consider.<br><br>My wife never considered me more than a really good fren, until i told her i liked her in that way. Only then did she think thru and agree to go steady with me.<br><br>Bear in mind, by doing that, you risk losing her as a friend. But as another forumite said, either try or live with eternal regret. It is even worse when you see her go with another guy one day, and you DID NOT EVEN TRY.<br><br>Face it, either you try and win or lose her, or you don't try and lose her (coz I don't think you can bear seeing her with another guy, in which case, you STILL lose her friendship), so go all out and try I say!<br></div>
