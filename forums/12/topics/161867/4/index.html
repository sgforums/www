Girls' who dress until eye capturing and attention seeker like, onli a bra that cover the top and a damn short mini skirt, ming ming jiu shi capture guys attention and get themselves screw. bu shi slut den wad? More worst, i see around 2 to 4 girls dancing themselves den all out of blue, a couple of guys seek behind them and lay their fingers into the girls heel, waist and etc. The girls' only smile back<br>by hinting the guys that they want more. I'm a regular clubber anyway, if i'm a foreigner i'll have a real bad impression on local girls for sure. of all these places i mention, out of the 100 girls, you can see those type at around 95. Go to these places, you can see what's the girls in local behave already, what's more get out of my shell and see the world like?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Just that it's not the right timing and not the right person. If that is what you think, then go be a monk or become gay.<br><br>There's good ppl around and perhaps you just need more time before you met the right one. Just a matter of time.
