End up you'll feel tired of wearing the mask and take it down. Then what? Start all the nonsense again?<br><br>Many times I heard my friends say that their partners had change, but to me is more like that they just went back to the real time. Courting and wooing period is like a masquarade. One be extra nice to the person interested in and do all kinds of things to please that person and that person is touched by the things he/she do. Then what? Can you do all those forever? If you can...good...if you can't...then be prepared for the worst.<br></div>
