They did these things for everybody.

If a gal does not hav any feelings for u, wat u did is useless..if u think u treat her lik a princess is great, then u r wrong ! Some gals dun lik to be served..u got to find out wat type she is b4 u did all the jobs. i would suggest u try to find out wat she likes, then it's really worth to give her some surprises <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

But for these three years, we become good friends and soulmates to each other and I've put aside the love for her long ago. Mid this year, she came over to Singapore to visit me. As much as a good friend can do, I bring her around and attends to her needs as she's not familiar with Singapore. She stayed for 4 days.<br><br>Early July this year, I went over to her hometown for a short trip and end up staying there for three weeks. During these three weeks, my feelings for her seemed to slowly come back and by the time I'm back to Singapore, I'm quite affirm of my feelings for her. I confessed to her and it took her a few days to decide if she wanna be with me. She finally agreed and I happen to ask her if she love me and she admit that she did. And I ask her since when and she admit again that she started to have feelings for me during her trip here. And I ask her why and she simply say that just because I'm good to her during that few days and that I really take very good care of her.<br><br>I never did expect it's during that period that she start to have feelings for me. Initially I tot was during my three weeks at her hometown. During her stay in Singapore, all I did was just take care of her needs and I never expect anything from her.<br><br>Bottomline is, no matter what you do, don't expect anything back cause you'll feel disappointed if the person fails to give you what you expect. There's no need to be "EXTRA" nice towards a person. Just be natural.<br><br>It's quite obvious that she is touched by your "helpfullness" but not moved by your "willingness". I think she did the right thing by rejecting you outrightly when she knows that she got no feelings for you. Or do you rather that she "entertain" you by accepting you just because of the things you did for her and she feel obligue to say "yes" to you and then later decide to leave you just cause she still can't get the right feelings for you? Won't you be in a more sorry state?<br><br>Think about it pal.</div>
