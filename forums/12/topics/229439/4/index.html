            <div class='col-md body'>dear TS,<br><br>After reading the posts by fellow forumers, I cannot help but have the following thoughts:<br><br>a. firstly, both of you are young and am probably not sure what you want. You may say you do, but I can dare say you don't.  Sure, you can say I want to be so and so but in life as you go through it, things change and you will realise you will change you your mind.   So, are you her first boyfriend?  Is she your first girlfriend?<br><br>b. Earlier I have said, technically age is not a barrier so long you love each other, that still holds true.  But dude, two things here you got to be clear, you are 16 and she is 20.  She is in Uni &amp; you are in ITE.  Thats a difference in educational level.  I'll be honest with you, whilst I as well as many other forumers here feels that  educational level difference shouldn't be an obstacle, it takes a lot of effort to overcome that.  Think for a moment, ok, you are ok, she is ok, your friends can be convinced, her parents?  If you are serious about this relationship, which I hope you are, you've got to convince her parents that you are worthy of her daughter as her bf.<br><br>c. She is uni, which means she will be graduating in 2-3 years time, max.  Where will you be then? NS?  She will start working and she will see &amp; experience new things in her workplace.  She will have financial independence and she will expect new things.  You said she is normal, meaning she will be wooed by colleagues, clients, suppliers, what have you.  I am not saying she will stray but she will be subjected to temptation.  And you, you are still in NS.  When you meet, you tell her about how your sergent tekan you and she is thinking, "Oh hell, I was scolded by my manager and sexually harassed by my client, I have no mood to listen to this boyish crap.".  Differences in ideas, in thinking you see ,simply because you experience different things every day.<br><br>A relationship cannot be sustained without constant communication, you need to talk to each other, about each other's feelings, each other friends (heres one thing, your group of friends will be so different from hers)., about work (if both are working, you can relate to bitchy colleagues, nasty bosses, etc)<br><br>c. I am not painting a sullen picture for you.  But I just want to tell you, you will have a more rocky road ahead, more challenges, and the possible pitfalls.  Do think through and hard and do be aware.  Of course, a relationship is not like a business plan, you don't want to plan out everything because alot of things are uncertain.  What we can do is tell you those that r highly probable.<br><br>Good luck moving ahead, and please talk openly with her about all these differences.  make sure both are aware these are going to have a bearing.  And if both you are prepped and ok, then by all means proceed.<br><br>Life is uncertain anyways, but its always good to know all that you could.  Cheers.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>it's more and more common for a guy to look up for a gf older than him. 1-2 years older is ok lah but 4 years? it seems to be too big a gap.<br><br>as for educational level, you can still catch up with her unlike age in which you can't possibly make yourself older than her right? so educational level, in this case, shouldn't even be an issue at all.</div>
