              hi i have been feeling lost for almost a month and barely clinging onto life
              
              the story began few years ago when i started dating a lady much older than me. it was more than a relationship but a connection. we were very happy for several months until i thought that i should find someone closer to my age. guess i gave her cold shoulders and became temperamental and took her for granted. she was hurt. i even left her for a brief period when i fell for another girl. she begged me. but i guess when i was not the one hurt i didn't know. thinking back, i don't know what was i thinking. 
              
              my relationship with the girl didn't last and i went back to the lady of my life who was always there for me. still, i wasn't sure and focused on my work. a few times i made her upset by not showing enough care for her. although i don't show it, i always hold her dearly in my heart, always thinking of her..i was beginning to see things in a different light. at the same time, there are a few suitors around her and a mistake i made caused one of them to start going out w her and she fell for him. i broke up with her, thinking i could let it go since it was i who didn't treasure her. but i never got over it, constantly overwhelmed by guilt and regret. i am going thru what she went thru and more when i left her. a realisation struck me that i have lost in fact more than a girlfren, she was a companion, one whom no one can replace, one whom i can never love more deeply. i want her back so much..

Anyway she is only yer former female companion - not yer family, not yer wife, not yer children - so wat family bond u have wif her? Wat done is done. Dun cry over spilled milk.

              were very happy for several months until i thought that i should
              find someone closer to my age. guess i gave her cold shoulders and
              became temperamental and took her for granted. she was hurt. i even
              left her for a brief period when i fell for another girl. she
              begged me. but i guess when i was not the one hurt i didn’t know.
              thinking back, i don’t know what was i thinking.</p>
              <p>my relationship with the girl didn’t last and i went back to the
              lady of my life who was always there for me. still, i wasn’t sure
              and focused on my work. a few times i made her upset by not showing
              enough care for her. although i don’t show it, i always hold her
              dearly in my heart, always thinking of her..i was beginning to see
              things in a different light. at the same time, there are a few
              suitors around her and a mistake i made caused one of them to start
              going out w her and she fell for him. i broke up with her, thinking
              i could let it go since it was i who didn’t treasure her. but i
              never got over it, constantly overwhelmed by guilt and regret. i am
              going thru what she went thru and more when i left her. a
              realisation struck me that i have lost in fact more than a
              girlfren, she was a companion, one whom no one can replace, one
              whom i can never love more deeply. i want her back so much..</p>
