            <div class='col-md body'>If we ask any woman what she's looking for in a man, she'll come out with a long list of ennobling qualities: a sense of humor; a guy who's nice to her and treats her well; good values; a strong moral character, interesting and intelligent, but monetary terms will never be in the picture.. Does that means she will go for the poor guys if he have the above qualities? ... NO...<br><br>Many women lie.. They are experts at self-deceit because if they ever admitted to themselves what they really want from men, then they'd be forced to acknowledge that they don't really want a "nice" guy.. They are equally contradicting as they always lament about the lack of "Nice" men arounds..<br><br>I always watch what a woman does, rather than what she says.. And what does she actually do? When it comes to choosing men, she heads straight for the cash.. What women want most from men -- and therefore the criterion most significant to them in selecting a mate -- is money or the assurance of thereof in the future.. ThatÂ’s probably why guys with a bigger house have an edge over the poor live-with-parents-kid.. And guys driving Lexus have an edge over SMRT riders...<br><br>You'll never catch a woman saying what she wants is a tall handsome man who drives a continental car, with lots of money and lives in a condo.. They got to have thick skin aka leather to do that (and we all know how lovingly soft the skins of sweet asian things are.)<br><br>Some women are blatant about their mercenary choices, openly choosing men with substantial material assets that they can exploit.. But most are subconscious hypocrites, screening out less successful men without admitting it to themselves.. They publicly announce that all they want is a nice guy, but privately disregard any men who don't meet their elevated standards for money, success, and status..<br><br>Let's be honest -- if women really chose men based on what they say they're looking for, then every nice, average guy out there would be besieged with females trying to go out with him.. Like my friend Peter,  nice, average looking  generally stay at home on the weekends with a date from the PC/TV..<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Oh Peter again??<br><br>So how? How's the make-over coming??<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by caramon:</div><div class="quote_body">If we ask any woman what she's looking for in a man, she'll come out with a long list of ennobling qualities: a sense of humor; a guy who's nice to her and treats her well; good values; a strong moral character, interesting and intelligent, but monetary terms will never be in the picture.. Does that means she will go for the poor guys if he have the above qualities? ... NO...<br><br>Many women lie.. They are experts at self-deceit because if they ever admitted to themselves what they really want from men, then they'd be forced to acknowledge that they don't really want a "nice" guy.. They are equally contradicting as they always lament about the lack of "Nice" men arounds..<br><br>I always watch what a woman does, rather than what she says.. And what does she actually do? When it comes to choosing men, she heads straight for the cash.. What women want most from men -- and therefore the criterion most significant to them in selecting a mate -- is money or the assurance of thereof in the future.. ThatÂ’s probably why guys with a bigger house have an edge over the poor live-with-parents-kid.. And guys driving Lexus have an edge over SMRT riders...<br><br>You'll never catch a woman saying what she wants is a tall handsome man who drives a continental car, with lots of money and lives in a condo.. They got to have thick skin aka leather to do that (and we all know how lovingly soft the skins of sweet asian things are.)<br><br>Some women are blatant about their mercenary choices, openly choosing men with substantial material assets that they can exploit.. But most are subconscious hypocrites, screening out less successful men without admitting it to themselves.. They publicly announce that all they want is a nice guy, but privately disregard any men who don't meet their elevated standards for money, success, and status..<br><br>Let's be honest -- if women really chose men based on what they say they're looking for, then every nice, average guy out there would be besieged with females trying to go out with him.. Like my friend Peter,  nice, average looking  generally stay at home on the weekends with a date from the PC/TV..<br><br></div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Materialistic.... hmm... come to think of it... everyone... including children... r materialistic. This is wat the society brought us up to be. I used to think women r materialistic, due to the family background I'm living in and to the pple I'm explosed to, but if u get to know them, they r not wat u think they r(for ur info, they r genuine women, not wannabes). So this is wat I've learned so far.<br><br>This "materialistic women" topic doesn't sound very rite. I wan a 5K paid monthly job, I wan to live in a condo and a big car to drive with lots of women at my beck and call, doesn't it makes me materialistic too? Nope, these r ambitions, dreams. These ambitions seperates 2 types of pple, those who strife to achieve them, and those who keeping dreaming but lived a simple life. Prehaps those women who ruthlessly strife to achieve their ambitions r so-called branded "materialistic". But u have to give them credit for tat, these women have the balls to get wat they wan, and I believe they deserve getting it. Anything more than tat, tatz another story.<br><br>To correct u, the word to use here is "dependable". Damn... I'm starting to sound like sesame street. Yeap, materialistic... I think everyone is. If u say u r not, touch ur heart then tell me again.<br><br>Yeap yeap.... most women wan a dependable man to take care of them for the rest of their life... till they die of old age. Yes?? No?? They'll wan someone who can provide for them, someone who can mentally and psyhically support them, someone who they can open themselves fully to, someone who will warm them up in a simple cuddle, someone who will protect them and be at their side when they need them.<br><br>Ehhh... lost me there?? Anyway the point is, eventually she'll look for someone dependable, looks is not the critical critria anymore.... well, if she got herself a hold on a goddamn good-looking guy, itz a bonus. But if tat gal still die die wan to look for a zai zai look-alike for a bf.... well... time for her to wake up and face the real world kiddo.<br><br>And if tat gal dump/reject u bcos u look ugly.... thank god she didnt take u, cos she dun deserve u.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by icebaby0:</div><div class="quote_body">AGREE with icy<br><br>Just because you urself might have been hurt by those "materialistic" women doesn't mean that all women are LIKE that.<br><br>Seriously in reality, in any courtship there are some lies now and then.

            <div class='col-md body'>Peter will never get a date if he keeps sitting around and doing nothing to help himself. It is not that girls are not attracted to him because of his looks, but he is not making an effort to communicate with the opposite sex.<br><br>Hmm, I dunno how true this is for every ladies out there, but this is what it says about the stages women go through when they fall in love, in the following order:<br><br>First, she will fall in love with your mind (mental chemistry). This means she is attracted to something in a guy's character. It could be a way of how he smiles, of how he expresses consideration for others, of the kind of questions he asks, the values he lives his life by...all of these are ways a man can express his character.<br><br>Second, she will fall in love with a man's personality. She will discover the kind of personality in a man which she is most compatible with, the one she actually feels safe being herself.<br><br>Third, she will fall in love with a man physically. This is the so-called physical attraction level, when a woman wants to be touched, when she wants to be kissed and hugged. Not that many men will make it to the level when they can stimulate her both mentally and physically, so now the circle of men she is interested in grows smaller and smaller...<br><br>Fourth, she will finally experience soul attraction. She will finally realize after going through the previous 3 stages, that this is the person she wants to be with. This realization is not something that she has concluded on basis of comparisons of what is available or what could be possible. Her soul will just know.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> Taken from a book I have read before, finds to be kinda true for me. I know I will never fall for someone without loving his personality and character first, so he can be as goodlooking as Brad Pitt but his personality is like shit, I will still kick him into the gutter  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>i.c.y</div>
