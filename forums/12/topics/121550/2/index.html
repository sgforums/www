            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I take the definition of materialistic as the following:<br><br>A great or excessive regard for worldly concerns.<br><br>I mean of course everyone is concerned about having certain necessities in life so that we can live comfortably, about having money so that we can acquire those necessities, but it is only when someone is so consumed by greed to acquire those worldly possession can he or she be branded as being materialistic. I do want a job that can provide me and my family with a comfortable home and life in the future, but because I am not consumed by the desire to own 10 diamond rings or to live in a condominium or bungalow, I do not think I am materialistic.<br><br>i.c.y</div>

It is not that girls are not attracted to him because of his looks, but he is not making an effort to communicate with the opposite sex.<br><br>Hmm, I dunno how true this is for every ladies out there, but this is what it says about the stages women go through when they fall in love, in the following order:<br><br>First, she will fall in love with your mind (mental chemistry). This means she is attracted to something in a guy's character. It could be a way of how he smiles, of how he expresses consideration for others, of the kind of questions he asks, the values he lives his life by...all of these are ways a man can express his character.<br><br>Second, she will fall in love with a man's personality. She will discover the kind of personality in a man which she is most compatible with, the one she actually feels safe being herself.<br><br>Third, she will fall in love with a man physically. This is the so-called physical attraction level, when a woman wants to be touched, when she wants to be kissed and hugged. Not that many men will make it to the level when they can stimulate her both mentally and physically, so now the circle of men she is interested in grows smaller and smaller...<br><br>Fourth, she will finally experience soul attraction. She will finally realize after going through the previous 3 stages, that this is the person she wants to be with. This realization is not something that she has concluded on basis of comparisons of what is available or what could be possible. Her soul will just know.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> Taken from a book I have read before, finds to be kinda true for me. I know I will never fall for someone without loving his personality and character first, so he can be as goodlooking as Brad Pitt but his personality is like shit, I will still kick him into the gutter  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>i.c.y</div></blockquote></div>

While I do agree with you that there are many materialistic women around I don't think there's much point harping about it. We guys will just have to choose the diamonds from the dust!

Because they finally realised they chose "Jerk" rather than someone like Peter..</div></blockquote>I don't think you know what you are talking about Caramon<br>What do you mean right place and right time? So are you trying to say that the so called 'nice' guys whom girls marry are really jerks in disguise because they upkeep the 'nice' guy image when they are dating? I think you should give the majority of Singaporean guys more credit than that!<br><br>As for Peter, from what I foresee, if he even exsist, sounds like a potential henpecked husband who gets stepped all over by the wife. Who after some time might get bored with him which, ultimately lead to divorce. When the woman don't respect the man, you can forget about the marriage working. This works both ways.<br><br>Let's face it. We grow up in a materialistic society whereby success is placed alot on the results you get, the money you earn. I agree that a group of women want the best of both worlds, but there are plenty of girls out there who will settle for an average guy whom they love, live in a HDB flat and maybe hope that they can afford a small family car soon. Anyway, isn't that what the majority of Singaporeans doing now?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If you ask me, I'd have to say, women of different age groups want different things.<br><br>In their teens, girls wanna experience what it's like to love and to be loved in return. This is commonly known as "puppy love". Hanging out with their boyfriends actually feels the same as hanging out with their chummy girl-friends. In other words, their boyfriends are so-called the girls' "confidante". And the couple is usually of the same age? *shrugs*<br><br>In their 20s, women tend to look further. Some wanna concentrate on career, while the family-oriented ones will think of settling down young. The former will have no qualms in telling guys interested in them to get lost. But the latter will look forward to a fairy-tale ending at the end of the day. This time, the women hoping that their counterpart will be the older party, IMO. Reason: More mature and can take care of them, not to mention, the guy will definitely have a higher spending power.<br><br>In their 30s, I guess women don't have much choices, yeah? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>But all in all, I guess each and every single lady out there needs a man who will love them, care for, and provide for them (after getting married).<br><br>**Above are all my views ah.
