              <p>Hi Caleb...</p>
              <p>Depression is in the mind...thus the mind cannot be used to treat itself.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To get out of the loop, you have to look away from answers, reasons, blames, what-you-might-have-done, what-you-didn't-do, etc...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You should focus on getting new accomplishments to hedge out the stuffs that didn't go as planned so that the total accumulated success stories are higher. It takes time and positive confidence.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Good luck</p>

              <p>Thanks alot guys. Anyway, it had nothing to do with life in RP but something outside of it.</p>
              <p>In regards to what actually happened. I'm too ashamed to even mention it. Tried not to think about it but it just struck back like a gust of wind. Catching you unaware.</p>
              <p>Most of my days are spent in a daze these days.</p>
              <p>It is easy to say not to think about it. Sometimes i am okay while sometime like last night i was like wandering around the street at night till i felt the need to eat as i had not eaten for the whole day. life seems miserable and meaningless. but not to worry, i won't do anything stupid.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></p>
              <p>Anyway, it also led me to see how supportive my friends are and most of the members here are.</p>
              <p>And Ceecookie, one can never imagine the feeling even if he or she tried to... Being in it is so different. I never intended to post that whole batch of blunt msg. I guess i am trying to up my post counts after the change of the forum look and wasn't putting much in the thinking and phrasing of those msg. Who doesn't do it anyway. Just that i did it for one whole period of time...</p>

              <p>Hello TS,</p>
              <p>Why focus on the few bad peanuts and forget about the hundred over good things that you have had in life??! Isn't that funny ? </p>
              <p>Rather than focusing on the past that can't be changed, why not focus in the present where, in every moment has the potential to evoke new and meaningful changes.</p>
              <p>We can always take something positive from the past and move onto another stage in life. Life is very short. Don't waste it hoarding onto the bad stuffs. ok?</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

              <p>I've been in a similar position myself. I guess it helps if you can focus your energy on something positive so you forget the negative things in life.</p>
              <p>Perhaps you need a change of enviroment? Some sort of challenge to look forward to?</p>
              <p>Do you think that is anything that would most perk you up right now?</p>

              that's because you really have nothing to be depressed about. your idea of depression is someone "fucking up your days". you're immature.

              <p>Okay kiddin. Don't be ad. When I was depressed I neeeded to chat with my close friends. We would chat for hours on anything. That would help.</p>
              <p>And be active. <strong>Do sport</strong>. Really if you don't like it at first do some sports. I suggest jogging. I like jogging because I can meditate while I'm jogging. Might want to add swimming.</p>
              <p>Jogging is known to reduce stress level and give you the happy endorphine.</p>
              <p>I also suggest you to <strong>eat celery</strong> daily. Uncooked or have it juiced. taste like hell but better  taste hell for a few minutes than to feel hell for the rest of the day.</p>
              <p>Do what you like or find things that you like to do. <strong>Find a hobby</strong>.</p>
