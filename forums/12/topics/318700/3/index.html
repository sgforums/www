              <p>Depression is a state where one cannot come to terms between the projected self and the reality one is in.</p>
              <p>I do not know if you are in a depression, because there is no definate term for 'depression'. However I believe there are others who may share similar situation with you. You may want to find these people and share about it?</p>
              <p>You can also consult more experienced people you trust and ask for their advice or comments.</p>
              <p>It is good you acknowledge you have an issue at the moment. It is far better than people who deny they are having problems. You are one step closer to solving your problems.</p>

              <p>Thanks alot guys. Anyway, it had nothing to do with life in RP
              but something outside of it.</p>
              <p>In regards to what actually happened. I'm too ashamed to even
              mention it. Tried not to think about it but it just struck back
              like a gust of wind. Catching you unaware.</p>
              <p>Most of my days are spent in a daze these days.</p>
              <p>It is easy to say not to think about it. Sometimes i am okay
              while sometime like last night i was like wandering around the
              street at night till i felt the need to eat as i had not eaten for
              the whole day. life seems miserable and meaningless. but not to
              worry, i won't do anything stupid.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></p>
              <p>Anyway, it also led me to see how supportive my friends are and
              most of the members here are.</p>
              <p>And Ceecookie, one can never imagine the feeling even if he or
              she tried to... Being in it is so different. I never intended to
              post that whole batch of blunt msg. I guess i am trying to up my
              post counts after the change of the forum look and wasn't putting
              much in the thinking and phrasing of those msg. Who doesn't do it
              anyway. Just that i did it for one whole period of time...</p>

              there are two types of depression.
              
              1. you can avoid and get out of it
              2. one you cannot avoid and get out of it
              
              number 1 is easy but number 2 may need medications to control until one day you can get out of it.
              
              most pple that suffer number 2 depression don't even know that they are depress.
              
              just be happy and glad that you are not fall into the number 2 depression type.
