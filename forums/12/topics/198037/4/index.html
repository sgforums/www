            <div class='col-md body'>Let me offer my input.<br><br>Girls do and will always like bad boys. They like bad boys not cause they are bad, but cause they have confidence and a heck-care attitude. It's different, it's not supplicating and it's exciting in a way.<br><br>So guys, if you want to start getting girls. Shave off the Mr Nice guy look and character. Be an in-between.. the Nice Jerk. That's me. I dunno what exactly constitutes a nice jerk but here's alil to describe the general characteristics of me:<br><br>1) I'm not afraid to admit what i like. I love women.. Heck.. i love women with boob and butts. I am totally not attracted to skinny/bean poled women. I love women who are passionate, expressive and love life.<br><br>2) I may have few women at one time in my life coz I nvr believe in chasing ONE girl at a time. It's suicidal. (eg. Ask a salesman to sell to 1 customer at a time, see whether he can stay long in the company <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> ). I may see a few women at any one time. But if i'm committed to one, I'll stay committed to that one only and expect her to do the same. I'll drop her off if she cheats on me.<br><br>3) I treat women well n with respect. I believe in reciprocation. I wun keep 'investing' in a woman if there is little or unjustified ROI.<br><br>4) I believe in being honest and open always with the women or special one. I dun believe in lying. I'm not ashamed of my desires and needs. Life should be fun and full of adventure. I always act with an objective in mind and if there's nothing to be gained, I do not believe that 2 pple should just hang out aimlessly.<br><br>5) My validation in life is not from women but from life, my studies and my future career. I strongly believe men must have an actionable vision, direction and achievable goals in life. Women are attracted to such men. (Even if all the women i'm seeing now on a social basis leave me, no problem.. gives me more time to focus on my education and outside life. No worries, there'll always be more women out there)<br><br>6) I know that what ultimately counts is still how much n what kind of food one is able to put on the table. Pple can go ahead and argue on this point, I dun care. Yes there are exceptions. But a man must alwaz be financially stable, confident to win the heart of his chosen lady.<br><br>7) I wun supplicate and be at the whims and fancy of any girl. I believe every r/s, whether committed or open, requires both parties to invest in equal portions. If a girl doesn't want, sure thing.. just move on. There are thousands and thousands of women still waiting to be known and made contact with. When I think of such numbers, I get down n sad less and bounce back faster.<br><br>So guys, grow a backbone.. dun chase a girl like u are putting the 'pu**y on the pedestal* pls. That's a major flaw we guys make. Be generative, be creative.. outgoing, daring.. confident, have strong goals in life. Dare to take risks, do crazy and fun things. Dun stick to safe safe havens and boundaries. Girls like guys who are fun, exciting. It's a bonus to them if you are loyal and loving to them.<br><br>Just like me, I am still waiting to meet a girl whom I can wake up every morning to and feel everything starts fresh n nice again. Yet she possesses good qualitites of a wife and mother which I'll need to complement me.<br><br>Cheers</div>

Heck.. i love women with boob and butts. I am totally not attracted to skinny/bean poled women. I love women who are passionate, expressive and love life.<br><br>2) I may have few women at one time in my life coz I nvr believe in chasing ONE girl at a time. It's suicidal. (eg. Ask a salesman to sell to 1 customer at a time, see whether he can stay long in the company <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> ). I may see a few women at any one time. But if i'm committed to one, I'll stay committed to that one only and expect her to do the same. I'll drop her off if she cheats on me.<br><br>3) I treat women well n with respect. I believe in reciprocation. I wun keep 'investing' in a woman if there is little or unjustified ROI.<br><br>4) I believe in being honest and open always with the women or special one. I dun believe in lying. I'm not ashamed of my desires and needs. Life should be fun and full of adventure. I always act with an objective in mind and if there's nothing to be gained, I do not believe that 2 pple should just hang out aimlessly.<br><br>5) My validation in life is not from women but from life, my studies and my future career. I strongly believe men must have an actionable vision, direction and achievable goals in life. Women are attracted to such men. (Even if all the women i'm seeing now on a social basis leave me, no problem.. gives me more time to focus on my education and outside life. No worries, there'll always be more women out there)<br><br>6) I know that what ultimately counts is still how much n what kind of food one is able to put on the table. Pple can go ahead and argue on this point, I dun care. Yes there are exceptions. But a man must alwaz be financially stable, confident to win the heart of his chosen lady.<br><br>7) I wun supplicate and be at the whims and fancy of any girl. I believe every r/s, whether committed or open, requires both parties to invest in equal portions. If a girl doesn't want, sure thing.. just move on. There are thousands and thousands of women still waiting to be known and made contact with. When I think of such numbers, I get down n sad less and bounce back faster.<br><br>So guys, grow a backbone.. dun chase a girl like u are putting the 'pu**y on the pedestal* pls. That's a major flaw we guys make. Be generative, be creative.. outgoing, daring.. confident, have strong goals in life. Dare to take risks, do crazy and fun things. Dun stick to safe safe havens and boundaries. Girls like guys who are fun, exciting. It's a bonus to them if you are loyal and loving to them.<br><br>Just like me, I am still waiting to meet a girl whom I can wake up every morning to and feel everything starts fresh n nice again.

            <div class='col-md body'>Like I've always said (not on the forums, in real-life), women or men have a different aura around them when they exhibits confidence. Exhibiting confidence gives you a natural shine, a very attractive air around you.<br><br>That's why the so called "bad boys" seem to attract all the girls. Girls of a younger age are GENERALLY more attracted to the confidence the "bad boys" have.<br><br>That said, I totally agree with MetalGear. Cheers!</div>

Not too much of a jerk who takes the woman for granted and not too much of a wimp who gives in too much. And be a gentleman- this way you will be perceived as a real mature man who has some masculine qualities and yet not a jerk. A jerk is one who has too much negative qualities but he has some strength. A nice guy doesn't. That's why women are attracted to that strength of the jerk. But if a guy has some strength and takes charge all the time, yet he is a gentleman, he scores way much better than the jerk.<br><br>One last thing: women are supposed to share your completeness in life, not to make you complete.</div>
