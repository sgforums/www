            <div class='col-md body'>One day, you fell in love with this special person, whom in the end, became your bf/gf over the course of several months courtship. You feel that she is the one you probably going to last VERY long (not speaking on the basis of marriage, but if possible and if fate allows, it could happen). The both of you ride through the storms of your relationship and enjoy the aftermath through a period of probably 3 years.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> You felt that she/he may be the one....<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> You felt that probably no one else would take his/her place...<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> You were utterly wrong.<br><br>You got to know this person (I called it the 'One') and you finally discovered that ALL ALONG THIS LIFE, <strong>this is the person you are looking for</strong>.

He/she is everything you need and ever hope for and probably if he/she becomes your partner - you would be quite certain marriage will be an option in the future.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>What will you do? You still have feelings for your gf, but VERY strong attraction towards your 'One'. You felt that everyday you are missing not your gf/bf but the 'One' and your craving for him/her is getting more addictive every day of your life.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Then, one fine day, you discovered that she shared the same liking for you as well.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> You bleed inside from the turmoil and torment.<br><br>***<br><br>What will you do?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

You feel that she is the one you probably going to last VERY long (not speaking on the basis of marriage, but if possible and if fate allows, it could happen). The both of you ride through the storms of your relationship and enjoy the aftermath through a period of probably 3 years.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> You felt that she/he may be the one....<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> You felt that probably no one else would take his/her place...<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> You were utterly wrong.<br><br>You got to know this person (I called it the 'One') and you finally discovered that ALL ALONG THIS LIFE, [b]this is the person you are looking for</strong>. You went beserk, despair or even resigned to fate. Everything you desire and want in a lady/guy (physical + characteristic) is found in him/her. He/she is everything you need and ever hope for and probably if he/she becomes your partner - you would be quite certain marriage will be an option in the future.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>What will you do? You still have feelings for your gf, but VERY strong attraction towards your 'One'.

            <div class='col-md body'>3 years can mean alot. Human are all liddat, we cant escape the feeling of the heart. We cant always remain static, which means our heart changes overtime. Seriously i never even think "forever" this word existed.<br><br>I will chose "the one".<br>The 3yr old gf case is realli classified as "Utterly wrong." Wad's there to think about? Feeling changes. Yes, being together for 3 years is not easy, go thru many storms aint easy as well. But the feeling is not there already, its unquestionable going on with life is the next thing.<br><br>Then come the next stage of the question:<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> How to break?<br>Have to face her, her family, her frens, ur family and ur frens? Dont bare to break her heart? Or cannot let go?<br><br>Lets be straightforward, cherish the feeling. Once gone it might not come back again. To break up is not easy, but well, impossible is never the word.<br></div>
