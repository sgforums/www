This is because, I will never believe that I make any wrong choice or wrong move in choosing a partner.  The ONE may or may not happen.  Even if it happens, it's just a crush.  How can I be so sure that I can be as happy with the ONE as with my current boyfriend?  Life is too short to gamble on this.<br><br>I will stick to my boyfriend</div>
