              <p>Make a gal happy?It's easier to know what happened before Big bang than that. Don't waste your time and happiness for a bitch's. You will regret it later. What is a friend for her?No sex and ask your help when needed.And you are threaded along while she fcuks others for any needs that might arise.</p>

              need some opinions. Lately ive been helping a best gal friend of
              mine with money. Ive started giving her some small sum every month
              as an allowance for her as she is financially drained. <br> <br> She knows i love her but she rejected cuz she told me she didnt
              wanna risk losing the friendship. That was 5 years ago. And
              recently, she did told me she likes me more than a friend but not
              to the level of bf. she even call me her special guy friend as im
              her only guy friend she trust with all her heart. <br> <br> Im helping without asking anything in return. I did so because i
              love her is one thing. Secondly, she needs help and she is a best
              friend so i cant bear to leave her behind with problem. And she is
              single again so she cant ask her ex bf for help. <br> <br> Ive never hated her or hold grudges against her for rejecting me.
              She knows that ive always respected her decision even if it hurt my
              feelings. I know im not gaining anything by doing this for her. But
              i love her and im ready to sacrifice things for her.</span></p>
