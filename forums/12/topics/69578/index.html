(ew)<br><br>haha anyway i dun think thats all right? so she has a short fuse... well many girls do... and guys as well.. i can only tell her to be more patient and tell u to be more understanding... but of course.. if she takes your niceness for granted.. maybe u should find some one else. but i dun think thats the case cause u seem to adore her.<br><br>u might also wanna examine how she gets pissed off each time.. could be that u need to be more tactful when you're talking to her. the best way is for both of u to sit down and resolve this....</div></blockquote>Yeah, what he said! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
