More than often we tend to let our mistakes blind ourselves from the practical options that are presented before us.<br><br>Put it this way, you broke off with this person mainly for the fact that there is some one better out there for you. Which then again may not necessarily be 100% accurate, given the possibilty you might fall out of that said r'ship. It's a vicious cycle but that's wat many of us go through before we manage to find our ideal partners.<br><br>It also depends on the mindset of the individual. Are you still opening your options despite the fact everytime you meet some one new and you decide to commit but can't actually bring yourself to? That's when all the "mistakes" and "misgivings" come in.<br><br>Bottom line is, people WILL change. All of us will definitely learn something from any r'ship we are in. Be it good or bad. Who knows now you are estranged from some one only to realise in future you are smitten with him/her again? Fate plays a cruel game on us sometimes. But I try to tell people I know to start and think HOW you are going to move on rather than WHY has the r'ship ended this way. Try to think positively and not attempt to comprehend as to "why we so suay? why must she do this to me? why, etc etc." If others have moved on and u are here moping around, it's quite obvious who's on the losing end.<br><br>Hope that helps.
