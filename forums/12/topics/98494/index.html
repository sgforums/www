            <div class='col-md body'>well, ya i wouldnt like it... tt's why sometimes i just force myself not to think of him so much... so i wouldnt feel the urge to call him so badly.... well, we've never tok about this face to face... but i have complained to hima  lot on the fone... but it's like he always never reply to it... if he ever says anything it's onli "sorry"... well, i'm thankful that at least he knows how i feel.. but sorry doesnt cure anyhting... it doesnt change the situation.... i still hold on to this day.. becoz sometimes i do take notice of the little things he say... or the little things he do... which gives me hope becoz it shows that he still do care for me... but i'm always left alone... it feels so bad... it;s like i'm attached by name.. but i'm no different to someone who's alone, who's single most of the time...</div>

We feel that we are not as close to them as before.. right? I've been thinking this too.. But then when they are in ns.. is either very good.. they enjoy their army life.. or very bad.. and they are hate it and sux.. Another thing.. they have to wake up damn early in morning.. i believe that they are physically very tired.. and they don't think much oso.. Guys are insensitive creatures.. So don;t put all the blame on them..<br><br>Sometimes we think too much oso.. It's nothing wrong one.. then we think until got something wrong.. Sit down and breathe hard.. and think.. They are really tough in there.. I'm silly to think of this oso.. but i tell myself.. i wont htink about it anymore.. They need our understandings.. don't stress them again.. when they are with you.. Let them feel relaxed.. and forget about the NS jus for a day or two..<br><br>Whether he loves you or not.. is not up to us to decide.. I suggest that you wait until he really ORD then talk to him about this again.. Maybe he's really busy.. and maybe he's too tired and stressed out.. Don't worry ok..<br><br>Cheers..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> </div></blockquote>thanx a lot... u sound mature.... hehe... this is gd advice... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

Though from SURFACE ANALYSIS, your bf do sounds a little more on the suspicious side... You did mentioned about his ORD coming soon? When would that be? How about seeing if he's gonna be changing his style after he's detached from NS?</div>
