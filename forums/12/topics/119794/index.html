Guys like him should learn the HARD WAY.<br><br>Other methods might just easily backfire. Main worry now should be that he might have backup copy of it. Anyway, question him at the police post. Try to have Susan keep a backup copy of the picture as a form of evidence, just in case if the photo's circulating else where, she can hold him RESPONSIBLE FOR IT.</div>
