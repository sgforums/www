              <p>Well 14 years old is a bad age to be rebelious, and choosing not to face the reality is not going to help</p>
              <p>Try asking him to find a part time job(during holidays) where he will see those people with degrees etc etc</p>
              <p>i really got no idea how to tell your son about it, im a teenager myself and sometimes i just cant be bothered too</p>
              <p>Sometimes some things must be realised for yourself, like maths, u must realise/experience sin30 = 0.5 urself, instead of people keep telling u sin 30 the answer is 0.5. wad im trying to say is that maybe ur son needs to realise by himself that without o level/diploma/degree, the pay will be stuck at 1k+ for a start</p>

              <p>I am strongly against your statement. By allowing a child to suffer, he will seek ways to reduce the ''pain" from the suffer as a result, he may in turn find himself in a gang whereby things are easier and people are more 'caring' to him.</p>
              <p>Soon you will find the child proceeding to do things against the law and in turn, lost his future.</p>
              <p>Mr 'Paisley' you are really cunning for wanting other forumers child to become a bad child maybe or probably just like you as you have a strong desire to allow fellow forumers child to suffer what you may had went through.</p>

              <p>Nowadays kids got pamper too  much, children scolding 3 letter words. At that age, either he behave or he won't and will just do opposite of what you trying to tell them. I am a TA so i roughly know. You tell them after that when you turn your back, they go doing the thing that you don wan them to do.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So for parents wise, try to get along with them but at the same time, teach them (not scolding or reprimending). Nowadays they like it soft, not hard.</p>

              <p><br>Learn to be your son's <strong>friend and father</strong>, and not the <strong>king of your house and father. </strong>You need to be <strong>patient and sincere</strong>, and <strong>lead by good example</strong>. Slowly, you should be able to gain his trust and he'll understand and appreciate your good intentions.</p>
              <p>Too many S'porean parents make the mistake of using material stuff to substitute their love and care, and end up 'losing' their child during their growing years. Once you've lost that crucial period, it's very hard to have a strong parent-child relationship in future, when your child has grown full independence.</p>

              <p>well, the reason why he's closer to friends...it's because that's the place where he feels at home and finds "love". Perhaps because ur a single parent so it's really difficult to juggle work and family.</p>
              <p>you must try ur best to give him love, not just putting food on the table and allowances etc. He will wise up, appreciate you and eventually do things for you and the family because he loves you.</p>

              <p>I do not know if my advice will be helpful to you since i am only 22 at the moment... i will just tell you the efforts my father has done... He exposed to me to different aspects in life and explained to me the differences of the past and the present... he did not do it in words but in action... he brought me around like go drain for fishing and tell me that not every kid at my age (i was 14 at that time) knows the simplicity of life and fun... whenever i get bad results (example i got 19/100 and 2/20), i will be shivering with fear... yet he will always be calm and ask me to do better next time... what is important is not to set expectations too high but set them as a point you can reach... that is what he told me countless times... and never show the expression that you r disappointed... Remember whatever you r doing, your son will be watching as you are his role model...</p>
              <p>i have to agree with one of the posters that other being a father, u have to be a friend... i do not know if i have such capabillity of my father...</p>

              <p><br>You need to have a good chat with your son.</p>
              <p>Get him to sit down and have a serious chat with you.</p>
              <p>Even if he walks off halfway, at least you've tried and might even get an idea of what his issues are.</p>
              <p>lol</p>
              <p>If you keep at the "serious chats", he might even start studying just to get you off his back.</p>
