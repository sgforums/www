            <div class='col-md body'>My bf and I have been tgr for abt 4 mths. Recently we keep quarreling its more sort of like as we r getting closer to each other, we tend to see each other weak points more or things we r unhappy wif.<br><br>But bcos I love him too much wen I m unhappy abt certain things in him, I will jus keep quiet n respect his decision. As for him, wen he is unhappy abt certain things wif mi, he will jus say it out and angry abt mi and say I hurt him a lot.<br><br>Recently we had a quarrel again, after tat he did not contact mi for a day cos I noe he needs to cool down so I didnÂ’t call him. Tat day I was very very sad. I couldnÂ’t slp for 2 nites. I really miss him a lot. It seems like my life will collapse without him. I guess I love him too much.<br><br>ItÂ’s the 1st time I have tis kinda feelings towards my bf. Cos usually in the past I m a very strong will woman and kinda stubborn towards my ex. i never been so sad before even when I quarrel wif my ex. Ever since I m wif tis current bf, I find tat all day I will miss him, I put him in my 1st priority wen I want to do anything, I will give in to him if we have any argument.<br><br>I used to be an independent woman but after falling in love wif him, I m jus not my usual self anymore. I m not the stronger me anymore. I jus dunno y. all mind was him. He seems to be very important to mi. its not tat I m very dependent on him. He still goes out wif his frens. And when I noe he is going out wif his frens, I will go out wif my frens or go out alone or stay at home.<br><br>But there is one thing we both have; we are easily jealous type of person. Wen I noe he has a good fren who is a lady, I m kinda jealous and he told me b4 tat the lady did hint to him b4 tat she likes him but tat was already years ago. Now they were jus good frens. And she is attached for abt 2-3 years already..wen I get to noe tat my bf and her did call each other at times to catch up I feel very uneasy but jus keep quiet cos I noe its my jealousy. I told my bf b4 but he assured tat they were jus good frens and will not b tgr wif her. After tat I will jus keep quiet wen I saw his hp got her num call in or wen he call her or sms each other.<br><br>I feel tat lately IÂ’ve been thinking too much. And after the recent quarrel, my bf tends keep a distance frm mi as in not to meet up so much so less friction. I feel very uneasy and very sad. Wat should I do? I keep telling myself to b more strong more independent but I still think of him every day. I guess he may b sian of mi le or after a coupleÂ’s honeymood period is over, ugly things begin to come out. I really hope to b wif him forever.<br><br>I love him a lotÂ…wat should I do? I m in a dilemma rite now. Mayb I should not put so much of my love in him cos I scare if 1 day he leaves mi I will really collapse. My fren told mi tat I should not bother him too much cos if a gf bother the bf too much, the more the bf will feel irritated. And if the gf dun bother too much the guys will even love her moreÂ…izit true? I m sorry for typing too long cos I m really sad..i feel tat I will bcome mad sooner or laterÂ…</div>

Surely you can LOVE him as much as you want... He's YOUR BF what...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  But like what others have suggested, don't let him be your WHOLE WORLD lor...<br><br>Don't think of silly things like is the honeymoon period over and the ugly things start to come out... 'Ugly things' can come out ANYTIME.... Honeymoon or no honeymoon... And LOVE can STILL BE THERE.... Honeymoon or no honeymoon... It usually just evolves into another kinda QUALITY....<br><br>As a relationship proceeds, it would usually EVOLVES and there're bound to be some CHANGES... Big or small...<br><br>I think your bf's 'strategy' in avoiding you might be a good or bad one... Depending on his intention and how he uses it.. (and how often he uses it?)<br><br>Something you could add to it.. During cool down or avoidance period.. You can always sms or e-mail him... Avoid direct correspondance contact unless both of you are VERY GOOD in handling that kinda situation (which is quite unlikely the case here)... Use a sort of 'mono-directional' 'communication'... Meaning you give him a message... He reply you one... That's IT... Unless things work out to be EXTREMELY WELL.. Just let it as it is... And in this 'message' of yours, AVOID working on REASONING... INSTEAD, work on LOVE... Something like.. Just let him know that no matter what just happened, you still love him very much.. Something like that....<br><br>It's relatively true that during HONEYMOON period, logics are usually greatly reduced and flaws minimised in each other's eyes... Because thinking's still young... Usually of curious and positive quality....<br><br>However, having honeymoon period OVER doesn't necessarily spell the end of your love story or the start of a bitter struggle for the relationship... It simply just work on a different mode and requires fine tuning and adjustment... It's a bit like... Studying for exams and then sitting for papers... You know..?<br><br>After that phase, the relationship is usually pulled back much closer to the ground... Faces reality and the more 'physical' each other... Things that are more 'SOLID'... Some things which you can't hide.... Cutting edges of a 'connection'.... Like... Running 2 computer programs together and sometimes they clash due to certain reasons....<br><br>So the period after Honeymoon is still on EXPLORATION of the relationship... But in a more mature sense usually... Still be 'HONEYS'... (In fact you'll need much of that from time to time to overcome things...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> ) But no swinging by the see-saw whole day long ok? Things which needs to be smoothen out, LOOK at them... REVIEW them and try to think of a way out... If both parties share the SAME kinda 'spirit' and commitment to a certain extent... Things can actually be QUITE INTERESTING... Have FUN yeah?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

These two elements explains much of your entire topic and even the advice given to you by friends will ultimately create greater chasm in your relationship that it can barely survive by then.<br><br><blockquote><strong>My fren told mi tat I should not bother him too much cos if a gf bother the bf too much, the more the bf will feel irritated. And if the gf dun bother too much the guys will even love her moreÂ…izit true?</strong></blockquote> Wrong theory, wrong case, wrong effect as well - seriously, if you do follow what your friend had commented, you trust me on this: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">your relationship will be walking on the road to destruction</span>. It is <strong>NOT</strong> about bothering, it is about knowing your problem, tackling them and solving them mutually. If relationship becomes a one man show thing - your cracks gets larger each day.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Three things I see which is killing this relationship everyday:<br><br>I) Inability to share, explain and work things out. <strong>Seek to understand, then to be understood</strong>. It is not about potential quarrel; rather you must place in view of a long term fulfilling relationship. To cease communication because you fear it will draw verbal conflicts - you have to learn and practice tactful, yet effective couple communication. Please note, I am <strong>not</strong> asking you to rant and trash things as if you are being unreasonable. You only appear unreasonable if you acted and spoken like one - Be mature and logical in your speech. Motivate each other to do likewise.<br><br>II) In a relationship, as we get closer emotionally, we begin to discover new aspects of our partner's personality. If knowing them will throw you into hostile mode, question is 'ARE you going to be defensive against it? <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Or are you both going to sit down and discuss how are you going to deal with them</span>?'<br><br>III) Jealousy. This chronic poison that will pollute the blood stream of your relationships; choke and clog every critical point of your love. This will gradually create much tension and stress within your relationship and causes either one of you to explode periodically. How can trust ever come into the picture when both of you grip love so possessively? For now, this wouldn't be too much of an issue (because the above two point could probably decapitate this relationship serious enough), but would be unhealthy for long term basis.<br><br>P.S: See beyond surface problems and have a soul talk regarding the three points. If nothing is improved, 'love vultures' are hovering in the air.<br><br>Cheers</div>
