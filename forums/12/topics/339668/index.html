              <p>Here's the situation</p>
              <p>I'm grouped in a project which requires me and 2 others to develop a case study for a project</p>
              <p>This girl, whom i shall call Ego Girl, decides to come in and boss everyone around.</p>
              <p>We havent even chose a team leader yet!</p>
              <p>She bosses me ( a guy , like wtf, naturally guys have more ego than girls, but this girl has bigger issues than me ) and another lady member around.</p>
              <p>All of us are supposed to contribute our ideas to build up a case study,</p>
              <p>but Ego Girl says "Hey!, why not stick to my case study?, its easier to understand!" (of course having a simple case study is good, but one which is modelled from a tutorial question?!, HELLOOO.. this is a project ,not a fukin tutorial)</p>
              <p>I pointed out to Ego Girl politely that her case study lacked a balanced view and would only warrant at most a B or a C</p>
              <p>Ego Girl fired back "JUST STICK TO MY CASE STUDY" yes she said that when i called her to tell her about my views</p>
              <p>All means to reason with her were met with nonchalance and she didn't had the respect(or courage) to even face me when I spoke to her.</p>
              <p>Yes I've confronted her about the lack of creativity of her case study on 2 occasions and both times, she just behaved like a stubborn pimple that refuses to pop out</p>
              <p>Now here's the worse part, she's will be in my team for a marketing project ICA and I'm contemplating changing teams.</p>
              <p>Honestly, she has a big ego issue which I find it hard to solve as a leopard can only change it spots after gaining enlightenment, and never once in my course of team projects have i encountered such a "foul" creature</p>
              <p>The project is due in a couple of days and this also involve a presentation, and i am starting to have dilemmas about this project and the upcoming marketing project.</p>

              <p><br>Do you have a better case study to present to the entire project group? If you do have one, then you can always go ahead and present it to your entire project group and get their approval to adopt your case study and not Ego Girl's case study.</p>
              <p>But if you do not have a better case study than her, then maybe that's the reason why you don't really have the power to comment on her case study.</p>
              <p>It's easier to criticise and put people down, but it is not easy to convince them to agree with you if you do not have a better case study at hand. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p>Teamwork matters more than the topic for the project. With a committed team, you can create outstanding project out any simple topic.</p>
