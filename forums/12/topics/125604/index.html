Have you tried examining yourself as a possible cause.. and is it possible that you are resisting it in your own way which will make her feel that you are not changing some of your bad habits..<br><br>so if you think that all else has failed you then you shud end the misery soon.. no point prolonging the suffering for both sides..</div>

At least you would save yourself some dignity for the next better girl.<br><br>In relationships, when one party becomes unbearably domineering, sometimes the other party also has to share the blame as well. You may want to be the perfect gentleman, but being a gentleman does not mean you have to suffer all her abuse blindly. By failing to put across the message that your tolerance has a limit, you have succeeded in feeding the monster in her and opening yourself to more frequent abuse instead. In her eyes, you are no longer a gentleman, you are just a punching bag undeserving of her respect.<br><br>Who knows? Perhaps your departure would make her appreciate you more and she could be changed for the better when you come back together again.</div>
