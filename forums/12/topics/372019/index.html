Much as he was my top priority, I guess I was nowhere near his top. He's either busy sleeping, or playing his games.  I had forgiven him b4 when he betrayed my trust. I had never thought that he'd hurt me like that but then I forgive him as I thought that it was juz a moment of folly on his part. Though true he didn't contact the gal anymore, I still don't feel anything like e top priority. Suddenly I feel very tired. Very very tired. I don't feel like hanging on anymore. But I can't bear to let go and don't know how to let go too. Can someone please tell me what to do? Or can GOD pls take me away so I don't have to think abt what to do?</p></div>

              <p>Whether u marry him or not -  the 'doubt' that you experiencing now would soon permeate your every day life.</p>

              <p>I trust that before you decided to get married, you and your intended have talked and thought things out.</p>
              <p>Some couple get married because it is assumed that they get married, and they really get married!</p>
              <p>For a marriage to work, both parties need a mindset and attitude to make it work. Otherwise all the promises of commitment and love will come to grief.</p>

              <p>Girl, listen to your gut.</p>
              <p>The problems you have will not dissapear after a marriage, it will only be magnified.</p>
              <p>If you cannot be happy now, how can you be happy for the rest of your life with this man ?</p>
              <p>Canceling/delaying a wedding is cheaper than paying for a divorce later.</p>

              <p>TS, i was like you in my previous r/s. i cleared most of his debts. i helped him work like hell in his pub without complains. and he always sleep and games. gambles and drinks at other pubs. i still continue with the r/s cos i loved him. and were planning for our marriage this dec. but half way thru during may/june. i gave up the r/s although so many years i cant put down just like you. cos i see no future. i'm tired physically and mentally. he doesn't appreciate what i've done so what for doing so much right?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>TS, i suggest you have a heart to heart talk with him or talk to his parents about your feelings. since you feel tired. no point forcing yourself into a marriage you aint sure whether you'll be happy or not. good luck!</p>

              <p>Talk to him:</p>
              <p>1) tell him what you want (i.e: you want to be the top priority in his life)</p>
              <p>2) tell him how you want it (spending time with you? give u flowers/gifts? hug you frequently? etc)</p>
              <p>Sometimes guys can be clueless, 'blur', insensitive. Doesn't mean he didn't love you. But u have to be sure he loves you and you are the priority oh his life (higher than games and his personal enjoyment).</p>
              <p>Worst come to worst, call off the wedding.. money lost can be earned again... but divorce can change the way u view marriage (and affect ur future).</p>

              <p>Always changin, always evolving - that is what an alive relationship is. It is river-like - flowing. It has climates, many moods. It is uncertain and always full of suprises. A dead relationship, like a pond remains stagnantand smells, is stale. It is repetitive, it is the same, but then it is no more a relationship. Then it is no longer two persons, but two things together. Of course, two things never quarrel. The quarrel arises when two alive persons enter.</p>

              <p>Sounds like pre-wedding jitters.. maybe you are having cold feet which is common before the wedding. When is the wedding scheduled to be?</p>
              <p>A month or two before the wedding, I also lamented to colleagues that I wonder whether I was making the right choice because we fight so often, if I marry him, won't that be my life forever? However I shrugged off the doubts after awhile because I decided I do love him and want to spend my life with him, despite the fights.</p>
