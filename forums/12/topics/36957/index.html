            <div class='col-md body'>Hi everyone,<br><br>Just got into this forum and have read quite a number of stories and have found a lot of sadness but warmth at the same time from people that spent effort in helping one another out.<br><br>I hope to share my story with people here, maybe someone can help me out a little bit before I will get really crashed down by it....<br><br>I'm met this guy, i named him as Q when I'm in my poly. Classmate initally but we never talk at all maybe a glance or a smile at times. We never really known until a year later he ask for my number.<br><br>At that time, I just broken off with my previous bf. Quite upset at that time because he betrayed me for another girl and did not wished to admit too for his mistake that he has been flirting around.<br><br>I caught him 3 times in half a year with another girl clubbing and flirt in front of my presence. But i still forgive him cos I love him too much. Until the very last time, I was working during my vacation, I call him and found him sleeping in a girl's home. So I just initated the breakoff after that with an extreme heart broken moment.<br><br>Then comes my current bf H, who is my best friend all along but liked me for a long time too. I didn;t accept him until I really can convince myself that I have forgotten my ex.<br><br>We are now together for almost 3 years. In the meantime, as I mention, I got to know Q. I thought we were like normal friends like everyone else, sat together in lecture, study together..<br><br>As time passes, the relationship between my bf and I gets down the road, we argue almost every week becuase he has a very bad temper and blow it at me at times. I tried very hard to accept it but then fail.<br><br>I do not know it's because that I starting to get tired, or for other reasons as time goes by I found that I fell for Q. I told my bf. He cried and beg me to stay even I like Q and not him. Q at the same time ask me to be with him regardless of my bf...<br><br>But then I'm still with my bf, but in my heart, I'm still with Q. Q was heartbroken because I ask him to leave(my purpose was not to hurt him by my indecisiveness but I do not how to make him understand) and then he did not contact nor talk to me anymore. I'm living in deep misery everyday and could only express my depress through work.....<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br></div>

You spend your effort in typing your essay above - I would spend equal effort in analysising and sorting you out.<br><br>The key problems lies within your first jerk ex that you encountered. Seriously speaking, you are better of without him - which is exactly what you did. However, psychologically, you have been affected and it isn't easy to erase or lessen the deep scar that was left on you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Your best friend, H, likes you, but you say you wouldn't accept him until you can convince yourself that you have forgotten your ex. Firstly...<br><br>I) Have you truely erase that ugly scar deep within yourself?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>II) If chemistry does exist and you like your best friend, why didn't you accept him last time? Because your Jerk ex was in the picture?<br><br>Many a times, when we reject someone's advancement and later when we accept them, we have to look and reflect seriously on ourselves. What gave you the rational to accept him now? I mean forgetting about your jerk ex is only one thing - the main thing is that chemistry really applies in your case? Or are you just accepting it because he loves you so much and the psychological hurt that you have been through tells you that such relation, you can give little and take more? You answer yourself - no need to reply me on this.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>See? Always and it always causes it - people who never settle their past feelings, thoughts, etc and come to a proper closure - it affects every single relation later on, in your case, which is so obvious. You found yourself liking Q in the end - because....<br>Your current relationship is in pretty bad shape, therefore you seek dependance elsewhere? Think about this - you lasted 3 years and is it only recently then this quarrelling thingy started? Or it has been there for the 3 years? Or when finally you discover this inner liking for Q, then it started, but gradually, brewing?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>Q admitted his feelings for you and you were affected - shows that you too like him, which you have stated above. He chose to go after you despite about the fact that you already have a boyfriend and like 10 cases I have counselled, 9 cases of such guys will avoid like your case above. In my opinon - even in relationship, one must be good losers - he took the risk and failed, thats his own ego to settle. You did what people would claim as the 'right' thing - not to two time.<br><br>Advice?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Since the time when you break off with your jerk ex, you have never take a good solid break to sort out your thinking and feelings. You continued onto relationship after crushes after liking - in which your heart never cease to rest. You are getting tired from your current relation because you the original started chemistry is gone with your current bf, furthermore you heart is screaming for a rest. Think about this, do you seriously think that being together with Q will seriously bring about happiness that neither your past two relation would give and last?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>You said this current relation was a drag - what makes you think being with Q wouldn't turn out the same?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You need a good rest, because you absolutely delete whatever mental, heart, resource you have. Indecisiveness was often cause by past actions that ain't completely settled, which sinks into a mode where you always make, or seemed to make the wrong decisions.<br><br>Last question for the post: Are you for responsiblity or for love with your current bf?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Prays (I will reply you at night after I come back studying)<br><br></div>

Classmate initally but we never talk at all maybe a glance or a smile at times. We never really known until a year later he ask for my number.<br><br>At that time, I just broken off with my previous bf. Quite upset at that time because he betrayed me for another girl and did not wished to admit too for his mistake that he has been flirting around.<br><br>I caught him 3 times in half a year with another girl clubbing and flirt in front of my presence. But i still forgive him cos I love him too much. Until the very last time, I was working during my vacation, I call him and found him sleeping in a girl's home. So I just initated the breakoff after that with an extreme heart broken moment.<br><br>Then comes my current bf H, who is my best friend all along but liked me for a long time too. I didn;t accept him until I really can convince myself that I have forgotten my ex.<br><br>We are now together for almost 3 years. In the meantime, as I mention, I got to know Q. I thought we were like normal friends like everyone else, sat together in lecture, study together..<br><br>As time passes, the relationship between my bf and I gets down the road, we argue almost every week becuase he has a very bad temper and blow it at me at times. I tried very hard to accept it but then fail.<br><br>I do not know it's because that I starting to get tired, or for other reasons as time goes by I found that I fell for Q. I told my bf. He cried and beg me to stay even I like Q and not him. Q at the same time ask me to be with him regardless of my bf...<br><br>But then I'm still with my bf, but in my heart, I'm still with Q. Q was heartbroken because I ask him to leave(my purpose was not to hurt him by my indecisiveness but I do not how to make him understand) and then he did not contact nor talk to me anymore. I'm living in deep misery everyday and could only express my depress through work.....<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br></div></blockquote>I think you should leave both. I think what De|usi0n  say is correct. Your boyfriend maybe due to his ego that he ask you to stay. But I think we cannot forget the fact that he may likes you too somehwere deep down there. Mayeb you can try to talk to your guy about his bad temper. Although loving someone is about accepting his evenything including his bad points, but eveyone has his/her limit of tolorence. When you feel that you are tired of the whole thing, that mean it is time to let go and move on. May sound cruel but it is like that. Another that guy who likes you for many year and even ask you to be with him despite your current boyfriend, I think is not that good also. He is either not serious about liking you or he is not gentleman. How can he stop talking to you because you reject him? HE is asking you to make a choice here and he blame you for what you choose. I am a guy also. So I know what guys think. Some of my friends are like that. Very "hua hua".Haha..<br>Anyway think carefully before you make any choice lah. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>
