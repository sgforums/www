Its an urge he would be feeling ever time he is alone and bored.<br><br>As long as he is not showing any violent tendencies towards u, i really encourage you to standly firmly beside him. Do not reprimand him but instead let him feel that u accept him for having this problem. Let him know that you will be there for him to fight this addiction.<br><br>This may cause much tension within the relationship so its imperative u be very patient with him. he knows he is wrong but does not want to leave the comfort zone having so much of these at his disposal to feed his addiction. If possible encourage him to spend more time with u or at the very least with his friends.<br><br>If he is kept busy all the time, he would be killing two birds with one stone. Fighting his addiction and at the same time making full use of his life. A lot depends on u as the love of his life, for u may hold the key to making him a better person.
