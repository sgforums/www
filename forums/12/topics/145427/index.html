But of course, it's really a personal preference...  At least you can see to it that he doesn't get too perverted or anything...? Being too obsessed with such things ain't really that healthy too..

Much as I sympathise with you, &amp; understand your frustration, I can only tell you what I think.  The ultimate decision, you understand, will lie with you.<br><br>I'm Not some frigid old woman, but I believe we women are entitled to our likes &amp; dislikes.  So are men.  Ok fine, your man thinks his porn is more important?  He can go have candlelit dinners with his porn.  In fact, he can cuddle his porn videos.  You have the right to your own self-respect, &amp; as a bf, he should respect you, &amp; Not take you for a fool.  If he made you a promise to watch them less, he should keep them, Not try to hide it from you, then give you the guilt trip by accusing you of being over-sensitive.  In my opinion, he's totally IN-sensitive.<br><br>I dumped that weirdo porn-obsessed ex &amp; haven't looked back since.  Sure, it may hurt after awhile, but you'll feel good for getting your self-respect back.<br><br>FeowFeow<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by cutegenie:</div><div class="quote_body">I'm in mid 20s... he is going to 30 soon.
