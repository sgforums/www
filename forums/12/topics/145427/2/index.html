I try to talk him out several times about how unhappy and hope that he will watch lesser like what he promises me when I first know about his activities at home.<br><br>But when I access to his PC again, the window that poping out and also the real player's history have shown all the evidence that he did not watch lesser but he try to hide all this from me. Not that I want to dig and protrude onto his privacy. He have the real player and the pop out window to blame.<br><br>upon talkings, arguments and quarellings he still did it. And if he really appreciate me, why then he keep making me repeatedly for the sake of porn???<br><br>He told me that he is a human, he need those porn. And said that all guys are the same, where to find a guy who don't watch it... He stick to his own perception and will carry on with the porn. That's why I said, he can forsake everything for those porn... and that he appreciate it more than anything else...</div>
