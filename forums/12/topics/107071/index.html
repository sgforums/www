            <div class='col-md body'>Well, looking from a guy's point of view. (Sorry i'm not a girl, hope you don't mind.)<br><br>It may be just that the sex is getting boring. Have you tried different styles? There's more than 1 way of having sex after all.<br><br>There are lots of books, websites, on teaching you the various techniques.<br><br>But if sex becomes boring, maybe he's doing it the wrong way *shrugs*<br><br>Happened to my friend once, he actually told me he's getting bored of sex. Hmm, maybe you can compare it to having dessert. Initially when you first get it, its good. But after eating it 4-5 times a week for a year... you can get sick of it i guess.<br><br>Maybe you could lay off it a while too.<br><br>But once again, i may be totally wrong about what you're feeling. Hope i'm able to be at least a little help though.</div>
