              <p>Hi all, Is it advisable to lodge a complaint to my employer through MOM?</p>
              <p>These are the following case,</p>
              <p>1. We have 2 departments one is office (HQ) and the other is doing retail (front line) what is displease me is the office department staffs do not need to punch timecard and their lunchbreak is 1 hr or more while I in my retail department we slog like crazy people yet our break time is 30 mins sharp and we do need to punch timecard when we come to work, go for break, back from break and lastly knock off from work.  Which made me unhappy about the double standard my company doing.</p>
              <p>2. Recently our company HR revised their employees handbook guideline and stated that staff who are late for work even for 1 min will deduct 2 times their salary per min! I'm asking these is this a common practise for other company out there?</p>
              <p>Don't ask me to talk to my GM or my manager cos I really feel there is no point talking to GM as I just a small employee but I typing these to also help my fellow colleagues who are struggling out there.</p>
              <p>Thanks for reading.</p>

              <p>1. You can't argue about fair or not. The HQ people holds a different job scope from you. You as the frontline, you are representing the company, and in other words, the direct ones raking in the profits. Thus, the hours you spend at the shop is proportional to the amount of sales they will get. As for office people, what makes you think they are not slogging? There are times where they have to work OT too if they cannot complete their work. The irregularity of timing is there. Too put it in a nasty way, retail dept is physical, HQ is more of use brain to work. </p>
              <p>If you want to follow office people with their working hours, I think your comapny can close down already.</p>
              <p>2. The moment you sign the contract to agree to work for the company. It means that you are willing to work from e.g. 9am to 7pm, with 30mins of break, 6 days a week for $6 per hour. If you can dishonor your contract and come in at 9.30am, then the company would not be at fault to penalise you, and save their money. Why must they pay you when you are not contributing?  </p>

              <p>Well, resign of cos will resign but not now at the moment cos another 3 months to get AWS.</p>
              <p>For lateness, this is the first time I encounter since I have been working for different company for the past few years but my question is. Is this a common practise in SG company?  </p>
              <p>Than why office no need to punch timecard? while the frontline need even for my management side.</p>

              <p>Hi, I do know HQ people also have their own jobscope but that doesn't mean they are slacker or what. My frontline staffs just need fairness among ourselves, like office people can go lunch break for 1 hr or more while we only have 30 mins btw MOM guildline is 45mins break time &amp; not less.</p>
              <p>Yes, we do sign our appointment paper but inside it didn't stated the break time we can have. Moreover, the HR like suka suka change the company rules etc lateness deduct 2 times salary btw last time don't have this policy at all.</p>

              <p>Hi, I do know HQ people also have their own jobscope but that
              doesn't mean they are slacker or what. My frontline staffs just
              need fairness among ourselves, like office people can go lunch
              break for 1 hr or more while we only have 30 mins btw MOM guildline
              is 45mins break time &amp; not less.</p>
              <p>Yes, we do sign our appointment paper but inside it didn't
              stated the break time we can have. Moreover, the HR like suka suka
              change the company rules etc lateness deduct 2 times salary btw
              last time don't have this policy at all.</p>
              <p> </p>
              </div>

              <p>I don't think its a good idea to bring up to MOM. If the company is able to thwart away your 30mins break issue and counter it. Then you might lose the case which in future, would reflect very badly on you as a troublemaker. How would you then secure a job?</p>
              <p>There must be a reason for the company impose the lateness rule. It could be due to a few black sheep in your company. This I doubt you can argue as company rules can be changed at any time as long as it is reasonable. </p>

              <p>Phantomite first reply really make me think that he belongs to ts HQ company . Although he have a point there but because i too work in front line many times , i can only agree his view to certain level . But to say that HQ pple uses brain while front line use labour or physical that i cannot agree 100% . Because many times HQ pple can make very stupid decision which doesn't make any common sense at all making front line work very complicated or troublesome . And at times you can hear them asking stupid questions about front line work which makes you think whether do they know anything about front line work or even their own work .</p>
              <p>  I am not the type of person whom belive blindly that just because a person hold higher rank or position mean he is a capable person . Because i have seen too many incapable pple holding executive position  myself inclusive of my own supervisor .</p>

              <p>Haha. I don't. In fact, I have also worked before in the front line. You are right to say that not all HQ people are smart and that most of them don't even qualify for a lot of leadership roles. It's easily arguable in that flaw in my post. What I want to point out is that majority of the time, people in the front line, instead of making decisions which would affect budgets and playing a bigger role in decision making, theirs compromise more of the physical work, which includes stock taking, providing service as and when to customers and so on. </p>
              <p>As much as I would like to be less offensive. It is the truth. Why else would the company highlight the difference in qualifications in hiring people for a job scope in retail and for that in an office setting? Why would the wage system be different for those in the front line, and those hiding behind the backdrop? </p>
              <p>I would say, for people in the front line. Its more of common sense. Something that even leaders sitting in their nice cushy chair do not even possess. </p>

              <p>Is this a joke or you didn't even bother to read what I wrote at all? Did I said that I late for work? I only said my company impose a new lateness rules for our employees which I think is unfair to some people. What if I held in a traffic jam? MRT brokedown? So does it justified to deduct our salary 2 times?</p>
