            <div class='col-md body'>hey sdl, I think that it's rather selfoish of u to be wishing them to break up. Ok, it's a natural for some one to feel this way.. but it's just not rite. Sometimes when u really love someone , u shld be happy becoz u see the happiness in the the person that u love. maybe that's u say that it's a crush that's y.<br><br>But being born in the same yr, it's alright. It's only a few mths difference. In fact my gf is older than me by a couple of mths too.. I mean if a few mths matters so much to u, then wat will happen to pple who are born in Dec and Nov?? Even worst guys who are born in late Dec. I dun think it's the end of the story for them.<br><br>Anyway girls dun go for physical characteristic that much. They do choose, maturity and character. U can be good looking and be rich, and haf a line of gers who wants to take ur sports car for a ride. But hey, they will grow out of it. Becoz, there' still something in u that is missing.. To them having a great body or looks or $$$ will become superficial when they grow up. Even to guys too. We do look at girls with good looks, but our gf and wives may not be that great, becoz we will learn to appreciate the peron of their character, rather than the physique part. Developed ur character, and learn to think maturity. TO care for her by one corner. To wish her happiness. That's maturity.. Not wishing that they will break up soon. Apologise if u feel that I haf hurt ur feelings.<br><br>------------------<br>Barely Bearing Berry Belly Bear</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>as usual, the straight forward, but ever caring bear. =)<br><br>sdl:<br><br>actually, again, i agree with bear. (he seems to be making a lotta sense) hee~ coz c-riously, when u love someone, thou it's hard to let her go, u will still find urself wishing her happiness always. u'll find urself wanting her to be happy, and as long as she's happy, u will be happy. that shud be sorta how it feels to be in love with someone lo.......at least, that's how i look at it. anyway, i may not be older than u, or even ur same age, but i have had my fair share of crushes, and i believe, i will still have a few more crushes till i really meet my one true love. till then, crushes are crushes. somehow, when u have a crush on someone, u sorta wanta "possess" her, u feel jealous whenever she walks with someone else, or talk to someone else. u just sorta feel she belongs to u and u alone, but remember, she is not yet ur girlfriend, and she is definitely not urs........mebbe u dun feel/think this way, but wat i'm trying to put across to u, is that it's natural for u to feel this way, in a sense lo, coz u are only having a crush, and u r most prolly not in love........<br><br>opps.....sorry for being so straightforward......=) hee~ oh, and oso for being so crappy....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>oh by the way, just some thing else to add....<br><br>sdl: u are not a loser, and stop calling urself one. u are wat u think u are. remember that.... so if u think u're a loser, then u are. okiez. 2nd thing would be that there is no such thing as the right girl or the wrong girl. i mean, as defined in ur context la. coz u are just having a crush, and a few months doesn't really matter. c-riously.......there's no wrong ger to like and no right ger to like. u can like any ger, but of coz, there is and will be da one, who would be da right ger for u. =)<br><br>lastly, dun give up hope la. it's not the end of the world yet ma.....=) think POSITIVE!</div>

Had this sort of feeling before.. my ex just walked away from me even though how hard I tried to save it. Even gave her my last $2/- for the mth, when she told me that she's broke and is seeing this other guy who is really rich. Said this in my final words to her, "I'll wait for u, if things doesn't work out." That was then.... Sorry for this part that is totally unrelated to the help that I'm suppose to gif to u sdl.

Especially when shcool work is going to give you a lot of stress next year...<br><br>I, too had my problems during my sec 4 dayz. Not really problems, but I played too much... Never really bothered about my work till, I saw my mid-year results, which gave me a fright. Can't believe myself, that I'm such failure... haa haa...<br><br>So better not be naughty and too playful.. if not you will end up like me... Get extra stress, and panic.... haa haa..<br><br>------------------<br>Barely Bearing Berry Belly Bear</div>
