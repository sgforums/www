            <div class='col-md body'>The root of your problem seems to stem from your working which leaves you physically drained. This physical fatigue is translated into your lack of interest in your studies. If you cannot quit your work altogether to focus on your studies, try to get a flexi time job or one that requires you to work on weekends only. You could also try to apply for a study grant. Go check with your school's administration. You may want to approach the Lee Foundation for a grant. Go see your MP too. However tough things are, you should persevere to at least complete your course since you are already in Year 2 and get the diploma. It'll stand you in better stead should you decide to pursue a full-time work life..... All the best!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>
