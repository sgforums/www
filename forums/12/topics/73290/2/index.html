            <div class='col-md body'>give yourself a chance. if u believe that u can never be with the person u love most, most likely u will not, not to mention it's gonna be unfair to whoever u're with.  like u said, love never dies, it just lingers on. have u ever wondered why we never seems to really get over a relationship? i believe it's because for every failed relationships we gave a piece of ourselves to the other party, and for every new relationship, we are given a piece of their heart.<br><br>between two person in love, there should be a certain level of trust and honesty. i sincerely wish u the best and god bless  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by edithpiaf:</div><div class="quote_body"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> Dear tots, i am in the same situation as you are.<br><br>i loved my ex dearly and to me, love never dies, you can never fall out of love and it lingers.<br><br>I even joined the same school as he did, but it's been a year and 4 months already- and of course, if he wanted to patch things up, it would have happened long ago.<br><br>I know that having a boyfriend while thinking about my ex is not fair to my boyfriend, but it's a complicated situation.<br><br>I wanted to give myself a chance to start anew and a chance to my now boyfriend.<br><br>I don't think i regretted this decision because i find myself loving him more each day, and i've decided to change schools if it means that i won't 'bump' into him along the corridors anymore.<br><br>I guess it's just one of the things in life- and you can never be with the person you love most.<br><br>remember that.</div></blockquote></div>
