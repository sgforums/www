By pretending that he's already dead... By keeping yourself busy.... Many others...<br><br>If you can, maybe you'll like to choose to 'face it' instead? Pick up the phone or something... Call your ex. and let him know that you still kinda miss him. Tell him that even though so, you're already attached and feel that that's the best for you and you're not going back to him... Tell him that you have to move on... Then MOVE ON with life as it is... If you feel that you don't have enough courage to do that, there's an alternate plan... You can either write and mail him a letter or e-mail him instead? Even less of that? There're also people who choose to just voice up to another person... Either a friend, a stranger you don't really know or ask to speak up to someone and let him allow you to pretend that he's your bf at that moment of talk... You can also just write something, fold it in a bottle and release it to the sea... (but don't be caught littering...) And similar things like that...<br><br>All the best. Know what's in store for you now and what's no longer in your hand... You know the path. You just have to walk it?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
