              <p>Your mum's action reflects insecurity and lack of trust in you. I hope you're within the age group of 12 to 16, that's because when you're at this age, problems and any developmental corrections can be done.</p>
              <p>Try the following: the following proposed action are mean to create rapport and trust between a mother and her children</p>
              <p>1) If you're going out with friends, tell your mum what time you will be back. On your part, reach home before on the agreed timing. If she's worry about you hanging out late, ensure her that you are with your friends</p>
              <p>2) In cases where a fight started, do not fight with her, look into her eyes. The right thing to do is to stay away from her as far as possible in the house and remain silient. Should you try to raise your voice to shoutback or argue, chances are, what i'm typing is not put to great use.</p>
              <p>Such problems, as I mentioned, arises from lack of trust and insecurity. You will have to ask yourself how defiant are you when you're with your mum. The trick is to let know that you are trustable and affirm her with your actions</p>

              <p>And kids should nv hit their parents unless the parents get physical and start hacking u wif chopper. And esp not if you are a guy and the parent is a lady. You could cause serious injuries. Mai fwen punched his cupboard instead of his mum and there's still a HOLE there. Don't do that k.</p>

              <p><br>we wonder what will happen in the future the days when you are the parent of your own children, your son/ daughter might just wallop and whack you in the balls, then when they start to work, they will not give you any parent maintenance/ household money...etc.</p>
              <p>though your parents lack parenting skills perhaps it's due to their own parents-child relationship when they are young themselves many years ago. what you are lacking yourself are filial piety, manners, maturity, moral, civil behaviour and civic virture. afterall without your parents, you will not be even borned on Earth.<br><br>how will you feel as a father (husband) coming home from work in the future to hear your child kick his/ her mother (your wife)?</p>
              <p>you can change friends, but you can't change parents. i myself was used to be caned often when i was a child, but never ever once do i ever hit my parents.</p>

              <p>You are a teenager. That means you are much stronger, you may hurt your mother. Please refrain from physical violence. Many mothers nowadays are not trained to be good mothers, there is no manual and schools don't teach people how to raise your kids. So, your mother may not be doing the proper thing in raising you and your siblings. i find her using a stick to beat you, a bit excessive. These days, the ang moh in America don't even lay a hand on their kids, at most they discipline their kids by grounding them.</p>
              <p>However in your case, you should not hit back your mother. Instead you should study hard, and tell yourself you want to grow to be a better person and not be like your mother.</p>
              <p>There are ways to release your anger, hitting back is not one of them. If you accidentaly hurt your mother, neighbours may call the police. Perhaps you should consider taking a pile of magazines or newspapers throw them across the room to vent your anger and disagreement but don't throw pottery, glass or furniture as this may damage expensive items or hurt somebody. A useful trick is to buy some plastic containers of talcum powder. Whenever your mom slaps you, you should show your disagreement by throwing talcum powder all over the place. I think slapping is quite excessive. THe limits of physical disciplining should be canning or slapping one's backside.</p>
              <p>I don't think anybody here is able to find a solution for you because you know your mother better than any of us. You have to find a way to reconcile your differences with your mom. Some moms can be insensitive, maybe they don't see your point of view or they are too busy or too stressed up at office to think of your feelings. If you are able to find a way to reach out to your mom, then it benefits your upbringing and makes your life a lot more happier. The journey is a hard journey but hey no life is easy.  </p>

              Your mum  may have frustrations of her own. Perhaps she had a really bad childhood, or an unhappy marriage . Even if you are sloppy , disobedient and irritating, she could have scolded you in anger in many ways , but not in vulgarities. For a mother to scold you "poo bor" she is actually scolding herself! after all she is your "bor"(mother) so to speak. In my opinion a mother who spews vulgarities  must be very badly brought up herself.
              
              On your part you could perhaps reflect upon yourself as to making things  easier for yourself  and her,  by being less careless  and also perhaps showing her some care and concern. maybe that might change her ways and attitude towards you.
              
              If indeed she is just the way she is, a bad tempered vulgar woman , then you have little choice  but to put up with her and try as far as possible to avoid conflict with her .( after all she is still your mother)  In the meantime study hard, so that in future you can get a good job and be independent , so that in future you need not have to live with her and put up with  such vulgarities!

              <p>The reasons for your mum's behavoir is not easily understood by you or bystanders like us, since we do not know her history or situation.</p>
              <p>For now, try to avoid her (stay outside or be in your rooom), study hard and do part-time work. Good studies results will help to assure her that you are a good kid, and part-time work can help to reduce your mum's financial worries.</p>
              <p>When you are more mature and financially self-sufficient, you can then explore other options.</p>
