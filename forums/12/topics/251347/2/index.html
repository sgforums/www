And the group felt that because they know Chuan and Derrie personally, and that Jenna is a newbie.  So they decide to comfort and pressure Derrie to stick with her man.  At the same time, exerting pressures of Jeanna, flamming her too, at the internet group.</div></blockquote>Oh man u guys are gonna love this.<br><br>First of all , Because they  ' Chuan made a move on Jenna and they subsequently continued their hanky panky at Chuan's car.' Because THEY both WITHOUT any rejection , which , i didnt see in this case scenario that Jeana rejected , i do not see why we should condemn Chuan alone.<br><br>As you all are aware that since chuan appears remorseful , it is given the benefit of the doubt that he is INDEED remorseful. And since like this case , Chuan n Derrie know each other personally , and that the group , who knows Chuan personally , will by common sense support Chuan.<br><br>Jeanna can voice out her problems , can go to the authorities. Thats why like any democratic system with a democratic judiciary system , there are neutral ppl , like E.g Juries . Since the internet is no place for 1 man to  pass down sentence , i say all this is irrelevant until produced in the court n evidence of the case presented and the jury decides.But since no jury system... hell~ lol<br><br>My personal advice , is to be aware of this situation , and decide for yourself what is right n wrong,  and who is right n wrong.Your experience and wisdom dictates the outcome of your decion , and some thorough research as well.. he he. There will be always 2 sides. And you are responsible for your own actions and decisions. Only time will tell whether u are right or wrong. And I for one is not responsible for anothers stupidity. And i wont say ' I told you so' .
