Ask once liao .. you answer is wishy washy... then what do you want him to do. Ask you every month?<br>I think its your turn to ask back ...

He may be your best fren.. Being able to share every deepest secret with you and vice versa.. But you got to think in the long run if you and him are the person meant to be..<br><br>There is a saying.. Your wedding day is only that particular day. A marriage last a life time.. Can you be 100% sure that you will be able to live and tolerate this man for the rest of your life?<br><br>If your ans to this is yes.. My advice is don wait for him to ask you the question again. The next time he holds your hand. Make that acknowledgement by holding his hands firmly. That should give him enuff hint that you are his..<br><br>Good Luck.</div>
