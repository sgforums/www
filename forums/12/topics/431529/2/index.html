              <p>Everyone is afraid of being getting hurt again, no matter how old they are.<br>Even at my age, yes, I’m still afraid of getting hurt.<br>But being in love and in a relationship is about taking the chance. There may be hurt, there may not be.<br>Each time, we fall, we get up stronger.<br>Just allow as much time as possible to understand each other better.<br>Don’t do things you’re not comfortable with (yes, I’m also referring to sex). Don’t give in because you’re afraid of losing him. No guy is worth it if he uses sex as a bargaining chip (sorry, guys).<br>I was an introvert too, and I understand how insecure you feel. How you’re afraid of being alone, without that someone to love, to be loved.<br>But I assure you, there will always be many more out there who are suitable for you. I’m not saying he is not suitable for you. He may be. Take the time to know each other better. Talk more about each other.<br>Did i say I was an introvert? Yes. Build your self confidence. Attend speech classes, acting classes, classes that put you in front of many people. It’s scary, yes, but you’ll overcome it.<br>Keep smiling.</p>

              TS,
              Being mature, being responsible - u can be whatever u want to be and do with your life. It is nobody's business as long as it does not encroach or take away what another is or wants to be. Someone who cares for u will allow u to be and of course, by allowing u to be, they cannot assume responsiblity for what u are and do. That has to come from u.
              
              As long as u understand that you are being mature and being responsible - u can b e whatever u want to. The maturity and the responsiblity of being oneself is more than enough to see u thru the course of everyday living. Things may be 'ok' and yet 'not be ok' - but u will manage.
              
              Simply put, if u love, just love , why wonder what is going to happen tomorrow. Of course, it is assuming/presupposing u have it, one can only give or share what one has. By that I mean, what u have INSIDE of u.
              
              Are u loving? are u kind? Are u grateful?  Being kind, being loving, being grateful - u have nothing to lose. Cos it is your state of mind and being - u never will lose it. It was created from within u.
              
              Cos u are so ''self''-fullfilled in you (eg. love,acceptance,responsibility, esteem ...., that u no longer need to beg that someone love u , appreciate u.
              The other may stay/not stay or another may come or not come - it is no longer relevant.
              
              PS - To marry someone or to be with another cos one feels that the other makes me happy, takes care of me, or cos of security or other reasons is consigning oneself to a life of fear and anxiety. This is the predicament of many - unreconciled needs within and expecting the other to ... imagine when both are in the same boat! Love never hurts, it is expectation of what another ought to be, what life ought to be, what love ought to be and so many ''sick'' thoughts in one's head that makes living miserable.

              <p>Comon lah ah xiao gu gu,</p>
              <p>There is phrase saying nothing is free, that include love, you hv to make sacrifices, money and time for it, and nobody put a gun on guys head to say you must go after this gal or that gal, it all the initiative of the guy, if he do fall for it, no problem, but too bad, most or infact, all guys had their weaknesses, and the most common is sex, even an emperor can lose his dynasty to a woman, not to say a typical layman.</p>
              <p>For we gals, our time of beauti sexy and pure is only from 15yo to maybe 28yo, after that, we just go for a free fall into the abyss aging, give birth and become fat fat..so if during this period we do not chop if there is an opportunity, but the time 40yo, the chopper also blunt already. By chopping, does mean we do not like the guy, after a few outing of chopping and togetherness, who knows, maybe we do fall for him. So, it could be worth the guy investment, after all, you dun go after girl without a credit card.</p>
              <p>What toy with feeling, there are more guys out there toying with our gals feeling, from obedient club to swinger club to those old uncles karaoke club to angel club. Look at those guys flirting with gals, wonder if they ever think of their gfs or wives at home who are lonely and doing all the chores.</p>
