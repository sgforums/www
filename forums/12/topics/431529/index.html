              <p>I am a 24 year old girl. I am much of a introvert kinda person. I do have many friends, but I am very much reserved, like the quiet one in a group.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When, I was 21, I had dated a guy who was a year older than me. We were dating for about 2 years and then recently, he out od a sudden, jus ditched me. I was very very shattered, cos I had made up my mind about him as the ONE for me. Oh well, I guess some things happen for a reason.</p>
              <p>And jus a few months after this break-up, I had another guy showing interest in me. This guy, however is 32 years old. And, he sounds dead serious about me. Am afraid that I am falling for him. But, am holding back alot, cos there are a two reasons. Firstly, I am afraid that he might also hurt me. Being a soft natured person, I don't think that I would be able to handle another break-up. Secondly, I am not sure if the age gap between me and him is acceptable. I prefer an older guy as I assume they might take care of their girl well and can be able to understand us cos they are much more matured. More like be able to guide us.But, an age gap of 8 years, is it okie?</p>
              <p>Haiz.. I need some help.. Should I trust this guy? He is saying that he wants to marry me, he would take care of me.. He is very honest about himself, told me the truth about his past and all. Am kind of impressed cos I think it takes a true man to admit all his mistakes..</p>
              <p>Hmm, so what do people out there think?</p>

              <p>Age is a number.. and it's also not a good guage of maturity. You have to get to know him.. to see if his maturity level is a good match for you.</p>
              <p>Age does not determine probablity of a guy hurting a girl. It's all in his character.</p>
              <p>Also, we all go through life phases... where are you vs where is he ?</p>
              <p>A guy his age.. may be ready to settle down..but will you be in the short term ?</p>
              <p>While he may be ready for a serious relationship.. are you ready ?</p>
              <p>He may have gone through several more relationships than you.. are you sure you have done enough sampling of what's out there ?</p>
              <p>While he may be more experienced , he may also come with more baggages.... do you have the maturity level to handle em ?</p>
              <p>I do agree that it's more fulfilling to date older guys..because of what they can offer,  but 8 years is not a huge difference.</p>

              <p>32 yo is not uncle lah. 8 years is not a big age gap.</p>
              <p>In fact, I have a few friends who married older guys ranging from 9-18 years age difference... so far.. they are happier than when they dating guys around their age.</p>
              <p>Girls mature faster than guys.. so having a guy older is actually more preferable lah. IMO.</p>

              <p>Aiya sista, guys are like buffet, it for you to pick and choose, each gal got each preferences, if you like older ones go ahead, no bad, especially if u manage a rich old one who had one leg on the coffin already, then you will be rich soon.

              <p>On the other hand, gals like me like younger guys, those blur blur virgin looking type, new birdie in town and gong gong type with gal one, like this than I can control over him.

              <p>Anyway, there is a wide spread buffet of men to suit each gal liking. But once you choosed one of them, make sure you get the correct one, dun go eat buffet blindly, you need to pay the penalty for not consuming. So if the took the wrong guy, too bad.

              <p>Once hurt does not mean forever must keep away.</p>
              <p>Let me tell you a sad story ( not me hor ;0 )</p>
              <p>A guy once like a gal but got no guts to go after her. He finally pick up the courage to buy a present for her. He places the present on her table and hides.</p>
              <p>She comes along and saw the present, and ask around if anyone knows who is that person that left the present on her table. No one admits.</p>
              <p>She threw the present away and the guy was totally heartbroken. He sworn never to fall in love again and was all alone till he die.</p>
              <p>Moral of the story: If you never gave love another chance, you will never know the great  love can be. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There is no such thing that the boy or girl is the one only in your life or he or she is the must have.</p>

              <p>Most of the troubles like this one is self limitation.</p>
              <p>The one that comes along must be THE ONE to marry.</p>
              <p>It would be better if the youngsters could say Tom is ok, but wish he were more dynamic and ambitious, Dick can do, but have the awful habit of calling his mother for everything, Harry is great, but he is too full of himself.</p>
              <p>They need to date a wider range of people, instead of just THE ONE.</p>
              <p>How would they choose a car, a TV set, a PSP? They buy the first one they see? They marry the only boy/girl they know?</p>

              <p>1. Older guy doesn't mean wiser, more matured, less shallow.</p>
              <p>2. Having said that - nothing wrong with a 8 year age gap IF the guy is sensible, matured, and sincere.</p>
              <p>3. Having said that - there's no guarantee for a long lasting commitment, not even marriage.</p>
              <p>4. Having said that - some things are worth the risk. Is finding true love worth risking another broken heart for you?</p>
              <p>5. Lastly, don't step into a relationship because of what that guy SAYS to you. Go into it knowing how you feel for him youself.</p>

              Everyone is afraid of being getting hurt again, no matter how old they are.
              Even at my age, yes, I'm still afraid of getting hurt.
              But being in love and in a relationship is about taking the chance. There may be hurt, there may not be.
              Each time, we fall, we get up stronger.
              Just allow as much time as possible to understand each other better.
              Don't do things you're not comfortable with (yes, I'm also referring to sex). Don't give in because you're afraid of losing him. No guy is worth it if he uses sex as a bargaining chip (sorry, guys).
              I was an introvert too, and I understand how insecure you feel. How you're afraid of being alone, without that someone to love, to be loved.
              But I assure you, there will always be many more out there who are suitable for you. I'm not saying he is not suitable for you. He may be. Take the time to know each other better. Talk more about each other.
              Did i say I was an introvert? Yes. Build your self confidence. Attend speech classes, acting classes, classes that put you in front of many people. It's scary, yes, but you'll overcome it.
              Keep smiling.

              <p> </p>
              <p>However what you are articulating to TS is only to identify what kind of guy to 'chop' ? You are seriously stereotyping guys of different ages, what this age guy is rich, that age guy is poor, this age guy one leg into coffin ..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You are æ–°èŠ±è�‰ and we guys are buffet ? Wah piang eh.. Mind what you say can anot? I truly find your comments quite insulting towards guys loh. Its not like you are the most chio girl in the world that every guy will fall by your feet leh. Save some grace for yourself please.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I hate to spell it out to you, but perhaps you are young and pretty now, you can have a lot of guys at your beck and call. But girl's beauty fade away very soon one loh. A few years down the road, once you find that you are depreciating, if you are not married yet, you'll be forced to consider your options and be glad that even a guy wants you by then !!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>å¥½æ™¯ä¸�é•¿ï¼Œ æœ‰æ²¡æœ‰å�¬è¿‡?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I dont find myself a lesser mortal if i am not as rich as some guys loh. As a guy, the most important thing he needs is confidence, sincerity, and be hardworking. Do the best as he can for the girl he cares about.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you are basing your assumptions about guys just by how much they own, then others will also judge you just for your looks.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why are you linking the government to this issue? I do not find the relevance in terms of rship and politics loh.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And for god's sake, why drag fathers into the picture?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>DONT blame parents ok? I can give you the most screwed up parents, but as long as you want to stay good, no matter what you will stay Good !! You can have the best and most elitist of all parents, but you could end up a no good scoundrel. Even Lee Hsien Loong's son did a number of fked up things loh.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Whether a person is bad or not is a PERSONAL choice, it has nothing to do with the mum and dad !! You are Responsible for your own actions !!'</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you want to give advice, at least give those that are sensible and really useful lah..</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">You are æ–°èŠ±è�‰ and we guys are buffet ? Wah piang eh.. Mind what you say can anot? I truly find your comments quite insulting towards guys loh. Its not like you are the most chio girl in the world that every guy will fall by your feet leh. Save some grace for yourself please.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">I hate to spell it out to you, but perhaps you are young and pretty now, you can have a lot of guys at your beck and call. But girl's beauty fade away very soon one loh. A few years down the road, once you find that you are depreciating, if you are not married yet, you'll be forced to consider your options and be glad that even a guy wants you by then !!</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">å¥½æ™¯ä¸�é•¿ï¼Œ æœ‰æ²¡æœ‰å�¬è¿‡?</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">I dont find myself a lesser mortal if i am not as rich as some guys loh. As a guy, the most important thing he needs is confidence, sincerity, and be hardworking. Do the best as he can for the girl he cares about.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">If you are basing your assumptions about guys just by how much they own, then others will also judge you just for your looks.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Why are you linking the government to this issue? I do not find the relevance in terms of rship and politics loh.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">And for god's sake, why drag fathers into the picture?</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">DONT blame parents ok? I can give you the most screwed up parents, but as long as you want to stay good, no matter what you will stay Good !! You can have the best and most elitist of all parents, but you could end up a no good scoundrel. Even Lee Hsien Loong's son did a number of fked up things loh.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Whether a person is bad or not is a PERSONAL choice, it has nothing to do with the mum and dad !! You are Responsible for your own actions !!</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Wah xiaogougou! Totally agree with you. Nice one!</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">TS, you shouldn be too influenced by the comments here. Matters of heart is very hard to say.. you're the one in the situation. Have to see for yourself. Takes time.. don't rush into things. </p>
