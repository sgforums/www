Though I cannot deny the possibility that she might still be interested in you totally... But CHANCES are... It doesn't have to mean anything...<br><br>Believing that she's still interested in you and that you should go after her JUST BECAUSE she contacted you again would only cause further confusions and agony... Take my words... She've probably just gotten over the arguement... If she's REALLY INTERESTED, REST ASSURED that there's a high chance that she'll be dropping you MORE OBVIOUS HINTS even if you don't react to her....</div>

That seems just about right for her. She needs the security. However... Security can be given in the form of good friends, or just a normal friend, not necessary a boyfriend.<br><br>I wouldn't think too much about it. Chances are she's just 'using' you. A bit crude, but that seems like what she's doing.<br><br>Be careful of girls like this..</div>
