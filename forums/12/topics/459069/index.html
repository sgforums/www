              <p>Running away from home is bleak future. Maybe should wait until you r 18 or 22. After NS, find a job, only then can move out. At the moment you have to make do wit h your situation. Chinese always have a saying "Yan !". Which means Tolerate.</p>
              <p>No choice.</p>
              <p>If you run, where you gonna stay? Shelters? They will provide you home but without education you are a goner. There is no future.</p>
              <p>Perhaps your step mom abuse you. Perhaps you father is a drunkard. But you don't have a choice. You have to stay until you are independent.</p>

              <p>you are 18yrs old, how long do you think you can run away? If home have some issues that you cannot go home, seek help.. from social welfare or FSC...</p>
              <p>If is you who having problem, then what can you do? If have money, then you wont be having a problem of where to stay.</p>
              <p>So i presuming you have no money, without money, how long can you last outside? If your family have make a missing person report, whoever let you stay, you may be getting them in trouble also.</p>
              <p>If by some chance you can stay outside, you are at the age liable to NS, with reporting.. You are chargable for desertion, alos become bo tai bo ji kenna also..</p>
              <p>so my advice is, face it... if home have some issues that you are force to run away, seek help with proper authority, family service centre is a good place to start.</p>
              <p>If you are the one that have problem, wake up and go home.</p>

              <p><br><strong>Plan ahead</strong>. Think of what you will do if any part of your plan goes wrong, and make excuse for everything:</p>
              <dl><dd>If you have someone helping you run away, and have a safe place to stay with someone you can trust, you're pretty much set. However, if that's not a possibility, where will you take shelter?</dd><dd>What will you do if you get sick?</dd><dd>What if you are caught?</dd><dd>What will you eat?</dd></dl>
              <p>If you still have $100 left, spend $30 and go Gaint to buy tent. Then, ahead for sengkang riverside park. It's a lonely location except for noisy road works(near TPE).</p>

              <p>Wear a cap or something that reasonably covers your head/face when traveling on a train because the CCTV footage in the local train station will be checked.</p>
              <p>If you're looking for food that's free, try looking in grocery stores, they often give away free samples. Try the bakery section, for free cookies or cake, or whatever or if there is one in your area try Costco. Grab a cart and tell the people checking that your mom's waiting for you or whatever. You can also try going through the customer service area, but go to the bathroom before trying the main shopping area. And look like you actually have a purpose. Don't hang about.</p>
              <p>Do not bring your cell phone (unless you can change your number, or the SIM card), debit or credit cards with you, as these can be used to trace your location. If you need to make call to someone, borrow a phone or use a payphone. If you need to purchase something, pay with cash.</p>
              <p>If you don't have a place to stay, you'll have to find shelter elsewhere. Try finding a reasonably safe spot under a bridge, in an alcove, <a title="Squat in Abandoned Property" href="http://sgforums.com/Squat-in-Abandoned-Property"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">in an abandoned building somewhere</span></span></a>, or perhaps in a public building that stays open 24/7. Public libraries, churches, college buildings, airports, and train stations are all possible options</p>
