Wat's the big deal abt looking for part time job&gt;?  Dun expect ur mum to feed u till u die ok?  It's time to learn to be independent.  At least u are not one of the victims being abused by parents.  Talk so much, go reflect ba. </span></div>

Do you have to be working for now? If you have to, then you would have to? I would rather see the job search as a separate issue from the trip....<br><br>Hmm... HK trip and she's not even sponsoring your idol stuff...? Well... My mum won't even wanna bring me to Genting when I was young... Bringing almost the whole family along except me and my dad whom she really disliked... Do you know what 'hate' is...? I think you're still far from understanding what it is.... Meanwhile, why not be more appreciative of what you've got?</div>
