            <div class='col-md body'>Put yourself into his shoes. If u are the guy, do u have the courage to confess? DO U HAVE THE COURAGE TO PURSUE UR LOVE?<br><br>Normally, short guys tend to be more inferior, especially those below 170cm in height. (Dun flame me, I am also below 170cm). As they feel that they are below average or rather they feel that they are looking weird.<br><br>Ok my point is ur guy friend NEEDS A LOT OF COURAGE AND PRIDE to confess to u. Agree? The fact that he confess shows that he is sincere about the r/s and he is willing to endure all the unforeseen hurting comments (namely u find him short)  that maybe coming from u.<br><br>What's matters now is WHETHER u like him a not, u want to give him the chance a not. If u despise him for his height, then don't regret ur choice. It is hard to find someone u truly love. It is even harder for u to find someone who truly love u.<br><br>Make the right choice.
