            <div class='col-md body'>TS,<br>I think since you started such a topic, it's clearly in your mind that you're bothered by the height issue... I think if you cant accept it, then forget about this "potential" r/s. Because since its a concern to you now (lets assume that the r/s will be a long one, till marriage and stuff), this issue will continue to pose a problem to you later on in the r/s.and what if a taller better guy appears? It will be even more unfair to him.<br><br>I'm the same height as you also. I had an ex who's like 3 to 4 CM shorter than me, in this situation, he was the one who's bothered.. I couldn't wear heels and stuff. And he threw temper at me during his bad hair days coz he felt short (I am not trying to say that your guy friend will behave like this in future)...it's just an example of a person in a r/s being bothered about height issues.. in the end i felt restricted and he felt unhappy.. so whats the point?<br><br>It's just human nature that most girls want taller(if not the same height) guys than them.. so that they will feel more secure.  Its just like guys not wanting bigger size and taller girls coz they will feel intimidated or something ( friend told me this)..<br><br>But if your love(if any) for him is really that strong (U will be able to accept him for what he is,not see it as a flaw, but being unique), you wouldn't be thinking of such an issue, and posting here..</div>

Now I try to be a good gal, most boys will be afraid of me when they see me, cos of piecing and tattoos here and there, when i visit their house, their parent will chase me out and scream at them. So, no bf lor.<br><br>For once wrong, it takes a life span to repent, behold 666 Angel lucifer, the Rise of the Satan.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by mood_inn:</div><div class="quote_body">I know they say that love trascends all boundaries. I used to believe it too, until my male best friend confessed that he likes me!<br><br>I am 173cm, while he is 12cm shorter than me. He is also of a smaller build than me. We were very good friends for 2 years, and we can click really well together. But I've never thought that the lines will ever be crossed.<br><br>He's really a great guy, and he has done a lot to win my heart. I can say I'm quite touched by his sincerity but I'm not sure yet if I really like him as a boyfriend. The main deterrent is actually the height issue. =S<br><br>There were many times when we went out that people mistook him for my younger brother when he is actually a few years older than me. He had absolutely no problem with our height difference, and I respect him for his courage. But I'm not sure about myself.. I didn't tell him that height was a problem because I'm afraid it might hurt him.<br><br>Perhaps we're socialized that guys should be taller and bigger than girls in a relationship.  How can I garner the courage to break through societal norms? Am I being very superficial here? =(<br></div></blockquote>Hi,<br><br>I believe I'm in a similar situation to you. I'm 25, guy and am sort of dating a girl 5 yrs my junior. I'm only 1.7, she's 1.78. 1.7m for a guy's height in Singapore is pretty average, just that she's much taller than usual.<br><br>I understand your situation because these are sentiments echoed by my girl also. Though she's taller than me, I realise she has very good internal 'software' (aka character) which I'm attracted to, plus we can click very well, that's what made me want to pursue her. Her looks are acceptable to me but most importantly is she has a very good character which is rare in most girls i've dated.<br><br>Physical constraints<br>Our height difference cannot be helped much, save for she wearing flats most of time to minimize difference but I will not restrict what she wears as I'm a very confident guy and know me giving her the 'security' feeling is a package of physical, emotional n mental. in fact, when she wears flats, she's only a forehead taller than me. So since i'm down on the physical side abit, i've to make up for emotional n mental. Fortunately for me, I'm of the muscular kind, with broad shoulders so it lessens the physical constraints.<br><br>I understand that women need to date a taller guy to feel more secure. It's perfectly normal, girls like to feel that they are protected by their guy. But like i said, the security factor is actually a package of emotional, mental n physical. Actually once we sit down, we are the same, she just has very nice long legs <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">. When she raised her concerns to me, she told me she likes me n knows we'll have a great time together, but the height thing is something very difficult which she has tried in the past by dating shorter guys but has failed. I just have to be understanding and tell her that the height thing is something she has to learn to accept and maybe even appreciate for its quirkiness.<br><br>I think your problem is similar to my girl on the physical constraints. But like what i told her, she has to learn to accept it and maybe even appreciate. You have to do the same also if you think this guy is worth it.<br><br>the Friends to soulmates factor<br>I think this problem is actually the worse problem for you. Basically you 2 have been friends for too long already. The friends bond has been forged for too strong already. It's very difficult to break it and try to form something else. Have you heard of the ladder theory? Go find out about it. Respect it. Statistically it fails for most couples who think they can beat the statistical odds against them. I have exp in this area which has tell me that frens shd alwaz stay as frens n gfs as gfs. If it doesn't happen then, it wun happen now. So dun spoil the friendship coz the awkwardness will kill most friendships eventually.<br><br>When i met this girl, I knew i would like her and want to know her more than just frens. So it was easier on her also so she could start seeing me as potential 'bf-material'. The frens trap is very real and most guys think of being the nice friend first n delay being the 'bf-material'. I think this is your problem more. Your feelings towards him are more of gratitude and buddiness that he has been there for you. I have female buddiness which i'll be there to support them and even literally lend a shoulder for them to cry on when they are down, but we are clear that it's nvr anything more. Of coz when emotions are high and mixed like when u were sad coz of a previous r/s failure, u could possibly mistake this guy's feelings for something more.<br><br>For my case, I believe she might be considering giving us a try but i'm patient and expect nothing but hope for everything.<br><br>all the best to yours. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
