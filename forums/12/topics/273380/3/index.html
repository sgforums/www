            <div class='col-md body'>Hi there, my hubby is shorter by a whole head. But we got round this problem by (1) me wearing only flats and (2) he adding some invisible heels in his shoes  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> . But we are like soulmates and can talk about anything and sometimes say and think the same things at the same time.<br>We still hold hands like other couples and when you are lying down, everything same height lor. Definitely no deficit in the ahem, manhood department.<br>Married 17 years already and still going strong (praise God). I think key is communication, give and take and understanding and it is a necessity in every relationship whether short or tall.<br>It depends on whether You wanna take that leap of faith or not.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi.....<br><br>I think you might not really like him.....<br><br>I mean, this height issue, should not be an issue if you really like him and are attracted to him enough.<br><br>So I believe its not just about height issue.....but more overall.....that you are still hesitating about the prospect of turning your friendship relationship into a romantic dating relationship. You are not really attracted to him.<br><br>I believe u have to think and reflect deeply....and if u still feel hesitant...its best to just let him know, and just maintain the friendship.<br><br>Meat Pao.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes i agreed with Meat Pao... I think u are too used of being a bosom friend with him. Though he has been doing all the things to win ur love, you still cannot accept him becoz u feel thats the "brotherly" love instead of affection... but then thats how i feel, u may think otherwise... juz my 10 cents worth... good luck (;</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey guys, and girls..<br><br>Thanks for all your comments, advices, inspirational examples and well wishes. Really appreciate them a lot. =)<br><br>I agree with you, Meat ball. Perhaps it was due to the unwillingness to break the friendship that I hesitated. My friend confessed to me twice. He first confessed a year ago, but I rejected him because I could not bring myself to cross the lines of friendship. Ever since he got rejected, we sort of grew apart. He deliberately distanced himself away to get over me.<br><br>During this period, I got involved with another guy (who also happened to be shorter than me, by 6cm). I invested a lot of emotions and effort into that relationship, yet the relationship failed due to personality clashes and it left me rather heart brokened. My guy friend got to know of it and came back to put me back on my feet. I was grateful, but I was aware that isn't the feeling of love.<br><br>Now that things are getting back to normal for me, he asked to be considered again. I'm not sure if I should give him, as well as myself, a chance to try this out. I'm still pretty confused with my own feelings. On one hand, I was thinking, since the lines of the friendship have long been broken, why not just move on and see what happens? Moreover, perhaps love can be nurtured with time. Yet on the other, I'm afraid of what's to come. Will I lose this friend if the relationship fails?<br><br>Perhaps I still need some time to sort this out. I've been thinking a lot in the past few days, and trying to imagine what would it be like to be with him. I've also been observing some couples on the streets which have the girl taller than the guy (found quite a number, to my surprise). I think I'm on my way to overcome the so-called "norm".<br><br>Thank you all for all your supportive and thought-provoking comments. They really contributed a lot to straightening out my thoughts on height issues. There are still some other issues which, like many of you say, depends on me alone to find out. =)<br><br>Oh, and thanks Crystal_Dumpling for recommending Lovely Complex. Very cute anime there. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>
