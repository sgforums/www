We chat almost everyday, regardless of anything..I have a bf, he has someone in mind.. just like normal friends, chat about our problems.<br><br>My bf and I have been together for 2 yrs but we had quite a number of miscommuincations and arguments, therefore sometimes i tend to be rather disheartened about this relationship...<br><br>He..my good friend, we started to get very closed no matter in school or when chatting, we started going out, doing things together.. very soon, we fall for each other. I did declared my feelings to him and he too...<br><br>I didn' know what happen but although i am very happy being with him, I would remind myself that i should be responsible of my actions, cus I have a bf.. I don;t want myself to betray him... however in my heart I understand who I really like... but I have to be responsible... One day, he ask me to choose between my bf and him ... so out of frustration,<br><br>I asked him to go.....telling him that I am a responsible person... I will not leave my bf just like that. Just imagine if I'm a kind of person that could leave my bf for another guy, i could have done that to him too... I just wish he understand... we never contact every since not even take one single look in school....<br><br>I feel miserable... cus I really loved him... In order to attempt to stop missing him, I agreed to engaged with my bf... I have make a mistake I know, hurting my bf and him.. i am a sinner... but it's no way to return...<br><br>During Valentines', I only can send him a msg, secretly send him a bday gift on his bday without a name.... always dream of him that we were back like how we used to be..... I love him... really... not a crush.....<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br></blockquote></div>
