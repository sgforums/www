            <div class='col-md body'>HI Plain,<br><br>I think it is not being very fair to the guy you love now. He has been with you and supporting you all along when you have problems.  And frankly speaking, he doesn't mind treating you well despite the fact that he know you have a bf. And he doesn't expect anything return from you. What he is doing is pure and sincere. But do you know how much emotional holdbacks he has to go through by thinking of how you are going out with your bf? Do you think he can really take it when you tell him stuffs about you and your bf but yet, he also likes you? Just think about it. I don't mean to be hash but I really feel that you are confused.<br><br>Just imagine that after you confess to him that you like him, he feel really happy. He want to be with you all along but he know it is not right for this situation. That was why he ask you to choose between your current bf and him. I can sense his sufferings. He want to be with you but yet, he knows that what you are doing is wrong. He do not want to be unfair to you of your bf. That was why he want you to choose. But what did you tell him? You cruely told him that you will not leave your bf but yet, you loves him. So, what do you think he will feel? What are you treating him as? You treat him just like a spare tyre. When you feel moody, he will be there for you. But when you are with your bf, he can only suffer in silence. Do you still think you are right?<br><br>If you really loves him now and want to be with him for the rest of your life, just pick up your courage and explain to your current bf. It will be much fairer to your current bf and yourself. Just imagine that you love the guy and the guy loves you. This involve two parties and at least the two of you will be happy together. Your bf should understand that if your heart is no longer with him, it is of no point to hold you back. But if you choose to remain with your current bf but loves the guy, all the three of you will suffer together.<br><br>I have been through it and that was why I can understand how the guy feels. Just pick up your courage and choose the person that you truely love. Follow your heart.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>imho, i think all these debate is getting way out of hand. all along you people are only talking about the 'guy' (the friend) and not the bf.<br>spare a thot for the poor guy. all these while he's in the dark and he has this misconception that his gf loves him and wants to get engaged with him, but in actual fact, his gf is only staying with him because she cannot get over herself. her consience will prick her if she leaves him for the 'guy'.<br><br>please ms plain. let go of your bf now. do not torture him anymore. short pain is better than long pain. at the very least, i believe he deserves to know the truth.</div>
