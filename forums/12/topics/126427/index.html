            <div class='col-md body'>3 years ago I fell for this gal and tried to woo her.We did go out and stuff but in the end,she got attached to another guy.After that,the guy forbid her to have any form of contact with me.So for 3 years,she disappeared from my life(she even changed her phone number) and I didn't try to contact her also though once in a while I would check out her Friendster profile and her status WAS always "In a relationship" Her pictures included those of her and her boyfriend(her displayed photo was a couple shot)<br><br>Then today,I checked her profile and her displayed picture was one only of herself.Curious,I looked at her status and now it is "single." Then I went to check her boyfriend's or should we say ex's this time. His pictures show him in  intimate poses with ANOTHER gal and his status is "in a relationship".<br><br>Unbelievable,just a few weeks ago,my crush just uploaded new pictures of her and her ex.They portray a picture of a very happy couple and I even thought they will be going to the ROM very soon.But now what the??? So fast???<br><br>BUT THE BIGGER QUESTION IS SHOULD I...?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="large">DEAR DIARY</span></strong><br><br>A FALSE DAWN<br><br>31st May 2002<br><br>I woke up with mixed feelings.On one hand,I felt elated that I was going to meet the gal I was utterly smitted with again after over three months. Yet this was tempered by the fact that she was attached.Sigh.<br><br>On the way to meeting Ting at her place,I felt very edgy.Why this was so,I had no idea.Perhaps I was too excited about the prospects of seeing the smile that stole my heart some time ago.Perhaps there was an internal conflict raging inside me-one part yearned to see Ting,the other kept saying: "forget it,it's in vain." Throughout the bus journey to Ting's place,I was full of question marks pertaining to this dichotomy.<br><br>Ting will be a little late.I waited.The tension was unbelievable.I could feel it permeating the void deck.To ease my tensions,I SMS-ed Angie to while the time.Angie,as always,never failed to showcase her repertoire of balmy words.Nice girl,Angie was,but I only wanted Ting.<br><br>"Ting,I have got You written all over my Heart."<br><br>Ting came down."Wowww." Here standing in front of me was the girl who had given me the sweetest dreams for the past months.Here was someone who made me discern that,in Life,the line between sheer happiness and despondency of the nth degree is gossamer thin.The burden deep in my heart eased instantly upon seeing that megawatt smile again.I was lost in her eyes yet again.When I heard her mellifluous voice,I was almost gone...<br><br>I soon regained my senses,luckily.She wanted to do some window shopping first.Every step I took with her was like in heaven.At this accessories shop,the shopkeeper greeted us as if we were a couple and I gave her the widest smile I ever had.Though I often find shopping with girls boring in the past,this was not the case with Ting this time.While she was looking at the products,I was looking at her.Is she an Angel from Heaven?<br><br>She finished her shopping and we settled down at Foster's to rest and have tea.We engaged in some small talk-about school,what we have been doing and the like.Somehow we ended up talking about her relationship.<br><br>She said she was single.<br><br>I did not catch it at first.Then I realised that she had actually said it.My brain reprocessed her words again.Yes,she had declared her status to you,pal.Finally it dawned on me that the window of opportunity was finally opened again.The agony and heartbreak I felt all over the past few months would finally be expiated.What a denouement!<br><br>My happiness was transcendental.<br><br>Suddenly,everything looked so beautiful to me.Time passed so fast when you are feeling good,soon it was time for us to part ways and I walked her home all the while dropping hints that I wanted to woo her and she played along with me.It was so funny!<br><br>I reached home on time to catch the opening game of the World Cup finals.It was France versus Senegal.I rooted for Senegal.When the Africans scored,I cheered.When the final whistle was blown,I punched the air in delight.Victory for Senegal parallelled the joy I felt that day.I felt that I represented Senegal.France represented All the Unfavourable Circumstances That I Had Faced.With grit and patience,I had triumphed handsomely against what Life had thrown at me.<br><br>I flipped to page 76 of Different Seasons by Stephen King.There is an interesting passage on it.I read it and I smiled to myself.It goes:<br><br>His mood broke around the time of the 1967 World Series.That was the dream year,the year the Red Sox won the pennant instead of placing ninth,as the Las Vegas predicted.When it happened-when they won the American League pennant-a kind of ebullience engulfed the whole prison.There was a goofy sort of feeling that if the Dead Sox could come to life,then maybe <span style="font-style: italic;">anybody</span> could do it.<br><br>"Now there is something to look forward and plan ahead in the days to come.",I told myself as I retired to bed.</div>

Here standing in front of me was the girl who had given me the sweetest dreams for the past months.Here was someone who made me discern that,in Life,the line between sheer happiness and despondency of the nth degree is gossamer thin.The burden deep in my heart eased instantly upon seeing that megawatt smile again.I was lost in her eyes yet again.When I heard her mellifluous voice,I was almost gone...<br><br>I soon regained my senses,luckily.She wanted to do some window shopping first.Every step I took with her was like in heaven.At this accessories shop,the shopkeeper greeted us as if we were a couple and I gave her the widest smile I ever had.Though I often find shopping with girls boring in the past,this was not the case with Ting this time.While she was looking at the products,I was looking at her.Is she an Angel from Heaven?<br><br>She finished her shopping and we settled down at Foster's to rest and have tea.We engaged in some small talk-about school,what we have been doing and the like.Somehow we ended up talking about her relationship.<br><br>She said she was single.<br><br>I did not catch it at first.Then I realised that she had actually said it.My brain reprocessed her words again.Yes,she had declared her status to you,pal.Finally it dawned on me that the window of opportunity was finally opened again.The agony and heartbreak I felt all over the past few months would finally be expiated.What a denouement!<br><br>My happiness was transcendental.<br><br>Suddenly,everything looked so beautiful to me.Time passed so fast when you are feeling good,soon it was time for us to part ways and I walked her home all the while dropping hints that I wanted to woo her and she played along with me.It was so funny!<br><br>I reached home on time to catch the opening game of the World Cup finals.It was France versus Senegal.I rooted for Senegal.When the Africans scored,I cheered.When the final whistle was blown,I punched the air in delight.Victory for Senegal parallelled the joy I felt that day.I felt that I represented Senegal.France represented All the Unfavourable Circumstances That I Had Faced.With grit and patience,I had triumphed handsomely against what Life had thrown at me.<br><br>I flipped to page 76 of Different Seasons by Stephen King.There is an interesting passage on it.I read it and I smiled to myself.It goes:<br><br>His mood broke around the time of the 1967 World Series.That was the dream year,the year the Red Sox won the pennant instead of placing ninth,as the Las Vegas predicted.When it happened-when they won the American League pennant-a kind of ebullience engulfed the whole prison.There was a goofy sort of feeling that if the Dead Sox could come to life,then maybe anybody could do it.<br><br>"Now there is something to look forward and plan ahead in the days to come.",I told myself as I retired to bed.</div></blockquote>^^ Jia you wor~ i guess love and patience do pay off in the end..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
