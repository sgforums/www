Cuz A did prayers for me for 2 days.. even if its a joke, does it sound logic for her to pretend its a joke and trouble herself into this prank? Just dont make sense..<br><br>ANyway, im ok now.. those thing is not following me again.. its just that A told me to be careful .. thats all, and im not quite understand if she meant that i shudnt step on anything ( im sure i didnt) so that that thing wont follow you..<br><br>Anyone experience this ?
