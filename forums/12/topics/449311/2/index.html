              <p><br> Hello , Yes my friend has been reading all the responses here. She
              concurs with your opinion. She definitely is not letting her
              children deter her from divorcing Samuel. But she also wants total
              custody of her kids. Scumbag Samuel says no. Her parents suggest
              buying the custody from him. My only advice to her was :"don't buy,
              get a good lawyer, to fight all the way for custody, if she wants
              or give up the kids to him. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>My rationale to her is - why should she
              be saddle with the children? </strong></span>Let him be saddle with the
              responsiblity first. Afterall it is his children too.and since his
              mother wants to take full responsibility - so be it. When he proves
              incapable of giving them what they need or if his mother is finally
              unabl eto take care of them well, then at a later date fight for
              full custody.</p>

              <p><br>You can't say that. For obvious reason, if the guy never stray, then all these problems wouldn't have been there in the first place. The family was broken up when the guy CHOSE to have multiple affairs with multiple women. It was not broken up because of the wife, much less from the friend, but it was broken up the moment the guy with intent, chose to have sexual relations with multiple women.</p>
              <p>My parents never take care of me when I was young, but that didn't stop me from growing up to be a successful person. Let's not push all responsibilities to the parents here. All the problems arose from the straying husband, so let's focus on that root problem and not the symptoms that came out from it.</p>
              <p>If you have a certain illness, you want to cure that illness and not the symptoms such as runny nose/headaches/sore throat because if you remove the symptoms alone, they will come back eventually.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks everyone ! for all your inputs. You all have your  points  and true it depends on my friend at the end of the day.  This morning was a hectic morning as we accompanied her to change her will to make sure than in the event of any accident of any sorts( she flies here and there in her job) scumbag Samuel will not get hold of her assets. She has hired a good lawyer to proceed withthe evidences to sue for a divorce.  Lawyer even suggested  will to him ten dollars  just to show she did think of him and that's all he gets.  She divided her assets in trust for her twins as well as a token sum to her parents , with her siblings as her children's trustees. The children are still with her mother-in-law who is almost hysterical, and refuses to let them move to her parents home. So my friend has insisted that  the two maids stay  on at her mother-in-laws place to keep an eye on the kids and report to her  whatever transpires. But her father-in-law is more accomodating and has agreed to let the kids move in a weeks time, when his wife  calms down. But that is left to be seen. The lawyer suggested they try to work out custody amicably rather than  stress the kids  as well. Yes all your points are taken about the children being innocent parties,  but that's life when there is a divorce, can't be help. But in all fairness she can't be expected to live with his nonsense, just for the sake of the children- that sort of tolerance happens only in the movies in olden days!  As the detective was hired  to stop, only when they have enough evidence, it is quite clear that the number of extramarital liasons he had exceeded those on record, whenever  he is overseas. So once again thank you for your inputs!</div>

              Am I involved? How did you come to such a conclusion. As for re-marriage , it is happening quite a lot even with children in tow. I have friends who are divorced, widowed and re-married very happily. So it is occuring more frequently., these days.

              <p>Thanks everyone ! for all your inputs. You all have your points
              and true it depends on my friend at the end of the day. This
              morning was a hectic morning as we accompanied her to change her
              will to make sure than in the event of any accident of any sorts(
              she flies here and there in her job) scumbag Samuel will not get
              hold of her assets. She has hired a good lawyer to proceed withthe
              evidences to sue for a divorce. Lawyer even suggested will to him
              ten dollars just to show she did think of him and that’s all he
              gets. She divided her assets in trust for her twins as well as a
              token sum to her parents , with her siblings as her children’s
              trustees. The children are still with her mother-in-law who is
              almost hysterical, and refuses to let them move to her parents
              home. So my friend has insisted that the two maids stay on at her
              mother-in-laws place to keep an eye on the kids and report to her
              whatever transpires. But her father-in-law is more accomodating and
              has agreed to let the kids move in a weeks time, when his wife
              calms down. But that is left to be seen. The lawyer suggested they
              try to work out custody amicably rather than stress the kids as
              well.<strong> Yes all your points are taken about the children being
              innocent parties, but that’s life when there is a divorce,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> can’t be
              help.</span></strong> But in all fairness she can’t be expected to live with his
              nonsense, just for the sake of the children- that sort of tolerance
              happens only in the movies in olden days! As the detective was
              hired to stop, only when they have enough evidence, it is quite
              clear that the number of extramarital liasons he had exceeded those
              on record, whenever he is overseas. So once again thank you for
              your inputs!</p>

              It can be even worse for the kids if adults continue in a loveless marriage. Children know if their parents are unhappy and it makes them unhappy too. Some kids even blame themselves whenever the parents have an argument. We are living in modern times one in every two marriages here in Singapore ends up in divorce- like it or not. It's time to teach society how to cope with divorce, re-marriage and doing the best for the kids of such  circumstances , rather than being unrealistic and hoping that such situations won't happen.

              Excuse me but why get so personal?  What has mine or your background got to do with it? Facts are statistics show clearly  divorces are on the rise.  Good wives do not check on their husbands.  And I suppose good husbands do not check on their wivies too?  Not this day and age. Even if you  trust your spouses, it  does not mean you can trust those around them 100%. Of course everyone ( or most people) start off their marriage with all the ideals of what a marriage should and could be. But what it is, can be aschewed somewhat in reality.

              <p><br> True -lah but hello ..she ask for advice how to say , sorry don't
              ask me i not your family. She thinks I am objective enough to be
              fair in my judgement of the situation. Of course any decision is up
              to herself. Good friends must always support each other ,right!</p>

              <p>If she ask me for advise, I would suggest,</p>
              <p>1. divorce since her husband is a proven cheat.</p>
              <p>2. get custody of her children, don't regret that you didn't do so when you have the chance now.</p>
              <p>3. stop talking to Bikeforceful, this guy is shady, avoid at all cost, why? he is implying that you should not get custody of your children and I have no idea why any sincere man would suggest that, well unless he is not.</p>
