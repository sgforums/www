                  In fact I had advised her first  to give her marriage a chance  for the sake of the children. So your assertion here is dead wrong. I twas only when the report  from the detectives came  that she decided  she wanted to get out of he rmarriage. I had suggested that she could consider not fighting for the children's custody- only temporarily.( read carefully) , as Samuel knows the children are her weakness and is using them as a bargaining pawn! But speak your peace , it is ok with me. But I think calling me shady says a lot about you too. I don't go around calling others who post here , names! So can be civilised or not?

                  Why temporary? whats the rationale behind that? If she'sreally into
                  fighting for the custody, why is there a need to give it off
                  temporary? Children are her weakness? probably abit more
                  elaboration of it in relation with the part about giving temporary
                  custody? That would make more sense in what you are saying. As a
                  friend, i think you wld have understood enough how much she love
                  her kids, can't reason out why u would not want her to fight for
                  her kids...</p>

                  In many cases the wife knows the husband very well. Chances are that the husband  really can't take care of the kids  but will use custody to get at the wife , knowing that the wife wants custody. So if the wife shows her weakness, then she allows the husband to bargain very hard. Another friend of mine had the same problem. Her French husband actually told her  that he wanted total custody of all the children despite the fact that it was adultery on his part.  So she told him, alright you can have the kids  but I only want access to them.  When the case actually went up to court  he did not fight for custody because there was no way he could cope with the 4 kids ,  Why? because he didn't even know how to make breakfast! So in a divorce ( and I have seen many)  even if you are emotionally tied to your kids, you can't show it, or you might lose even more in the settlement bargaining process.
