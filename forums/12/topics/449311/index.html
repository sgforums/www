               Samuel( psuedo name) works for a multi-national  and travels into  Shanghai and shenzhen regularly , for the past year. His private banker wife also travels into China regularly . She decided to give her husband a surprise three  months ago  by visiting him in Shanghai whilst she was also on assignment to meet a Prcian client. To her utter shock,  by coincidence she saw Samuel arm in arm with a Prcian girl shopping in the supermarket near the condo where he lives in HongQiao. She took a snap shot of them and decided to return straight back to Singapore without telling him.
              She then enlisted the help of a private investigator who by now has sent her a complete record of  all his infidelities and dalliance with more than 3 "regular" Shanghainese girls  and 2 others in Shenzhen.
              Being a successful woman with her own career she has decided to divorce him. he has pleaded with her that all his extra-marital activities meant nothing to him and that he still oves her and their  three year old twins dearly. Her  in-laws  especially her mother-in-law has also pleaded with her to give him a second chance. However  her parents who are very wealthy , has told her to do as she thinks best for herself  and they will support her decision even if she decides to divorce. She is moved by her mother-in-law's pleading , but feels  there is no way she can trust her husband at all, as he is a definite lying cheat. Should she continue to be in a loveless marriage for the sake of the children? Or should she simply divorce him and seek her own happiness?

              <p>This kind of situation is super difficult since you want to believe that the guilty party can change but also, because of what he's done and what you have to protect (i.e your family), it becomes a decision not only affecting one's self, but also the children.</p>
              <p>I think a marriage consultant and lots of communication between husband and wife, and since wealth is not an issue, seeking the husband to change job to a less travelling career. Or stay home and watch the kids, that conniving bastard.</p>

              He has also made clear that if there is a divorce he wants custody of the children as they are his mother's precious pets! The wife  says -no way  as they are her children as well. Her parents have suggested offering to pay him off to gain total custody of the children. I told them not to waste good money  on the scum, but let a good lawyer handle the custody case.

                  I think so too. But Samuel is now telling the 3 year old twins  that mummy is trying ot seperate them from their papa. Psychologically it is creating lots of insecurity for the children. She suspects he doesn't want a divorce because  he is comfortable  having the networking and family connections of her family,  by staying married to her. But she is at a quandary because having the twins means somehow having to always deal with him unless she get complete custody, which is why her parents  wants to pay him off.  In fact her parents have even suggested leaving the kids to him if he so desires, so that she can have a clean slate, in life. But she is unable to do so-maternal instincts I suppose.

              <p><br>If Samuel is doing such tricks on the kids, it reflects clearly what a manipulative person he is. Based on that trait alone, I think the person is not trustworthy. If you factor in the fact that he is fooling around with so many girls, then very clearly he has no regards to the wife. Lying becomes second nature to him. If despite all these clear signs of a liar and still want to trust him, then I say all the best lah.</p>
              <p>As for the kids, I think it depends on individual. There is no right or wrong answer on this. Having a clean slate may end up being the right option. Taking custody of the kids may also be the right option. Only time will tell which choice is right.</p>
              <p>However, what is true is that most men don't really like to go for a woman who already have kids. Don't ask me why but it's just that, so that may be a barrier to dating.</p>

                  If Samuel is doing such tricks on the kids, it reflects clearly
                  what a manipulative person he is. Based on that trait alone, I
                  think the person is not trustworthy. If you factor in the fact
                  that he is fooling around with so many girls, then very
                  clearly he has no regards to the wife. Lying becomes second nature
                  to him. If despite all these clear signs of a liar and still
                  want to trust him, then I say all the best lah.</p>
                  <p>As for the kids, I think it depends on individual. There is no
                  right or wrong answer on this. Having a clean slate may end up
                  being the right option. Taking custody of the kids may also be the
                  right option. Only time will tell which choice is right.</p>
                  <p>However, what is true is that most men don't really like to go
                  for a woman who already have kids. Don't ask me why but it's just
                  that, so that may be a barrier to dating.</p>

                  Yes you  are right . Most men preferably  don't want to date a woman with kids . I suppose her next husband has to be a Westerner ( ang moh) they are perhaps more open minded , about kids.

              Hello , Yes my friend has been reading all the responses here. She concurs with your opinion. She definitely is not letting  her children deter her from divorcing Samuel. But she also wants total  custody of her kids. Scumbag Samuel says no. Her parents suggest buying the custody from him. My only advice to her was :"don't buy, get a good lawyer, to fight all the way  for custody, if she wants or  give up the kids to him. My rationale to her is - why should she be saddle with the children? Let him be saddle with the responsiblity first. Afterall it is his children too.and since his mother wants to take full responsibility - so be it.  When he proves incapable of giving them what they need  or if his mother is finally unabl eto take care of them well, then at  a later date fight for full custody.

              <p>Samuel( psuedo name) works for a multi-national and travels into
              Shanghai and shenzhen regularly , for the past year. His private
              banker wife also travels into China regularly . She decided to give
              her husband a surprise three months ago by visiting him in Shanghai
              whilst she was also on assignment to meet a Prcian client. To her
              utter shock, by coincidence she saw Samuel arm in arm with a Prcian
              girl shopping in the supermarket near the condo where he lives in
              HongQiao. She took a snap shot of them and decided to return
              straight back to Singapore without telling him.<br> She then enlisted the help of a private investigator who by now has
              sent her a complete record of all his infidelities and dalliance
              with more than 3 “regular” Shanghainese girls and 2 others in
              Shenzhen.<br> Being a successful woman with her own career she has decided to
              divorce him. he has pleaded with her that all his extra-marital
              activities meant nothing to him and that he still oves her and
              their three year old twins dearly. Her in-laws especially her
              mother-in-law has also pleaded with her to give him a second
              chance. However her parents who are very wealthy , has told her to
              do as she thinks best for herself and they will support her
              decision even if she decides to divorce. She is moved by her
              mother-in-law’s pleading , but feels there is no way she can trust
              her husband at all, as he is a definite lying cheat. Should she
              continue to be in a loveless marriage for the sake of the children?
              Or should she simply divorce him and seek her own happiness?</p>

              <p>er i think you advice is rather selfish in my opinion. That child is hers too and she has her responsibility as a mother of tat child too. The fault lies with the dad, why punished the child by thinking that she'll be saddled with the responsiblity of the child if she assumes the custody of the child? and so if she gives up the custody of the child, what happens if the child grows up asking her mum why did you give me up to dad? you cant expect your friend to reply them with "why should i be saddled wth the responsiblity to look after you?" the child is the responsiblity of both imo...i guess the best way is to go through legal means and fight for the custody straight out. Do not "buy" it over cos they are not goods... dun risk having them think that they are merely goods when they grow up.</p>
              <p>As for divorce, thats things b/w 2 of them...to really give a chance anot, depends on the sincerity of the husband, and how strong the foundation of the r/s is. Bottomline, kis are innocent.</p>
