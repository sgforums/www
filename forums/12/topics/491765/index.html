              <p>I kind of post something previously about going into poly. Well I manage to get into a the course I want and I'm now studying in SP.</p>
              <p>Ever since entering poly I'm being feeling really really self concious about myself. I mean I studied only in N levels (NT) and most of my classmates are O levels students. Everyone of them seem really hard working and seem to be good in conversations, mathematics etc. </p>
              <p>I kind of feel that I'm losing out. Pressure here seems even more tough then in ITE and honestly the only thing that I think I have advantage against them is probably my prior knowledge on programming.</p>
              <p>I really feel uneasy since the start of poly, on the first day we're already joining groups for our group project on an assesment.</p>
              <p>Any advice from Ex-ITE to Poly student? How do you all take the pressure and overcome it?</p>
              <p>I guess maybe I need to be even more hardworking and studious now then ever. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/cry.png" alt="cry.png"><strong></strong><em></em></p>

              <p>Not an ex-ITE student but...</p>
              <p>You don't have to feel self-conscious. There are people from all walks of life in poly. I've seen people who drop out from JC then come to poly, some go poly after NS, and what not... I know of someone who came from the normal stream and eventually became a gold medalist.</p>
              <p>The fact that you are all in the same school, the same course, means your level of competence is around the same. So don't feel pressurised. You are as capable as them too. It doesn't matter where you came from, but where you go from there ^^</p>

              <p>Why you no ask at SP Confessions?</p>
                      <p>anyway,</p>
                      <p>If you do not have Additional Mathematics background, you have to take the module "Basic Mathematics" (MS4120). It is non-graded, but takes up four credit units (one week four hours of class). I believe it is already factored into your time table. Do not worry. The number of hours per week is about the same for every student.</p>
                      
                      <p>You may have difficulty coping with the module "Principles of Electrical and Electronic Engineering" (PEEE I / II)(ET1005 &amp; ET1006), as that involves the use of Mathematics, but that is about the only modules in year one that involves mathematics. No worries. SP got Peer Tutoring Program on Wednesdays from 1pm to 5pm at... sorry, cannot say here. Pls ask your PEEE lecturer to put you in the Peer-Tutoring Program (assign you a peer tutor). He/she will tell you the details.</p>
                      
                      <p>ITE graduates got added advantage when comes to soldering wires and components on the circuit board.</p>
                      
                      <p>by the way, do not say "I guess maybe I need to be even more hardworking and studious now then ever".</p>
                      <p>i have been in poly for two years. first few weeks is quite slack. three weeks before MST then will start to pick up momentum..... it's about studying smart, not hard.</p>
                      
                      <p>i believe the grouping you meant is during IE class... the very first assignment should be about "discovering engineering", where you all would be dismantling electrical appliances and analysising the parts... have fun :)</p>

              <p>Yea thanks for your advice.. I guess there really isn't a need to worry too much and focus what I can do now. Maybe instead of studying harder I should focus on studying smarter.</p>
              <p>I just don't understand why i worry too much about this. I'm always worrying about what others think of me or whether I can make it. It makes me kind of sad and depressed.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/ccmathteam.com/cry.png" alt="cry.png"></p>
              <p>I'm always judge by people like my relative and other people who I don't know just bcause I'm in em3, NT, ITE...I have smarter siblings/relatives (who are in express or na), no one in either side of my family are NT/em3..etc.</p>
              <p>I was actually born with dylexia which is a difficulty in learn and writing, I took at least 3 to 4 years in primary school to be able to read and write very well..</p>
              <p>I did manage to work really hard and scored well in my PSLE, N level, ITE but no matter what I do I keep getting look down on for certain things...</p>
              <p>It hurt so much thinking about it now. I have a good family, a good supportive mother and elder brother. But sometimes I feel really alone...</p>
              <p>Sorry for ranting I'm just not feeling so good lately :(</p>

              <p><strong>Tertiary education is not for the faint-hearted</strong>.</p> 
                  
                  <p><strong>This is the survival of the fittest</strong>.</p>
                  <p>This is what I realise after being in tertiary education for three years, since 2013. Initially, when I transitioned from secondary school to tertiary level, it was a culture shock for me. After a while, I understand that everyone has their own life to live. Grow up. Have confidence in yourself. Prove your worth.</p>
                          <p>Honestly, nobody cares about your past. Move on.</p>
                          <p>You probably have heard of this saying before, "Yesterday is history. Today is a gift. Tomorrow is a mystery."</p>
                          <p>I am surprised to see this come from someone who is already in tertiary education for a few years. You mean you never realise this when you were in ITE (or for that matter, JC)?</p>

              <p>Hello,</p>
              <p>Nopes, you're not the only one :)</p>
              <p>I'm in fact an ex ite student too, im struggling to fit into poly life as well.</p>
              <p>But my concerns lies towards the modules structure than the culture shock itself.</p>
              <p>I'm leaning towards indecisiveness being in the wrong course. Studying for four years in ite is no joke, it really made me question every decision i make, even up until now i fret if i'm wasting my time or pursuing this for the sake of that piece of diploma paper.</p>
              <p>Set aside my concerns but if this is the course you have great interest, yes all the more you should stay. The feel to compare yourself with other people, it will always linger. But always do your best. In fact theres a lot of my friends who came from ite and went into poly had a hard time adjusting too. </p>
              <p>It may be the age gap or mindset difference but you should give yourself a try.</p>
              <p>I think the most important is, you have to like what you do and have a great interest and i am very sure you will do well in poly. Just meet your deadlines on time even if have to submit shitty work hahaha, as long you can pass that modules :D</p>
              <p>All the best!!!! </p>
