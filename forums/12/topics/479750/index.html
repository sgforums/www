              <p>will all the items like pc and printers, furnitures and stuff be cleared from house?</p>
              <p>if those items are purchased by me and i have already lost the receipts, whats going to happen? i'm putting purchases off now as i'm afraid that they will be gone when the creditors come and i'm not at home to state clearly that certain items are purchased under my name...</p>

              <p>1. No your dad cannot be your guarantor.</p>
              <p>Even if he were to sign before he declares bankrupt, you get the loan.. how are you going to service the loan anyway ? If both of you cannot pay... YOU will also become bankrupt.</p>
              <p>Also, never become a guarantor to anyone unless you are prepared to pay the loan if it goes into default.</p>
              <p>2. Hold off all purchases.</p>
              <p>3. The officer will decide what is worth taking. You will need to submit application to claim items that belongs to you and can prove it.There will be other fees involved to reclaim your items from the court.</p>

              <p>I mean, when we buy things, we immediately discard the receipts. Who keeps the receipt. And even if we have the receipts, it's paid in cash mostly, how to prove whose cash is it? Then how to prove son's ownership of items instead of dad's?</p>

Don't give up on yor Uni plans, I'm sure if you approach the Uni or Family Services.. someone must be able to help or point you in the right direction. After you have talked to help groups, then go to a temple or whatever for the calmness to think out your options... Really sorry for you predicament... </p></div>
