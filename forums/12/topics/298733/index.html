            <div class='col-md body'>Sometimes, this kind of thing cannot help it one. For me, i really care for my parents - i joke with them, go breakfast with them every morning without fail. I am also a mummy boy and i know girl hates this kind of guy for being too obedient. However, TS what i want to tell u is the time u can share with ur parents together is very short.<br><br>If ur bf sort of married u at age of 30, how long u think ur bf can be with his parents? at most 15 years, y? because only when one reach maturity then one MAY realise how important their parents are. For me, i realise it quite late or rather i am really stunned when i really it. Therefore, i am happy to be a mummy boy at the moment so that i can treasure them while time last till we parted.<br><br>Therefore, sometimes please spare a thought for ur bf.</div>

His problem is that he cannot keep his appointments, and he is not punctual, and he expects you to wait for him without giving you a call. In other words, in a few years time, he will grow into a chauvinist pig, and he will expect his girl (you) to wait on him, and keep mum when he wants to have his way with you.<br><br>Dump him. Mummy's boys do not keep other people waiting for 2.5 hours. You will thank me for this advice.</div>
