His problem is that he cannot keep his appointments, and he is not punctual, and he expects you to wait for him without giving you a call. In other words, in a few years time, he will grow into a chauvinist pig, and he will expect his girl (you) to wait on him, and keep mum when he wants to have his way with you.</span><br><br>Dump him. Mummy's boys do not keep other people waiting for 2.5 hours. You will thank me for this advice.</div></blockquote>Agree only within the highlighted text as per above.<br><br>I would not dump him that fast if I were you since you're both quite stable already to the stage of fixing stuffs etc..<br><br>So if you're annoyed over this weakness of being a mommy's boy..<br><br>Give him a path, a few choices, a few set of simple 'test' and see if he is decisive or just a tag-along follower.<br><br>If he's the latter, then you decide what you want in this relationship.</div>

I think it might be possible.<br>I often use my mom as an excuse, esp when I'm lazy to budge and am going to be late. I often hear some of my counterparts using such excuses too to get rid of some unwelcomed guests.<br>Examples are:-<br>I got to help my mom with some chores, I'll be late.<br>My mom quarrelled with me, sorry I'm late.<br>My mom cook already, I got to eat or else she'll flip. I be late.<br>My mom not feeling well. I got to accomp her awhile. I be late.<br><br>It's convenient.<br>Sometimes my mom overhears my conversation and scold me for using her as an excuse.<br>Hahaha.<br><br>Maybe when next time he says an excuse involving his mom, you try to confirm with his family?</div>
