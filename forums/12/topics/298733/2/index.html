My neighbour, on the other hand, is an honest to goodness mamma's boy who needs his mother to make all his decisions, and I mean ALL. He wants to move into my apartment when I leave and what does he do? He sends dear old mommy to check out the place and wax lyrical about how her son is a good boy, when in actuality he strikes me as a filthy perv who walks along the corridor in nothing but his towel. And frankly it makes me sick. Sorry about OT-ing but I really hate my neighbour.

I mean wtf he is 24 yrs old already, gf tell him go out, his mother tell him go out after lunch and yet he obey his mother.<br><br>3) Your bf simply loves mum's cooking. He is a glutton.</div>

Hmm not sure if your logic works.<br><br>Btw this has nothing to do with America, I'm talking about almost the entire world from Europe, North and South America, the Middle East, Australia, Africa and almost friggin everywhere it's customary for the children to stop living with their parents once they reach a certain age.<br><br>Just because they start a family of their own doesn't mean they stop caring about their parents.</div>
