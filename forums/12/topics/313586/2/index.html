              <p>FYI, I waited for over a year... then the chance came.</p>
              <p>If it didnt happen then, i guess i'd have waited on...</p>
              <p>but i'd never tell her my feelings. You having confessed to her is already a form of 3rd partying.</p>
              <p>ok just think about this. when you are finally with her, will you like it if guys around her starts telling her they have feelings for her? no right? coz that will make her heart waver. Humans are like that. when they have it, often they take things for granted and dont see the importance. You have taken advantage of that by providing her with something new and fresh. thats why she showed 'interest'.</p>
              <p>if you still have some sense left in you, you should move on or at least keep your distance until her current relationship ends naturally. Since u have already done the damage by confessing to her, that is the only thing you can do now.</p>
              <p>Of course you can choose to be a jerk and try to snatch her away but if she leaves her current bf in such manner, be prepared to lose her to others in the same manner in the futher.</p>
              <p>One more thing to consider is people's perception of you and her if both of you were to be together one day.</p>
              <p>one thing i know for sure... if you are my friend, i'd be keeping my gf away from you.</p>

              <p>You are the kind of guys.. girls keep on their " Standby" list.</p>
              <p>Also knows as "benchwarmers".</p>
              <p>Basically, we don't reject you outright. We keep you on a string. just dribble some hope .. enuf for you to stick around.</p>
              <p>Just in Case... we break up with our boyfriend, we'll have a "rebound" guy available.</p>
              <p>So.. I'd not say you don't stand a chance.. but you'd have to wait till the time comes when you'd be useful.</p>
              <p>Let's put it this way... after you got her... she'd have some other guys on her standby list.</p>
              <p>So , go figure.. if she is worth the wait .. or not .</p>

              <p>Your problem happens when u dont use your brain.. u felt like telling her your feeling even though u know she got bf and when she say she likes u does it really mean she "love" you? No, my fren. Frens can like frens..</p>
              <p>SO wat else u can prove that she likes (loves) you rather than one common one outing as good fren ?</p>
              <p>You know why u got into this big mess? Cuz u just cant control yourself from being too close to her even if shes in your department.. Even though u know she got bf, u still unconcsiously getting nearer to her. And perhaps u think she deserves u more cuz his bf keep giving her trouble?</p>
              <p>Sory , IMO, you just think too much,.,. when a gal say she likes u this and that.. your just another kind of guy to easily fall in trap (if shes playing with u) or just you just dun understand her well.. u already said u dont really know her well.. then how could u possibly tell that she really likes u ? Dont u think she might have treated everyone the same cuz its just her characteristic ?</p>
              <p>One more thing, is that u dun understand women's language.. when they say dono how long u will wait, it means u better dont wait cuz she wont be together with u. ya , i know it sounded like the gal giving u hope to wait but the truth is that they just dono how to speak straight forward to your face.. for gals, hard for them to say 'No, we cant be together" ..they always come up with study 1st la.. this and that 1st la... to me, just making guys confused. No ?</p>
              <p>Dont wory, as for your own sake and confidence.. i prefer u leave her behind and treated her like normal fren.. dont be a wussy as if shes the only women that lives in this world. I think u just never really had a good r/s previously.</p>
              <p>Trust me my fren, gals just dono how to say NO to r/s or to anyone who confess to them.. well only some.</p>
