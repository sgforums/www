              <p>Just let him do what he wants. If the juice is worth the squeeze , then let him squeeze it . It may taste like the sweet nectar of life , or a real sour experience.</p>
              <p>I also one that believes in getting what u really want and anything is game. But like all things , u get what u want , but it will always be at a cost. I guess i can say , as guys sometimes we just cant let go of some people and let the feelings just disappear. I have these feelings also. Like when i see a girl i like , then i know she got BF , i may still go all lengths. To the point that i dun even mind being the rebound guy.I become oblivious to what people think or say. At least i know what its like being with her. I dont mind spending the time and money for it. And at least we had a great time nevertheless. But , i am a strong believer that good bro's girls are to be left alone.</p>
              <p>We all think too much. Only we know deep inside what it really means. If you dont , well, u will need to learn. Many years ahead . There will be times u will mis-read , misinterprete , but hey man.. even i mis read and misinterprete quite a few times. hahaha. but at least u know and learn from it. But if we purposely go and destroy thier relationship , its , not so right to. But not as wrong. You cannot be wrong when you can be more right.</p>
              <p>mmmm....  i seem to be in a lot of contradiction with my own statement vs principles. haha.. see , thats why i always have these conflicting feelings . And its a never ending battle. In the end. We all try to justify the things we do. How simple if i can just think 'ppls gf liaw cannot touch' . Only when i am single i tend to have these , urges to go al out. All fair in love and war. Was it all worth it ? Yes i can say. More worth it then not. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>
              <p>Good luck</p>

              <p>Never let emotions affect your work . Especially if u are the leader. It will affect ur judgements and the ability to apply your skills . Get a pillow and go into ur room and yetll into it. LOL! or go down into ur car n yell.. ARRRGH! hahaha..</p>

              <p>Why wasting time for some1 who doesnt love u? If u really love her , then wait till she broke up with her bf. U wanna be 3rd party destroying ppl's relationship? U enjoy this? Are u that selfish ? U ask urself. If u still talk to her then its ok but as long as frens talking. If u wanna date her then go on. But accept rejection.</p>

              <p>ok... actually work itself is not affected, but there's this guy in the same dept, he's more of a lady's guy... maybe more open and talkcock/chit chat with the ladies more often. And recently the two of them have been goin for breakfast, lunch together (I missed lunch quite alot due to the workload... just slogging in the background trying to help the team...)</p>
              <p>So the times when I've joined in, I become totally withdrawn. It's stupid but I cant' help it... they just have like alot to talk about (from previous conversations etc) It's now reached the point that now I'm trying to avoid going out with the 2 of them... go alone or jio another colleague to go. And just kena say that I'm anti-social.. which is true to an extent, looking at my behavior.</p>
              <p>Sigh, silly me. Alot of things perhaps I can make an effort to change, to think differently...but just cant seem to do it. Times where I wish there's tons more work so that I can<br>spend less time thinking over such things..  and heck, it's not like she's single.</p>

              <p>Yeap, ever had this kind of situation. My friend told me to fight for my own happines but he did not say to break them up or what. Til now, I'm still waiting.</p>
              <p>I ever told my friend, I have no confidence to woo her. Although I am better looking than the boyfriend, he is rich. He drives a van. I don't even have a license. Going out late as a group, he would come fetch her, she would offer to send me back to the east side, but I always reject and take cab home.</p>

I dont think any advice will be good cuz when one thinks that they should go, its hard to the one to think opposite cuz the feeling is just overwhelming.
