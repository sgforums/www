              <p>I'm not saying that I agree with ur action, somehow u alr crossed the line when u alr noe that she has a bf. Tell her and then? U expect a reply from her that she likes u too? More or less, u are alr sabotaging her r/s with her bf, whether intentionally or not.</p>
              <p>If she thinks she likes u more than her bf, she'll eventually let u noe her decision.</p>
              <p>If she told u that she'd rather remain as friends with u instead, then respect her decision. If that's the case, move on and get a life.</p>

              <p>Since u alr told her u like her, I think u better stop bothering
              her for now and see what decision she makes.</p>
              <p>I'm not saying that I agree with ur action, somehow u alr
              crossed the line when u alr noe that she has a bf. Tell her and
              then? U expect a reply from her that she likes u too? More or less,
              u are alr sabotaging her r/s with her bf, whether intentionally or
              not.</p>
              <p>If she thinks she likes u more than her bf, she'll eventually
              let u noe her decision.</p>
              <p>If she told u that she'd rather remain as friends with u
              instead, then respect her decision. If that's the case, move on and
              get a life.</p>

              <p>Then that means her mind has wavered.. She has feelings for u..</p>
              <p>There may be problems existing in her r/s right now. If u r willing to wait for her, then it's up to u.</p>

              <p>Sorry to burst your bubble bro. That statement is woman's language for '' I'm not interested in you so don't waste anymore time on me''.</p>
              <p>I am not going to judge you on whether it is morally right to fall in love with someone else's girlfriend. That's your prerogative, not mine. But i can tell you that you are wasting your time. Why do I say that? Because she doesn't like you enough to want to go out with you. And what does it mean when she doesnt want to go out with you? It means she is not interested.</p>
              <p>Couple of things I wanna say:</p>
              <p>1) It is not wrong to fall in love with someone else's girlfriend. If the girl isn't married, she's fair game. If the guy can't keep that girl, that's HIS problem, not yours. However, i do abide by the '' a friend's girlfriend is untouchable " mentality. Trust me, it's not worth losing a friend over a girl.</p>
              <p>2) Dont bother wooing, chasing, spending money, whatever you call it, on anyone who's not interested in you. There are plenty of girls out there. Please don't subscribe to the '' there's only one woman in this whole wide world for me '' mentality, you'd only severely limit your choices.</p>
              <p>3) Go out and meet some people. i must repeat this. There are PLENTY of girls out there waiting for '' the right guy''. So be their right guy.</p>
              <p>Good luck !</p>

              <p>thxs for ur lengthy reply.</p>
              <p>anyway i did not thought she like me just because , she went out with me for 1 time , and for that statement u quoted.</p>
              <p>she did once told me she like me . and yes miss tiny , there is a bit of problem going on with her n her bf i think , but im not very sure whats going on though cos i nv wanted to go into that topic.</p>
              <p>the reason why i brought up this topic here is that...recently i felt very guilty , by giving her more trouble instead , and of cos , the guilt of "snatching someone else gf"</p>
              <p>anyway...i do not know her bf at all , seen him once or twice only haha.</p>
              <p> </p>
