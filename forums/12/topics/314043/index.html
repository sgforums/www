              <p>Hi guys. Looking at the state of the economy and the high-cost living these days, I was thinking if it is really gonna be difficult to find jobs. Two years later, I'll most probably be entering the workforce after my NS, but I'm kinda worried that I'll not be able to get a job of enough pay to feed my family. Let alone to be able to get that one job.</p>
              <p>My mum told me as long as I have my diploma cert, I'll be granted at least a good chance to be able to successfully clinch a job. But the story is I may be looking fgor a job outside of my diploma. So what chances are there left? Is my mother right in any case?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Any advices to keep my mind in its stable condition?<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Blue/omg.png" alt="omg.png"></p>

              diploma these days also cannot make it......20 years ago starting pay was $1.2k, currently it's $1.6k, general degree was $1.4k, now about $2.2k. inflation, hdb and ministers' pay rises like nobody's business.....it's a trap, you go out to work, they want you to buy hdb which in turns finances the coffers of the state....
              
              let's say you get $1.6k, less 20% cpf you take home $1280, your mama and papa sure want to take something one, at least $200 if they not greedy, then transport min is also $200, food $200 if you don't eat high class, phone bills and other incidentals $100 if you are frugal...so what are you left? about $500 and even if you save all, you get $6k a year...pathetic...i would suggest you stay single and remain in your parents house...marriage will get you into a debt hole you can't get out these days.....
              
              is it a wonder sg young adults see little for themselves in the future.... so you are seeing more of these dip and deg holders 'doing surveys' at malls and mrt stations....
              
              i have mid 30's deg buddies who were laid off, some cabbies and others property agents....the job figures you see on papers don't tell the total picture......
              
              try to get a degree at least and one that's from a more reputable school....you might just have a shot for something better...

              <p>I totally agree with saving. it's not the matter of how much you earn, it's how much you can save, just like the already existing threads. High post = High Pay = High Expenditure. Average post = Average Pay = Average Expenditure. So if you're not those post that require you to be very very presentable, You probably don't need a closet full of Designer Shirts and Pants, or also don't need to spend excessive money on entertaining, and networking.</p>
              <p>the end of story is, make use of what you have, got hands and legs, sure won't die of hunger. Won't be millionaire, but you'll be just like any other people. Be content and you'll be fine.</p>
              <p>oh.. a stable mind would be, don't sign on. :)</p>
