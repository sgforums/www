            <div class='col-md body'>There's a few possibility...<br><br>1st, She might have wanna find a chance to get close to him,but this kinda possibility is rare.<br><br>Next, She might really have problems on her relationship, wanna find someone to chat with. As you had mentioned that your bf is a kind and helpful person, she might have approach him because of this. The reason that she's hiding from you maybe she doesn't want to let you misunderstand and break your relationship with your bf.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If only things r as simple as that.. Firstly, I don't scan my bf's hp coz I don't think he'd like it.. Secondly, I promised to give him trust which I did and I think he deserved a bit of it for telling mi that my cousin called him which he could have actually chosen not to tell.. Thirdly, he had repeatedly assured mi that nothing is gonna happen between my cousin and him.. My cousin is juz consulting him on her current bf coz even i'm suspecting her new bf to be a creep.. What is the most discreet way to do it??</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If I were you, then I would try to get more info out of my bf, coz it seems like thats where most of the info is coming in from.  Next, I would ask my bf if he does have the chance to speak to her again.  Ask her why she never revealed the truth to me?  Discreetly lah of coz, you dun want to risk spoiling an ok r/s between ur cousin after all.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What about the r/s between mi &amp; my bf?? This matter is kinda putting a strain on our r/s.. He barely have enough time for mi liao.. Then my cousin still have to take this time away from me.. Thou my bf told mi tt each time she called it's only barely a few minutes kind of conversation but why do i feel that he seems to noe more than I do about my cousin?

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually personally, I think it's quite okay for a girl to talk about her relationship with another guy... I'm not commenting  on whether your bf or your cousin have any other intentions or not, because it's hard to tell based on that ALONE...<br><br>It's just like a girl sharing her things with another girl...? Nowadays it's getting more common between boys and girls too...?</div>
