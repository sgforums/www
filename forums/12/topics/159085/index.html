            <div class='col-md body'>If you don't feel happy working there, you won't enjoy going to work, and as a result you won't enjoy doing what you do there. And most probally you won't do well. Working is for a lifetime, you gotta love what you do, and as Steve Jobs puts it, the only way to succeed is to do what you consider great work, and that is to do what you love. How to acheive that, when going to work everyday already see their black face? Like going to have a celebration dinner after getting distinction for all your papers,a dn on the way *touch-wood* see somebody kena knocked down by car. Then the celebration mood no more rite? Don't feel like eating rite? Same thing. I think it's the extra pay that gets the employees so engrossed in work(or the $?).</div>
