La trobe degrees doesn't have that strength either to get u a job<br><blockquote><br>Bachelor of Commerce (double Majors) - Murdoch University (SMA)<br></blockquote>Just like edith cowan but slightly better . However compared to the rest , it's no better.<br><blockquote><br>Bachelor of Commerce - Univ of Western Australia (PSB)<br></blockquote>UWA is a recognised university - do an accountancy major is my suggestion<br><blockquote><br>Bachelor of Business in Business Administration - RMIT Univ (SIM)<br></blockquote>Second tier university .  Not too recognised.<br><blockquote><br>Bachelor of Business Administration - Curtin Univ of Tech (PurpleTrain)<br></blockquote>I won't trust anything purple train - seems like some of their degrees are just accredited by the universities and allowed to use the university's name. BUT wayyy different from the university actual degree. Curtin is the same as murdoch- neither here nor there.<br>[quote]<br>Bachelor of Business &amp; Commerce - Monash University (TMC)<br>Bachelor of Business (Marketing) - Central Queensland Univ (Hartsford)<br><br></div></blockquote>Avoid marketing majors - you will find it hard to get jobs. Monash has a requirement in TMC for a final year - go to australia on the final year. Monash is not that fantastic out of the first tiers.<br><br>CQU was a former polytechnic . Nothing special. Same tier as murdoch and curtin and edith cowan - 3rd tiers.<br><br>You want a degree which will at least pay itself off in time. Not just a useless toilet paper degree. I would advise you to think carefully and research further what is recognised and what is not recognised.  Most importantly , is the degree accredited by Australian professional bodies such as ASIC, Australasian Association of Banking and Finance ( may have got that wrong).<br><br></div>

It is not only important to chose the right university but equally importance will have to given to chose the right educational institutes that are offering such courses.<br><br>Most institutes are hiring part time teaching staff to teach their students. Most of them are holding full time job and are less than committed in the teaching. I do know of certain institutes that are hiring Indians (not being discriminating) as teacher. Some students do have problems understand accent.<br><br>If possible ask for a visit around the centre and view the classroom, library, computer lab and etc. Most institutes claim to have a library but the titles tend to be old and limited.<br><br>Do check with the course counselor and do some research yourself if the course are accredited by Australian professional bodies. (e.g. accounting - CPA Australia)<br><br>In addition, most institutes (do check before you send up if it is possible) will also allow student to transfer part of their course to Australia. Hence, you can spend a year of a semester in Australia for your course. Do check with the counselor earlier in your course if you intend to do so.<br><br>As for your choice:<br>I think you should go for the better recognised university. UWA and Monash are top tier in Australia. You will not go wrong with them.<br><br>Something about Monash University course in Singapore:<br>There are two different business course that are running in Singapore. Bachelor of Business and Bachelor of Business and Commerce. Bachelor of Business are from Clayton campus and it is more well established and their entry requisites are higher. Student from Poly will have to attain at least average B and above to stand a chance in the program.<br>Bachelor of Business and Commerce is from Gippsland campus. This course are more general and have lower entry requirement.<br><br>SIM RMIT courses seem to be doing very well. I have friend who have graduated from their course and working in the government sector. They campus are well established, and it is now consider Singapore 4th university.<br><br>There should be an up and coming educational fair at Suntec in March. Do drop by and visit the place and find out more yourself. And I do not this institutes will give out freebies if you sign up on the spot.<br><br>Good Luck <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

And also the "kind" of lecturers they are getting.<br>Where is Northumbria University from? UK?<br><br>As for whether to do a well known or better degree....E.g. In the BIG 4 firms, they will go for students who grad from certain Aussie University because of their cirriculum.<br>As for some companies, they actually don't give a "damn" about the Uni that you are from but just as long as u have a degree (and it meets their company's requirement - mgmt requirement from corporate head office/because of image requirement), it's fine!<br><br>As for UWA, it's a very well known degree and also the fact that it is from PSB Academy, it makes it more "KNOWN" hence it's the price that you are paying for the "brand". (Cos they are basically a well known institute and also UWA is a well know Uni overall)<br><br>Do I make sense?</div>
