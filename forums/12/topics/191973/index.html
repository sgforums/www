It doesn't matter whether you were indeed too short (1.7 is still fine imho), because her words cuts your ego savagely like a mindless zombie. Your mind tried to ward off the incoming attack by installing a psychological defensive mechanism to restore that esteem balance she had greatly decimated.<br><br>Your mysogynist attitude is a byproduct of a piercing rejection which you took it personally. One likely scenario could be; chances are, your friends may have dissuade you from chasing her, but you probably turn on deaf ear until she had to destroy that blinded ego of yours to convey that message directly. If you were to reflect objectively, you would have realise that she might have rejected you, however subtlety it may seemed, but your pressuring love merely brush away that notion.<br><br>Your desire to amass materialistic power is a change to rebuilt your self worth. It's a very common transformation in Love (especially man), whenever their self worth is being questioned, regarding their personality or when in Love. Money represent power and because you have failed to secure the object of your affection, somehow, it seemed that you could have 'more power' through 'more money'.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>So what if you could own the world but loses your soul? </strong></span><br><br>Love is a free spirit that cannot be bounded by any artificial earthly powers. Its beauty can only be attracted and not postulated by some imperative manner.<br><br>Your self worth is in a blur, caused by a huge devastation of your falling ego. And this is the crucial moment when you make a choice between:<br><br>I) Rejuvenate your soul to explore the meaning of Love and gradually move on the advanced and higher study of Love.<br><br>II) Reject the lessons presented to seek your own path.<br><br>Aquarius, the water bearer, and it makes you a natural thinker. In Love, you are intellectually stimulated, but you must guard against degenerative thoughts that is self destructive because you are so mentally influenced/triggered (and your quality being fixed), that negative thoughts affect you far more insidious than the other signs (applicable Gemini and Libra as well).<br><br>P.S: I was once at this cross road of life, to become a fcuking player or to become what I am now. I took the latter road and there are several personal reasons why I did so. Still, it didn't banish the fact that we are all ruled by choices on the kind of attitude we want to adopt in Love.<br><br>This is the time to be spirtually enlightened. Explore your religion if you have or if you have none, you could study astrology like myself.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

You can seek counselling<br>2. You can try to find the answer in religion<br>3. You can discuss this to death with your friends or the "bo liao" "very eng" people in this forum. (The effect is the same.) As long as you have something to say, just say it. For example. I am still fcuking angry and the reason I am still fcuking angry is because....<br><br>you don't have to use vulgar language, but if you feel like it, just do it.<br><br>4. It will come to an end sooner or later.

Like has you relationship with your parents changed? Has the relationship your boss, colleagues changed? How has it changed, how is it still the same.

You won't be any more mature simply because you label yourself to be so... Anyway... Let that not be the main issue for now...<br><br>Somehow I just can't help but to think that you've got quite a narrow thought in certain sense? And in a way, rather stubborn in thinking? If you say that's not 'childish', I won't know what to call that...? Just why should her bf be labelled a bastard simply because he had sex with his ex...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>So ya said... Life is 'unfair' because she rejected you...? So you think life would only be 'fair' if life 'favors' you...? Cut the story short... So she didn't like you, you PESTERED her CONSTANTLY... What do you expect her to do..?? To say "I love you" to someone she doesn't love...?? Sheesh...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> I really don't know what else she could be saying to you than to say those sarcastic remarks to you so that you could be shook off...? Then ended up in what happened to you today, but I guess it really ain't that great too back the way you were then...??<br><br>If you would allow the experience with this girl to hinder you from knowing other girls and think that you should be MATERIALISTIC, you'll just have to UNDERSTAND that it's really YOUR CHOICE... You can CHOOSE to be STUCK UP, be COLD towards people... WHATEVER....

I'm Aquarius also! I nvr believed in Zodiac signs but I can see alot of similarities between u n me in my younger years. Maybe its just luck that I read such an interesting post and find my 'younger' me posting. haha..<br><br>Anyway young man, take heart! I wun provide you with advice like what 90% of the people here will say. I will tell you what 1% of the people will say or are doing but nvr say at all. What you choose to do is up to you, but I believe that with such hunger and passion in a warp way, you'll succeed well. Do know that doing the same as 90% of the population will make u end up like 90% of the world - the average joe. Not that there's anything wrong about that, but it's up to personal choice. Anyway, the focus is on you.<br><br>I sense great disturbance and instability in you. You can get to the root of this problem in 2 ways like what Yunhaier has said: Be the nice person or be a fucked up person. Well, I give you the 3rd choice, focus on something greater. I dun mean religion, but something just greater.<br><br>You have 2 issues here<br>1) Women<br>2) Money and power goals<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Women</span></strong><br>Many men make the mistake or we all have made the mistake of focusing on 1 one girl. Please don't do that. She's not even your wife or serious girlfriend who has sacrificed much for you. What you are actually doing is putting the pussy on a pedestal. Or in slang words, you have suffered the curse of the one-itis. Go google n see what it means <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>But anyway, I'm glad it's over. But really, such animosity is not needed. Such feelings of grudges or anger will only eat you up inside. You must have a confident and very positive outlook in life. Young man, there are 6 billion pple in the world. let's say 3 billion women, let's say 2.5million women.. let's say 500,000 women whom you are eligible to chase. And you are bearing a grudge over 1 woman? I hope she's damn hot and so seductive or damn charmer man. Coz I wun give such a woman these days such attention if it's not reciprocated. Anyway it's only 1 girl. There are definitely plenty others out there.<br><br>Believe me when I say i was alot like you during my younger years. But really, love is a numbers game. Never chase 1 girl at 1 time, you lose focus of the bigger picture and you get too emotionally attached. Unhealthy. It's pretty much like investing and sales, you dun depend your success on only 1 entity. Young man, you must go n meet more women out there. Keep an open mind, if you got chance, ask one of your older frens, bring you to see geylang and open eyes. You'll be surprised and open your mind immediately that hey, you are over-reacting when it comes to women. Sad to say, and still the truth, we men still run the world. So pls act like you are the alpha male and be proud of who you are.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Money and Power</strong></span><br>There's nothing wrong with your goals. I'll tell you that it's healthy and good. In fact, you are embracing a man's natural affinity for power. Remember, doing wat 90% of the rest of the pple do will only give you the same results as 90% of the pple. No one aims to be poor but 80% of the world will only control 20% of the world's wealth. Most will be struggling financially, living from paycheck to paycheck, some living on handouts and only the minority few will enjoy immense wealth. At 17 yrs old to have such thinking.. good! But thoughts without plans and actions is useless. Are you working now or studying still? Ifyou are studying, continue to study hard, read mroe business and self-improvement books on how to achieve more.<br><br>When you are rich, you'll definitely have power and women will come, dun worry. Your problem then is worrying about quality of women. Now you have to worry about quantity and quality. Why not focus your attention on improving yourself? Remember I talked about focusing on a bigger picture in life? Focus on your career/dream/idea. Go to bed each nite thinking how you have improved, wake up each morning wondering how you can improve for the day. Everything starts in small steps my young man.<br><br>Money is not evil. Money is everything. Everything - happiness, joy, security, freedom.. They all lie on the foundation of being financially secure. I dare anyone to reject my point by thinking about whether they still got time to thinking about posting on SGforums if their stomachs r empty, bills to pay, debts to settle etc. Money is the root of everything you see in life. But it's a merely a tool. Respect it and harness its power, in turn, you'll be rewarded immensely.<br><br>Remeber, no one dreams to be poor yet 80% will nvr be rich in their life. What would you do now? I admit I carry very strong, extremist views of my personal life but that's because I'm one who goes all out to achieve what I want and desire in life. I am willing to take time to post this as I see alot of myself in this post during my younger years. Back then I didn't have anyone to show me how I should embrace my destiny. I struggled thru life by myself and had to figure out my lifes journey and direction by myself. I'm very happy I made such choices and take each day with such hunger and passion to achieve more.<br><br>You can either think hard about what I say, or follow others, or find your own path. But hey, remember, doing what 90% of the rest of the pple do will give you the same results which 90% of the pple attain - The average joe. Nothing wrong. But it's a personal choice. You choose now.<br><br>All the best.</div>
