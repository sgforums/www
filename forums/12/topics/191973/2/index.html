I wished to slap you. Somehow I just can't help but to think that you're rather delusional to such things...<br><br>Well... I was young before... And I know how it feels when someone you love jus won't even bother to take a 2nd look at you... Certainly looked so 'unfair' as why 'this reaction' out of all other possible ones... Why this EXTREME?<br><br>1st thing you've got to understand... 'Bastard' he was, is only through your own eyes... You can't simply use your own standard of judgement, and expect other people to just follow suit all the time... So whether you're really 'alot better' (in what sense?), only her judgement matters since she's ultimately the one to make the decision...<br><br>2nd thing... Coming back to her not giving you a chance after all the time you've spent on her... She's a human, not a rock... Not even a pet (animal)... Even animals have their own right to show or not to show liking and affections for you... If you love a rock, probably she won't have a complaint about you.. And even if she gave you a chance and things won't work out... What would you be doing next then..? Probably complaining that she's not looking sincerely at you or something...? Not really giving you a chance but just giving you an excuse so that you could be shook off...? Not giving you enough attention and more time to prove yourself further still...? Hmm... Sorry but to bring you this HARD FACT... It's ALL IN YOUR MIND... If you're not able to face the fact at this point... You'll probably not so easily face even more chances are given to you and you're rejected... Until you 'wake up' one day....? Does it matter how much time and effort you put in..? Some people just don't have the 'cut' for drawing... Or singing... Or whatever else which requires certain level of talent.... If you're not made for this girl, you're not made for this girl... Just accept it... Forcing yourself through one way doesn't necessarily promise you any happiness to come....<br><br></div>
