              <div>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: black;">Dear All</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: black;"><br>On </span><span style="color: black;">11<sup>th</sup> April 2008</span><span style="color: black;">, my mum received a Termination letter (terminated with two weeks’ notice) from her F&amp;B Company. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: black;">My mum, who is 55 years old and is in perfect health shape, has been working as a part time stall assistant in this F&amp;B Company for close to 6 years.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: black;">She has been a faithfully worker who report for work without fail. This termination letter came as a shock and left her wondering why her service was terminated. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: black;">She is not guilty of serious misconduct, persistent un-punctuality or serious neglect of duty.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: black;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: black;">It is known that this F&amp;B Company is going to hire foreign (</span><span style="color: black;"><span id="lw_1208790812_0" class="yshortcuts" style="cursor: hand; border-bottom: #0066cc 1px dashed;">China</span></span><span style="color: black;">) workers due to salary concern. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: black;">My mum’s appointment letter dated </span><span style="color: black;">1<sup>st</sup> September 2002</span><span style="color: black;"> had this clause stating that<span style="background: #ffffbf;"> “You are assured that there is a continuity of the period of employment.” </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: black;">The F&amp;B Company is in a healthy financial state, which have a few food court operations in </span><span style="color: black;"><span id="lw_1208790812_1" class="yshortcuts" style="cursor: hand; border-bottom: #0066cc 1px dashed;">Singapore</span></span><span style="color: black;"> and overseas. So why is it that the F&amp;B Company terminated her?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: black;">Is it simply because the cost of hiring a foreigner is cheaper as compare to Singaporean?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: black;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: black;">Government is always encouraging more local senior citizen to contribute to working force but on the other hand, why some companies are retrenching or terminating older workers without any valid reason?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: black;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: black;">With only two weeks notice and my mum’s current age, she might not be able to find a job so soon. What if no company wants to hire her? Is my mum able to claim any damages from her F&amp;B Company?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: black;">Especially nowadays, there are so many foreigners fighting jobs with Singaporeans, our living standard and expenses had also increased tremendously. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: black;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: black;">I can’t seem to understand why majority of local companies love to hire foreigners. Is it simply because the cost of hiring them is lower?<span>  </span>Is there any fairer treatment for senior workers or any law that will protect them from preventing a company to terminate their employment without valid reason? </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: black;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: black;"><span style="color: black;">By the way, the Termination letter stated that her last day of work is 25 April (Fri) and so happen that Friday is her off day, is she still require to report for work on friday?</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: black;"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: black;">I just started out working and is unsure of Singapore labor law. Appreciate to anyone who is able to give comment and advise as what should my mum do. <br>Thank you. </span></p>

              <p>she is a part-timer only, which means, in her contract, it will be stated that they can terminate her given x number days notice.</p>
              <p>If she feels unfair termination due to discrimination, pertaining to her gender, age, etc, she can seek to speak to the HR and ask for a good explaination. If she is still unhappy with the reason, then she can lodge a complain to MOM to ask them for direction.</p>

              <p>Dear BrUtUs, darknessfall and Hello Kitty <br><br>Thank you so much for your prompt reply and advise. Appreciate it a lot.</p>
              <p>Actually my mum had went to MOM last Wednesday to find out what are the compensation that she will be entitled. But that malay lady officer told her that she won't get any compensation as her company had gave her 2 weeks notice. There is nothing my mum can do at all.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But for my personal view, why is it that MOM don't protect workers who were unfairly treated? Is there no way to fight against company who "happy happy" can terminate their employee and without any reason given?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Recently my mum looks worried and i am afraid that she might go into depression mode. Once she is jobless, she will be left alone at home.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The feeling of helplessness is so unbearable when there is nothing you can do to help your loved ones.</p>

              <p>It's sad to say, goverment may encourage one action, but tat doesnt mean all will follow.  Companies have their own gains to think abt, they r not doin charity.  Tis is the harsh &amp; cruel life in work force society where the slower, less competence get replaced by younger, faster &amp; the more competence..most of all cheaper wages in rate.  Wat do u think MOM can do?  It happens everywhere in every companies.</p>
              <p>Of cos, good news is, that there are still some companies who are show humanity in takin care of the less abled &amp; the senior citizens, e.g MacDonald, KFC etc...If ur mum is not the onli bread winner in the family, she can always go for interview in those areas. </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">But for my personal view, why is it that MOM don't protect workers who were unfairly treated? Is there no way to fight against company who "happy happy" can terminate their employee and without any reason given?</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Recently my mum looks worried and i am afraid that she might go into depression mode. Once she is jobless, she will be left alone at home.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The feeling of helplessness is so unbearable when there is nothing you can do to help your loved ones.</p>

              <p>sadly this is the world we live in. by SG law, the employer did not really do anything wrong because all the employer needs to do is give advance notice of termination and that's it.</p>
              <p>yes, the F&amp;B company is likely converting to use cheaper foreign workers. there'll only be a case for damages when the employer has made representations assuring that they will not sack you forever.</p>
              <p>Anyways, perhaps you can send her on holiday or tour? old people can relax and go holiday and be happy. Better off than working, i think.</p>

Employer must explain why they get FT, it must either b for labour work or only when they cant find local to fill up that position. Unlike here in sg.... even my company is fill with 50% of FT.

              <p>Unfortunately, this is the way of the world - survival of the fittest. If there are people willing to do the same job to the same standard for less pay, companies will of course cut costs there. If they don't do it, then their competitors will, and they will go out of business.</p>
              <p>My advice to you and your mom is to not lose hope and get depressed. Go out there and find other jobs to do, maybe look at other foodcourts or coffee shop. She might have to take less pay, but this is a natural consequence of the influx of low skilled FT.</p>
              <p>Balancing the influx of FT is a delicate process, we should leave it to our multi million ministers and their scholars to calculate.</p>

              <div>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000;">Dear All</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000;"><br>On</span> <span style="color: #000000;">11<sup>th</sup> April 2008</span><span style="color: #000000;">, my mum received a Termination letter (terminated with two weeks’ notice) from her F&amp;B Company.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000;">My mum, who is 55 years old and is in perfect health shape, has been working as a part time stall assistant in this F&amp;B Company for close to 6 years.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000;">She has been a faithfully worker who report for work without fail. This termination letter came as a shock and left her wondering why her service was terminated.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000;">She is not guilty of serious misconduct, persistent un-punctuality or serious neglect of duty.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is known that this F&amp;B Company is going to hire foreign (</span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="cursor: hand; border-bottom: #0066cc 1px dashed;">China</span></span><span style="color: #000000;">) workers due to salary concern.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000;">My mum’s appointment letter dated</span> <span style="color: #000000;">1<sup>st</sup> September 2002</span> <span style="color: #000000;">had this clause stating that <span style="background: #ffffbf;">“You are assured that there is a continuity of the period of employment.”</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000;">The F&amp;B Company is in a healthy financial state, which have a few food court operations in</span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="cursor: hand; border-bottom: #0066cc 1px dashed;">Singapore</span></span> <span style="color: #000000;">and overseas. So why is it that the F&amp;B Company terminated her?</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000;">Is it simply because the cost of hiring a foreigner is cheaper as compare to Singaporean?</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000;">Government is always encouraging more local senior citizen to contribute to working force but on the other hand, why some companies are retrenching or terminating older workers without any valid reason?</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000;">With only two weeks notice and my mum’s current age, she might not be able to find a job so soon. What if no company wants to hire her? Is my mum able to claim any damages from her F&amp;B Company?</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000;">Especially nowadays, there are so many foreigners fighting jobs with Singaporeans, our living standard and expenses had also increased tremendously.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000;">I can’t seem to understand why majority of local companies love to hire foreigners. Is it simply because the cost of hiring them is lower?<span> </span> Is there any fairer treatment for senior workers or any law that will protect them from preventing a company to terminate their employment without valid reason?</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: black;">By the way, the Termination letter stated that her last day of work is 25 April (Fri) and so happen that Friday is her off day, is she still require to report for work on friday?</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000;">I just started out working and is unsure of Singapore labor law. Appreciate to anyone who is able to give comment and advise as what should my mum do.<br>Thank you.</span></p>

              <p>actually the way I see it is that its a simple termination of service issue...</p>
              <p>I am not sure why U highlighted <span style="background: #ffffbf;">“You are assured that there is a continuity of the period of employment.”</span>...that employment letter was in 2002 and it has been 6 years...there is no clause saying that the period of employment is determined by the employee...so the employer has the right to terminate the employee's service subjected to the conditions mentioned in the employment letter...which I presume to be 2 week's notice...</p>
              <p>There is nothing much U can do based on the employment letter...its their company decision...ya...U can argue saying there is no misconduct/etc on the side of the employee but in a happy working relationship...both sides must be willing parties mah...if 1 side decides to go for foreign manpower...Good or bad,right or wrong aside...its their call.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>No...then the last day of work would be Thursday....maybe get ur mom to highlight the fact to her immediate superior just in case there are any misunderstanding...</p>
