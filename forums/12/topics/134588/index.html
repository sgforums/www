            <div class='col-md body'>7 months ago, I found the love and happiness of my life. I met her. She was such a nice person always so loving and caring. We got together just after 1 month and after 1 meeting. First 2 months were honeymoon and it was so wonderful. But as time passes, she started to display all her bad points which were so terrible that i didnt know what to do. I did treat her with all my heart and love her but there were so many times when she make me so frustrated.<br><br>Then came that very very unfortunate day, I admit that my temper wasnt very good and I like to settle things very fast (especially relationship problems). She got very unhappy and refuse to talk to me. I tried to ask whats wrong but she simply dont want to talk. Out of frustration, I grab her tightly. She slap me then I did something which I never should - I hit her back!!!<br><br>I really regret what I did. Really.<br><br>I lost control that day and my frustration got over me. I really wanted so much to spend the rest of my life with her. Now everything is over cos I did the ultimate unforgiveable things!<br><br>Now my life is in a big mess and i seems to be living for nothing. I hate what i did but i cannot change the fact that i did it. I really want to be with her but after what i done, i really dont think that is possible anymore.<br><br>I have very few friends, thats why i pour out my feelings here.<br><br>1 remorseful guy,<br>Whom dont have 2 chances.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>there is a need to know each other better before committing to a relationship, 1 month and 1 meeting is way too short. Say, you know her better as a friend, and vice-versa, maybe the relationship wouldn't even have started, thus saving all the pain and sorrow you are feeling now. take this as a lesson learnt.<br><br>another point is your temper. you must learn to control it and eradicate this sting totally. it will not only affect future relations but at work as well. in a sense, you are potentially a wife beater.</div>

Take it as a hard lesson and learn to mellow down.  Then start afresh again....<br><br>Time is on your side because people get mellow with age too....in another 5-10 years' time, you will find it easier to control yourself.<br><br></div>

I hate what i did but i cannot change the fact that i did it. I really want to be with her but after what i done, i really dont think that is possible anymore.<br><br>I have very few friends, thats why i pour out my feelings here.<br><br>1 remorseful guy,<br>Whom dont have 2 chances.  </div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> You began your relationship rather hastily; just after a month and within one date and bloom - the relationship is born. It could be true for your intense feelings for her; the passion and everything else, but to be frank, it may not be quite equal on the other side.<br><br>Merely two months into the reality of Love and you see cracks of individual personality. I would tell you it's a perfectly natural process; what matters is how you handle your relationship after the sweet honeymoon has passed and not what's sweet and loving in the beginning. It's pretty sad to realise that you hit her over some minor dispute; you ought to realise that EVEN if she is your wife, there are no reasons justifiable for such reaction.<br><br>The violence indicates <strong>not </strong>the lack of love - rather the helpless agony of a man who fell before the cruel reality of his own relationship. Love cannot be subdue (via Mars), it can only be tamed (via Venus). To ignore the usage of proper communication as a matured couple will serve to fail your own relationship even if problems are minor and insignificiant like your thingy.<br><br>This Love is young; she probably still have the ability to escape the clutches of the relationship without much emotional issues. From your post, your had probably lost this love... already. The only consolation is that, if you learn this the hard way, make sure this lessons stays with you for life. To dump away what you have gain, is as good as sacrificing future relationship with history repeats.<br><br>P.S: Actually, you have your second chance; that's your next relationship - my promise to you. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To Deportivo, gentlerock, littlestream:<br><br>About the potentially wife beater, I agree with you cos if it can happen once it may happen again. But I learn alot from this lesson. The pain of losing my beloved is so much more difficult to bear than the pain of enduring my temper and frustration. So my perstective have changed and I will never never use violent anymore. Things are often easier said than done but I definately will try hard. Thanks for advice.<br><br>To timble:<br><br>Although more than often right and wrong is hard to differentiate. but in this case I am definately wrong even though she slap me first. I am a guy and so show some gentleman-ism when dealing with girls (so much more her)<br><br>To Devil1976, zheshi:<br><br>I already apologise to her so many times until I lost count but think haven gotten forgiveness from her. So many times she ended our conversation with a "ok we still an item" Then after she put down the phone, she will send msg saying negative things and uncertainty about the relationship. This is making me confused and frustrated - the thought of losing her forever is slowing draining my soul away. I really dont know what I can do anymore to get her love back.<br><br>To Apollo_sg, Yunhaier:<br><br>Although its true that I started too fast but this type of thing is really beyond our control. Imagine meeting someone whom you like almost immediately and willing to spend the rest of the life together. And she have exact the same thinking. How would one be able to say oh wait for a while before getting together. There are poeple who will be able to but unfortunately the 2 of us werent from this category.<br><br>"The violence indicates not the lack of love - rather the helpless agony of a man who fell before the cruel reality of his own relationship." - this clearly explain my behaviour that night. (Golden words)<br><br>Thanks for the concern regardless of whether they are real or fake.<br><br>I am not trying to defend myself but i feel that repling to each of you helps to brighten up my lousy period a bit. As I have few friends, I can only pour things out here so as not to hide everything inside my heart.<br><br>I really hope to have another chance as all I bring along with me now into this relationship is much more love, sincerity and tolerance.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi again under-construction....<br><br>Woah, I didn't imply wife beater at all....please don't be mistaken.  I think wife-beaters are of a different category altogether.  Just because you slapped a girl once doesn't make you a potential compulsive wife-beater...no no no....definitely not!<br><br>Look at it this way.  We've all been in scuffles and have lied before.  But that doesn't make us compulsive troublemakers or liars.  Sometimes things just happen on impulse, under certain circumstances.  No, no....please don't even start to think that you'd be a wife beater.<br><br>We all have done things we've regretted anyway....who hasn't?  This case is just one of yours, which you've regretted.<br><br>Anyway, its was nice to hear from you again after you had read our replies.  And your reply carried a calm tone too! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div>
