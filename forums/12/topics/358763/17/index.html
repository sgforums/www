              <p>well she can go to kkh for abortion. don't worry don't need parents consent. totally remain discreet. how many months?? it will cost you abt $300. if below 3mths only  need a day to do the abortion. but more than that she probably need to be admitted. well she can lie that she's going for chalet or something.</p>
              <p>im not encouraging abortion, i discourage underage sex. do you know that you are in a very hot soup for having sex with below 16 yrs of age girl??this is a police case.  what were you guys thinking?? you are too immature to have sex why let the peer pressure in?? have some sex education first and know what's the consequences. i hope this serves you and everybody else a lesson. she's bloody young. it's very traumatizing. the one suffering most isn't you but the girl. it's a life mind you. pls take this experienced seriously and not do it again. very disappointing. what's wrong with kids nowadays??</p>

              <p>still, maybe got solution,</p>

              <p>2nd make yourself presentable. just meet her mom. be intiative arrange
                              place and time. best if u dont want paiseh go someplace like park or
                              garden. also call the police on our own. its torture to see the girl's
                              mom calling the police in front on u. best get her to go police station
                              and get police to meditate?? if possible...</p>
              <p>3rd dont do anything foolish. thing b4 u act. (cons and pros) do things

              <p> </p>
              <p>btw: if you think this is hard. think of yr gf and whats shes going through now.( gives u courage i think)</p>
              <p><strong> this is just my suggestion.. dont take them too heavily i 16yrs old nia. so a little stupid and foolish also... best is get counsellor's advice.<br></strong></p>
              <p> you can also go for "<a href="/users/220263">princesspatzziyang</a>" sggestion. but since her mom knows, go ARRANGE meeting with her( take initiative, dont get her to come knock on your door, she will want to meet your parents one, so bring your parent/s along) then tell her your plan the "abortion w/o parent's consent thing. the rest good luck.</p>
              <p>rmb, its YOUR FAULT and u shd actively make suggestion on how solve prob.</p>
              <p>PS also try make her think u nice boy and not pai kia. (though u probably are one since u do such things)</p>
