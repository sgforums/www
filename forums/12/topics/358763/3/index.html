              <p>Anyway, you for sure need to tell your parents. So what if you know that they will kill you? If you dare to do then you dare to admit it and face the consequences. For your age getting money to let the girl do abortion is hard la, unless you come from very rich family, where your pocket money is a few hundreds a month. Somemore 13 years old go do abortion, you think ur gf can handle it emotionally???</p>
              <p>è‡ªé¦–å�§. turn yourself in. The court will give you a lighter sentence if you cooperate with the authorities, instead of trying to get ways and means to let her do illegal abortion, which may firstly, take away lives and secondly, get yourself into more troubles.</p>

              <h1><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Termination of Pregnancy/Abortion in Singapore<br></span><em>Information on who to contact and how to proceed in the event of an unwanted pregnancy. Also information on the types of termination practised, the counselling available and general health promotion.</em></h1>
              </div>
              <p>In Singapore, abortion is legal on socio-medical grounds. The legal time limit for abortion is 24 weeks into the pregnancy.</p>
              <h5>The Age of Legal Consent and Under 21s</h5>
              <p>In Singapore the Abortion Act law states that there is no defined age limit for the abortion procedure, nor is there a legal requirement for parental consent for minors under the age of 21.</p>
              <p>In other words just about anyone may request the procedure for unwanted pregnancy, provided they are of sound mind and body and understand the risks and details of the procedure. <br><strong>Note</strong>: In contrast, if a miscarriage happens, then parental consent is required for anyone below the age of 21.</p>
              <p>The law applies to all patients, regardless of nationality.</p>
              <h4><strong>Legal restrictions on foreigners</strong></h4>
              <p>Foreigners are only eligible for pregnancy termination/abortion in Singapore if one of the following criteria are met:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>They have been residing in Singapore for 4 months or more </li>
              <li>They are married to a Singapore citizen or have PR status </li>
              <li>If they have a work permit</li>
              </ul>
              <p>These restrictions do not apply to foreigners who require evacuation for miscarriage, but the age of legal consent (21 and above) will apply in this scenario.</p>
              <h5><strong>Before the Procedure</strong></h5>
              <p>The Abortion Law act requires that the woman undergoes brief counselling by a qualified abortion counsellor at any accredited abortion clinic, and watch a video on the subject.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Girls under 16 years of age</span> have to undergo <span style="text-decoration: underline;">mandatory counselling</span> at the </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><a href="http://singapore.angloinfo.com/r.asp?http://www.hpb.gov.sg/hpb/default.asp?pg_id=776"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Health Promotion Board Counselling Centre</span></a></span></span>. <span style="color: #888888;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">They will be issued with a Certificate of Attendance (COA) without which they will not legally be allowed to have an abortion.</span></span></span></strong></p>
              <p>There is also a mandatory waiting period of <strong>48 hours</strong> after the counselling before the procedure can be done.</p>
              <h5>Procedure for an Abortion</h5>
              <p>There are 2 main types of abortion procedure, depending on the gestation of the pregnancy</p>
              <ol>
              <li>For early pregnancies <strong>3 months (12 weeks) and below</strong>, the procedure is called <strong>vacuum aspiration</strong>. This usually involves being put to sleep for about 10 minutes, during which time a small tube is placed into the womb via the vagina. An attached vacuum will then remove all the pregnancy contents of the womb. </li>
              <li>For pregnancies <strong>3 to 6 months (13 to 24 weeks)</strong> , the procedure is known as Mid Trimester Pregnancy Termination (MTPT) which is a more complicated affair. Hospitalisation is usually required for a day or two, during which medicine is inserted into the vagina to induce natural expulsion of the pregnancy. After the foetus and placenta are aborted, the process of evacuation of the womb follows. This is basically the same procedure as used in <strong>vacuum aspiration</strong>; it ensures that the womb contents have been thoroughly evacuated. </li>
              </ol>
              <p>The second method takes a little longer and is messier, so it is far preferable that an early decision for abortion be made, before 3 months if possible.</p>
              <h4><strong>Abortion in a pregnancy beyond 24 weeks</strong></h4>
              <p><strong>Abortion is not allowed if a pregnancy has progressed beyond 24 weeks.</strong> The legal limit of termination of pregnancy in Singapore is 6 months, or 24 weeks, beyond which abortion of any pregnancy is illegal. Most doctors would not initiate abortion beyond 23 weeks as the abortion has to be completed <strong>by</strong> 24 weeks. The only exception to this rule would be a severe or lethal foetal abnormality but even then, special approval would have to be sought from the authorities before the procedure can be done.</p>
              <h4><strong>Limit to how early in a pregnancy the abortion can be performed</strong></h4>
              <p>A woman choosing to have the procedure, should make an appointment as soon as possible in order to date and to locate the pregnancy so that the timing of the procedure can be planned. This is important because is not advisable to have the procedure too early in the pregnancy, as the risks of retained products and a "missed" abortion is higher.</p>
              <h4><strong>Expected downtime after the procedure</strong></h4>
              <p>Though the evacuation procedure itself takes only about 10 to 20 minutes, it would probably be advisable to take the rest of the day off in view of the residual effects of the anaesthesia. Recovery should be complete by the next day.</p>
              <h4><strong>Risks with the procedure</strong></h4>
              <p>The risks of the procedure are rare, and consist of bleeding from the womb, infection and trauma to the cervix.</p>
              <p>Another extremely rare complication is uterine perforation, which is when the probe goes through the wall of the womb, and which requires repair via keyhole surgery.</p>
              <h4><strong>Long term effects (including emotional and psychological trauma)</strong></h4>
              <p>The risks of infertility from abortion carried out in a modern setting, particularly in a sterile environment, are extremely low. As for psychosocial effects, these are far less common than some sensationalist media imply. In fact the only satisfactory studies conducted in this regard show that there is an improvement in the mental well-being when compared to someone who has to go through the entire process of an unwanted pregnancy.</p>
              <p>Nonetheless many aspects of emotional and mental well being are subjective, and coloured by social, cultural and religious influences, making this a controversial issue. The impact of regret also varies from individual to individual. A qualified gynaecologist can provide in-depth discussion and unbiased counselling.</p>
              <h4><strong>Cost of the procedure</strong></h4>
              <p>The cost of the surgery itself in Singapore ranges from S$300 to S$2000. The large disparity is due to variations in the type of theatre employed, the depth of anaesthesia applied and in the package inclusions. For MTPT, the hospitalisation and medication charges must also be taken into account. An accredited abortion centre should be contacted for an in-depth discussion.</p>
              <p>Patients are also usually entitled to a medisave claim, although this may not be relevant to foreigners.</p>
              <h4><strong>Abortion through taking medication</strong></h4>
              <p>The practice of medical termination via taking of prostaglandins has the advantage of avoiding surgery. However it is a more prolonged process, and may involve pain and bleeding which may last for weeks. There is also a slightly higher failure rate, which may <strong>still</strong> require one to undergo a formal evacuation if the medicine fails.</p>
              <h4><strong>Traditional medicines </strong></h4>
              <p>The procedure <strong>should only</strong> be undertaken under the supervision of a <strong>qualified non-objecting gynaecologist</strong> trained in abortion procedures. "Traditional" or "alternative" methods of abortion using<strong> </strong>pineapples, herbs and/or instrumentation in unsanitary conditions should be avoided as complications such as infection, bleeding and sometimes infertility can occur.</p>
              <h5><strong>The Doctor's Rights, a Woman's Choice </strong></h5>
              <p>A doctor may refuse to perform the procedure on personal grounds although the woman retains her choice in the matter of abortion.<strong> </strong>It is the duty of every responsible medical practitioner to offer the patient a second opinion even if they object to the procedure on religious grounds. <strong><br></strong>An accredited abortion centre is a good source of unbiased objective information. The final decision is made by the pregnant woman.</p>
              <p>The most important aspect of abortion is the decision to have one. There are a myriad of conflicting social, religious and financial issues that have to be sorted out carefully so time should be taken to make an informed decision as this is something that should not be taken lightly.</p>

              <p>Best thing you can do is talk with your parents.</p>
              <p>Regardless of what you believe they might do.</p>
              <p>Fact is that in modern society you and her are too young to deal with the consequences of having a child. So abortion would be an option. But abortion is not without risk (http://www.pregnancycenters.org/abortion.html) so therefore you guys should not make this decision on your own. Consult with your parents (both yours and hers) and with the doctor. Also abortion can cause mental difficulties for the girl who undergoes the abortion. So that's also one of the reasons you should consult with both your parents and a doctor who's specialized in certain situations.</p>
              <p>If I was in the same situation I would probably still go for the abortion, unless she wouldnt want to do an abortion. Because in my opinion having a child at that young age is not a great way of developing yourself (both you and the girl) since you both are still kids and kids need to live as kids and have fun and what not. Kids in modern society should not raise a child because of this. (And I wont say anything about if it's good for the child or not).</p>
              <p>I strongly advise you not to act on what others say about this matter and talk this through with both your and her parents and a doctor. Than you can establish what you like to do according to the information you gained. Decide what both you and your girlfriend wants to do and be considerate towards your girlfriend, since for a girl such a situation is far more emotional and difficult then for a guy.</p>
              <p><br>Good luck in the matter and make a wise decision.</p>
