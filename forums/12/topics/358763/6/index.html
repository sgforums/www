              <h1><span style="color: #800000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Termination of Pregnancy/Abortion in Singapore<br></span><em>Information on who to contact and how to proceed in the event of an unwanted pregnancy. Also information on the types of termination practised, the counselling available and general health promotion.</em></span></h1>
              </div>
              <p>In Singapore, abortion is legal on socio-medical grounds. The legal time limit for abortion is 24 weeks into the pregnancy.</p>
              <h5>The Age of Legal Consent and Under 21s</h5>
              <p>In Singapore the Abortion Act law states that there is no defined age limit for the abortion procedure, nor is there a legal requirement for parental consent for minors under the age of 21.</p>
              <p>In other words just about anyone may request the procedure for unwanted pregnancy, provided they are of sound mind and body and understand the risks and details of the procedure.<br><strong>Note</strong>: In contrast, if a miscarriage happens, then parental consent is required for anyone below the age of 21.</p>
              <p>The law applies to all patients, regardless of nationality.</p>
              <h4><strong>Legal restrictions on foreigners</strong></h4>
              <p>Foreigners are only eligible for pregnancy termination/abortion in Singapore if one of the following criteria are met:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>They have been residing in Singapore for 4 months or more</li>
              <li>They are married to a Singapore citizen or have PR status</li>
              <li>If they have a work permit</li>
              </ul>
              <p>These restrictions do not apply to foreigners who require evacuation for miscarriage, but the age of legal consent (21 and above) will apply in this scenario.</p>
              <h5><strong>Before the Procedure</strong></h5>
              <p>The Abortion Law act requires that the woman undergoes brief counselling by a qualified abortion counsellor at any accredited abortion clinic, and watch a video on the subject.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Girls under 16 years of age</span> have to undergo <span style="text-decoration: underline;">mandatory counselling</span> at the</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><a rel="nofollow" href="http://singapore.angloinfo.com/r.asp?http://www.hpb.gov.sg/hpb/default.asp?pg_id=776"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Health Promotion Board Counselling Centre</span></span></a></span></span>. <span style="color: #888888;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">They will be issued with a Certificate of Attendance (COA) without which they will not legally be allowed to have an abortion.</span></span></span></strong></p>
              <p>There is also a mandatory waiting period of <strong>48 hours</strong> after the counselling before the procedure can be done.</p>
              <h5>Procedure for an Abortion</h5>
              <p>There are 2 main types of abortion procedure, depending on the gestation of the pregnancy</p>
              <ol>
              <li>For early pregnancies <strong>3 months (12 weeks) and below</strong>, the procedure is called <strong>vacuum aspiration</strong>. This usually involves being put to sleep for about 10 minutes, during which time a small tube is placed into the womb via the vagina. An attached vacuum will then remove all the pregnancy contents of the womb.</li>
              <li>For pregnancies <strong>3 to 6 months (13 to 24 weeks)</strong> , the procedure is known as Mid Trimester Pregnancy Termination (MTPT) which is a more complicated affair. Hospitalisation is usually required for a day or two, during which medicine is inserted into the vagina to induce natural expulsion of the pregnancy. After the foetus and placenta are aborted, the process of evacuation of the womb follows. This is basically the same procedure as used in <strong>vacuum aspiration</strong>; it ensures that the womb contents have been thoroughly evacuated.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>The second method takes a little longer and is messier, so it is far preferable that an early decision for abortion be made, before 3 months if possible.</p>
              <h4><strong>Abortion in a pregnancy beyond 24 weeks</strong></h4>
              <p><strong>Abortion is not allowed if a pregnancy has progressed beyond 24 weeks.</strong> The legal limit of termination of pregnancy in Singapore is 6 months, or 24 weeks, beyond which abortion of any pregnancy is illegal. Most doctors would not initiate abortion beyond 23 weeks as the abortion has to be completed <strong>by</strong> 24 weeks. The only exception to this rule would be a severe or lethal foetal abnormality but even then, special approval would have to be sought from the authorities before the procedure can be done.</p>
              <h4><strong>Limit to how early in a pregnancy the abortion can be performed</strong></h4>
              <p>A woman choosing to have the procedure, should make an appointment as soon as possible in order to date and to locate the pregnancy so that the timing of the procedure can be planned. This is important because is not advisable to have the procedure too early in the pregnancy, as the risks of retained products and a "missed" abortion is higher.</p>
              <h4><strong>Expected downtime after the procedure</strong></h4>
              <p>Though the evacuation procedure itself takes only about 10 to 20 minutes, it would probably be advisable to take the rest of the day off in view of the residual effects of the anaesthesia. Recovery should be complete by the next day.</p>
              <h4><strong>Risks with the procedure</strong></h4>
              <p>The risks of the procedure are rare, and consist of bleeding from the womb, infection and trauma to the cervix.</p>
              <p>Another extremely rare complication is uterine perforation, which is when the probe goes through the wall of the womb, and which requires repair via keyhole surgery.</p>
              <h4><strong>Long term effects (including emotional and psychological trauma)</strong></h4>
              <p>The risks of infertility from abortion carried out in a modern setting, particularly in a sterile environment, are extremely low. As for psychosocial effects, these are far less common than some sensationalist media imply. In fact the only satisfactory studies conducted in this regard show that there is an improvement in the mental well-being when compared to someone who has to go through the entire process of an unwanted pregnancy.</p>
              <p>Nonetheless many aspects of emotional and mental well being are subjective, and coloured by social, cultural and religious influences, making this a controversial issue. The impact of regret also varies from individual to individual. A qualified gynaecologist can provide in-depth discussion and unbiased counselling.</p>
              <h4><strong>Cost of the procedure</strong></h4>
              <p>The cost of the surgery itself in Singapore ranges from S$300 to S$2000. The large disparity is due to variations in the type of theatre employed, the depth of anaesthesia applied and in the package inclusions. For MTPT, the hospitalisation and medication charges must also be taken into account. An accredited abortion centre should be contacted for an in-depth discussion.</p>
              <p>Patients are also usually entitled to a medisave claim, although this may not be relevant to foreigners.</p>
              <h4><strong>Abortion through taking medication</strong></h4>
              <p>The practice of medical termination via taking of prostaglandins has the advantage of avoiding surgery. However it is a more prolonged process, and may involve pain and bleeding which may last for weeks. There is also a slightly higher failure rate, which may <strong>still</strong> require one to undergo a formal evacuation if the medicine fails.</p>
              <h4><strong>Traditional medicines </strong></h4>
              <p>The procedure <strong>should only</strong> be undertaken under the supervision of a <strong>qualified non-objecting gynaecologist</strong> trained in abortion procedures. "Traditional" or "alternative" methods of abortion using pineapples, herbs and/or instrumentation in unsanitary conditions should be avoided as complications such as infection, bleeding and sometimes infertility can occur.</p>
              <h5><strong><span style="color: #008000;">The Doctor's Rights, a Woman's Choice </span></strong></h5>
              <p><span style="color: #008000;">A doctor may refuse to perform the procedure on personal grounds although the woman retains her choice in the matter of abortion. It is the duty of every responsible medical practitioner to offer the patient a second opinion even if they object to the procedure on religious grounds. </span><strong><br></strong><span style="color: #008000;">An accredited abortion centre is a good source of unbiased objective information. The final decision is made by the pregnant woman.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008000;">The most important aspect of abortion is the decision to have one. There are a myriad of conflicting social, religious and financial issues that have to be sorted out carefully so time should be taken to make an informed decision as this is something that should not be taken lightly.</span></p>

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Abortion – The Facts</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong>What is an abortion?</strong><br>Abortion is ending a pregnancy early before the foetus can survive outside the womb. If it occur spontaneously or naturally, it’s commonly referred to as a “miscarriage”. This is usually because the foetus has passed away in the womb. Under these circumstances, the pregnancy may be expelled from the womb naturally or may require surgery.</p>
              <p>Abortion can also be induced. The foetus together with the placenta is expelled from the womb before it is developed enough to survive and will result in its death. In this article, the word abortion means the voluntary termination of pregnancy.</p>
              <p><strong>How is abortion performed? <br></strong>You will have to see a gynaecologist who will examine you and send you for ultrasound scan to find out how far advanced your pregnancy <strong>and if the foetus is in the correct location in the womb. If it is outside the womb,it is potentially life threatening. </strong></p>
              <p><strong>The gynaecologist will then send you for counselling, if you wish to have an abortion.</strong> After counselling, if you are still certain about going for the abortion, you will be scheduled for one. How the abortion is performed depends on how advanced your pregnancy is.</p>
              <p>If your pregnancy is less than 12 weeks, you will undergo a day surgical procedure. Under anaesthesia, a plastic hollow tube is inserted into the womb and suction applied to empty the womb.</p>
              <p>Although it is a simple and very safe procedure, there are some risks. These include:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>  
              <ul>
              <li>Bleeding which may require hospitalisation and blood transfusion </li>
              <li>Damage to cervix which may result in early delivery or pregnancy loss in subsequent pregnancies. To reduce this, medication is inserted in the vagina before the procedure </li>
              <li>Perforation (making a hole) in the womb which may require further surgery </li>
              <li>Infection which can cause fever and pain and hospitalisation. This may impair future fertility </li>
              <li>Rarely, scarring of the lining of the womb such that you may not have menses any more. It can also cause difficulty getting pregnant in the future.<br></li>
              </ul>
              </li>
              </ul>
              <p>If the pregnancy is 12 weeks to 24 weeks, you will be hospitalised for 2 to 3 days, sometimes longer. A series of prostaglandin tablets are inserted in the vagina to cause contraction and opening of the neck of the womb until the foetus and placenta is expelled. If there are retained tissues, a surgery to “clean out” the womb may be required.</p>
              <p>The risks of abortion at this period include</p>
              <ul>
              <li>  
              <ul>
              <li>Strong and painful cramps which may require painkiller </li>
              <li>Nausea and fever </li>
              <li>Bleeding which may require hospitalisation and blood transfusion </li>
              <li>Damage to cervix, which may result in early delivery or pregnancy loss in subsequent pregnancies. </li>
              <li>Tearing of a previous scar in the womb which may require further surgery. This is more common in women with previous Caesarean or operations to remove fibroids from their womb. </li>
              <li>Infection which can cause fever and pain and hospitalisation. This may impair future fertility </li>
              <li>Failure to abort. This may require other options that has to be discussed with the doctor </li>
              </ul>
              </li>
              </ul>
              <p>There are certain laws which you need to be aware of for an abortion to be carried out legally:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>  
              <ul>
              <li>the abortion must be performed by a gynaecologist in a certified approved institution </li>
              <li>your pregnancy must be less than 24 weeks </li>
              <li>you must undergo pre-abortion counselling at: 
              <ul>
              <li>the approved institution where the abortion is to be carried out if you are above 16 years old </li>
              <li><strong><span style="color: #ff00ff;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">at the Health Promotion Board Counselling Centre if you are below 16 years old <br>(A Certificate of Attendance will then be issued to you. This must be shown to your gynaecologist before you can be go for the abortion)</span></span></strong></li>
              </ul>
              </li>
              <li>you can only undergo abortion 48 hours after the counselling </li>
              <li>You must undergo post-abortion counselling which includes family planning education. </li>
              </ul>
              </li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>Are you considering an abortion? <br></strong>If you have just found out that you are pregnant and it was unplanned, do take some time to think of the options very carefully. Although your initial reaction may be shock or panic, it is a good idea to speak to a responsible adult whom you can trust. There are also Helplines (can be hyperlinked direct to the Helplines section) you can call. Avoid making any hasty decisions, which you might regret later.</p>
              <p><strong>Remember that you have choices</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Becoming a parent</strong> <br>Parenting is a rewarding experience however challenging it may be. Do not rule this out as an option.</p>
              <p>Try to think through the following questions:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>  
              <ul>
              <li>Is it possible for you to marry the father of your child? </li>
              <li>Would the father be able to provide financial or childcare support, whether or not you marry him? </li>
              <li>Could your/his family help (in terms of finance, childcare and living arrangements)? </li>
              </ul>
              </li>
              </ul>
              <p>If you have enough support to raise the child, do consider parenthood. Discuss care and financial arrangements carefully with your family and/or that of the family of the child’s father bearing in mind what is best for you and your child.</p>
              <p>If you are considering marriage, do take note that you have to apply for a special licence for marriage if you are under 18.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Putting your child up for adoption</span></strong> <br>This is another option. In Singapore , there are laws regarding who can adopt your child. The age, financial stability, compatibility and the ability to provide a loving environment for your child are all taken into account before approval is given for adoption to take place. Think through the following points regarding adoption:</span></p>
              <ul>
              <li><span style="color: #0000ff;">  </span>
              <ul>
              <li><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are you able to handle the possibility of not seeing your child again or of maintaining a relationship with your child? </span></li>
              <li><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are you able to manage financially and emotionally during your pregnancy and childbirth until adoption procedures have been completed? </span></li>
              </ul>
              </li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>Abortion <br></strong>Before you decide on an abortion, do consider the following:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>  
              <ul>
              <li>Have you explored all your options carefully and thoroughly? </li>
              <li>Have you spoken to your partner (father of your child) and both your families? </li>
              <li>Is an abortion what <strong>you</strong> really want? Are you being pressured into having an abortion? </li>
              <li>Are you clear about the procedure, the risks and side effects? </li>
              </ul>
              </li>
              </ul>
              <p>If you have decided to proceed with the abortion, try and ensure that you have enough support on the day as well as the days following the abortion. If you have been seeing a social worker,remember to go for your follow-up sessions.Clarify all your concerns and questions during the post-abortion counselling session.</p>
              <p><strong>Other important considerations</strong> <br>Here are some other important points for consideration: </p>
              <ul style="margin-right: 0px;" dir="ltr">
              <li>  
              <ul>
              <li>Have you been tested for STIs? STIs refer to sexually transmitted infection. It is more likely if you or your partner have other sexual partners. STIs put you at risk of infection during the abortion and also may have other consequences in your health and fertility. </li>
              <li>Have you thought about family planning and contraception? <span style="font-family: Tahoma; color: black; font-size: 10pt; " lang="EN-GB"><span style="color: black; " lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></span></span></li>
              </ul>
              </li>

              <h1><span style="color: #800000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Termination of Pregnancy/Abortion in
              Singapore<br></span><em>Information on who to contact and how to
              proceed in the event of an unwanted pregnancy. Also information on
              the types of termination practised, the counselling available and
              general health promotion.</em></span></h1>
              </div>
              <p>In Singapore, abortion is legal on socio-medical grounds. The
              legal time limit for abortion is 24 weeks into the pregnancy.</p>
              <h5>The Age of Legal Consent and Under 21s</h5>
              <p>In Singapore the Abortion Act law states that there is no
              defined age limit for the abortion procedure, nor is there a legal
              requirement for parental consent for minors under the age of
              21.</p>
              <p>In other words just about anyone may request the
              procedure for unwanted pregnancy, provided they are of
              sound mind and body and understand the risks and details of the
              procedure.<br> <strong>Note</strong>: In contrast, if a miscarriage happens, then
              parental consent is required for anyone below the age of
              21.</p>
              <p>The law applies to all patients, regardless of nationality.</p>
              <h4><strong>Legal restrictions on foreigners</strong></h4>
              <p>Foreigners are only eligible for pregnancy termination/abortion
              in Singapore if one of the following criteria are met:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>They have been residing in Singapore for 4 months or more</li>
              <li>They are married to a Singapore citizen or have PR status</li>
              <li>If they have a work permit</li>
              </ul>
              <p>These restrictions do not apply to foreigners who require
              evacuation for miscarriage, but the age of legal consent (21 and
              above) will apply in this scenario.</p>
              <h5><strong>Before the Procedure</strong></h5>
              <p>The Abortion Law act requires that the woman undergoes brief
              counselling by a qualified abortion counsellor at any accredited

              <p>There is also a mandatory waiting period of <strong>48
              hours</strong> after the counselling before the procedure can be
              done.</p>
              <h5>Procedure for an Abortion</h5>
              <p>There are 2 main types of abortion procedure, depending on the
              gestation of the pregnancy</p>
              <ol>
              <li>For early pregnancies <strong>3 months (12 weeks) and
              below</strong>, the procedure is called <strong>vacuum
              aspiration</strong>. This usually involves being put to sleep for
              about 10 minutes, during which time a small tube is placed into the
              womb via the vagina. An attached vacuum will then remove all the
              pregnancy contents of the womb.</li>
              <li>For pregnancies <strong>3 to 6 months (13 to 24 weeks)</strong> , the procedure is known as Mid Trimester Pregnancy Termination
              (MTPT) which is a more complicated affair. Hospitalisation is
              usually required for a day or two, during which medicine is
              inserted into the vagina to induce natural expulsion of the
              pregnancy. After the foetus and placenta are aborted, the process
              of evacuation of the womb follows. This is basically the same
              procedure as used in <strong>vacuum aspiration</strong>; it ensures
              that the womb contents have been thoroughly evacuated.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>The second method takes a little longer and is messier, so it is
              far preferable that an early decision for abortion be made, before
              3 months if possible.</p>
              <h4><strong>Abortion in a pregnancy beyond 24 weeks</strong></h4>
              <p><strong>Abortion is not allowed if a pregnancy has progressed
              beyond 24 weeks.</strong> The legal limit of termination of
              pregnancy in Singapore is 6 months, or 24 weeks, beyond which
              abortion of any pregnancy is illegal. Most doctors would not
              initiate abortion beyond 23 weeks as the abortion has to be
              completed <strong>by</strong> 24 weeks. The only exception to this
              rule would be a severe or lethal foetal abnormality but even then,
              special approval would have to be sought from the authorities
              before the procedure can be done.</p>
              <h4><strong>Limit to how early in a pregnancy the abortion can be
              performed</strong></h4>
              <p>A woman choosing to have the procedure, should make an
              appointment as soon as possible in order to date and to locate the
              pregnancy so that the timing of the procedure can be planned. This
              is important because is not advisable to have the procedure too
              early in the pregnancy, as the risks of retained products and a
              "missed" abortion is higher.</p>
              <h4><strong>Expected downtime after the procedure</strong></h4>
              <p>Though the evacuation procedure itself takes only about 10 to 20
              minutes, it would probably be advisable to take the rest of the day
              off in view of the residual effects of the anaesthesia. Recovery
              should be complete by the next day.</p>
              <h4><strong>Risks with the procedure</strong></h4>
              <p>The risks of the procedure are rare, and consist of bleeding
              from the womb, infection and trauma to the cervix.</p>
              <p>Another extremely rare complication is uterine perforation,
              which is when the probe goes through the wall of the womb, and
              which requires repair via keyhole surgery.</p>
              <h4><strong>Long term effects (including emotional and
              psychological trauma)</strong></h4>
              <p>The risks of infertility from abortion carried out in a modern
              setting, particularly in a sterile environment, are extremely low.
              As for psychosocial effects, these are far less common than some
              sensationalist media imply. In fact the only satisfactory studies
              conducted in this regard show that there is an improvement in the
              mental well-being when compared to someone who has to go through
              the entire process of an unwanted pregnancy.</p>
              <p>Nonetheless many aspects of emotional and mental well being are
              subjective, and coloured by social, cultural and religious
              influences, making this a controversial issue. The impact of regret
              also varies from individual to individual. A qualified
              gynaecologist can provide in-depth discussion and unbiased
              counselling.</p>
              <h4><strong>Cost of the procedure</strong></h4>
              <p>The cost of the surgery itself in Singapore ranges from S$300 to
              S$2000. The large disparity is due to variations in the type of
              theatre employed, the depth of anaesthesia applied and in the
              package inclusions. For MTPT, the hospitalisation and medication
              charges must also be taken into account. An accredited abortion
              centre should be contacted for an in-depth discussion.</p>
              <p>Patients are also usually entitled to a medisave claim, although
              this may not be relevant to foreigners.</p>
              <h4><strong>Abortion through taking medication</strong></h4>
              <p>The practice of medical termination via taking of prostaglandins
              has the advantage of avoiding surgery. However it is a more
              prolonged process, and may involve pain and bleeding which may last
              for weeks. There is also a slightly higher failure rate, which may
              <strong>still</strong> require one to undergo a formal evacuation
              if the medicine fails.</p>
              <h4><strong>Traditional medicines </strong></h4>
              <p>The procedure <strong>should only</strong> be undertaken under
              the supervision of a <strong>qualified non-objecting
              gynaecologist</strong> trained in abortion procedures.
              "Traditional" or "alternative" methods of abortion using
              pineapples, herbs and/or instrumentation in unsanitary conditions
              should be avoided as complications such as infection, bleeding and
              sometimes infertility can occur.</p>
              <h5><strong><span style="color: #008000;">The Doctor's Rights, a
              Woman's Choice </span></strong></h5>
              <p><span style="color: #008000;">A doctor may refuse to perform the
              procedure on personal grounds although the woman retains her choice
              in the matter of abortion. It is the duty of every responsible
              medical practitioner to offer the patient a second opinion even if
              they object to the procedure on religious
              grounds. </span><strong><br></strong><span style="color: #008000;">An accredited abortion centre is a good source of
              unbiased objective information. The final decision is made by the
              pregnant woman.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008000;">The most important aspect of
              abortion is the decision to have one. There are a myriad of
              conflicting social, religious and financial issues that have to be
              sorted out carefully so time should be taken to make an informed
              decision as this is something that should not be taken
              lightly.</span></p>
