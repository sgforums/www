              <p class="statscontenttext"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">More Female Minors involved in Statutory Rape and Carnal Connection </span></span></strong></p>
              <p class="statscontenttext">Statutory rape<sup>3</sup> and carnal connection<sup>4</sup> cases involving female minors below 16 years of age who had consensual sex, rose from 216 to 310 cases in 2008. <strong><span style="color: #ff00ff;">Similar to previous years, known persons such as boyfriends and friends form the bulk of the culprits in these cases.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="statscontenttext">To address this growing trend, Police have embarked on several intervention initiatives by working closely with MOE, MCYS and NCPC on training sessions, workshops, programmes and crime awareness talks. The talks were intended to create greater awareness on the legal and social consequences of teenage sex so that teenagers could be dissuaded from such acts. For example in 2008, Police delivered two talks in collaboration with the Ministry of Education's Guidance Branch, namely: 'Teenage Sex and the Law' and ‘Legal Perspectives’ (Sex and the Law). Recognising that the increase in such sex-related offences involving young people may be linked to the increasing social trend of young people engaging in sex at an early age, SPF will continue to work with the relevant agencies to focus on intervention and educational programmes.</p>
              <p class="statscontenttext">All stakeholders, including the community, schools, and parents have a role to play as well. Care should be taken by families to <strong><span style="color: #ff00ff;"><span style="color: #ff00ff;">pay attention to the activities of their younger members, as most of the perpetuators in such cases are known to </span><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #ff00ff;">the victims (e.g. boyfriends and friends).</span> </span></span></strong></p>

              <p>According to the Children and Young Person Act (CYPA) 2001, a "child" is a person below the age of 14. A "young person" means a person who is 14 years of age or above but below the age of 16 years. A "juvenile" means a male or female person who is 7 years of age or above but below the age of 16 years. The Employment Act adopts the same definitions as the CYPA for a "child" and a "young person".</p>
              <p><strong>The Women’s Charter 1997 defines "a child" as a "child of the marriage who is below 21 years", and a "minor" as "a person who is below the age of 21 years and who is not married, or a widower or a widow". <span style="color: #ff0000;">Under the Women’s Charter, any person who has carnal connection with a girl below the age of 16 years, except by way of marriage, is guilty of an offence. The Penal Code provides that an offence of statutory rape is made out if (among other things) a man has sexual intercourse with a girl even with her consent if she is below 14 years of age. This means that a "child" below 14 years old cannot legally consent to sexual intercourse.</span></strong></p>

              <p>Statutory rape, which involves those below 14, jumped from 57 cases to 63 last year. Carnal connection, which involves girls below the age of 16 having sex, leapt from 159 to 247 cases.</p>

              <p>"Police have also held discussions with teachers from secondary
                                      schools and junior colleges about sex-related offences and laws.
                                      Discussions have also covered the consequences of underage sex and
                                      the use of technology in sexual crimes.</p>
              <p>Teachers have been asked to help disseminate these messages to

              <p>Or you can face your parents and her parents, sure you might go boys' home and have a pretty fine future after that.
