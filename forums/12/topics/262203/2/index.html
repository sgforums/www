There are many reasons why she never tell you, good or bad and there's no point trying to think of those reasons and you will only feel more insecure.<br><br>Remember they has a rs before. But just treat everything as per normal until you find out something is wrong. All's fair in love and war, go ahead and check on her.<br><br>doko</div>
