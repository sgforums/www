            <div class='col-md body'>A long time ago in China, a girl named Li-Li got married &amp; went to live with her husband and mother-in-law.<br><br>In a very short time, Li-Li found that she couldn't get along with her mother-in-law at all. Their personalities were very different, and Li-Li was angered by many of her mother-in-law's habits. In addition, she criticized Li-Li constantly.<br><br>Days passed, and weeks passed. Li-Li and her mother-in-law never stopped arguing and fighting. But what made the situation even worse was that, according to ancient Chinese tradition, Li-Li had to bow to her mother-in-law and obey her every wish. All the anger and unhappiness in he house was causing Li-Li's poor husband great distress.<br><br>Finally, Li-Li could not stand her mother-in-law's bad temper and dictatorship any longer, and she decided to do something about it! Li-Li went to see her father's good friend, Mr. Huang, who sold herbs. She told him the situation and asked if he would give her some poison so that she could solve the problem once and for all.<br><br>Mr. Huang thought for awhile, and finally said, "Li-Li, I will help you solve your problem, but you must listen to me and obey what I tell you."<br><br>Li-Li said, "Yes, Mr. Huang, I will do whatever you tell me to do."<br><br>Mr. Huang went into the back room, and returned in a few minutes with a package of herbs. He told Li-Li, "You can't use a quick-acting poison to get rid of your mother-in-law, because that would cause people to become suspicious. Therefore, I have given you a number of herbs that will slowly build up poison in her body.<br><br>Every other day prepare some delicious meal and put a little of these herbs in her serving. Now, in order to make sure that nobody suspect you when she dies, you must be very careful to act very friendly towards her.<br><br>"Don't argue with her, obey her every wish, and treat her like a queen."<br><br>Li-Li was so happy. She thanked Mr. Huang and hurried home to start her plot of murdering her mother-in-law.<br><br>Weeks went by, and months went by, and every other day, Li-Li served the specially treated food to her mother-in-law. She remembered what Mr Huang had said about avoiding suspicion, so she controlled her temper, obeyed her mother-in-law, and treated her like her own mother.<br><br>After six months had passed, the whole household had changed. Li-Li had practiced controlling her temper so much that she found that she almost never got mad or upset. She hadn't had an argument with her mother-in-law in six months because she now seemed much kinder and easier to get along with.<br><br>The mother-in-law's attitude toward Li-Li changed, and she began to love Li-Li like her own daughter. She kept telling friends and relatives that Li-Li was the best daughter-in-law one could ever find. Li-Li and her mother-in-law were now treating each other like a real mother and daughter. Li-Li's husband was very happy to see what was happening.<br><br>One day, Li-Li came to see Mr. Huang and asked for his help again. She said, "Dear Mr. Huang, please help me to keep the poison from killing my mother-in-law! She's changed into such a nice woman, and I love her like my own mother. I do not want her to die because of the poison I gave her."<br><br>Mr. Huang smiled and nodded his head. "Li-Li, there's nothing to worry about. I never gave you any poison. The herbs I gave you were vitamins to improve her health. The only poison was in your mind and your attitude toward her, but that has been all washed away by the love which you gave to her."<br><br>HAVE YOU REALIZED that how you treat others is exactly how they will treat you? There is a wise Chinese saying: "The person who loves others will also be loved in return."

            <div class='col-md body'>actually... if you didnt specifically TELL ur brother not to delete it... and you are using his laptop (which I think is quite nice of him, some siblings wouldnt share such an expensive piece of equipment), AND he deleted it accidentally not to sabo you or what...<br><br>then despite being angry etc, i think should forgive him. I don't see it as entirely his fault. and I think if you have told him nicely, he would have been guilt ridden instead of defensive.<br><br>Especially when it comes to family, if you know others weaknesses (for gossip, for talking behind back) etc, then more important not to hold it to heart ba. Or basically just TELL them how you feel about it nicely, then forget it. I think every family have times when we quarrel with each other... not possible to avoid. But keeping grudges really do make things worse.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>my bro don't even want to share text book with me. I now do not live with my parents who live in his house. So what do you think?<br><br>This world is tough. Some ask you to reflect if you had cause the issues, I think its a must do activity. The other is to consider building up yourself and character and in future, you creally cannot take it... then move out and be independent. However, its neceaasry to get rid of the bitterness in your feelings towards your family first. You don't have that long a life to enjoy...<br><br>understand bo?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have a second brother, in thailand. When he came back to usually 1 week to 10 days.... He insisted on sleeping in my room. I can sleep same room with him but he insisted he sleep in my room alone. I was not allow to enter my own room for that period &amp; not even to use my own PC. Even is he went out during the day. He lock up my room. I was force to sleep in the living room as the only other room my parents sleep.<br><br>The second time he came back... I refuse to let out my room. I lock it up instead. There is a big argument but it's my room, he is only temperory here. Stuipd him also cannot go live in hotel. Now he have to sleep with my mother.... &amp; my father sleep in the living room. Father don't want to sleep with me, because my room is pretty warm. Only my mother in the family talks to my second brother. No body else likes him in the family.<br><br>You know what... 3 years back. This second brother even took a Feng Shui Master to "see" my parents room. You know what was instructed by him to the feng shui master?.... Make everyone "bad luck" in the house hold. Put salt &amp; above Silver coin in bottle inside my parents bed room &amp; "Money" locations in the house.<br><br>This is true ... My father actually don't believe... until everything was so bad. We took another Feng Shui Master's advice to remove things "HE" done.<br><br>You think you have a bad brother? Look what brother I have? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>He even told my mother to force my father to work.... My father is sick &amp; 65 already. Can say he inhuman. What happend my father falls?<br><br>My sister hate him also... once in my sister house. Sister wearing shorts to do house work. Second brother went to "Touch" my sister backside while commenting she wearing shorts in front of him.... My Sister gave him 2 super tight slap on his face &amp; chase him out of her house.
