              <p>This is a classic line for guys to coerce sex from their gf. Together with "If you love me, you should let me do it."</p>
              <p>Don't fall for it.</p>
              <p>You should not love hopefully, looking into the future with dreamy eyes.</p>
              <p>But rather, act carefully, so that in future, you look back with love in your eyes.</p>
              <p>Look back the one month, do you love him? Do you admire him? Are you proud of him?</p>
              <p>Too soon to tell, right.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>and yes "He was the one who told me that couples should make love to grow closer tgt" is what usually guys would say in an attempt to get what they want. The moment a lady goes emotionally into it, he usually gets what he wants... but it doesn't mean that there's no sense in that sentence that he says though... i believe it breeds understanding, whether there is sex anot. Whether he respects your wish for abstinence or that he pushes for sex, it will just make you know him better.</div>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">This guy is a manipulator, using guilt and preying on your ignorance.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">If sex does make a couple grow closer, why didn't it work for his previous relationships?</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">He had sex with his ex gf(s) it didn't help make them closer, on the contrary , they are no longer together. </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">So that claim holds no water. It's just meant to manipulate you into giving him what he wants on your own free will. </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Frankly, he is quite good at teasing you. Frustrating you and making you feel guilty about not giving him what he wants. </p>

                              <p>Thanks for all the replies! <span style="border-color: initial;"><img alt="smile.gif" style="vertical-align: middle;" src="http://www.flowerpod.com.sg/forums/style_emoticons/default/smile.gif"></span> appreciated
              them greatly. <br>
              <br>
              I've been a no premarital sex person until I met him. But I really
              do want to spend my life with him while he sees that he's unworthy
              of me because of his past. I don't see any issues though because I
              love him and what's most impt is our future ahead. </p>
              <p>Anyway, he wanted it last night but I told him no. Cos I'm not
              too sure what he's thinking again. He said he was too tired the
              other night but hey! He was the one who initiated everything and
              stopped at the last point. Whether he playing mind games with me or
              whatever, I've decided not to give in easily
              again. <span style="border-color: initial;"><img alt="smile.gif" style="vertical-align: middle;" src="http://www.flowerpod.com.sg/forums/style_emoticons/default/smile.gif"></span></p>

              <p>Guess we will further comment after you have sex with him, that will be part 2 of your Love and Sex story.</p>
              <p>For some sound advices, I can only say that after he had sex with you, most probably, like my sista jojo said, game over.</p>
              <p>You see, man who keep asking for sex are actually nothing but sex maniac, in love, sex come naturally, you do not have to ask for it, so for him, women are like cars, drive this, tested that, throw away, then go drive another one. As a smart girl, you should know what I meant, if not, go back to sex education again ya</p>
