            <div class='col-md body'>cant talk and look hideous?<br><br>Then you have to accept the fact that your life is like that. What else can you do, blame your parents? UNLESS you dont mind settling down with a girl who's as ugly as you, which i dont think you would want to because if you really did, even steven lim would have plenty of them.<br><br>MEANWHILE, i would advice you to concentrate on your career and earn as much $$ as possible. Only by doing so would you get flooded by those gorgeous babes which is what you want. And mind you, this is not being shallow minded or whatsoever. Think about those soccer stars having those top models as their gf/spouse.<br><br>Girls afterall need some security and having your own car and apartment generate it.

Are you happy with yourself in the first place? If you are not happy with yourself, what makes you think you will be happy whether there is a girl with you or not? I mean, what do you want out of a girl from a r/s? There are many responsibilities from a r/s.<br><br>The first thing you have to do is really have the guts and take the first step. It comes from within. There are so many motivational courses out there to give you the external push but ultimately i think, it still comes from inside you.<br><br>What about making some female friends first without trying to hit on them? If you do, maybe try getting some not so gd-looking girls first to have a taste of a r/s? Try not to set too high a standard because ultimately, we still come back to reality.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, I think your communication skills are top notch.  It's a shame some narrow-minded people can't get past your speech impediment to try to get to know the man and mind behind it.<br><br>Don't let it get you down.  What I can suggest is, focus on the online community for now if you haven't already done so... put up a sparkling (but honest)  profile with pictures, network, pay much more attention to your grooming.  You'll charm people in no time.  Those who want to meet up with you eventually will already have decided your impediment is not an issue.  =)<br><br>However, most of my friends have moved out of Singapore citing poor quality of life due to their physical or vocal differences.. they wanted to focus their energies on their life goals, and not waste energy overcoming barriers that other people set up for them.  If you haven't ruled out migrating to an ang moh country as an option, it could boost your chances of meeting like-minded people and eventually maybe even finding a soul mate.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have speech problems too, but don't let that hinder you. Look at least you are still normal, compared to some less fortune ones born with deforminties or mental disability, you will still get the chance to get chicks. Just be more confident with yourself, even if you can't be confident just think that you are still normal like the average guy next to you. Don't ever think you are worst that others because you have some speech problems.</div>

Discriminating people because they are different, aren't this people narrow? No these people aren't your friends they are just making other people look bad to make themselves look good, most of these people are actually unconfident about themselves.<br><br>And do I sense that you are getting desperate? If you are stop feeling this way, you just need to wait don't be impatient, you will rather be in a relationship with someone you love and not someone you don't really like but be in a relationship for the sake of being in a relationship. Just wait and if someone good enough and doesn't really discriminate you for your speech problems go for it. Just dun give up so soon.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hey cheer up~<br><br>Look, if the ladies can't accept ur "flaw" then they aren't the ones for you. If the lady really love u, they will actually accept u, being yourself. I'm sure you have seen many couples where we would classify as "xian hua cha zhai nui fen shang". Why does these girls seems so attracted to them? Answer is simple: Love is blind and love is the strongest power on this planet. I'm pretty sure you'll find someone whom is able to accept the way you are.<br><br>p/s: look at it from another point of view, you may be born with a "flaw". I would actually consider that a "Test machine of love".  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>do u have short tongue or u just have a problem speaking well? i see yourself in me during my younger days, what you going thru is exactly what i experienced then. I am now 30, at the age u fear that you will still not experience love and my speaking deficiency still exist, yet to experience love myself, hold a girl hand, have my first kiss and sleep thru the whole nite together with the woman i loved.<br><br>Life still goes on for me, no have means no have, but being human with an animal nature, there is the so called mating season, and i am beginning to have the urge to settle down and start a family. But how to do it without a mating partner, there are short terms relieve (if u get what i mean), and long term, though tedious ones (mating agencies), have tired but without success so far, partly becos i still want to find my princess thru natural means. Like a bro here had said, worse come to worse, find a vietnamese bride, maybe after getting one, u may be relieve at the end of it that u never get the chance to know a local woman  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
