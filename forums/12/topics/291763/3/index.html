I thought by this age you would have achieved a certain level of appreciation for most things good in life, and that includes a girl who is not prone to over-expressiveness and drama.<br><br>You need to watch less taiwanese idol dramas. You need to stop peeping at your friend's incoming SMS messages. If your friend showed it to you, you need to get new friends who actually have character. If you even know what character means.<br><br>You need to leave your girlfriend. It will do her and her future boyfriend plenty of good. They will be happier than what you two are experiencing right now. You must let her see what I have written about her. Please do that.<br><br>Lastly, you really need to stay away from this forum.
