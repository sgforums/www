            <div class='col-md body'>StarPuppy,<br><br>Wat's impt is Not to rate ur own depression.  Wat's impt is tt u DO realise wat has caused a vicious cycle.  U're depressed, which leads to aggressive behaviour, which leads to pple Not liking u which will in turn, lead to a deeper depression.<br><br>Thus, the choice is now up to u.  U've taken a fall, &amp; now u noe the pebbles tt haf caused u to trip.  Do u now wanna remove the pebbles, or do u wanna juz leave them there, trip over them over &amp; over again &amp; juz simply sit there &amp; cry for help?<br><br>Pls understand tt I'm Not here to scold u, I'm here to help u, so pls try &amp; listen to the suggestions I'm gonna give u:<br><br>1.  U noe u're antisocial:  Make an effort to smilez more.  When pple r depressed, they tend to smilez less, &amp; tt makes them look aloof &amp; unapproachable.  I'm Not even gonna ask u to start becoming a chatterbox immediately.  Juz take baby steps.  Start by smiling &amp; returning greetings like "Gd Morning" or "Hi".<br><br>2.  U used to be v. quiet but now u're disruptive &amp; u think swearing is fun:  Swearing &amp; cursing in foul lang is Not the be all &amp; end all of conversation.  Imagine someone speaking to u, &amp; after ev. word, is a vulgarity.  "Hi StarPuppy, how're u @#$%&amp;*( doing?  My @#$*$% life is still the same, all the @##*(&amp;#% @ school &amp; the same @*@#(%*$% teachers."  Some may find it fun, but there're oso others tt find it offensive or difficult to understand <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  So keep swearing to when u're tokking to the guys (who can accept it) &amp; when u're really angry, if u muz swear @ all.<br><br>3.  Pple hate u:  I'm juz speculating here, but it may be due to wat they perc' as aloofness or aggressive nature/actions.  Again, I'll ask u to take baby steps.  Juz start by smiling &amp; returning greetings, &amp; mebbi swearing less.<br><br>4.  Get bullied, get into fights:  Pls speak to someone abt this, a teacher or ur parents.  But most of all, pls start wif urself.  Being abit more frenly may actually send u into a gd cycle once again.<br><br>5.  U're v. self-conscious &amp; u care abt wat pple sez:  Then why r u still swearing? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  Why r u still displaying aggressive behaviour?  Wldn't u rather pple remember u as a nice person when u graduate from sec sch/JC?  Or wld u rather pple remember u as a total @#$%$???<br><br>6.  U haf a v. hot temper &amp; can't tolerate even the smallest thgs:  Here, start wif baby steps.  When someone stares or glares @ u, instead of glaring back, juz look away.  I'm Not asking u to smilez @ them, they might think u're trying to be farnie.  Wat I'm asking u to do is to drop the aggressive behaviour.  This may actually lead to less bullying &amp; less fights.<br><br>Ultimately, StarPuppy, it's up to u.  Personally, I think u're intelligent, otherwise u wldn't even haf listed out ur problems so clearly in the 1st place &amp; asked us forumites to rate ur depression.  Thus, I believe u're intelligent enuff to make the wise &amp; courageous choice.<br><br>Gd luck!<br><br>RP<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by StarPuppy:</div><div class="quote_body">Rate for me how much depressed am I<br><br>.I am anti-social<br>.I used to be very quiet but now I feel disrputing and speaking in vulgar language is fun<br>.People hate me<br>.get bullyed,get into fight<br>.I am very self-cocnious(care what people say)<br>.Very hot-tmeper,cannot ren</div></blockquote></div>
