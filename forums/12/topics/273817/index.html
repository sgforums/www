            <div class='col-md body'>ok. lets make this thing interesting:<br><br>TYpe of gals (that i know.. sory cuz im not expert in knowing gals)<br><br>a) Home type gals - the one whom your mom love the most, shy<br>b) Office gals - intelligent gal, dun mess with them<br>c) Sporty gals - always wear in jeans n straight forward?<br>d) High-Maintanence gals -  U see them in the bar everynite<br><br>Yea different gals takes different method to approach.. Any expert can help on this?<br><br>Just wanna share something with you all, I've been reading David Deangleo's email thing. He used the method of "C o c k y and Funny" method.<br><br>It means, never be too gentleman to always say the gal's pretty but bust on her if she thks herself too pretty. And always make something fun for it. What he meant is that never be so predictable. Pretty gals get used to get compliments from guys.. they can already predict wat your goin to say. So do something different..<br><br>I personally did try this on some collegues (that i dont even knw their names) , well, they enjoy it and we are very good frens now even though im one of a hella person who teased them too much but not too hurting their feeling.. need to read their mood.. Never tried this with gals outside.</div>

Pretend like you don't care about her because that'll really get her interested because she'll be used to having all guys try to talk to her and such but if you just play it cool she'll come to you.</div>
