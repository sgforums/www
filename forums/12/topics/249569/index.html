Love transcends all forms and BGR is merely one dimension of how Love can manifest into. Ironically, the existence of a relationship might not be, though it should have been, a relationship based on unadulterated, altruistic model of love. The higher octave of Venus lies Neptune and that's where the divine power of love perched itself beyond all marked boundaries, incarcerated by previous self doubts, fear and all elements of negative forces and would transform itself into one hell of a formidable force. But the sad truth is that most couples hardly reach there - often slaughtered by realities of life like a doomed infantry amid heavy crossfire.<br><br>I wouldn't say finding a good partner is much more important than finding a good formula and equip yourself with the right wisdom to ensure a fulfilling relationship. Everybody have different successful love formulas, but what works for people may not absolutely mean it's the same for you. People always talk about jerks seeming 'winning' the game of love, but I can tell you Mr Nice Guy can also win being Mr Nice Guy - <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>it's only a matter of strategy.</strong></span> I can tell you the factors influencing our fate and destiny in love, in which you could form your own secret equation based on your personal life and make the best out of things.<br><br>As a general rule, the reason why otherÂ’s love secret to success may not always be 100% applicable:<br><br>i) We all have different but stated amount of cosmic lessons to overcome this lifetime.<br><br>ii) We have different and various degrees of karmic bonds with different people, which will trigger off our cosmic lessons in life and reverberate different results based on our freewill (Law of Cause and Effect).<br><br>The four elements, also known as Quadruplicity, are the basic unit of life and quoted in CloUdiSm (Elements Of Relationship), it is also the four factors that pervade every love relationship - Fire, Air, Earth and Water. In qualities it refers to Willingness, Communication, Trust and Understanding, but as factors of a relationship:<br><br>Fire rules Lifestyles.<br><br>Water rules Heartware.<br><br>Air rules Communication<br><br>Earth rules Material Possession.<br><br>Every love is subjected and affected by the theory of Quadruplicity. Theoretically speaking, a lack/concentration of either element would upset the overall balance and harmony of the relationship. But realistically speaking, most relationships have uneven mix of these thingy.<br><br>From the effect of Quadruplicity, it will generate two phenomenons - Complementary/Similar effect, but generally a mixture. Similar effect refers to two people with similar qualities/conditions in themselves that spark off reasons of attraction. It promotes harmony, but sameness.<br><br>E.g. We both have a liking for sports, sun and the sea.<br><br>Complementary effect refers to qualities/conditions in themselves that complements one another that spark off reasons of retention. It promotes conflicts, but higher awareness.<br><br>E.g. I am a blur queen and he's more streetwise. But at the same time, I am thrifty while he's a spender.<br><br>Going back to answering your question of 'How do we know who is right for us as a partner' - <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>seek for the one with enough similarity to forge attraction, yet not too much to limit mutual exploration and one with enough complementary qualities to compensate, yet not too much to create overwhelming conflicts</strong></span>.<br><br>You must go through your baptism of fire to learn about the 'correct equation' needed for you to have a decent, fulfilling relationship. There's only so much you can learn from others and nobody, other than yourself, can give you the best strategy in your game of love.<br><br>P.S: Our life calculates the introduction of karmic or benefic bonds based on previous incarnation and current planetary movements. Most of the time, we can't actually prevent the manifestation of our cosmic lessons, but what we can do is to outsmart our cosmic lesson by having the wisdom to learn FASTER than the time it takes for our cosmic lesson to teach.<br><br>In school, the most intelligent fellow will probably perform the best. In love, the accolade goes to the one with the highest wisdom.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

In reality, however, I suppose compatibility is a big issue that will go a long way towards determining whether you're going to have a future with someone. I'm sure, before you marry someone, you'd seriously give this a serious thought : "Do I see a future with him/her at 70?" I suppose you'll get the answer then as to who really constitutes a worthy candidate of being a partner for a lifetime...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Hence, the right partner is a game of trial and error. If you are lucky, your first will be your last. When you reached your final breath, ask yourself, "If I were to start life all over again and fall in love again, would I choose the same guy?" If your answer is yes, then he is the one.<br>In this world with billions of people, only one perfect one for us? We may never know unless we met every single person and know them inside out, and finally decides on the chosen one. You may have chosen your one now, but hey, for all you know, I could be a better partner than your current. Heck! That guy over there could be a better one too!<br>Everyday that passes by with your partner, your feelings towards him/her determines the chances of him/her being the One for you. Once you no longer feels the same way, the chances of him/her being the One for you? Possibly zilch.<br>Things get complicated because it is a two way thing. You may love him all your life but the guy may not. So I'm guessing the quote from bear is the best answer to your question.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
