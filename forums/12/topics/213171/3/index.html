I had no time for my gf, friends and family and all i do is sit in front of the comp looking at pixels. My temper also grew worse as I would grow very impatient when someone talks to me while i was in the mist of raiding in game and yell at them sometimes. I finally decided to quit and sell the account away for good cos it was really sucking my life away and changing me. Blizzard claimed that it was a casual game, believe me, its not............</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>How can somebody sleep for only 2 hours? Can meh? Maybe he sleep again at office? I mean, one day or two days is ok, but how can anyone sustain having 2 hours of sleep for long period?<br><br>Well.....anyway, if you need to distract him, take him outdoors for a walk, maybe weekends. A beach is really great, wide open spaces and soft breeze, can see sunset too on late afternoon. A good break from staring at computer, total opposite. Hope it will help abit.</div>
