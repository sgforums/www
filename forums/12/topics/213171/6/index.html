If it is juz computer AI enemy, its nothing fun.  Of coz, if anyone remembers the old time "MUD", I think WOW is somthing similar.

So, the real addiction is playing with the online "kaki".  I do not know how to stop it, bring him outside to walk, stroll would be useless.

But you married a little boy still. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Real men dun play computer games. We play it when we are young. But most of us outgrow it. Because we start to develop more important priorities in life. Like finding a good soulmate, working hard at our career or maybe simply because we are progressing to higher level things.<br><br>I know many gamers will not like what I say. But hey, it's the truth man. I'm refering to those who play for hours n hours continuously. If you just play once in a while to destress for 1-2 hrs during weekends, it's fine. But to play so much.. OMG, ur husband just does not have more important priorities. N he is still a little kid. You go to those gamer shops or those who play card games or kiddish games.. MY goodness, they all look similar or have a certain similar look. There are exceptions no doubt but hey.. i'm talking about the avg gamer addict<br><br>I always believe if you want something, you'll do everything to accomplish it. If your husband really cherishes what u have done, he'll treasure what u have done and even put up the picture with you together. Obviously his priorities lie in some stupid computer game.<br><br>You might also want to know that divorce rates in SG are on the rise with the highest proportion of divorces coming from the age grp of 20-30. So don't be surprised. A good bf not necessarily makes a good husband. vice versa for the ladies.<br><br>Good luck</div>
