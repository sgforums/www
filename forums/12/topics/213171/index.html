            <div class='col-md body'>Yep I too think it's the addiction. MMOs (WoW is a MMO) often takes up alot of time as it's a 'world' inside too, with in-game economics, friendship bonds etc.<br><br>For your case it's better to approach him when WoW is under maintainence. WoW maintainence is every Tues 6-7pm all the way to 12am (SG time). Make full use of this time when the game is down.<br><br>Another suggestion is to get to know what he is doing in game. In WoW the most time consuming activity is <strong>raids</strong>. Get to know your husband's raid timings and try to get him off the game during the off-raid timings. It's pretty bad for a person to be spending 12hrs a day on a game.<br><br>Use the game's qoute to aid you<br>"Bring your friends to Azeroth, and don't forget to go out of Azeroth with them as well" (Azeroth is the name of WoW's world)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>WoW is ridiculously addicting. I have been playing WoW since its launch, and spending most of my time on the game. Fortunately my fiancee is as addicted to it as I am. We spend most of our free time in-game.<br><br>Good thing for me is that I recently got kinda bored of the game with the endless raiding and stopped for a couple of weeks now.</div>
