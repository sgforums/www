Haha...<br><br>Now i am more independent as in sometimes I can go out alone for shopping and movies... My boyfriend doesn't go out on the streets and he only goes suppers with his buddies where I would follow coz I am very close to his buddies' gfs after all these years... &amp; it would be like a boy's night out cum girls night out in one...<br><br>And of coz like i say, he doesnt go out so obviously when I hang out with my friends, he doesn't follow, except when he comes to fetch me and join us for a while...<br><br>He's super anti social, but somehow, it gives a subtle sense of security too...<br><br></div>
