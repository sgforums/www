Honestly, I really want to join in the fun but i really sux in games... maybe I shall try elindra's suggestion: Try play a mage instead of a hunter...<br><br>As to what some of you asked, he has a job and now he sleeps two hours a day... He plays from 6pm to 6am, wakes up at 8am and report work at 930am... Amazing right? And i have to wake him up from 8 to 830am when i myself am hurrying for work... I feel like he's my son now...<br><br>He was a very nice husband, if not i wouldn't have married him... But somehow, this gaming thingy changed him entirely... I still harboured some hopes that he would stop when he completes the stages, but alas!!!! I just found out from you guys that this is a NEVER ENDING game!!!<br><br>Just who on earth invented this??? I know it must be fun... But at least put a final stage to it?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </div></blockquote>There is no final stage in this game. It's pretty amazing that your hubby can sleep for only 2hours....He is too deep in his addiction.<br><br>Have a good talk with him tonight. Work together to come up with solutions, tell him that there are more things to do in reallife.

            <div class='col-md body'>In truth, although you may speak of WoW as the fundamental issue giving you unhappiness, it seems there is a more systematic disfunctionality involved in your relationship. He doesn't exactly enjoy 'couple' activity right from the begining and before this WoW craze, he was more involved with the TV than with you. WoW is just another avenue to occupy his time, and he doesn't view you as any form of significance in his life.<br><br>This further becomes obvious when he is oblivious to your discomfort about his wee morning gaming and how it affects your comfort. Sorry to say, but he doesn't exhibit the slightest bit of concern over you.<br><br>Now, I'm not saying that you should leave your husband or any of that sort, but now you're stuck in a situation where your husband can't be bothered about how you feel.<br><br>Myself, and many of my in-game friends are badly addicted to WoW. We want to spend most of our free time in game. However, everyone of us makes allowances to our wives or GFs, in spending good time with them as well. It has to do with care and thoughtfulness.<br><br>Some of them are willing to play with their GFs in game. Either assist them leveling up their low level characters or starting a new alt to level with their better halves. This is what I see that you can engage in with your husband. You complain at dying easily, but with your husband's higher level character assisting you, it can be quite fun. The most important thing is that you will slowly enjoy the game and storyline as you play along.<br><br>Sad to say, your husband takes you forgranted. If having a heart-to-heart talk fails, then perhaps some form of counselling will help. If you don't address this issue now, I'm afraid it will be every prevalent in your relationship. Unless you don't mind playing 2nd fiddle to whatever your husband's current interest is, you better find some way to correct this systematic problem.</div>
