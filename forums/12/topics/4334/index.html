ALOT would depends on what's on her mind... If she just can't get the 'load' off her mind, arranging trips for her would ONLY create more additional time to DWELL on her problems...<br>BASIC 2 APPROACHES:<br>1. Swift her CONCENTRATION:<br>Let her concentrate on some other stuffs so that time could wash things off more efficiently... It's like taking a 'drug' on a medication period...<br>WOULD WORK: Only if she's those more optimestic type. OR something during that period of time really catch her attention and KEEP HER OCCUPIED.<br>NOTE: Might turn out to be a 'superficial' solution or temporary solution as IDEA might RESURFACE later.<br>KEY: Learn to 'let go'.<br><br>2. Make her FACE IT:<br>Make her confront the reality and problem. Usually a PAINFUL process but she should tends to grow STRONGER thereafter.<br>WOULD WORK: Only if she's MATURE enough to think or deal with the situation.<br>NOTE: DO NOT force her TOO DEEP into FACING the problem if it really don't deem fit. As EFFECTIVE this method can be, it can ALSO proves to be as LETHAL.<br>KEY: TAKE IT as a lesson in life. Life is a BIG BOOK, it usually don't ends at a CHAPTER unless you've come to the end of the book. (You don't PRESUME it's the end of the book.

I dunno if anyone tried this before and I think it's the best solution to the root of the prob... of coz being by her side is a must and consoling her.. on the other hand, maybe can try telling that guy's wife.. but it will haf to be done very tactfully and of coz has to be let the wife in total trust wif ur fren and u... maybe the other pple in the forum can gif suggestion to this??<br><br>I really think this sort of thing the guy shud not even have a place set his foot on... better let him sink...<br><br></div></blockquote>Don't mind if I have to put a word into this reply of yours. No offence to you but just directing this to your reply.<br>1st of all, I think Joanne is really just looking for a solution for her friend. No doubt what you've offered MAYBE a possible solution but it also MAY NOT be.<br>Misleading point here. We don't really know what is going on between Joanne's friend and her friend's married bf (or EX so to call.) Nobody should harshly make comments on either of them. The SIDE is CLEAR as the OBJECTIVE is also rather CLEAR. But don't PRESUME.<br>And all along we have been hearing 'one sided story' of this lady. No offence. Not that I mean to say that she's lying. But her friend might not be telling the complete truth? As far as I'm concerned, the whole story won't be as simple as ABC.<br>The solution you offered MIGHT WORK. I'm NOT saying it won't. But have you also considered? The wife might have know about this whole affair already? What if the married guy has children and a family? What would happen to the innocent children then? What if the wife don't know? What would happen to her?<br>I say there's really no need to set the fleets on fire unless it's really the last straw. I can see the possibility of MORE PROBLEMS arising from there. Just like I believe that there're ALOT of warm-hearted people like you in here trying to help out the others, harsh moves could only indirectly create more problems. Who would solve them then? A SOLUTION should be one which can resolve the situation with MINIMAL EXTERNAL EFFECTS done.<br>If the guy's family is DESTROYED (Even IF he really deserves it?), he would be at ZERO TERM. A guy at ZERO TERM is DANGEROUS. You won't know what he can do to you.<br>A piece of advice... Look at my signature...<br><br>------------------<br>ÃŸe COOL, NOT sÂ¢rrÂ¥....</div>

Don't try to do EVERYTHING for her as it's really NOT POSSIBLE. Got to understand that ALOT MORE depends on her rather than you people.... Don't let her be too reliance on you.... From my personal point of view, from this point on, just 'monitoring' her would be just sufficient.... Let her learn to stand up on her own or she'll just continue to sink.....<br><br>------------------<br>ÃŸe COOL, NOT sÂ¢rrÂ¥....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A friend of mine got involved with a married man as well. When his wife found out, he turned around and said she was the one who "seduced" him. He went back to his country, she stayed in UK. A year later he came back to look for her, had a one night stand together, and disappeared again. Your friend should face it - bastards don't change.<br><br>She's probably having a hard time accepting the fact that all she's given will never be reciprocated. She should cut her losses and move on. 18 is too young.</div>

Try to get her to see tt, 1 day she'll find someone who loves her truly... this married man has demonstrated tt he was using her, n she has foolishly allowed herself to be used.  It wasn't really love @ all.<br><br>If need be, get her to see a counsellor, or if there's someone of authority in her life, it'd be beneficial to get her to seek advice.  Is there someone she trusts alot?  Perhaps tt person cld tok some sense into her?<br><br>Rite now she's probably going thru the process of denial, followed by anger.  It'll take some time for her to heal.  In the meantime, as a fren, give her as much support n understanding as u can.  I hope she'll get better...<br><br>RP</div>
