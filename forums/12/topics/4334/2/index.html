She can RUN it the way she wants it to be OR she can just RUIN it the way its gonna be. Just like addicts who turn back to drugs again, congratulate her... She just did it.... Ask her to think back to the time when the guy left her ALL ALONE. Think then NOT now. Cause that may very well be the FUTURE she choose to live in. Ask her to sit down, clear her mind AND think of the above POSSIBILITY. Ask her to take care. She's on her OWN. Because she NEVER LEARNT it the HARD WAY, because it just didn't HIT HER HARD ENOUGH....."<br><br>------------------<br>I have no 'friends' nor 'family'.<br>I hold no past and see not future...<br>These are just samples of illusions....<br>I don't exist, but I shall live ETERNITY.....

Convince her a few times, if its not of use... leave her alone to learn the lesson first-hand.  Can't help it if they want life to be a roller coaster between heaven and hell, right?
