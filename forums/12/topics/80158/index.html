And, you will have to ask her that.<br>Hope this helps.<br><br>Cheers.</div>

Start learning about management of Long Distance Relationship now and after having getting an upperhand of things, try to convince her... I can understand your gf's mentality.. But such a form of mentality might be hard to survive in the years to come after you're both married... But picking up such a form of 'management' would certainly bring both of you much good in a sense..?</div>
