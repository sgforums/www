            <div class='col-md body'>Hello all,<br>personally i think there`s really no specific answer for this kinda question..<br>i feel that most of the time, people break up for various reasons,<br>1st being the lack of love or 2nd havin found new love<br><br>if one had broke off due to the lack of love, i believe that it`ll be reasonable to have a considerable patch up<br>but if one broke off due to one party finding new love, i think it`s much harder to patch back<br><br>taken from Westlife`s "If I let you go"<br>'..... but if i let you go, i will never know, what my love would be, holding you close to me.....'<br><br>Sometimes people do break up for reasons that are beyond their control.<br>eg. guys going NS.gal goin exams, or are temporary in different phases of life..<br>sometime these stress levels force ppl to give up on a r/s befoer it turns too strong. some people have this ` i must break up or i`ll love her too much and i`l be very sad when it happens` mentality.. that why guys ( lots of them ) break up with their gf when they enter army..<br><br>sometime i really feel that this could had been managed better, but somehow it seems like most ppl took the easy way out..<br><br>in cases when ppl had found new love ( esp when it`s too easily ), it`s hardly advisable for a patch back, cuz wat happend once will have a very high chance to happen again, not saying that it surely will, but the chances are high..<br><br>so my conclusion is that you have to think for youself,<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Like every human, every love is so alike, but yet so unique and different</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Agreed...come to think of it there really isn't a definite answer...love is damn ambiguous and it cuts like crazy and all we need is support...perhaps the answer is somewhere in you but in tough times most people aren't too keen on doing much soul searching while crying their hearts out. Humans are dangerous because they look sweet on the outside and you have NO idea what goes on in their minds. If not for love, we would never have a reason to trust anyone. Support is all that is required now.</div>
