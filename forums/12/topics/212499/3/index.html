            <div class='col-md body'>I know it's hard...... but then, all mothers, like all mere mortals, have their own set of imperfections and faults. We can't expect them to be perfect, can we? Better to let He who is without sin cast the first stone lor........<br><br>For me, I won't be here in the world without my parents. Since my dad's gone and I have only my mom left, I try to do as much as I can for her while she's still around coz the scriptures tell me to honour my parents mah. Despite her imperfections, I try not to judge her and try my best to treat her as best I can.<br>I think it's easier to love our moms if we don't judge them.........  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

EVER... known.<br>- her english is funny but the meaning is spot on.  "Aiyah, you know your mummy english is the world besssst." (beaming in self-mockery)<br>- her business &amp; PR skills are razor sharp<br>- she never forced us into any religion<br>- she still loves us even though we were the kids of an abusive, lowly-educated, foul-mouthed, blackmailing pimp who destroyed her entire business empire with his obscene million-dollar spending and countless mistresses ...  aka our dad<br>- she was a virgin beauty queen when she married our dad and has never known any other man since (whose heart wouldn't ache at that.. ARGH!!!)<br>- she has a business degree, won national debates in the past (mandarin), but after her business wound up she was forced to become a cleaner so she wouldn't meet all the high-flyers.<br><br><strong>Why I can't stand mom :</strong><br><br>- she didn't divorce our dad earlier (okok I don't hold it against her)<br>- her habits drive me nuts (reason 1 why i moved out)<br>- Our house is a storeroom for her old office equipment, documents, and xxxx dynasty chinese antiques (reason 2 why i moved out)<br>- she likes to keep secrets from us kids.  there are always new secrets.<br>- she's good at sidestepping questions.  her words are very vague.  I need to pound her with the same questions over and over before I get an answer.<br>- she likes to be overly optimistic sometimes, like she's still got her head up in the clouds.<br><br>All in all, I love my mom.  heh heh heh</div>
