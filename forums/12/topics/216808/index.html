Why would you be madly in love with another guy when you have a bf already? Why not think this way. Your bf is madly in love with another girl who understands him much better than you do. And he is torn apart between you and her. Because you treat him like a prince.<br><br>Differenciate between infactuation and real love. Search where your real love is &amp; stay faithful. If you ever want to sway because any guy comes and treat you better or you feel he understands you, then think about how you'd feel if your bf does that to you. What goes around comes around.<br><br>Please wake up and make up your mind. Guys shouldn't 2 time their gfs. Likewise, girls shouldn't 2 time their bfs.<br><br>All the best to you.</div>

Are you very confused and self-contradictory? If you don't cheat, it means you don't cheat.<br><br>Is it because your feelings for your bf is not as high as before? And this guy happens to come along and conveniently gives you excitement? Sort out your emotions first and dun tell the new guy anything. Just because the new guy gives excitement does not mean another new guy will not come along again... and the whole cycle repeats again.<br><br>doko</div>

You're actually in not such a bad situation, considering that you would really see how it can suck you up if you make a wrong move from here...<br><br>Not sure if you truly know this, but sometime I feel you do.. To an extent but maybe not fully of what I'm about to tell you....<br><br>At this point it's not surprising that you're mad or I would rather put it as 'interested' in this other guy... It has a bit to do with your age... Also... ROMANCE.<br><br>2 of the guys are probably bringing in to you 2 different forms of romance... At this cross-point you're confused... Which form to choose?<br><br>But as much as I do not wish to make any decision for you, I'll just let you see what would likely make more sense to you....<br><br>You're a loyal girl by nature. As much as you love stirs, romance and sparks in your life, you can only settle for someone who can love you.. Provides for you... And pampers you like your current bf... A few years down the road, if you've given this 'another exciting boy' a skip... You might be wondering what it could have been / should have been like... But if your bf still loves you as much as now (if not just enough), pls understand at least you've not lost him....<br><br>For now I'll tell you about 3 types of guys... The 1st type is one of stability and security (you're also looking at that now, don't ya? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> ) The 2nd type is the 'exciting and interesting guy' or might very well be a player of sort...? Just as you're making yuor decision between the 1st and 2nd.... There comes a 3rd type... Someone who is stable and is willing to pamper and love you... This type I shall termed as the 'undead' for now... Someone who fuels in the heart still and have not really 'died' within to push himself follow for love....<br><br>Now honestly I tell you... If the 1st's boring enough, you probably won't be the least interested... The 2nd is somehow my sort... We have 'capabilities' but somehow are much CHEAPER compared to the 3rd type... Imagine someone who flirts around and knows girls, to someone who is DEVOTED to ONE...? What lower chances it would be to be in the embrace of the latter...? Besides... 3rd types are often like a spark of fire.... They diminishes or is taken up from time to time... Making them comparingly rare to the 2nd type which is likely to be just a breeding culture...<br><br>You're also likely to be someone who climbs the ladder in your social status or at work.... A few years down the line, you probably won't be seeing the 'exciting boy' as before anymore... In fact, it's quite likely that there'll be an existing gap between both of you...<br><br>So a not best of both worlds situation (just like you're going to make a decision to choose), which would you choose? Taking off a slice of that pie to settle for a big portion (one likely to be more matching type in the future) or many slices of pies that might fill your life with different taste and varieties...?<br><br>Like I've said... Ultimately.... You might still be losing a portion of it... Just what you choose to be eating...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>
