Sometimes white lies are good.. but as it goes deeper its harder to get out of it.. and you jus have to stick your life with this lie.. Firstly you have to do.. is either you confessed to them that you never had a gf.. Yes.. ego and pride will go down.. but at least your conscience is clear.. you dun have to hide anything.. or worry anything any more..<br><br>Secondly.. jus carry on with your lie.. and said that you already broke up with your girl long time ago.. Like what others suggested! Guess youi jus have to live with it..<br><br>Thirdly.. you wan to be someone you love and be with her.. You see people so loving.. you feel so pissed jus be cos you got none!! Please make sure that when you say you like this girl.. make sure is really a liking.. and not someone who you find her a potential and feels that she can satisfied your loneliness... Someday somewhere you'll find your girl.. love this kind of thing cannot rush one.. When the time is ripe.. the girl will appear..<br><br>Whichever choice you chose.. you still have to move on.. Getting a gf.. is jus to show your friends.. that you have one too.. and you can also by telling them you can be so loving as the other couples too.. Your ego.. and self-esteem.. is so high up there.. is good.. cos of you believe in yourself.. and confident! but then when you fall hard.. its more diificult for you to pick up yourself again..<br><br>You can turn back.. but got to see how you wan to move..<br><br>Cheers..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

I feel so useless 2 hav bcome a real dumb ass lier. My lies were markin my relationship wif imaginary gf as great couples. Not easy 4 me 2 end my lie wif another lie like i broke up or somethin, cause i cont my lie life 4 years... but its possible... (sorry God, punish me wen its apporiate)<br><br>Now, i feel like i juz screwed myself frm any chance of gettin a any gf.<br><br>(my background: im known as kinda high iq cause i do relax alot but very good at my studies. easily i got a lots of frens frm da famous side of campus. i didn't lie anythin else at all, i neva wanted 2 lie at all.... its juz dat i wanted 2 b wif some1 i really loved a bit longer... gal A, B n all their frens r kinda close 2 me... im known as low profile, quiet but as very good fren n very independent n stable guy)<br><br>i dunno wut help 2 ask frm u guys.... juz giv me any idea... or scold me... or wateva.. i feel so lonely n pissed 2 c every1 else so lovey dovey aroun me... i screwed myself...</div></blockquote>Yeah i can relate. This one time moma and i was drivin in da car, and she asked me for directions.. i lied to her so i could take a route that went past mcdonalds.. but after eating mac i was so remorseful about my weight i wanted to turn back too.</div>
