              <p>Its the lack of training which leads to all the problems. No one is born knowing anything. Everything has to be learnt. Just like we need to learn the alphabet.</p>
              <p>If men were absolutely happy and suffer no confusion being themselves, i would not urge them to be anything else. But being themselves doesnt work, they end up in pain, getting dumped, loveless marriage, divorces.</p>
              <p>Any man who is serious about dating/marriage needs a plan. Before you go into battle, you need a plan. You don't just go in blindly and hope that the enemy is weak and let you walk all over them. Before you start a business, you need to do market research. You don't just open a shop and hope for the best.</p>
              <p>When we had to learn alphabet in kindergarten, i'm sure it was very uncomfortable too. Now that we all know it so well, it becomes second nature. Discipline to delight. Anything that's worth it will be uncomfortable, in the beginning.</p>
              <p>Sometimes break up is not a bad thing. if a man or woman is not relationship material, its better not to prolong the suffering.</p>
              <p> If you keep doing something in the same way and hope for different results, its called insanity.</p>

              <p>the key to maintain a relationship is to have or learn the ability to give and take. humans have mood indicators but they are not as obvious as traffic lights. people can read body language which a big indicator. adults are much better at communicating their needs and wants through their words and actions.</p>
              <p>precisely people do not  necessarily speak what they truly want, men are strongly advised to look at women actions instead. actions speak louder than words. but also do realise that people do not necessarily know what they want or need.</p>
              <p>in fact, there is such a manual on women, which i have benefitted greatly from and is the primary basic source of my knowledge of women. if any guy wants to know more about this manual, do not hesitate to contact me.</p>

              <p>Men are always going too heavy too fast too soon. That’s the biggest complaint from women today. In so doing, men come across as desperate and too available, which is a major turn off to women.<br><br>So at what pace should men go and who dictates that pace? Ever since Adam and Eve, men have always been the aggressor. Men approach women. Women almost never have to or never want to approach men. Why would they want to put themselves at the risk of rejection when men are already doing it anyway? If she ever wants a guy, she will choose to flirt instead and get you to do the dirty work of approaching. That’s how it is in most societies, whether we like it or not, that is the reality. So by default, women have been given the choice of accepting versus rejecting and also the choice of setting the pace in any pursuit.<br><br>Since only the woman herself will know when she is comfortable to shift gears, we have to go very slowly with them. Patience is the key. When you are able to be patient with them, they will find you different from the rest of the other guys who are always going too heavy too fast too soon. Patience will set you apart from the competition. Let the rest of the guys rush in, turn the woman off and get dumped. We will not attempt to shift gears unless given cues to do so. Women will seldom tell men directly to go faster but they definitely show signs or behave in certain manner to hint to us she is ready to take things to the next level. When we receive those hints, she is indirectly approaching us to take things to the next level. The choice is now ours to make and the tables are now turned.

              <p>Men are always going too heavy too fast too soon. That’s the biggest complaint from women today. In so doing, men come across as desperate and too available, which is a major turn off to women.<br><br>So at what pace should men go and who dictates that pace? Ever since Adam and Eve, men have always been the aggressor. Men approach women. Women almost never have to or never want to approach men. Why would they want to put themselves at the risk of rejection when men are already doing it anyway? If she ever wants a guy, she will choose to flirt instead and get you to do the dirty work of approaching. That’s how it is in most societies, whether we like it or not, that is the reality. So by default, women have been given the choice of accepting versus rejecting and also the choice of setting the pace in any pursuit.<br><br>Since only the woman herself will know when she is comfortable to shift gears, we have to go very slowly with them. Patience is the key. When you are able to be patient with them, they will find you different from the rest of the other guys who are always going too heavy too fast too soon. Patience will set you apart from the competition. Let the rest of the guys rush in, turn the woman off and get dumped. We will not attempt to shift gears unless given cues to do so. Women will seldom tell men directly to go faster but they definitely show signs or behave in certain manner to hint to us she is ready to take things to the next level. When we receive those hints, she is indirectly approaching us to take things to the next level. The choice is now ours to make and the tables are now turned.

              <p>If there is standard set of training, no men would be confused
              and suffering. and all marriages would be happily ever after. but
              there are definitely principles that have to followed. those
              principles can be taught through various methods or specific
              training. sharing experiences and telling stories of scenarios is
              one way of training.</p>
              <p>guys prefer info that is detailed and precise. when he fixes a
              model airplane the instruction manual says exactly which piece goes
              where. it doesn't say, well, there are five parts that make up the
              wing, here they are, go figure it out yourself.</p>
              <p>if the man doesn't even have any idea what he is doing is right
              or wrong, how can he gain experience? everytime he does something
              wrong and gets dumped, he just thinks that women are crazy and
              illogical, and he goes on to the next girl doing the exact same
              thing he done with the previous girl and gets dumped again. the
              thought that maybe he is doing something wrong never cross his mind
              at all. and mistakes keep getting repeated from one girl to the
              other. until he finally marries one girl, and get divorced or stay
              in a loveless marriage because he has 3 kids to raise and 30 year
              mortage loan to service and neither he or the wife can afford a
              divorce at that stage in their life.</p>

              <p>What makes you different from a dog or a robot if you are ''trained''. Yes there are principles i dont deny, you give a example to illustralate the principle, not exactly follow the example like a robot. Theres no detailed example guidebook.</p>
              <p>What is right and wrong now in this case, you might be surprise some girls actually like what other girls hate. Not everything is black and white in a relationship. It is sad if that guy doesnt consider all possibilities instead just blaming women for it.</p>

              <p>I dont think you understood my point. I said  Yes there are principles i dont deny, you give a
                                      example to illustralate the principle, not exactly follow the
                                      example like a robot. Theres no detailed example guidebook. What makes you different from a robot then ? Is that truely youself ?</p>
              <p>I wont call those you have listed as ''training'', just your own set of advices and experiences. Semantics argument.</p>

              <p>training techniques are debatable.</p>
              <p>more importantly, you are trying to say that by learning something new, the person will not be himself? i'm sure in our lives, we have learnt alot, everytime we learn something new, we change ourselves for better or worse. our view of the world is also changed.</p>
              <p>you won't be old self anymore. you will be a different person. the self is ever changing unless you never allow yourself to learn anything new or have new experiences in life.</p>

              <p>Training is not the word. The word should be learning.</p>
              <p>People should be learning etiquette. i.e. manners.</p>
              <p>And as one progresses on through life, to learn the etiquette for different events, like outings, parties, and dating etc.</p>
              <p>If one is brought up right as a child, there should be no problem later in life. Problem is the parents are not brought up right and therefore cannot instill the correct values to their offsprings.</p>
              <p>Training is too harsh, but necessary for pageants participants like Miss Universe or Man Hunt. Where a training regime is warranted.</p>
