              <p>Be yourself, because you won't know when you will meet the person who truly likes you for who you are.</p>
              <p>If you are able to make friends with people because they really likes you for who you truly are, then it's just a matter of time before you meet someone from the opposite sex who would also be attracted to you for who you truly are.</p>
              <p>Even the worst villians in this world also can find their partners in life and experience love, why is it not possible for you to find your own partners regardless of what weird, kinky, abnormal, psychological disorder you are having?</p>
              <p>It's the end for you if you gave up and surrender to your own fate and stop searching for your other half. But if you are faithful and hopeful with who you are, it's just a matter of time before you meet up with your other half.</p>

              <p>training techniques are debatable.</p>
              <p>more importantly, you are trying to say that by learning
              something new, the person will not be himself? i'm sure in our
              lives, we have learnt alot, everytime we learn something new, we
              change ourselves for better or worse. our view of the world is also
              changed.</p>
              <p>you won't be old self anymore. you will be a different person.
              the self is ever changing unless you never allow yourself to learn

              <p><br>Why don't you go and consult your harem of advisors instead?</p>
              <p>The fact that for two people to come together, they must first like each other enough to compromise themselves to be on the same frequency with one another.</p>
              <p>You just need to find someone who shares similar values as you, because if you need to change your own values to accomodate and convince that someone that you like her because you are on the same frequency as her, then you are not being true to yourself and to her.</p>
              <p>So you need to seek and find someone with the same mentality and values and attitude towards life as yourself.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hitler may be projected as a villian, but if even he can find love in his lifetime, it also means that there's some goodness about him that his loved ones appreciates him for who he is.</p>
              <p>You know Hitler for what he did, but do you know him for what he didn't do? He could've done alot worse knowing the evil is boundless and depthless in human hearts.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Don't restrict yourself on how you are going to live your life. People will always misjudge/persecute/critcise/condemn/discourage/scare/threaten/scold you no matter how hard you try to be good and better.</p>
              <p>The key is to believe in yourself and do not believe in others. The more you believed in others, the worse life you are going to end up living in.</p>
              <p>People can do you WRONG, but as long as YOU DO NOT DO THEM WRONG, you will be able to rise up against them and climb over them to reach your destination in life.</p>
