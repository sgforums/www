              <p>Men are always going too heavy too fast too soon. That’s the biggest 
              complaint from women today. In so doing, men come across as desperate 
              and too available, which is a major turn off to women. <br> <br> So at what pace should men go and who dictates that pace? Ever since 
              Adam and Eve, men have always been the aggressor. Men approach women. 
              Women almost never have to or never want to approach men. Why would they
               want to put themselves at the risk of rejection when men are already 
              doing it anyway? If she ever wants a guy, she will choose to flirt 
              instead and get you to do the dirty work of approaching. That’s how it 
              is in most societies, whether we like it or not, that is the reality. So
               by default, women have been given the choice of accepting versus 
              rejecting and also the choice of setting the pace in any pursuit.<br> <br> Since only the woman herself will know when she is comfortable to shift 
              gears, we have to go very slowly with them. Patience is the key. When 
              you are able to be patient with them, they will find you different from 
              the rest of the other guys who are always going too heavy too fast too 
              soon. Patience will set you apart from the competition. Let the rest of 
              the guys rush in, turn the woman off and get dumped. We will not attempt
               to shift gears unless given cues to do so. Women will seldom tell men 
              directly to go faster but they definitely show signs or behave in 
              certain manner to hint to us she is ready to take things to the next 
              level. When we receive those hints, she is indirectly approaching us to 
              take things to the next level. The choice is now ours to make and the 
              tables are now turned. If you have yet to realize by now, love is a 
              power play. In order for the relationship to last, men have to come out 
              stronger in the power struggle because women are subconsciously looking 
              for leaders in their men.<br> <br> So specifically, how should we go about this whole idea of patience and 
              playing it cool in the beginning stages of dating? First and foremost, 
              always wait five to nine days to call after you have got her number and 
              between dates. Most guys predictably call within two days. But you are a
               cut above the rest. Secondly, you will only give her a call between 
              Sunday to Thursday and ask her out for a date between Sunday to 
              Thursday. In other words, never call her on a Friday or Saturday and 
              never ask her for a date on Friday or Saturday. What’s the big deal with
               Fridays and Saturdays? These two days are only reserved for that 
              special someone. She has yet to attain that status yet. You are always 
              busy on Fridays and Saturdays, regardless of whether you are busy. Get 
              the drift? <br> <br> By the 4th to 7th date, she will ask you why you don’t ask her out for 
              Fridays or Saturdays, this is supposed to happen if her interest in you 
              has been increasing since the first date. Her interest should be on the 
              rise if you have not done anything to turn her off since date one. When 
              she asks that question, that is her first indirect approach. Ask her why
               going out on Friday or Saturday is important. Act dumb and make her 
              reveal her feelings for you. If she refuses to, just continue taking her
               out on the other days. Only take her out on a Friday or Saturday when 
              she asks you to.<br> <br> By the 8th to 12th date, she will ask you where the relationship is 
              going. In other words, she is asking you whether you want her to be your
               girlfriend and make the relationship exclusive. When she asks that 
              question, ask her “Are you asking me to be your boyfriend?”</p>

              <p>I don't know where you get this idea about you going too fast or too slow. Not all women are the same. Some like it hot, some like it cold. Some don't want it too fast but there are some who want it faster ! Normally those women who get turn off by men who go too fast are those who are rebounding. You cannot generalise. Fact is you must be able to read what the girl wants, if you are good at it then you are good at going after her. Speed of the chase has nothing to do with it.</p>

              <p>It applies majority of the time. If you look like Brad Pitt or Geroge Clooney or have as much money as Donald Trump, they wish you just propose marriage to them on the 1st date.</p>
              <p>And most guys are not good at reading what the girl wants. If guys know how to read girls, they would not end up in loveless marriages or divorce or getting dumped.</p>
              <p>And you can never go wrong if you are going at their pace. And you are making them come after you, instead of you going after them. Its about POWER actually, speed is just a way to get it, i should say lack of speed.</p>

              <p>Let me give you a few pointers.....</p>
              <p>A boy girl relationship is not baking a cake.</p>
              <p>There is no hard and fast rule to when you should call her or not.</p>
              <p>It's all about feelings. If she is not into you.. learn to leave her alone.</p>
              <p>If she is into you..she'll be waiting by the phone. You make her wait... you'll get to pay for it later.</p>
              <p>Stop dating girls who are out of your league.</p>
              <p>Stop playing mind games.</p>
              <p>Don't be afraid to face rejections.</p>
              <p>Love waits for no one.</p>
              <p>Ok ? Good.</p>

              <p>A boy girl relationship is not baking a cake.</p>
              <p>There is no hard and fast rule to when you should call her or
              not.</p>
              <p>It's all about feelings. If she is not into you.. learn to leave
              her alone.</p>
              <p>If she is into you..she'll be waiting by the phone. You make her
              wait... you'll get to pay for it later.</p>
              <p>Stop dating girls who are out of your league.</p>
              <p>Stop playing mind games.</p>
              <p>Don't be afraid to face rejections.</p>
              <p>Love waits for no one.</p>
              <p>Ok ? Good.</p>

              <p>Thank you for your pointers.</p>
              <p>There is no hard and fast rule but there are principles that men need to abide by if they want to win with women.</p>
              <p>Of course it's all about feelings. But men only look at their own feelings and mostly fail to read the woman's feelings toward him.</p>
              <p>If she's into the man, she will love him more if he makes her wait a bit. If she trys to make him pay for it later, he will drop her.</p>
              <p>men should only date girls (whatever league) if they have a plan, otherwise they'll just end up in pain eventually</p>
              <p>men don't know how to play games. women are playing all the games.</p>
              <p>rejections are part and parcel of dating, don't take it personally. if you don't swing, you can never hit.</p>
              <p>if she loves him, she will wait.</p>

              <p>i never said woman is a trophy for man to win. winning in terms of being successful in romantic relationships. from a man's point of view, the other party is the woman which he has to win.</p>
              <p>majority of men do not know how to read. of course there are some that know but simply refuse to. its not my wish to please female forummers here with answers they want to hear. i'm not here to seek anyone's approval. you are all entitled to your own opinions. please feel free to shoot my advice down, at the end of the day, its your words against mine. the truth is out there for everyone to find out.</p>
              <p>where does that vengeance come from?</p>
              <p>a guy will only end up in pain if he does not know how to handle women. whatever league.</p>
              <p>guys are lousy at playing games which is why they always come out on the losing end with women. its time to level the playing field.</p>
              <p>there is love aplenty but those love aplenty will not be lasting. only those with knowledge of how to handle women can make that love lasting. if he loves her, he should make her wait. if she does not respond well to waiting, she should not be considered for relationship or marriage.</p>
