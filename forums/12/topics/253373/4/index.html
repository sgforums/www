If you can't get into the mood for sex because you find it too sudden, have a good heart-to-heart talk with him.

If he loves u, this weekend, tell him your're pregnant, see his reaction, trust me, he's not going to answer your call.<br><br>If a guy really loves a woman, he should be repsecting you and not stick his pEnis in your mouth early in morning. What liao ah.  He's just using you as a sex slave. When he's tired of you or he had a new traget, you're histroy.Ask him face to face if he's going to marry u? I think your bf is the first to pop your cherry, no wonder you will still stick to him like your bf stick his penis in your mouth.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>from what i gather, TS loves the sex bit, besides it also affirms their "loving relationship" - I reckon she enjoys sex with him because she loves him; and shes having some doubts as other people around her tells her otherwise, that her bf is using her.  She refuses to believe it, yet she comes here for opinion; either to seek confirmation or have people reassure her that her bf is alright behavior, that its normal to behave like that.<br><br>But from her account I seriously questioned her bf's character.  He's very much like using her, he certainly does not behave like he respected the girl, much as TS might have liked it.  (After all she likes it because there's love involved, its fufilling to have sex with the one you love; but for him he probably just dig the sex )<br><br>If shes the proactive party in the sex then I can still assume her bf is only doing this to pleasure her as well as himself, but she sounded more like a passive role in this relationship, shes only convincing herself this is love and she loves it.  If she doesnt feel at some point doubts, she wouldnt post in AA.<br><br>To TS:<br>So thats the situation - your bf sounds more like using you as a whore; recognised that and are you still ok with it?  If your idea of great relationship involved his spontaneouty in his actions towards you then by all means carry on; but yes you ARE used.<br><br>So how now?  You got my opinion. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
