Nobody can tell u HOW to get over it. its all up to u buddy.. if u want to, *snap* its as easy as that...but if u don't wanna and u insist on clinging on to it, you'll never be able to let go of it..<br><br>i'm not saying that its wrong to hold on to it.. i'm just presenting options that u have to think for yourself carefully before adopting. u're prob gonna go thru the *one moment all happy and fine, not bothered or hurt* phase only for it to be shattered by a song that reminds u of her and soon you're in the *just kill meeeee pleeeeaaaasssee* mood..<br><br>u've got to reassess yourself and just decide what's best for u. i mean for all u know, just hanging on to those feelings but moving on with life could one day bring the both of u back. but the bottom line is.. *slap* snap out of the grieving mood... que sara sara, whatever will be will be.. u can't possibly control everything but u can definitely control how long u grieve. when i say grieve i mean the period where u just cry yourself to sleep everynight and just feel nonchalant about everything.. cut that out.. its enough carry on with life... u can still feel sad.. hey its normal... but if u continue carrying with this positive attitude.. u'll be bouncing back to normal soon enough.. take care dude and we'll always be here for u...right my fellow forumites??</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You will cry.<br>You will be angry.<br>You will be in grief.<br>You will even be tempted to contact her again.<br><br>For me, I felt all the above, and more. For 6 months, I was living in emptiness, thinking mostly of her. Things like, how many things we could have done, how we could still do many things, and how we could get back together, etc. But things were just not meant to be.<br><br>A few days ago, I lost control, and sent an sms her, telling her how much I missed her. She never replied, and the next day morning I saw her, she was just, well, herself. That reply never came. Of course, I never expected any reply from her. But deep down, I still hoped that she still felt something for me. However, circumstances showed me the answer.<br><br>That moment onwards, the final tie I felt that held me to her was finally severed. Initially, I felt empty, numb. I felt that I had finally hit rock bottom. And since there was no more way to go down, I went back up. By the end of the day, I felt as though something had been taken away from me. I felt relieved. I had never felt so relaxed for more than half a year. It was like all the grief and sorrow had been removed finally. I felt new. Refreshed. I could finally start anew.<br><br>These few days, there has been no relapse. So I believe the negative feelings are gone for good. And I will no longer want to get back together with her again.<br><br>So my point being, you will ask. My point is this. You need to do something/s that will make you severe the ties holding you to her. She most probably doesn't give a damn how you feel. Most probably she has no ties holding her to you. You can cry, you can be sad. But to stop the negative feelings from controlling your life, seek some ways to cut them off.<br><br>For me, that final cut was the last sms, and her no reply. For you, I dunno. You will know. And after you have done it, you will be released, just like me, and be able to start afresh.<br><br>I wish you well, and hope that you recover soon.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
