            <div class='col-md body'>Last week, I made a friend pissed due to not respecting his requests, then I insisted on talking to him and saying sorry.<br><br>But he hung up on me and refused to pick my calls. Initially I din know the severity of the anger and kept calling him. Later on, I realised that not only he was pissed with the issue, he was even more pissed that I refuse to allow him to cool off and kept calling.<br><br>As a result, he scolded me using SMS and says he wants to cool off. No talk, no sms, no chat &amp; no call.<br><br>Although it felt funny, I dropped him 1 or 2 liners over the weekend and refrained from calling the whole week.<br><br>Just 2 days ago, I needed a lift home due to something urgent and he agreed to send me.<br><br>Do you think he is still angry with me and stop being my friend liao?<br><br>He is important to me as a friend coz he has been a great listening ear to my problems. Suddenly cutting off my confidante and someone so angry with me makes me really sad.<br><br>He claims to be a petty person and sensitive.<br><br>Will he come back to normal? Feel sad leh!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>if he's still angry with u, he won't agree to sending you home.<br><br>u are the one being sensitive instead. a person can be angry, but only for a short period of time. if he's angry for a long period, it generates hate and pettiness. do u think he's that sort of person? maybe u've not known him well enuff lor..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well, as a colleague and I was in urgent hurry to get home to attend to my son, I guess anyone would've done that.<br><br>Anyway, I made him angry coz I insisted on doing something that he hated. (take pic of him) Then I didn't know that it was so wrong and didn't sense that he was angry. Next day, I called him, but he refused to answer my calls. Thinking that he was crazy, I kept calling, but he refused to answer my calls. In the end, he said he wanted to be left alone and not talk.  He said I only wanted to push my way and don't want to respect his wishes. He self proclaim that he is petty and sensitive, which I think not. He had his right to be angry and I apologised.<br><br>We used to chat everyday or at least he will reply my sms. All that has stopped since that day of quarel.<br><br>I am wondering when he will recover lor. Don't really want to lose a friend just like that. Not worth right?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmm a picture alone made him so upset? perhaps you did not respect him enough by taking that photo, but it sounds like he is also making a mountain out of a mole-hill.<br><br>anyway as abovementioned, you may just consider giving your friend some time to cool off. it may not help much if you keep trying to get your point through. it may backfire, with him getting more annoyed. you know like sometimes when you feel upset you would also want to be given some time and space to think tings over. i'm sure once he gets over it, he would show some signs of it, eg resuming chit-chats with you, etc.<br><br>don't worry unneccesarily or let it bother you too much.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
