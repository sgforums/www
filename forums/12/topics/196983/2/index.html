            <div class='col-md body'>Got to agree with what someone has posted earlier in this thread - (I presume you aren't out of your teens yet, given your take on things) although your outgoing friends may seem to be having the better deal with girls now, their perceived strengths(ie.them being extroverted, etc) alone will not help sustain any viable relationship. Basically, the sort of guys girls look for(from my experience, at least) are different dependent on whether they're looking for friends, buddies, boyfriends or husbands...<br><br>There's certainly no point for you to change yourself to tune into their frequency - you'd be better off having people accept you for who you're IMO.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

I guess it's better to be yourself but sometimes it's good to tease girls too, learning to tease girls is easy, you just need to see something wierd or wrong with them then capitialise on that and tease them on that.

The way you phrased it, it almost made me think you view girls as s-l-u-t-s - a possible result of either being dumped, or watching too much porn.<br><br>Learn to speak out more. Stop worrying about how people think about you, and start worrying about how people WON'T think about you if you don't start speaking out. Once you've learnt to speak out more, the other will follow.<br><br>By speaking out, you would increase your self-confidence. A high self-confidence (Note: self-confidence. Not arrogant. Set the line.) would allow you to better engage in conversation with others, girls if you like.<br><br>Then again, if all fails, find a shell, and be a hermit crab.
