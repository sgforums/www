              <p>do you sometimes drown yourself in work and activity, just to keep busy so that you don't have time to sit down to listen to your thoughts and get in touch with your feelings ?  it's a form of running away from hurts, losses and disappointments either with yourself or of others.</p>
              <p>i often feel this way these days.  just want to run run run till i am dead tired so that i fall asleep immediately in bed out of exhaustion.  it's also a way to avoid contact with people whom i rather not be around with.  there was a time when i was pretty much in touch with the inner voice...  then i felt peaceful.  not anymore.  don't even know why i am doing what i am doing,  don't even bother to ask "why" anymore.  i just do.  wherever it leads me, there i shall go.  there seems no point to control, because things almost always turn out differently from planned.  relinquishing control seems cowardly ? on one hand.  on the other hand it is liberating as one no longer needs to suffer incessant torture through self-blaming.</p>
              <p>busy-ness is an escapade to me.  some say it's a form of healing.  will ignoring life's misses and discouragements allow the wound to heal or let it die wrapped in layers and layers of our consciousness ?  or is it merely sweeping under the carpets awaiting the day when one goes berserk as he reaches the breaking point ?</p>

              <p>No, this is not a form of healing. By trying to avoid the root cause of your problems using forms of distraction will only cause it to go deeper, and potentially worse in future, when it finally surfaces.</p>
              <p>Real healing is to let your emotions of your root problem surface, and deal with it, not let it go out of control. After you've dealt with it, then your healing can then take place.</p>
              <p>From your last paragraph, you actually already know what is the right thing you need to do now. It's now your choice which option to take. :)</p>
              <p>Take care ya.</p>

              <p>Don't run away from your problems.</p>
              <p>Sit down and think about everything that is making you unhappy. Then slowly think of solutions for each of them.</p>
              <p>Most importantly, you must have the RESOLVE.</p>
              <p>You must be determined to get rid of these issues once and for all.</p>
              <p>Running away will only make ur problems worse and tire you out.</p>

              <p>You're not running away if the problems/issues are out of your control. You are just re-focusing your energy on something more productive.</p>
              <p>But if problems and issues can be resolved if you confront it , yet you decide to ignore them and keep busy with something else, then that is indeed running away.</p>
              <p> However, if you are running away from obligations and/or responsibilities.. then you're really doing a bad thing.</p>
