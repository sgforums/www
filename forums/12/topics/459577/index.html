              <p> </p>
              <p>Since young, I had the burning desire to live and work overseas. I went to US (Wisconsin) pursuing a degree right after my '0' Levels, but due to NS duties, I had to return after a few years.</p>
              <p>I loved USA, the exciting lifestyle and culture, as well as the lovely weather (even the winters with an average of -30 degrees). Also as a Singaporean Chinese, I am rarely a victim of racial remarks.</p>
              <p>Now that i'm 32, NS is no longer a liability for me, yet I'm tied down by other commitments. I am also getting married next year and we bought a new condominium slated to complete by mid 2015. Of course, it was a huge decision...but I am quite regretful now. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>Do I really have to give up my dreams of leaving Singapore?</em></p>
              <p>I have considered the options of migrating to NZ but with an average income tax of 20-30%, lack of CPF, and higher living expenses (in terms of commodities like cigarettes, food etc.), it becomes apparent that I cannot fund the housing in SG unless I make like SGD$10,000 a month. I am no doctor or lawyer, currently just a humble marketing professional in middle management. My savings are also depleted, with about $100K left for my marriage, car and renovation expenses.</p>
              <p>I have seriously thought about my options:</p>
              <p>i.) Forgo the stamp duty and deposit paid upfront for the house (around $150K), and incur more expenses as the bank loan is already in effect. <em>Too extreme I guess?</em></p>
              <p>ii.) Find an good paying expat job that sends me and my wife abroad, to UK or US? <em>Hmm..I was never a "lucky" person.</em></p>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>So...I believe many Singaporeans are facing similar dilemmas. Any useful advice would be great! Thanks.</div>

              <p>Hi Acid...haha didn't know still got people remember me. Anyway, thanks for your advice.</p>
              <p>I don't think leaving the country is a form of betrayal. What more can we ask from life, than to be happy? Maybe I'm not easily contended, but I feel suffocated living in Singapore.</p>

              <p>UK have already shut their doors. USA unemployment is still high, 14.5mil people out of work. NZ would probably be the place but they likely put your application in WIP. A friend of mine applied and still waiting after 2 years.</p>
              <p>Guess you have to make do with what you got unless you got that opportunity to work overseas.</p>
              <p>There are a lot of opportunities, undevelop places like laos, thailand, cambodia, china, indonesia and vietnam that you can still go abroad and earn better salary than the average singaporean. Question is, are you willing to live in such tough circumstances?</p>

              <p>u mean life in spore so bad until u think of dying?dun they have casinos ,aircon malls seafood etc???</p>
              <p>dying to protect country is unavoidable...everyone has to do it when time comes be it overseas or in spore.question is will the pm or generals in charge screw it all up until u cant reach camp...dont have a weapon  to fight with...no ammo...no rocket launchers ..no rations.....are they prepared as we speak now?are u certain they are prepared for u to die even in battle or will u end up dying from enemy artillery???u could very well be captured without a single round of ammo...no uniform and no means to fight a war.currently from looks of it they are not prepared to me.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>as for dying in battle.....do u always die when u play call of duty computer games?if so i suggest u pick up a pc version of call of duty and start killing and  mowing enemy soldiers instead of dying in a battle.its a good change for starters......just a thought.medals man!!gimme the medals!!!!</p>

              <p><em>Do I really have to give up my dreams of leaving Singapore?</em></p>
              <p>I have considered the options of migrating to NZ but with an average income tax of 20-30%, lack of CPF, and higher living expenses (in terms of commodities like cigarettes, food etc.), it becomes apparent that I cannot fund the housing in SG unless I make like SGD$10,000 a month. I am no doctor or lawyer, currently just a humble marketing professional in middle management. My savings are also depleted, with about $100K left for my marriage, car and renovation expenses.</p>
              <p>I have seriously thought about my options:</p>
              <p>i.) Forgo the stamp duty and deposit paid upfront for the house (around $150K), and incur more expenses as the bank loan is already in effect. <em>Too extreme I guess?</em></p>
              <p>ii.) Find an good paying expat job that sends me and my wife abroad, to UK or US? <em>Hmm..I was never a "lucky" person.</em></p>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>So...I believe many Singaporeans are facing similar dilemmas. Any useful advice would be great! Thanks.</div>

              <p>All I can said in my young age is, Uncle, do whatever you think is legal and right, for you only know yourself well, however, before doing anything, alway leave a back door for yourself, there lots of risk takers, the smart ones curved a back door for themselves, the goons alway end up hitting the walls head on.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>The concept is alway wrong that once you get married, you hardly can do much, today, divorce lawyers are the rise, you can alway seek them with a 2 to 3k fees, and everything is settle, infact marriage is more difficult then divorce. Some couples get married, bought a house, unoffical divorce for 5 years, sleeping at different room, rent out one more to others, after 5 years, sell, make money , split and spend 2 k on divorce fees, both wins.</p></div>
