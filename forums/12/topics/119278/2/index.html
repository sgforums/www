Most guys usually find pillow sleep more attractive than pillow talk after *ahem*... exerting themselves in bed.

            <div class='col-md body'>Here's mine:<br><br>Ask her out, normal date not fancy.  Go ice skating but I book the whole rink for an hour so no one is allowed inside.  Have them put on an hour worth of sappy love songs.  While there I drop a few hints maybe like ring reciept (let her pick it up) or drop something and go on one knee like I'm proposing but say something like "you drop something" then pick it up and hand it to her.  Not actually proposing.<br><br>Leave after an hour.  Will bring extra clothing of cos and leave it in the car.  Go to a nice restaurant like the one at (the old compass rose).  Buy a cake that says "*Name*will you marry me" on it.  Have the waiter bring it to our table and set it down.  Act like I don't know whats going on.  Look at the cake and say "must be a mistake".  Walk over to the captain and pretend to say something (of cos, everything worked out with him already).  He'll come back and take the cake back saying it was meant for someone else who just happened to have the same name.<br><br>After dinner take a walk over to the little park across the street from Marina Square.  You know the one with Fullerton hotel, Merlion and all the sky scrapers in the background.  Enlist the help of a pair of friends, guy and girl.  A pair most unlikely to be together (single and good actors, of cos). Give them a banquet of flower to carry.  Have them walk by at a certain time, and pretend us bump into them.  Talk a little then the girl will hand the flowers over to me.  Just before that have a friend on cycling by also 'bumping in' into me there.  He'll hand me the ring.  Then I'll drop to one knee and pop the question.<br>A cameraman will be hired then he take a picture of our sillohuette and with the city's background.  Then the picture will be used for the wedding cards etc. and framed in the bedroom.</div>
