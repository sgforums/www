              <p>it was already 11.30p.m after a hectic day at the office. The usual SBS bus had not arrived yet. I decided to take an alternate bus service that plied a longer route, as I did not wish to take the chance that my usual bus will arrive, since it was almost time that a last service would either be on the way or would have left.</p>
              <p>As the passenger-empty bus travelled along the unfamilar route, I glimpsed ahead in the dark, a dim silhoulette of a school. The one I had studied at before. On an impulse and with a sense of an unknown longing pulling me, i got up, pressed the bell to get off at the nearest bus stand.</p>
              <p>The bus quietly rolled away after alighting me. I walked the short distance to my former school, and found it fully fenced up around the commodious grounds and gates locked, with not a sign of anyone in the deserted landscape, save for a few passing cars heading home to their mansions far ahead.</p>
              <p>It had been years that I returned since my graduation from here. Looking up from the gates, I could see my previous classroom on the second floor of the main block nearby. Gripping the rusty bars with my bare hands, I hurled myself over the portal and landed onto the school's compound.</p>
              <p>Under the pale moonlight and twinkling stars, I made my way to my former classroom. Lonely and quiet, with not even a chicada chirping away, I sat down on my former seat.</p>
              <p>Suddenly, the room came alive and as bright as a morning classroom could be, right before my eyes and filled with people! Infront of me was Yuet Heng, with her pony tails and usual well pressed pinafore,chatting animatedly to plumb rosy cheeked Susan. On my left was Arul, my best buddy, copying my maths homework so that he could hand it up later.</p>
              <p>They seemed not to notice me. I reached forward to pull Yuet Heng's hair, as I often did playfully, but my fists grasped only air where her hair was. Turning to my right, Johan and Sam were reading their comic books. I called out to them, but they heard me not.</p>
              <p>In frustration, I shouted out, and in that moment, the cold chill darkness  returned. The living figures seemed to float away, everything else disappearing into the bleak nighttide. I then realised it was my imagination playing tricks, memories long buried of a happier and innocent time once lived.</p>
              <p>In sadness, I stumbled out, headed to the courtyard and made my way out thru climbing over the gates again, noticing only then that this school would be torn down soon to make way for new developement, another victim of Singapore's ongoing urban renewal programmes.</p>
              <p>With a heavy heart, suffering from long lost but cherished memories, I paced the  silent lited pavement,buffeted with cool gentle breezes flowing around me, making that journey home, alone, wishing all the while that time could be unwound back.</p>
              <p>Back to my school days where there were friendships made, relationships formed, trials and tribulations of life shared. filled with joys, naivety and innocence. Books, education, passing exams were not the only thing that mattered.</p>
              <p>In a few hours more, a new day will dawn, a rekindled hope for a better tomorrow will arise, and each moment to be treasured and cherished, for it will be fleetingly gone before one knows it. Everything else is transient, only the memories remain. They are part of humanity's gift that is called life... <br> <br>Therefore, seize each day and make the best of it, before it turns into memories, memories of which good or bad, happy or sad is within our own freewill and choice.</p>

              <p>It is not abnormal, especially if she is your one and only crush thus far.</p>
              <p>Many people also wish to turn back time if possible, though obviously it is not.</p>
