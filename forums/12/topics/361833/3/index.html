              <p>To <span style="color: #800080;"><strong>Ah Chye</strong></span> ---- Yah he just ask how r u, that's all. He asked this question twice in MSN and SMS. I was pissed that he just ask that and nothing else at all! and dont even reply when i replied him 'yes im fine.' So in SMS, he ask the same thing, i wont reply again. Cos that time is his birthday! I was not ready to reply him coz i still sooo angry and hate him for dumping me like that! At school, He ignore me everytime he saw me. Then why should he bother to sms me??</p>
              <p>Just now i return back the loan to him but only transfer by bank transfering. He really don't want to meet me to pass the money to him. -___- i mean we are in the same school and he rather ask me to transfer money to him. I myself don't really like to owe ppl money so even we had broke up, i return it back.</p>
              <p>T o <span style="color: #800080;"><strong>Fantagf</strong></span> - i guess i don't want to think endlessly and hopelessly for him. I hope i can control myself and move on without him. I had told myself a couple couple times! it didnt help me much. But i'm gonna learn how. I remember someone post here saying about guilty. Yes, i felt guilty of what i had done. He's really good and caring to me.. Sigh.. It's pity to lose him actually. We had alot of good memories than bad. So it's hard for me to move on.</p>
              <p>And btw, im telling the truth and nothing but the truth. I don't lie in my desperate words. I was so desperate how can i lie in my problems for wat??</p>

              <p>My advice to you is that you shouldnt worry too much about your break-up.</p>
              <p>In my opinion, his breaking up with you due to a superficial reason (not happy with you contacting your ex) is a proof that you and him are not suitable as long term couples and frankly he is little bit childish.</p>
              <p>In your age now you should be thinking how to get serious and mature guys, not immature guys.</p>
              <p>So you should be happy that you didnt waste more time and get older. You should be happy that you discover that he is not suitable for you, earlier.</p>
              <p>Now my second advice to you is.....remember that a boyfriend is not everything. Please take a better control of your emotions and thoughts. Breaking up with a boyfriend, even one who you love so much, is not the end of the world. You have to be stronger, please.</p>
              <p>Can you also take a better internal self-control and get a bit more mature. Dont depend your life on your boyfriend and when you break up you feel like your life is ended. Remember your future is still very long, lots of other guys are waiting, you know there is a saying "the forest has many trees" or something like that. If you break up with him it means you open the door to meet other guys who can potentially even better than him and someone you will love even more, have you ever thought about this?</p>
              <p>Most important is to get internal strength and dont be too weak and succumb to sadness.</p>
              <p>Now dont contact anymore this guy, or other exes, it has no point seriously, it's better that you dont make any contacts with them, at all. Your life and their life need to progress and enter another phase. It is better not to contact them. Some things are better to be done in certain way.</p>
              <p>Take this advice from me.</p>

              <p>If he already put it this way, then it is really time for you to move on.</p>
              <p>Words are not everything, you must know that. As the saying goes, "Action speaks louder than words". Your action has already upset him so badly that he seems to be unwilling to give you another chance.</p>
              <p>Indeed he is hot-headed, but from what you say, I believe that he is more of trying to keep to his decision than regretting his actions. Originally, I thought he might regret his actions and is waiting for you to patch up, but in this case, I see that his pride has blinded him to the point that he will not reverse his decision.</p>
              <p>What is important now is not on his part, but on your part. Instead of pleading with him and hoping for things to somehow change for the better, you should just move on with your life and forget about him. If you are going to keep contacting him, you will only keep getting yourself hurt.</p>

              <p>Ya i agree with wat earlneo said. Its very hard to accept that u are going out with ur ex and u are saying that to his face and not asking for permission. If u are going out, u shdn't have even told that to ur bf as he will think alot of it.  Being too open too much will bring adverse effect on relationship. <br><br>Such example is like being with a guy on a same photo with u and not just once  and adding it, its the same guy. <br><br>For u, u will think that its just a fren. But as for him, he will suspect that u having an affair with that guy. Its just basic instinct. <br><br>Humans are not perfect we all has flaws, so maybe next time when u have another relationship, u might be aware of this and so hopefully not to make this kind of mistake again.<br><br>Anyway, just move on with ur life now.....</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>My advice to you is that you shouldnt worry too much about your
                      break-up.</p>
              <p>In my opinion, his breaking up with you due to a superficial
                      reason (not happy with you contacting your ex) is a proof that you
                      and him are not suitable as long term couples and frankly he is
                      little bit childish.</p>
              <p>In your age now you should be thinking how to get serious and
                      mature guys, not immature guys.</p>
              <p>So you should be happy that you didnt waste more time and get
                      older. You should be happy that you discover that he is not
                      suitable for you, earlier.</p>
              <p>Now my second advice to you is.....remember that a boyfriend is
                      not everything. Please take a better control of your emotions and
                      thoughts. Breaking up with a boyfriend, even one who you love so
                      much, is not the end of the world. You have to be stronger,
                      please.</p>
              <p>Can you also take a better internal self-control and get a bit
                      more mature. Dont depend your life on your boyfriend and when you
                      break up you feel like your life is ended. Remember your future is
                      still very long, lots of other guys are waiting, you know there is
                      a saying "the forest has many trees" or something like that. If you
                      break up with him it means you open the door to meet other guys who
                      can potentially even better than him and someone you will love even
                      more, have you ever thought about this?</p>
              <p>Most important is to get internal strength and dont be too weak
                      and succumb to sadness.</p>
              <p>Now dont contact anymore this guy, or other exes, it has no
                      point seriously, it's better that you dont make any contacts with
                      them, at all. Your life and their life need to progress and enter
                      another phase. It is better not to contact them. Some things are
                      better to be done in certain way.</p>
              <p>Take this advice from me.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>hmm. nobody will like it if their gf keeps contacting their ex bf la.</p>
              <p>the same thing as no girl will like it if their bf keeps contacting their ex gfs.</p>
              <p>it's not simply about maturity level. maturity level won't sustain a relationship, but trust, respect, communication and love will.</p>
              <p>contacting an ex frequently is bound to hurt the trust level.</p>
              <p> with the betrayal of trust, it's going to take alot more effort to earn back the trust.</p>
              <p>the rules i think is really simple</p>
              <p>guys need respect</p>
              <p>girls need love.</p>
              <p>if a guy keeps contacting their ex gf, the gf will feel unloved because she will be wondering what the bf can tell to the ex that he cannot tell her, also, if he isn't treating her nicely, but treat the ex nice, she is bound to feel even worse.</p>
              <p>if a girl keeps contacting their ex bf, the bf will feel disrespected. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>like i said, this has nothing to do with maturity level, but about love and respect.</p>
              <p>maybe maturity level affects the relationship where one is mature enough to realise that some quarrels aren't worth it, or maybe one is mature enough to give in or agree to disagree about some issues, or maybe one is mature enough to be decisive about the relationship, or to be faithful to their partner.</p>
              <p>but that's about it for maturity.</p>
              <p>so yeah, i kinda disagree with your point about maturity.</p>
