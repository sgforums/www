              <p>As for trust, he is not obligated to trust u nor are u obligated to trust him. - Trust, yes, do u trust in your love? Does he trust in his love? Or is it something else behind the facade? Only u and him are privy to all that transpired between the both of you.</p>
              <p>Its palpable that both of you are playing 'games' with each other. By all means do so, its your prerogative and your predicament - just don't hide behind the word love. If its not love , nothing else matters.</p>

              <p>Hi everyone, i would like to meet girls and guys experiences for post break up.. Many thanks to you if you reply sincerely. I would appreciate so much for your advises.. Or do you have any experiences pls share with me your views of my problems? Thank you so much!</p>
              <p>My ex boyfriend is 21 and i'm 23. We dated for 9 months in the same poly and course but different classes. We recently Broke up this March. It's realllly soo painful and hurtful for me. I couldnt forget about him till now. i know many ppl said if he meant to be yours, he will come back, if he's not, he will not. I have to stay positive coz im someone who thinks too much.</p>
              <p>Since 3 months had passed till now, my heart seem to heal and i don't get nightmare about him. I don't know if he still got gf or likes someone else. We Broke up coz lack of trust. i contact my previous ex and told him that i went to meet my ex. He was shocked and couldnt hold his feeling any longer. thus he want to let go of me. he gave me chances to continue with me at the starting of our relationship. But i think that was the first time he felt hard to accept that i met my ex without his permission and lead to break up. My previous ex and me has nothing to do with each other. he already had a gf and is getting married soon. I kept telling him that my ex and i really had nth to do with each other and just friends. He didnt believe me and dislike him alot. Though they never see each other before. </p>
              <p>i really wish how to woo him back sincerely. i try liking other guys but it don't work on me everytime. I try to move on too but he is alway in the back of my mind. Pls help!</p>
              <p>He contact me just awhile to ask how am i. Sigh.. i wish things will be better if i stop worrying too much. Anyone who had this experience before?</p>

              <p><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"> How do you try liking other guys when your spiritual debt with your ex hasn't completely been resolved internally? This is a clear distinctive example of a relationship that are killed by the the spark of two separate causes that pronouce death in a relationship, but not yet love. (CloUdiSm theory of soul and structure). </p>
              <p>Meeting up with an ex lover is a tricky issue because it seriously depends on the kind of guy you are dating. For most guys, it's a competition-cum-ego problem that they are hit with, when their gf date her ex-beau behind their back. A combination of that sour feelings coupled with reckless attempt to break up would often fuel a problem of regrets in the future, especially after when they have cooled down and began to think rationally.</p>
              <p>It's not about a problem of ethics or morals, much more than an issue with expectation. Your man probably had an expectation that his woman shouldn't meet up with her ex at all cost, while you probably had this ideal that it's still perfectly ok to remain friends with an ex love. You probably felt certain degree of guilt and hence, resulting in this inability to move on.</p>
              <p>Two separate beliefs - one fatal error (that wasn't communicated).</p>
              <p>Personally, I do not advocate anyone returning to someone who had trashed you into the bin like a waste paper. Albeit he might have his reason/s to feel angry about this situation, but to abandon the relationship entirely shows a lot about his attitude towards his own love.</p>
              <p>If one decides that pride is worth more than love, then he will learn how much opportunity cost he has sacrificed to salvage pride. Do not expect instant recovery about a break-up - allow yourself the natural pace of healing, moving along your own rhythm of life. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="icon_idea.gif"></p>

              <p>You got a point there. Her ex-bf seems to act too implusively.</p>
              <p>Even so, the problem now is with her. She has broken up with her ex-ex, and yet she contacted him and meet him. Now she broken up with her ex, she is still talking to him. This feels like an endless thing.</p>

              <p>He 21 you 23... maybe he feel insecure... anyway, why did you go meet your ex? Even if he asked you out, you shouldn't have. Furthermore he's getting married right? He's also 1 hell of a nut case.</p>
              <p>You still young, and broken up for 3 months is a short time, sure will think about the romance... give yourself more time, do something new like a hobby, activity, etc... not necessarily finding another bf... for that matter, don't find another bf... it's just a rebound case.</p>

              <p>If u want a new relationship(s) - learn the art of relating, its the quality of your relating that enhances your relationship(s). Inner plentitude is the key - one's intuitive heart! Love shares, love appreciates</p>
              <p>As an aside - ego-gratification is what its all about - love? no lar , its playing, exploiting each other and .... now the result - is misery.</p>
              <p>a Pix this - a person who is loving, kind, empathetic, grateful - he/she has something to share (inner plentitude)</p>
              <p>b Pix this - a person who is  @jealous, needy, possessive, suspicious, fearful, insecure - he/she has nothing to share (impoverished, malnourished being)</p>
              <p>a - can relate cos he/she is no longer seeking but sharing - gives love without expectaions.</p>
              <p>b -  cannot relate but manipulates another to quickly secure a relationship, here the love given is not love at all - but  @..... disguised as love , and when it does not come back - watch the drama unfold</p>

              <p>To <span style="color: #800080;"><strong>Ah Chye</strong></span> ---- Yah he just ask how r u, that's all. He asked this question twice in MSN and SMS. I was pissed that he just ask that and nothing else at all! and dont even reply when i replied him 'yes im fine.' So in SMS, he ask the same thing, i wont reply again. Cos that time is his birthday! I was not ready to reply him coz i still sooo angry and hate him for dumping me like that! At school, He ignore me everytime he saw me. Then why should he bother to sms me??</p>
              <p>Just now i return back the loan to him but only transfer by bank transfering. He really don't want to meet me to pass the money to him. -___- i mean we are in the same school and he rather ask me to transfer money to him. I myself don't really like to owe ppl money so even we had broke up, i return it back.</p>
              <p>T o <span style="color: #800080;"><strong>Fantagf</strong></span> - i guess i don't want to think endlessly and hopelessly for him. I hope i can control myself and move on without him. I had told myself a couple couple times! it didnt help me much. But i'm gonna learn how. I remember someone post here saying about guilty. Yes, i felt guilty of what i had done. He's really good and caring to me.. Sigh.. It's pity to lose him actually. We had alot of good memories than bad. So it's hard for me to move on.</p>
              <p>And btw, im telling the truth and nothing but the truth. I don't lie in my desperate words. I was so desperate how can i lie in my problems for wat??</p>
