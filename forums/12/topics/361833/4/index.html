              <p>hey TS, i'm in a similar situation, just worse. All I can say is, if you want his trust, you can only earn it back. There's no quick and easy way to it. If you really want him back, work hard and don't give up.</p>

              <p>Hi everyone, i would like to meet girls and guys experiences for
              post break up.. Many thanks to you if you reply sincerely. I would
              appreciate so much for your advises.. Or do you have any
              experiences pls share with me your views of my problems? Thank you
              so much!</p>
              <p>My ex boyfriend is 21 and i'm 23. We dated for 9 months in the
              same poly and course but different classes. We recently Broke up
              this March. It's realllly soo painful and hurtful for me. I couldnt
              forget about him till now. i know many ppl said if he meant to be
              yours, he will come back, if he's not, he will not. I have to stay
              positive coz im someone who thinks too much.</p>
              <p>Since 3 months had passed till now, my heart seem to heal and i
              don't get nightmare about him. I don't know if he still got gf or
              likes someone else. We Broke up coz lack of trust. i contact my
              previous ex and told him that i went to meet my ex. He was shocked
              and couldnt hold his feeling any longer. thus he want to let go of
              me. he gave me chances to continue with me at the starting of our
              relationship. But i think that was the first time he felt hard to
              accept that i met my ex without his permission and lead to break
              up. My previous ex and me has nothing to do with each other. he
              already had a gf and is getting married soon. I kept telling him
              that my ex and i really had nth to do with each other and just
              friends. He didnt believe me and dislike him alot. Though they
              never see each other before. </p>
              <p>i really wish how to woo him back sincerely. i try liking other
              guys but it don't work on me everytime. I try to move on too but he
              is alway in the back of my mind. Pls help!</p>
              <p>He contact me just awhile to ask how am i. Sigh.. i wish things
              will be better if i stop worrying too much. Anyone who had this
              experience before?</p>

              <p>WTF is "i shall not love him too much like last time"?? Now you decide that since you have another shot at the r/s you won't put in 100% in case you get hurt the same as last time? When it was YOUR FAULT (yes your fault) you guys broke up the last time. And you obviously didn't love him very much if you didn't mind getting him upset, angry and worked up over your meeting your ex EVERY TIME.<br><br><br>YOUR FAULT: why do I say its your fault? simple. Its not the first time you've met your ex, and its not the first time your bf's known about it. Its not the first time he's expressed to you his displeasure, nor the first time he's "forgiven" you about it. The way your bf handled the issue not withstanding, it is simply YOUR FAULT that things wound up the way they did.<br><br>You knew that meeting your ex was something that made your bf extremely unhappy, yet you went ahead with the meet, in spite of the fact that there is nothing going on between you and that ex who is getting married. If there was nothing going on between the 2 of you, and if he was going to get married, WHY THE FUCK DO YOU WANT TO MEET HIM, AND MAKE YOUR BF PISSED AT THE 2 OF YOU, AND POSSIBLY CAUSE HIS FIANCEE TO DOUBT HIM??<br><br>That is possibly the single most selfish thing you have done, considering only how you feel with regards to your ex-who-is-now-just-a-friend, and not considering how others would feel about your actions.<br><br>I don't understand how TS can come here WHINING and pleading for advice on how to salvage a relationship and trust that she single handedly crushed, not once, not 2ce, but repeatedly. I'm all for second chances. But TS, you knew what you did wrong, and you persisted.<br><br>Maybe your relationship has miraculously been salvaged by your bf's willingness to initiate a reconciliation, but with your mentality and selfish desire to protect your "oh so fragile and sensitive girly heart", I doubt any relationship you get into will be meaningful or long lasting.<br><br>a little link for you, the one with all the unsatisfying relationships.<br>http://despair.com/dysfunction.html</p>
