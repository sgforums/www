Go join more activities.. More groups or something which you would need to meet up on a regular basis... Slowly you should possibly gain some more consistent friends from there...?<br><br>Getting to know people and friends should be a ACTIVE move and not a passive one....

I think there's a need for you to find that core interest to pursue because from there, you will inevitable find people of similar mindset/interest and forge great friendship.<br><br>I made friends from several sources. Obviously not all of them will turn out to be great friends, but when you scatter your seeds randomly all over the place, surely, a few will develop well, albeit most might just perish.<br><br>Let me try to form a logical picture/equation in your mind:<br><br>In school, you would probably have your school clique. These are some friends.<br><br>If you go to church and is decently active in church activities, you would have your religion clique.<br><br>Then when you expand slightly more; if you are involved in dance as CCA, you would have some dance clique.<br><br>You get the idea.<br><br>The more interest you pursue, the more people you will know from those activities and the higher the chance you will find good friends. If you want to improve/retain your chance of making meaningful friends beyond that of just 'good', you also got to work on your personality so that people will find you comfortable, interesting and most importantly, natural. Then they will include you into their life/group/clique/etc.<br><br>P.S: People often want to be around people they feel comfortable with. And to make them comfortable, firstly, they got to accept/like your character first before they will be comfortable with your presence in their life.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>
