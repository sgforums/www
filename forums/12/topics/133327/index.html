            <div class='col-md body'>To subarugal,<br><br>U need to test water first if  u want to give sex to a guy. Some gus are faithful but some are out with malicious intentions. Be very sure the guy loves and true to u only before giving it to him.<br><br>Not all guys are unfaithful but there are some i know personally who are really sincere. They are not even looking for sex, only love from the girl.Expecially those types who are madly in love with a girl but she hasnt accpeted him. Those guys will any day choose the love and attention from the girl over sex.Such are truly gentlemanly types.<br><br></div>

She does not know whether or not to trust the guy to give her love and/or body to him.<br><br>There is one simple solution for testing trust: Time. Give herself and the guy more time to know each other first before committing any further. With more time, she should be able to know more about the guy and decide whether he can be trusted before giving her love and/or body. If he knows what's good for him, he'll wait.<br><br>Let the guy talk about sex -- talking is all right, as long as he keeps his hands to himself -- if your buddy doesn't feel comfortable with the sex talk, she should tell the guy to ease off and give her some lady respect first. A gentleman doesn't shoot his mouth off with such lewd stuff to a lady even though he may love her a lot.</div>

How to know if the guys is really true interested..<br></div></blockquote>I'm always puzzled by the youngsters nowadays. If you don't know someone well enough, how do you fall in love with him/her ? And not even had a 2nd date ? How old are you and your buddy..?  Love at 1st sight ? How much you know about love to decide that its love at 1st sight ?<br><br>Lasting relationships are usually built on strong understanding of each other. Either before being in a relationship or during a relationship. Of course, sometimes, there are things that will never happen if you don'y even try. But the golden rule that works for me is, Never do things that you will regret doing. And Do things that you will not regret not doing . What are  the things to regret or not regret doing, is up to individual.<br><br>Once read this article in Sunday Times many yrs backabout relationship. For a lasting relationship, Understanding of the other party should come 1st. With the understanding of the person you love, Commitment will come naturally. When you are committed to another person, you will be willing to sacrifice ( NOT your body by having sex !! ) things like time ( spending more time with love  one ), missing that football match final in order to accompany the GF for her appointment with the doctor, etc.  After all these in place.. then will physical intimacy take place... And sex should only be the last.  I thought about it. It makes sense to me at least<br><br>But now, we are seeing more youngster, jumping straight to Pt no.5. And majority of them are doing so just bcos the BF ask them to.<br><br>Remember you are what you decide you want to be. A person who is aware of the situation that one is in.. or someone being made used of by another person to satisfy sexual desires.<br><br>It ok to talk about physical intimacy stuff. But only if the other party/parties are close friends or friends that you had know long/ well enough. But if the person is someone that you don't well well, someone only been to a date, doesn't that sound off the alarm that such a person is interested in such stuff only?<br><br>A real gentleman will not discuss such stuff with friends that he do not know well. Let alone a guy interested in a gal. If a guy is really interested in a gal for what she is, like her character etc and not bcos of her big boobs or physical appearance, he will definitely NOT discuss such intimate stuff with her, for the fear of scaring her off. Like what someone had advised , you can choose to lose your virginity anytime you want to. But you cannot choose to be a virgin once you lost it.<br><br>Physical intimacy or sex is a wonderful moment with the person you are in love with, someone who deserve it.  Someone is right when he/she pointed out that some men give love in order to get sex.some  women give sex in order to get love. These type of man are jerks and deserved to burn in hell. These type of woman are , well sorry to offend them , outright stupid . Bcos once sex is given out, they will not see love.  Of course, when gals are of higher sex drive and out to have fun, thats they own choices.<br><br>Remember you are what you decide you want to be</div>
