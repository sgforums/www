Of course, it would be good to keep her eyes open and know what is going on to an extent. But it won't be healthy if she starts to have great doubts here and there throughout her relationship... Some things in a relationship cannot be foreseen. No matter how well prepared you thought you would be, things might still fall out in one way or another sometimes. It doesn't necessarily has to be all that bad a thing, as lessons could be learned from it and happiness you might once be occupied with..<br><br>I hope in your 'defence' for your friend, you would also share with her your knowledge to love her partner, and to be by her side when things are bad for her?<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"Road is a stretch which sometimes you can't see beyond until you've walked it..."</span></div>
