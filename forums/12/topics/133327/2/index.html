I think now both feel a sense of awkwardness towards one another. Think have to wait a certain time period before things such to go back together.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by subarugal:<br>mention and ask y is she so daring to do oral on him ?<br></blockquote>Under such circumstances, it'd be natural for the guy to think of the girl as a prick-teaser. In fact, it is one of the most common causes leading to "date rape".<br><br>The damage has been done. Perhaps the girl should let the guy know that he cannot equate her consent to go third base for him as her consent to let him hit the home run. Her "no" really means "no".<br><br>One has a bad feeling that the guy is still sticking with the girl precisely because he hasn't gone all the way with her yet, and that the fastest way to realise her worst fears of losing him would be to give in to him.</div>

We can only advise and give our own opinions mildly (where appropriate)....and not scold.<br><br>I had suspected that something sexual had happened between the both of them on the first date.  I also suspect that maybe he's keeping away because he already got some of what he wanted.<br><br>Of course to prevent hurting your friend, he pretended to be interested in her, but puts it in a way that circumstances prevents him from meeting or calling her (eg. last minute office work).  Perhaps, he's trying to irritate your friend to the extent that she lets go instead of him (pushing the responsibility of the separation to her).<br><br>The above are only suspicions and I cannot be sure, but it sure seems like it......(situations like these are actually quite common).<br><br>IMPORTANT:<br><br>(1) If the above is right, then he did not get sick of her after petting.....in fact, he may have never been interested in her, except for sex.  So it MAY not be any inadequacy on the part of your friend.<br><br>(2) If my guess is right......and if she had waited till later to have intimacy with him, then he would either lose interest and leave before it happens....or wait patiently, then get it later and leave.  I've seen both these cases happening.<br><br>(3) Your friend should be careful also that he may call again some time later and be very nice to her....(when he's horny and needs it again).<br><br></div>

Unfortunately it is a mistake not reversible, and they would have wasted their first time on an undeserving jerk in exchange for an expensive lesson. To paraphrase an old post:<br><br>If the girl didn't get any love before sex, giving sex probably won't get her any love after it either.<br><br>If the girl did get love before sex, what is the point of giving sex when she already has the love?<br><br>The guy may beg "If you love me, you'll give it to me." The guy may threaten "If you don't give it to me, I won't love you anymore." The guy who says such things probably doesn't really love the girl anyway, so all the more the girl shouldn't give it to him.<br><br>So the big question is: When can the girl give in to the guy?<br><br>Since there is no litmus test for real love, the only logical answer one could think of is: <span style="font-style: italic;">Only when the girl wants the sex as well</span>. If she doesn't want it, she shouldn't give it away uncaringly just for the sake of giving. And once she has given the sex especially before marriage, she should be prepared to accept the possibility that the guy would leave once sex has been obtained.<br><br>If a girl respects her body enough not to offer it away carelessly, thus would a guy accord her with that same amount of respect.</div>
