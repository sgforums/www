All mothers will put their child in 1st place. Somemore, baby inside her stomach for full 10mths. Got feelings one. Your wife watched how the baby grow and move day by day, mth by mth leh. For man, only know that their wife stomach geting bigger and feel the baby kicking. Do you understand how much pain and suffering your wife will be going through if she's pregant?</div></blockquote>Hmm ... so it is because woman and man see this differently? So can I say that most men will want to save their wives and most women will want to save the babies?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
