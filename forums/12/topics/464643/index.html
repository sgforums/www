            <div class='col-md body'><p>Hi to all the readers out there. I'm 20 this year and I would like to talk about my life in 2012. First of all, it was a terrible year for me but I could only blame myself for it. I got addicted to gambling through my friend last year and I have lost about 60k in a year time. It was a lesson learnt for me but I really felt bad for my parents. They have basically emptied their savings to pay off my debts and still had to borrow from relatives to help me. My relatives did helped me but I know they had been talking bad behind my parent's back, and I'm really guilty about this as its my fault but I had implicated my parents. Not only that, I still owe 6k of debts currently with my parents not knowing, as I refuse to tell them so as not to add on to their troubles. With the deadline for it by end of the month, I have got completely no idea how to pay it off, as I'm still a student currently. I know I have screwed up my life and to some extent, I really wish to end it. It's really tough but I know that I was the one who caused it. Just a friendly say guys, please do not gamble illegally online as it would cause alot of misfortune to your family and I'm speaking through my real life experience. That's all and goodbye.</p></div>

              <p><br>Put it this way. Even with $6k in debts, you're still in a better position compared to people born in Nigeria or Vietnam or Indonesia or India. You have better jobs prospects, born into a healtier economy, and the reason you're feeling bad is because you made a mistake in your life. In life, who don't make mistakes? The important thing is the mistake is not grave enough to screw up your life forever, and second important thing is to never repeat the same mistake.</p>
              <p>The way I see it, it's not a major mistake and if you can prevent it from happening, you're still wealthier and having a better life than more than 3 other billions people around the world. They earn less than US$300/month with no hopes in sight that they can get out of their predicament.</p>
              <p>So, it's all a matter of perspective and you can choose to be happy or sad. There are always choices in life, at least in Singapore.</p>
