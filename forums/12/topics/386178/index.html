              <p><br>If none of your messages were replied, then it's a sign that you should let this guy go and play his own retarded fishing game.</p>
              <p>When he realised that he has failed to catch any fishes, then he only can go and use his fishing rod to go and beat up his so-called fishing masters.</p>
              <p>What he failed to realise is that it doesn't matter if he liked us first or not, it's whether we liked him or not. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>Lady Death,</p>
              <p>What exactly are you expecting from him now that you have rejected his approach ?</p>
              <p>"yes..i did agree to forget about the
                          confession tt he made.." THIS is a REJECTION to his unfortunate "<strong>bumbling approach</strong>".</p>
              <p>If you do have feelings for him, TELL HIM. <strong>Reciprocate</strong>.</p>
              <p>OK. So he went hiding in his cave because he is so shy.</p>
              <p>Now, will it kill you to give him a call ? Let him know that you have him in your thoughts.</p>
              <p>Are you/him playing the hard to get game ? Hopefully not.</p>
              <p>Even if later he denies his feelings for you after you have responded positively, then he is but a fool. Besides, you have nothing to lose.</p>

              <p>Hi lady death,</p>
              <p>First of all, do you have any feelings for him? If you do not have any feelings for him, just leave him be, as there is no reason for you to do anything else.</p>
              <p>However, if you are interested in him, approach him and see if the two of you can work something out together. If you continue remaining passive, nothing is going to happen between the two of you.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

              <p>Lady Death, Just because he didn't ask for a serious relationship, doesn't mean you can't ask for it.</p>
              <p>Do you play by his rules or yours ? I'd rather he play by my rules if I be you.</p>
              <p>I'd be telling him this when he ask to forget.... " You want me to forget this ? Well, that's just too bad, because I have the same feelings for you too."</p>
              <p>And so what if he rejects you... your nose is not gonna fall off.</p>

              <p>well TS:</p>
              <p>if you just want to mend his wounds and stick by your decision to reject him, just send him another msg telling him your reasons and what you expect him to do next.</p>
              <p>For instance the steps or action to remain as friends and not MIA totally.</p>
              <p>I have had an similar experience like yours years back. The only regret I had since then was not able to remain as friends after which.</p>
              <p>Just send an email telling him what your feel and just remain friends. Time will tell if he's sincere about his feelings towards you.</p>
              <p>By MIA, he's just isn't man enough. A man is to stay and face the consequences regardless of the results, there he is running away. Sigh..</p>
              <p>Make a wise decision.</p>
