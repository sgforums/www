Sometimes, its not about them, its about us. But this would be in another topic.<br><br>Art of seduction - the only way to counter them is to know what they are doing. Under Art of War (zi ji zi bi, bai zhan bai shen) - knowing how your 'opponent' operates almost guarantee you a victory in war because you can create a move, acting like a counterspell in all her schemes.<br><br>She is mysterious because she hasn't knew you enough. There are many thingy about her which she may/may not wants you to know because she isn't too sure of her intention to you yet. If she sees you are a potential friend, probably things would be as simple as it is now. If she sees you as a bf material, then probably she would work out a way to attract you. If she sees you as a kai zi, similiarly, she will also work out a way. She is the kind of people, who always desire to stand at an advantage, while keep herself shut. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>To avoid being a kai zi is to avoid employing wealth as a medium to foster good relationship.<br><br>Avoid or not doesn't matter. But seriously, you may not want to go anywhere further other than a causal friendship.<br><br>P.S: She, being mysterious, is turn off for you. When you sit down and think about it - it is this unique quality that attracts you in the first place.<br><br>Is she a Scorpio?<br><br>Cheers</div>
