We're still not in a r/s, she calls/sms me almost 24hrs a day everday. I just don't get it, she's the one who say she likes me, dated me out for movie.<br><br>Now this guy is back for her again i suppose. I used to like this girl but when after i knew her. I fell for her instantly, it's not a crush.. it took me 2 mths to decide who shld i confide my love to. I dunwanna hold them both cuz tht will be selfish. She nv tell me she's like tht guy back thou after she gave up.<br><br>I'm tinking of whether i shld pop out tht question whether she really gave up anot.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

Passive mode don't work all the time, strong chase don't work all the time - you have to understand your situations so well that you know what to apply during different cirumstances.<br><br>Of course she wouldn't look at you as someone she might fall for. (Worst if she is a Pisces/Aquarius involving in virtual love) cause you are a good friend and never had you attempt to cross the boundary. In fact, there's a note - there are times when friends are SO friends that a relationship cannot begin. Although it's not very common, but occasionally such cases do take place. Knowing a friend too well may not be a good ground for relationship to foster. That's why if your chase is drawn on a graph, it will NOT look like a straight line graph - it will zigzag along the imaginary line. Your optimum time to act is when the zigzag hits a relatively high peak and tada!<br><br>It seemed to me that you are a guy who is quiet about your passion and weep at home for her lack of response.

If she decides not to pick you, then at least you can get on with your life...<br><br>I have a friend who is like this as well, the girl have alot of other suitors, but always contact my friend (who she very well knows is very interested in a serious r/s with him). In the end, many times, my fren is being made to feel like he is just a spare tire for her. When she is down because of her other r/s, then she will turn to my fren. I dont mind it that she treat my fren only as a fren, but she seems to lead him on otherwise. aiyah, eventually i think my fren finally had enuff and made a clean break.
