              <p>It's always hard to know exactly what has happened in a relationship so got to take it all with a pinch of salt.</p>
              <p>For all we know, the girl you mentioned has learnt her lesson in life and realised there's more to life than just material possessions. Maybe she really does see something in this guy that she is willing to committ the rest of her life with him.</p>
              <p>Coming back to the kind of person she was though, it really says a lot about her as a person to have such a criteria when dating and to be so flirtateous only because of whether the person has a car. Like some have said, the guys themselves will access the girl as well. If she acts like that it's no wonder guys are discouraged from having a serious relationship with her, let alone marraige.</p>
              <p>About marrying at 34, frankly I don't really see anything wrong in itself. What age you want to marry is a very individual thing, moreover even if you want to marry you should consider whether there is anyone suitable rather than just marry for the sake of marrying at that age.</p>
              <p>Marraige is a lifetime comittment, it's not just about looking pretty when you marry but have someone be there with you supporting you for your whole life. There's more to consider than about being rich, pleasing parents or whatever.</p>
              <p>Besides, for all we know the girl herself didn't want to get married because she still wanted to play around with all those guys who own cars, we really don't know.</p>

              <p>I do realise though that there is a growing trend. As more woman compartively are educated nowadays, they come to have higher expectations of people around them especially prospective partners or whatever.</p>
              <p>Yet however they loose sight of what really matters and in some cases, do not consider or think about themselves what they bring into the relationship. It's not a behaviour that's unique to woman only, just that there are more of such women now as compared in the past.</p>
              <p>I feel it also has to do with the growing selfishness of people today that all they care about is only themselves and what they want to get without consideration of what they can do for others as well.</p>

              <p>Even in stories like Pretty Woman or whatever other stories, it's not just about the guy being handsome or rich or whatever. It was about the connection the people shared, the feelings they have.</p>
              <p>The character played by Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman actually loved the man, and not because he was rich or had a car or whatever.</p>
              <p>People lose sight of what it really is about in the first place.</p>

              <p>i think in the 1990s, if a woman was near her 30s and not
                  married, she would be afraid of being left on the shelf. I think
                  these days, women only panic when in their early 30s.</p>

              <p>yeah of cos women can choose to panic later and later.. AT YOUR OWN PERIL. Just cos people make more foolish decisions or are more foolish doesn't make it right. <br><br>those ladies who are GENUINELY not worried in their late 20s probably are content with the prospect of being single forever. those who aren't content with that and are still single at 30, or worse single without a bf (which means no immediate chance of turning this bf into a husband), i'd advise you to panic because only with panic would you take action.<br><br>i believe the odds of a single woman marrying drastically reduces after 30.<br><br>I told this friend of mine who's 31 about this "30 and above singles club" that my church is organising. he also goes to this church and I said it'd be a great way for him to meet his future wife, since he's looking quite desperately, plus the girls there would all be christian.<br>you know what he said? <br>he: "ee--yeh but the women there would be TOO OLD". <br>me: why would they be? seow ah? you're 31 this year.<br>he: too old for me lah. <br>me: but u are 31! can't you date a woman your age? or 30 year old still younger than you mah. moreover nowadays..its more common for men to be with slightly (by 1 - 2) years older ladies.<br>he: no lah. I am 31 lah. I want girls that are in their mid 20s. same age or 30 is too old for me!<br>me: ..........<br><br>The thing is most men, not all men, would always want much younger or slight younger women, if not at most same age. That's cos most men are shallow. There are men I know who have gfs that are slightly older by one to two years. But these remain minority cases.</p>

              <p>U need to get real and open your eyes to the real world.</p>
              <p>first, that was a Hollywood movie, and isn't used as a basis or reference for reality.</p>
              <p>second, even using the plot of pretty woman, how do u know that Robert's character didnt only fall for Gere's character because he was successful and rich? remember she was a streetwalker, not even a working class professional. Many many men, no need to be as successful as Gere, would have been a pretty good catch for her.</p>
              <p>Whether in movies or real life, if the man met a woman while he was still starting out and not so rich yet, and they go through thick and thin, get married, blah blah, I'd agree that the woman might not have let the guy's success and wealth colour her perception of him when dating him if he turns out to be as rich as Donald Trump 30 years later.</p>
              <p>But if they met when the guy is already successful, of cos the woman is tempted by that.</p>
              <p>Of cos no woman will be so candid and honest and say I'm attracted to his money/status/success. They'll just fall in 'love with them'.</p>
              <p>Maybe i'm one of the more cynical people around but i believe that to be true for 99% of women.</p>

              <p>as u move up every age bracket, there are fewer and fewer singles hence what I say about diminishing odds with time. please use blains.</p>
              <p>second point that u should know is, if u are good, u can find a good catch who is young. dun need to marry some old dick whose penis isn't working or can hardly stand.</p>
              <p>I have a few friends who are earning $10k a month at only 26 years old. they make many times more $ than most guys who are 10 years older than them. but they have all been snapped up liao - all are attached for a long time or married. this is because when a woman chances upon a good catch, she will quickly grab. these guys do not stay single in the market for long each time after a break up.</p>
              <p>The women who go for old men are women who can't get the young eligible men. The young eligible men go for women hotter than them. This is life.</p>
              <p>So they settle downwards for the average old dicks who make more money comparatively to a young average guy. if u compare 2 guys, both of equal and mediocre calibre, obviously the one who's 45 year old has an 'edge' over the 25 year old one but that's only cos you are comparing two losers. I'd hardly even call that an 'edge' cos the word used on this situation seems to mock them more.</p>

              <p>A lot of women like to talk kok, they say they dun mind/actually prefer to date men up to 10
                                          years older, also can cos they're more "mature, wise, stable", and
                                          other assorted euphemisms. what BS man haaha.. they say older men are
                                          more attractive.</p>
              <p>why? and what is the<strong> TRUTH</strong> behind the euphemisms and BS? Why is a old shit more attractive to them? Ans: A preconceived notion that as people (both men and women) age, they
                                          earn more. Of cos a superficial and unscientific social stereotype is at play that caused them to believe this. If we look at this like how we look at science and stats, we can see this stereotype deals with only one single variable - age, but not accounting a multitude of other variables like intellect (IQ), capabilities, chance, foresight and character (associated with risk aversion). These are of cos, personal traits that are gifts.</p>
              <p>of cos comparing 2 average joes or 2 losers of the same capabilities, one is 25, the other is 40, the older one earns more cos he has freaking one foot in his grave. <br><br>would these women REALLY choose a 25 year old guy who has his youth, looks good, thin, no pot belly and age spots and love handles, making $10K a month or a 45 year old, old shit who makes $10k also? IF THEY HAD THE CHOICE? Of cos they'd choose the young one at the drop of a hat.<br><br>Its just that men who belong to the 1st group - 25 year old guy who has his youth, looks good, thin, no pot belly and age spots and love handles and makes $10k a month - are a highly exclusive and elite group, and are extremely few in number. And these men go for higher league women than them ie hotter and smarter women.</p>
