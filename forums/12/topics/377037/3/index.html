              <p>U need to get real and open your eyes to the real world.</p>
              <p>first, that was a Hollywood movie, and isn't used as a basis or
              reference for reality.</p>
              <p>second, even using the plot of pretty woman, how do u know that
              Robert's character didnt only fall for Gere's character because he
              was successful and rich? remember she was a streetwalker, not even
              a working class professional. Many many men, no need to be as
              successful as Gere, would have been a pretty good catch for
              her.</p>
              <p>Whether in movies or real life, if the man met a woman while he
              was still starting out and not so rich yet, and they go through
              thick and thin, get married, blah blah, I'd agree that the woman
              might not have let the guy's success and wealth colour her
              perception of him when dating him if he turns out to be as rich as
              Donald Trump 30 years later.</p>
              <p>But if they met when the guy is already successful, of cos the
              woman is tempted by that.</p>
              <p>Of cos no woman will be so candid and honest and say I'm
              attracted to his money/status/success. They'll just fall in 'love
              with them'.</p>
              <p>Maybe i'm one of the more cynical people around but i believe
              that to be true for 99% of women.</p>

              <p>oh please..give me a break.<br> <br> how likely do u seriously think this is?? so u think she wanted to
              play around and be fucked by the guys who own cars because she has
              a new-age carefree and feminist attitude to men and treat them as
              nothing but sex objects, and she would end up MARRYING a
              macdonald's manager?! Is it cos mcdonald's is too sexy and good
              looking..and have a huge dick to satisfy her day and night?<br> <br> more like she wanted to aim for a husband with good earning power
              and good future but somehow they didn't want her and in the end
              panicked just grab whatever rubbish that doesn't hiam her.</p>

              <p>With any story I hear on the internet, l take it with a pinch of salt. I don't fully believe or fully doubt either way. Maybe I was just giving an extreme example, but really we don't really know the full picture do we? That was my point all along.</p>
              <p>To me, either extremes are equally plausible without actually knowing the people in question.</p>
