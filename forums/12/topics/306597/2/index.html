              <p>You are proving to be merely a man of your "words".</p>
              <p>You promise this, promise that, what exactly have you proven so far ?</p>
              <p>Talk is cheap. Don't just talk with words. DO with your actions.</p>
              <p>Your " If she doesn't accept me, what can I do." is an excuse. A self defeatist statement for a man, unwilling to change for hope.</p>
              <p>If you think it is useless to change for her, at least change for yourself, change for the next girl who will come into your life.</p>
              <p>Love cannot be forced, it cannot be controlled as you will.</p>
              <p>Not only must you manage your anger issue.</p>
              <p>Your fundamental problem is with your control issue.</p>
              <p>You refuse to hope, because hope is not a certainty.</p>
              <p>Hope is only a possibility, something you have no control over.</p>
              <p>The harder you grip, the faster love slips from your fingers.</p>
              <p>Learn to let go, be flexible.</p>

              <p>1. You have a tendency for violence. If you do not cure it, it will become worse.</p>
              <p>2. No point drinking to drown your sorrows. When you wake up sober, the problem remains.</p>
              <p>3. All this while, she has been attentive to your needs. But do you know what are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">HERS</span>?</p>
              <p>4. People make mistakes. But to harp on it and regret is pointless, like you said. Most importantly is not to commit it again. But it take guts and an iron will. Do you have it?</p>
              <p>5. In this society, achievements matter. Prove to yourself, prove to her that you can be a dependable guy, be it in working a good job, being a faithful partner etc. Stop whining and take actions to improve your life.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal">I wonder why u even post this here. U know u wont get any sympathy
              vote here. So why bother? Making urself feel sh1tty dun help make thing any
              better. Neither will guilt. So grow up and learn from ur mistake and do the sensible responsible
              thing that u can do, leave her alone.</p>

              <p>i admit it is my fault. but now whatever i say, i m looking to something else rather  than brooding over it.</p>
              <p>i understand that some people want me to leave her alone some people say hope, but i think, at the end of the day, its up to her, but i really am confused about what to do next.</p>

              <p>this is part of the growing up process.. jus b strong n hopefully, time will heal everything..</p>
              <p>i've been thru something like urs b4 n i've certainly moved on.. i found a better gal who i cherish very much n make sure i do not repeat my mistakes on her..</p>

              <p>Never hit a girl. I saw my sister get beaten up. I was beaten up. Its is the saddest thing that can happen. Once you hit someone. The person lose all respect and trust for you. The relationship will never be the same. There will always be an element of fear when people are around you. People tip toe around you fearing that they will make you angry, say the wrong thing and get beaten up for nothing.  People will not tell you any truthful things or give you feedback to help you improve because you might beat them up. You only want to hear good things about yourself and so this is what false friends will tell you and you just rot further until you are un-salvagable.</p>
              <p>You say you wanna change. You think its so easy?  Talk is cheap. I have hear so many people say they want to change but never did anything. Then they claim they change loh. Many people change for the worse only.  Most people are not even committed and do not have the will. Most people I know only tok c0ck.</p>
              <p>You truly want to change? You sure?</p>
              <p>YOU want to change?</p>
              <p>Are you aware of the extent of hurt you have done?</p>
              <p>Do you even know the level of hurt and disappointment you caused?</p>
              <p>Are YOU sure you want to change?</p>
              <p>Do you think you can change?</p>
              <p>Are you sure you are ready?</p>

              <p>if you are sincere about changing</p>

              <p>only if you honestly look into yourself</p>

              <p>Not many people know what a real change is all about. I've seen people make superficial changes and think they changed. Real change process is very painful and hard.  I am doubtful if all the counselling help if the person is not committed.</p>
