              <p><strong><a href="http://www.5lovelanguages.com"></a></strong><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-117" title="learn-book" src="http://www.5lovelanguages.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/learn-book.gif" alt="learn-book"></p>
              <p>With more than 30 years of experience as a marriage counselor, Dr. 
              Gary Chapman has heard it all. He has helped couples at every stage of 
              marriage and at pivotal points in their relationships—from those just 
              discovering the joys and trial of marriage to those who are ready to 
              call it quits.</p>
              <p>After many years of counseling, Dr. Chapman noticed a pattern: 
              everyone he had ever counseled had a “love language,” a primary way of 
              expressing and interpreting love. He also discovered that, for whatever 
              reason, people are usually drawn to those who speak a different love 
              language than their own.</p>
              <p>Of the countless ways we can show love to one another, five key 
              categories, or five love languages, proved to be universal and 
              comprehensive—everyone has a love language, and we all identify 
              primarily with one of the five love languages: Words of Affirmation, 
              Quality Time, Receiving Gifts, Acts of Service, and Physical Touch.</p>
              <p>Since The Five Love Languages debuted in 1992, over five million 
              copies have been sold, making The Five Love Languages a perennial New 
              York Times bestseller. But numbers don’t measure the influence the book 
              has had on couples and their marriages.</p>
              <p>The Five Love Languages has helped countless couples identify 
              practical and powerful ways to express love, simply by using the 
              appropriate love language. Many husbands and wives who had spent years 
              struggling through marriages they thought were loveless discovered one 
              or both spouses had long been showing love through messages that weren’t
               getting through. By recognizing their different love languages, they 
              witnessed the rebirth of the love they thought had been gone for good.</p>
              <p>The book has been translated into more than 40 languages and is healing marriages around the world!</p>
              <p>As anyone who has attended one of his marriage conferences knows, Dr.
               Gary Chapman’s expertise in marriage begins with the success and 
              failures he and his wife Karolyn have experienced in their marriage for 
              more than 45 years. He is just the man to turn to for help on improving 
              or healing our most important relationships. His own life experiences, 
              plus over thirty-five years of pastoring and marriage counseling, led 
              him to publish his first book in the Love Language series, The Five Love
               Languages: How to Express Heartfelt Commitment to Your Mate. Many of 
              the millions of readers credit this continual New York Times bestseller 
              with saving their marriages by showing them simple and practical ways to
               communicate love.</p>
              <p>Since the success of his first book, Dr. Chapman has expanded his 
              Five Love Languages series with special editions that reach out 
              specifically to singles, men, and parents of teens and young children.</p>
              <p>He is the author of numerous other books published by Moody 
              Publishers/Northfield Publishing, including Anger, The Family You’ve 
              Always Wanted, The Marriage You’ve Always Wanted, Desperate Marriages, 
              God Speaks Your Love Language, Parenting Your Adult Child, and Hope for 
              the Separated. With Dr. Jennifer Thomas, he co-authored The Five 
              Languages of Apology.</p>
              <p>Dr. Chapman speaks to thousands of couples nationwide through his 
              weekend marriage conferences. He hosts a nationally syndicated radio 
              program, A Love Language Minute, and a Saturday morning program, 
              Building Relationships with Dr. Gary Chapman, both airing on more than 
              200 stations. Dr. Chapman and his wife have two grown children and 
              currently live in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, where he serves as 
              senior associate pastor at Calvary Baptist Church.</p>
              <p>Dr. Chapman holds BA and MA degrees in anthropology from Wheaton 
              College and Wake Forest University, respectively, MRE and PhD degrees 
              from Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary, and has completed 
              postgraduate work at the University of North Carolina and Duke 
              University.</p>
