              <p>I'm getting abit sick of this. I'm a well-balanced person. On each day, i try to spent time with my different groups of friends. Like for example, I'm hanging out with my friends lets call it group A. Then the next day i hang out with Group B. Then saturday, afternoon with Group C then night time i hang out with Group D and so on. Well this next sunday is one of my friends from Group B Birthday and I need to attend because we're quite close but I forgot on that day i have booked my plans with Group C. Ahhh this is really making my head hurts. Then recently, I was hated by some of the person from Group A because I keep on turning them down about asking me out but i cant help it as i got busy with my other group of friends.</p>
              <p>And this kind of mindset stuck in me, i must find time to hang out with all of them after work or else, they will hate me thinking that im stingy. I dont want them to think of me that way especially the ones that i really like. I told my problem to my brother and he said that i having too much friends. There's no harm droppiing a few friends. He also said that this sentence to me which quite giving me abit of a boost "dont risk a thousand lives just to save one". Not sure what does it really means but it kinda grows on me. And my one of my cousin also think im stingy now because i used to hang out with him now not anymore. Oh and remember that guy who offer me his umbrella, I keep on turning him down on his offer to ask me out now he stop smsing me thinking im "action". This really sucks.</p>
              <p>Do anyone of u guys got this problem before? pls advice i really need some tips now.</p>

              <p>my gf also have this problem.</p>
              <p>however what i feel is that if they are really your friends, they should be understanding and not "force" you to be with them, all the time.</p>
              <p>and because of 1 incident which my gf and me can only go to this outing for 1 hour as my gf is super tired, the whole group condemned me n my gf, nv askin us out again which i think to this day, this group of so-called friends is really not worth it... and we dun even care and bother about this group of ppl again.</p>

              <p>Why dont you reduce the intensity / frequency ?</p>
              <p>Doesnt mean you should "drop" any friends....</p>
              <p>You can still keep in contact with them all.......just not at the same intensity and frequency...</p>
              <p>For instance, from once a week.....to once every 2 weeks.....something like that...is still possible.</p>
              <p>So that way you can have more time and more relaxed.</p>

              <p>Btw, why dont you like to go out with the umbrella guy?</p>
              <p>Just go have a lunch with him.</p>

              <p>One thing i learnt is to stand firm...Honestly, rejecting people are hard to do, usually for the meek ones, like me, will use something as an excuse to reject something. This is really bad, as excuses will lead to more excuses and lies...Like trying to tell someone no, by putting urself into a "i want to but i can't" state, and its like a double edge sword. So instead of getting a bf to reject guys who want to date u, or patch with u, say a firm no..play hard to get...guys will never ever cherish whatever that are easily obtained...the ones who give it all out are the ones u will want to look out for ^^</p>

              <p>ok. Hope your advice means no harm between me and my friends. I no feelings towards the umbrella guy at all. Actually its hard for me to meet him after work because i will probably have plans. I just pass him my number because its how i repay my thanks. Smses wont hurt. I dont have any attention of having a guy with me now. I just like to look at them only. Like how u guys like to look at pretty girls.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Da_dood? doubt that will work hahas. because even though i give out a straight answer to them, they keep on pestering me say "why?" or "u never know once u try" etc. irritating. But i cant ignore them. or else, they think im stingy =.=</p>

              <p>@<a href="/users/262206">Simple~Gal</a> : Try to hurt their ego badly...they will back off...pestering guys are real irritants..they never know when to back off, when to take no as no...U can try to observe them, spot things that bugs them most then keep attacking at it...best thing is to do it at public but subtly so that u wont be part of the laughing stock...like simply icing them on train rides...at most if they say ur stingy, attitude problem, tell this " This is an open society, I have the freedom to choose how i feel, when, and where. If u can't stand me, there is an option where u can turn around and keep walking." Then smile sweetly and continue to ice them..lol...don't worry bout pple thinking ur stingy...Real friends will understand u..dont't live ur life to please or to make others happy...Live the life u want it, even if it means the whole world is against it.. Rmb, u can't please everyone..just pick out the ones that are worthy can liao..</p>
              <p>A quote i find interesting " Have u ever wondered when pple say u've changed, its just actually u've stopped living ur life the way they want u to?"</p>

              <p>You try my method haha. I use to tell my friends, I don't feel like going today cos I'm not in a very good mood. You guys wouldn't want to see me sulk all day too and spoil your fun right. </p>
              <p>And if they insist, go with them, then pull a very long face and spoil the occassion or happy mood. In future, when you say this sort of things, they will know its for real. lol. </p>
