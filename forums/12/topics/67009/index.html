            <div class='col-md body'>My story goes like this..<br><br>My first relationship aka first love lasted for about 2 years, i guess because we were both new to this we didn noe wat to do, i took things too seriously and he took things too lightly. Eventually, i was taken for granted. I did my best to salvage the relationship but attempts were fruitless cos apparently he just didn noticed. For the 2 years he didn give me anything, didn celebrate birthdays together or any special occasions, we only go out for movies like once in a blue moon, he doesn dare to hold my hand in public <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Anyway, it's not that i think that all these are actually a must in a relationship, but as i said i was new, still abit disillusioned. So i couldn take it one day and initiated a break up, he was extremely devastated of course, but at that point of time i didn really noticed until later. Both of us had our share of relationships as time healed.. We eventually became very close friends, telling each other almost everything.<br><br>So now, both of us are single and still keeping in close contact, he'll always call or msg me when he has time during NS. I thought it through for quite a while,  i noe he was one that i love the most, first love best friends soulmate and all, always there for me too. I feel that those r/s that i went through may have been a quest to search for someone who loves me as much as he do? but of cos i got dumped la haha. Now, i feel that i am developing strong feelings for him but the thing is i'm far from wat he wants his GF to be <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> long legs and tall.<br><br>Soooo.. i need comments <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  to noe maybe wat i should do?
