              <p>You will not die so soon. I didn't when I kena the "death" card too. Not once but a few times. It's been many years. Nothing that bad has happened. The only bad thing that happened was having to worry most of the time. After a while, you'll figure it only screws your head.  You'll realise you don't have to listen and be led by what the such things says. There's always the other bright side that our heart, mind and spirit could instead listen to  and follow. Next time it comes around, just let it pass by your conscience. Your life will not go down that way. Instead, go the opposite and you'll see there's so much more to good living and a good life. Good luck and God and his angels be with you!</p>

              <p>My friend did a prediction for me using Tarot Cards, I got a death card in the month of september and I'm going overseas during that time. I thought nothing of it.</p>
              <p>But what he predicted this month is coming true, I'm becoming more short-tempered. I get pissed at small things or almost nothing. Like today, I was at the gym and my friend was spotting for me, suddenly I just felt pissed off at the way he was spotting.</p>

              <p><br>Ok, I think we should be more creative and enviromental friendly, let go away with wood, afterall, most will be cremated, waste the forest trees, i suggest we use PVC, Aluminium or Plastic grades, which can be use and reuse again as rental. Together with the bao all packages, i think we can cut a great deal here, cos today customers are more realistic, why invest so much to be burnt away??, we can sell it in a way that can convince our customers, so we neeed to have the niche to competite with the current saturated coffin and funneral business pples.</p>

              <p>I should note before posting the following, that I do not
              recommend Tarot reading, needing to know the future through
              divination, and definitely discourage superstitions about such
              things.</p>
              <p>But I am posting the following for a more balanced POV.</p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.holisticmakeover.com/July7th2006.htm">http://www.holisticmakeover.com/July7th2006.htm</a></p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Text
              format:</p>
              <div>
              <p>Most people know that tarot cards are about as evil as<br> coloring books. Instead of being tools of some satanic<br> force, they’re simply pieces of cardboard with pictures<br> that help to trigger intuition. The more intuitive a reader<br> is, and the more they know the cards and have established<br> a dependable system to use them, the more accurate their<br> readings are.</p>
              <p>Of course, the question for the tarot reader is important<br> too. General, unfocussed, or trivial questions tend to get<br> poor results. Specific questions tend to get specific
              answers.<br> Questions such as “Will I be rich?” or “When will I meet<br> my soul mate?” are very common, but not well stated; rich<br> means different things to different people and we all have<br> many soul mates. “What will be with the idea I have for a<br> business?” or “What will be with my love life in the next<br> 6 months?” are much more appropriate questions. Also,<br> if the questioner isn’t supposed to know something<br> because it may interfere with his or her destined path,<br> for example, a good reader will know the question isn’t<br> meant to be explored.</p>
              <p>Another important yet often overlooked factor which<br> effects accuracy with tarot spreads is personal energy.<br> Just as you have a great energy connection with certain<br> friends which results in great experiences, or a poor<br> energy connection with a neighbor who isn’t respectful,<br> positive or negative energy between a reader and client<br> can greatly influence the quality of the reading.</p>
              <p>For example, when Stephen does a tarot reading for a<br> long-standing client with whom he has a great working<br> relationship, the energy connection is good and that<br> person’s faith in Stephen as a reader allows the information<br> he “receives” to flow freely and copiously. Alternatively,<br> when he does a reading for someone who’s very critical<br> and skeptical or who happens to be projecting, for whatever<br> reason, a lot of negativity energy, because of Stephen’s<br> strong empathic and spiritually sensitive state, he’ll feel<br> blocked and not compelled to help the person.</p>
              <p>How does tarot work? There are many theories, but we<br> believe tarot readings can very effectively outline current<br> and destined personal circumstances because there exists a<br> divine order in this Universe, everyone is intimately<br> connected to this order, and because fate exists. Also, the<br> 78 unique tarot cards and the methods employed using them<br> are mathematically and symbolically synchronistic with<br> “what is.” An experienced tarot reader can tap into this<br> synchronicity. It is not an “accident” or “coincidence” when<br> certain cards appear in certain positions in the tarot spread<br> of an experienced reader.</p>
              <p>Some readers claim that their tarot spreads are “...only
              about<br> the current path you are on. It’s possible you will change<br> directions and avoid the outcome indicated.” In some cases<br> this can be true, but some readers might say this because<br> they lack confidence in their abilities, or to attempt to<br> empower their clients and keep them from feeling too much<br> fear about the future.</p>
              <p>However, based on our 22+ years (combined 44+) of<br> experience with metaphysics, we believe that the majority<br> of significant future personal life events and circumstances,<br> as outlined by tarot, comprehensive astrology and numerology,<br> and other esoteric sciences, are immutable. If something is<br> going to happen, it’s going to happen.</p>
              <p>We believe, based on years of regular spreads for
              ourselves<br> and others, that the future can be seen through tarot.<br> However, as stated above, results depend heavily upon<br> the reader and other factors listed in this column.</p>
              <p>Lastly, to provide a better idea of why some readers<br> don’t offer as much insight as you might hope, here are<br> some other common reasons for inaccurate tarot readings:</p>
              <p>*The reader, even with an extremely successful track<br> record and a very consistent, high accuracy level, has<br> an off reading and happens to give one of his or her<br> inaccurate readings to the client (no reader is 100%<br> accurate).</p>
              <p>*The reader is inexperienced with the process and, or<br> does not yet know at least the bulk of the symbolism<br> found through each of the 78 cards.</p>
              <p>*The reader is not very intuitive, or his or her intuition<br> is blocked for whatever reason.</p>
              <p>*The reader’s philosophies and beliefs conflict with “what<br> is” (e.g., he or she tells the client that they can cheat
              fate<br> and erase all of their tough karma without having to directly<br> balance it, or that they can have the “relationship of their<br> dreams” whenever they want, creating a “permanent,”<br> blissful, conflict-free “life-partner” situation without the<br> use of self-deception, manipulation, and conditional love).</p>
              <p>*The day and time (universal, and the client’s personal<br> numerological and astrological timing) of the reading
              strongly<br> suggests, despite the high level of expertise and accuracy of<br> the reader, that information imparted at that moment may not<br> be as appropriate or accurate as it would be at other times.</p>
              <p>*The client is fated to hear specific information in the
              reading<br> that turns out to be inaccurate, but that information helps
              to<br> ultimately steer them in the right direction.</p>
              <p>*The reader is biased about the issue related to the
              reading;<br> human filters can and sometimes do get in the way of<br> spiritual guidance.</p>

              <p>BTW would like to add to this article, I don't believe the fate part.</p>
