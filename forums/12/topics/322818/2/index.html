              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><em><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">THE TAROT'S DEATH CARD</span></em><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">, key #13 of the Major Arcana, does </span><em><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">not</span></em><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;"> mean physical death. Rather, the Death card portrays </span><em><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">symbolic</span></em></strong></span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> death-a change or transformation. </strong></span>Often, it heralds the end of a
              familiar or more comfortable mode. It conveys a release which is
              necessary for growth and expansion. Perhaps it even brings a whole new
              set of principles which will guide you spiritually, emotionally,
              psychologically or financially. Joseph Campbell, author of </span><em><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">A Hero with A Thousand Faces</span></em><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">, describes times of personal change as periods when </span><em><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">"The
              familiar life horizon has been outgrown; the old concepts, ideals, and
              emotional patterns no longer fit; the time for the passing of a
              threshold is at hand."</span></em><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;"> The
              sunrise depicted in the background of the Death card holds the promise
              of the transformation which is about to take place: the death of the
              old self, but also the dawning of a new day. The Death card is a cue
              that you are at a "threshold"-a crossing into a new phase, unbounded by
              the past. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">If you are casting the cards in a
              Tarot reading for another person, as a sensitive reader, you should
              always address this card immediately when it appears in a reading, and
              then go back to the rest of the reading. The "Seeker" (who is receiving
              the reading) should be reassured that the "death" being depicted here
              is symbolic and transformational, not literal. You might even encourage
              the individual to discuss his or her reactions to the card, relating it
              to events that may be occurring in his or her life. The white rose
              which the Death figures holds is the symbol of rebirth. It also
              portrays the mystery which surrounds death and transformation. Since
              there is no Tarot card that specifically portrays birth, we may wonder:
              Is the Death card really the birth card? The cycles of life, especially
              birth and death are mysterious and paradoxical. Such mystery is
              embedded in the Tarot's system. It is meant to challenge you and allow
              you to explore the meaning of life on a deeper level and from a broader
              perspective. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">When this card appears in your
              reading, it may be an invitation to embrace change and transformation,
              especially as it refers to your consciousness or past lifestyle. As
              such, it represents the quintessential example of "letting go." It's
              appearance may encourage you as you are clearing out the old and making
              way for the new. You can even meditate on the Death card in a creative
              visualization process, allowing its potent imagery to infuse your
              unconscious with its implied invitation to trust the process of
              transformation and release. The Death card can assist you in dissolving
              any negative forces which, knowingly or unknowingly, have taken root in
              your unconscious mind. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">At other times, the Death card may
              appear in your reading when there are changes which you know you need
              to make but which you are resisting. The potent Death imagery may serve
              to remind you that the more you hate something and the more you run
              from it, the more you are bound to it. You are caught by that which you
              seek to avoid. Resistance leads to persistence and sometimes that
              resistance to a problem or situation may actually help to maintain it.
              The Death card may help you to release resistance. As the symbolism
              makes contact with your deep mind, it retrieves the more elevated
              doctrine that shows the meaning of death in a broader context. You can
              never know what miracles, what healing, what insight or growth might
              come to you through the difficult times of your life and as you face
              life's challenges. It is likely that the Spirit flowing through your
              periods of change or difficulty will bring an expanded life, a greater
              self or a greater good. The symbolic death that follows may allow you
              to move forward. For example, perhaps you are holding onto friendships
              that are no longer supportive or nurturing. Perhaps your career or job
              is no longer satisfying. The Death card's appearance in your reading
              may be inviting you to deliberately address the issues at hand
              regarding these changes. Perhaps Death asks, "Is it time to let go and
              move on? Can you trust that some greater good will come to you as you
              surrender to the change?" </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">It can be one of life's greatest challenges to know when it </span><em><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">is</span></em><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;"> time to let go and allow "death" to claim whatever is being embraced.
              Meditation on the Death card may allow you to discern if, and when, it
              is time to let go, to mourn and grieve if necessary, and prepares you
              to be open to whatever is next. The Death card may guide you through a
              loss or sorrow so that you will not dwell on it excessively. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">If you are in the midst of a
              difficult life challenge, the Death card may also represent the process
              of spiritual purification in which you gain a deeper understanding of
              the love of a higher force. That is, often during times of adversity,
              you may be called to turn to a higher force to guide and sustain you.
              The Death card challenges you to expand your spiritual beliefs,
              allowing more of Spirit to touch and heal you. It also holds great
              hope-the hope that you can start over, embark on a new journey. As we
              are purged of the old, we are lighter, more receptive-we are freed of
              the past, ready to start on a new course. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">The darkness of winter is upon us;
              we have pause to contemplate death's message. As we hunker down into
              the chill, Nature reminds us that death is part of the cycle of life.
              All the signs of winter, the bare trees, the raw cold, the barren
              terrain may keep our spirits at bay. But we can keep Death's emblem of
              transformation in our hearts, allowing it to remind us that there </span><em><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">is</span></em><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;"> a sunrise in the horizon and it holds the promise of a new dawn.</span></p>

              <p>It is unlikely that this card actually represents a physical death,
                  usually it inclines toward an end of something; possibly a
                  relationship, interest or otherwise; therefore, an increased sense of
                  self-awareness — not to be confused with self-consciousness or any kind
                  of self-diminishment.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Joan Bunning, author of <em>Learning the Tarot</em>, says "It is a
              truism in tarot work that Card 13 rarely has anything to do with
              physical death. A responsible card reader never interprets Card 13 in
              this way because this view is too limiting. Death is not something that
              happens once to our bodies. It happens continually, at many levels and
              not just in the physical. Each moment is the end of the previous moment
              and is the beginning of the next.</p>

              <div>
              <p>Most people know that tarot cards are about as evil as<br> coloring books. Instead of being tools of some satanic<br> force, they’re simply pieces of cardboard with pictures<br> that help to trigger intuition. The more intuitive a reader<br> is, and the more they know the cards and have established<br> a dependable system to use them, the more accurate their<br> readings are.</p>
              <p>Of course, the question for the tarot reader is important<br> too. General, unfocussed, or trivial questions tend to get<br> poor results. Specific questions tend to get specific
                                      answers.<br> Questions such as “Will I be rich?” or “When will I meet<br> my soul mate?” are very common, but not well stated; rich<br> means different things to different people and we all have<br> many soul mates. “What will be with the idea I have for a<br> business?” or “What will be with my love life in the next<br> 6 months?” are much more appropriate questions. Also,<br> if the questioner isn’t supposed to know something<br> because it may interfere with his or her destined path,<br> for example, a good reader will know the question isn’t<br> meant to be explored.</p>
              <p>Another important yet often overlooked factor which<br> effects accuracy with tarot spreads is personal energy.<br> Just as you have a great energy connection with certain<br> friends which results in great experiences, or a poor<br> energy connection with a neighbor who isn’t respectful,<br> positive or negative energy between a reader and client<br> can greatly influence the quality of the reading.</p>
              <p>For example, when Stephen does a tarot reading for a<br> long-standing client with whom he has a great working<br> relationship, the energy connection is good and that<br> person’s faith in Stephen as a reader allows the information<br> he “receives” to flow freely and copiously. Alternatively,<br> when he does a reading for someone who’s very critical<br> and skeptical or who happens to be projecting, for whatever<br> reason, a lot of negativity energy, because of Stephen’s<br> strong empathic and spiritually sensitive state, he’ll feel<br> blocked and not compelled to help the person.</p>
              <p>How does tarot work? There are many theories, but we<br> believe tarot readings can very effectively outline current<br> and destined personal circumstances because there exists a<br> divine order in this Universe, everyone is intimately<br> connected to this order, and because fate exists. Also, the<br> 78 unique tarot cards and the methods employed using them<br> are mathematically and symbolically synchronistic with<br> “what is.” An experienced tarot reader can tap into this<br> synchronicity. It is not an “accident” or “coincidence” when<br> certain cards appear in certain positions in the tarot spread<br> of an experienced reader.</p>
              <p>Some readers claim that their tarot spreads are “...only
                                      about<br> the current path you are on. It’s possible you will change<br> directions and avoid the outcome indicated.” In some cases<br> this can be true, but some readers might say this because<br> they lack confidence in their abilities, or to attempt to<br> empower their clients and keep them from feeling too much<br> fear about the future.</p>
              <p>However, based on our 22+ years (combined 44+) of<br> experience with metaphysics, we believe that the majority<br> of significant future personal life events and circumstances,<br> as outlined by tarot, comprehensive astrology and numerology,<br> and other esoteric sciences, are immutable. If something is<br> going to happen, it’s going to happen.</p>
              <p>We believe, based on years of regular spreads for
                                      ourselves<br> and others, that the future can be seen through tarot.<br> However, as stated above, results depend heavily upon<br> the reader and other factors listed in this column.</p>
              <p>Lastly, to provide a better idea of why some readers<br> don’t offer as much insight as you might hope, here are<br> some other common reasons for inaccurate tarot readings:</p>
              <p>*The reader, even with an extremely successful track<br> record and a very consistent, high accuracy level, has<br> an off reading and happens to give one of his or her<br> inaccurate readings to the client (no reader is 100%<br> accurate).</p>
              <p>*The reader is inexperienced with the process and, or<br> does not yet know at least the bulk of the symbolism<br> found through each of the 78 cards.</p>
              <p>*The reader is not very intuitive, or his or her intuition<br> is blocked for whatever reason.</p>
              <p>*The reader’s philosophies and beliefs conflict with “what<br> is” (e.g., he or she tells the client that they can cheat
                                      fate<br> and erase all of their tough karma without having to directly<br> balance it, or that they can have the “relationship of their<br> dreams” whenever they want, creating a “permanent,”<br> blissful, conflict-free “life-partner” situation without the<br> use of self-deception, manipulation, and conditional love).</p>
              <p>*The day and time (universal, and the client’s personal<br> numerological and astrological timing) of the reading
                                      strongly<br> suggests, despite the high level of expertise and accuracy of<br> the reader, that information imparted at that moment may not<br> be as appropriate or accurate as it would be at other times.</p>
              <p>*The client is fated to hear specific information in the
                                      reading<br> that turns out to be inaccurate, but that information helps
                                      to<br> ultimately steer them in the right direction.</p>
              <p>*The reader is biased about the issue related to the
                                      reading;<br> human filters can and sometimes do get in the way of<br> spiritual guidance.</p>

              <p>firstly, you give yourself unneccessary fear, and you are meddling with powers which aren't from God, and no one knows the future, except God.</p>
              <p>and powers that aren't from God ain't free. There's always a trade off.</p>

              I believe in Tarots and I think you are going to die. 
              
              Meanwhile, do you have any valuables that you would like to give away since you cannot bring it along with you? Maybe your pretty gf etc...???
              
              Maybe you can organise a garage sales so that some 'scavengers' can pick what we like first. Why waste?
              
              Oh, btw, can you PM me? Can help me buy an insurance premium in my name as beneficiary? I will include an IOU to pay for the premiums...you pay first....if you die, I'll pay the premiums to your designated account. If you didn't die, you will continue to pay me the premiums until you do. OK?
