            <div class='col-md body'>A Maths shouldn't be a requirement for any subjects in JC. For the JC current curriculum, there is only 1 Maths subject, though it may be offered in 2 levels, i.e. H1 and H2. (H3 Maths is only offered during the course in JC, so I'm not going to say too much about it.) Most people, if not all, offer Maths in JC, be it H1 or H2 level, because it's a useful subject, although there are many students who did not offer A Maths in the 'O' Levels. So, you shouldn't have to worry too much about being disadvantaged when choosing subjects in JC.<br><br>However, I'm going to add that there are quite a few topics in JC Maths syllabus that's going to be the same as or more in depth than A Maths. Taking A Maths will help one grasp those topics more easily. That's pretty much the only advantage a student who offered A Maths at 'O' Levels will get. As long as you are studious, you should be able to cope with the JC Maths.<br><br>That said, I hope you don't get too stressed over this test. If you don't pass this test, just treat it as a lesson and prepare well for you tests/exams next time, including the necessary materials that may be required.</div>

So officially, A Maths is now not a prerequisite for any subjects in JC. However, different JC's may have different requirements by themselves.</div>
