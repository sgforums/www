I got a lot of time on my hands...<br><br>Then there is this girl, we will call her A... Well A is the same age as me, waiting for her 'O' level results as well. She is currently in a JC now, doing the 3 month thing.<br><br>I don't know why I typed that, I just thought it would help somewhat...<br><br>Anyway, here is the story... After about 3 months of knowing A, I told her how I felt about her... She said she liked me too but she wasn't ready to go into a relationship.<br>Then a week later, A started JC... Before that she was always prompt with a reply when I messaged her but after she got into JC, she became so busy that her replies are really delayed and I don't get to say much because soon after we start sms-ing, she has to go to sleep... So after about two weeks, I told her that I would not bother her with messages, seeing as she is busy and all  and that if she wasn't busy then by all means, she can just send me a message. If you don't get what I mean, I basically told her that I won't message her anymore unless she messages me first. I told her this on Sunday, 14th Jan.<br><br>So... On Monday I got a message from her, great, I was happy... But then I didn't hear from her the next two days... and basically left me feeling like crap, and today, just when I felt like I wasn't gonna hear from her anymore, she started a convo with me on MSN (when she does find time to go online on MSN, always appears offline so she isn't sucked into convos, so I can't possibly start a convo even if I wanted to)<br><br>If you really read all that, thanks... My dilemma is that I'm really confused right now... Did I do the right thing by saying I won't bother her by messaging her first? I don't know how much its helping her cope with JC, but it sure feels like its hurting whatever we have between us. What do I do? Go back to sending her messages and wait forever for a reply? Or just keep with this arrangement... The current arrangement is killing me though, I miss her like crazy when I don't hear from her and I don't want her to think that I don't care hence I don't message her first...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>

What is done is done BUT the next time you face a similar situation, maybe you can try NOT to tell the person "I won't bother you by sms 1st".<br><br>Whatever her difficulty with handling life in JC, if she has time to spend chatting with friends (which everyone should have, regardless of who like who or not), she will spend it. So do not worry too much on this. You have no control of her life and timing. She does. You control your actions.<br><br>You still haven't gotten over the "infatuation" period with her, thus making you fustrated trying to figure out her next possible move. Tell you something: don't bother to. The more you try to, the deeper you fall and the less chance you eventually have of actually getting what you want.<br><br>Keep it simple. You have your life to take care of to be dominated much by a gal. Do your hobbies. Hang out with friends. Concentrate on your studies. Discover more about yourself. You will gain nothing from thing alot about her. I do not think she will want you to be like that too.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>FYI spending whole day messaging someone is not a norm that everyone practices .  People got other stuff to do.   She's busy in school while you're idling at home.  You have nothing else to occupy yourself with while she has lots of new things to do and learn.  That explains why you feel so ignored and crave her attention.<br><br>Have you ever asked her how her life is now?  Perhaps if you had a proper conversation with her you'll understand what she's going through.  And if you're that good a friend perhaps you can be more supportive of her!    Besides, it's not her responsibility to keep you entertained.<br><br>If you measure a relationship by how often she messages you, I think you're too needy &amp; not ready for a relationship.  (But given your age and mentality you may not understand this now. )  If you cannot accept that her lifestyle and priorities will change  over the coming months, then don't expect too much from her romantically .  At least she was honest &amp; responsible by saying she's not ready for a relationship.</div>

People got other stuff to do.   She's busy in school while you're idling at home.  You have nothing else to occupy yourself with while she has lots of new things to do and learn.  That explains why you feel so ignored and crave her attention.<br><br>Have you ever asked her how her life is now?  Perhaps if you had a proper conversation with her you'll understand what she's going through.  And if you're that good a friend perhaps you can be more supportive of her!    Besides, it's not her responsibility to keep you entertained.<br><br>If you measure a relationship by how often she messages you, I think you're too needy &amp; not ready for a relationship.  (But given your age and mentality you may not understand this now. )  If you cannot accept that her lifestyle and priorities will change  over the coming months, then don't expect too much from her romantically .  At least she was honest &amp; responsible by saying she's not ready for a relationship.</div></blockquote>Sorry for making many replies...
