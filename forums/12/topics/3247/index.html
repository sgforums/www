            <div class='col-md body'>Some time back, I had this problem where I really liked a girl, but some other girl (let's call her A) liked me too. Unfortunately, at that time I did not reciprocate, although I did try to be friends. My friends commented that I seemed to be keeping her in 'reserve', sort of like a 'backup'. Later on I realised that my crush on the first girl had faded, and while sorely tempted to revert to my 'backup', I was torn between the attraction of immediate intimacy and my conscience, which informed me on no uncertain terms that she wasn't right (at least for a long term relationship), and it wouldn't do for me to make use of her. So, quite contrary to my heart, I set out to distance myself from her. Now I hear she has a bf, while i'm still unattached. I wonder:<br><br>Should I have done what i did, or just went ahead and pursued her right back for that 'instant intimacy' bit? Actually it isn't really as bad as it sounds, i just have a tendency to think long-term due to some previous bad experiences. Would it be better to just 'go' for a few months, if both sides benefit and are happy with the arrangement? And guys, if you were to discover that a girl liked you, what would your INITIAL reaction be? (let's talk ground-level here, not some heady idealistic stuff)<br><br>Vald</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Don't be so hard on yourself... You did the right thing and not used her as your rebound (because, if that was the case... I don't think your relationhship with her would succeed.)<br>Anyway, all... I can say is that... you can either try and fight for her... or wait... and see what happens next.<br>Now... hehee to tell the truth...I did have a girl who like me. But... at that time.., my feelings for her were nil.so... i rejected her(I felt bad....after that). My initial reaction was..."wow..." and it was kinda good to know that someone out there actually liked you and also willing to care for you. BUT...I guess it all comes down to you to choose with the girl who likes you or the girl who you desired...and like you, i chose the girl i desired. *Dun ask what happened next...*<br><br>---------------------------------------------<br>May GOD BLESS U!!! and i hope you find what you are looking for.<br><br>------------------<br>In your service,<br>Dragonlance</div>
