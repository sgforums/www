The point is that since rainee's parents like to embarass themselves, I don't see why Rainee should take the embarassment on herself instead...? It's not really something that totally disgraceful that she had done nor much of the extent of things she could do about their behaviors and attitude?</div>

I won't much tolerate if anyone is to try this on me let alone my parents. Then again, I could be much very numb to things unlike yourself. Of course, I'm not expecting you to be like myself.<br><br>But if even your own parents are to do such things to you at this point (as an adult), is there not even a least amount of respect to be employed? Exercise more authority and have a firm stand in your own rights and privacy even as a member of the family. Are they not afraid of retribution? Cause if they're my parents, they're probably getting it from me in the future even if not now... Often I'll try to make myself clear. Even if my words are not heard then, I'll make them understood a few years down the line.</div>
