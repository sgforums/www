One of the mindsets of the older generations is that if a person manages to get an overseas degree, he/she <strong>WILL DEFINITELY</strong> get a high paying job. That is true 10-20years ago, but highly unlikely now. There is a much higher percentage of degree holders these days and as we know, salaries in asian countries are much lower then their counterparts in the West.<br>This constitutes to her parents saying that "A teaching job is an embarrassing job as the pay is normal for a degree student" (which is true in MY. SG teachers have a much better salary and benefits)</div>

I definitely agree.<br><br>Living alone is so much better with a situation like this.

Maybe send them a part of the salary every month through mail? That's the best option if I were rainee.
