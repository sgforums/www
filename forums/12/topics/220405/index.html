Whilst the amount of respect is limited only to a certain extent. A parent doesn't deserve respect if they do not respect their children or their freewill of choices given by God. Confucius even said that one should give respect in order to earn it - Do unto to others what you want others to do unto you.<br><br>There must be communication, that's so much is true. that's the hardest part I must admit. It's a very subjective topic, so it'll still depend on individual's parents I must say.</div>
