Marriage is a sacred institution - it's not something to be taken lightly. Then again, I'm sure you already know that.<br><br>Honestly, all I can say is to deal with your problems in a rational manner and hope that things do get better eventually. I can see that you and the Nekodude are meant to be together, and I'm sure you would have a happy marriage.<br><br>But until then, I think the only thing you can really do is to talk things through with your parents and hope that they will eventually see the light. My own father used to scold me and emotionally shun me when I was young... he was ashamed of the fact that I was being bullied by the other kids, and he was ashamed that he had such a weakling for a son.<br><br>And he would constantly chide me and tell others that I was dumb and stupid... while he would just stay at home and laze in front of the TV for months at a time. He was clearly ashamed that I could never hold a candle to my more esteemed elder brother who made it to RI/RJC and went on to OCS... while his younger son couldn't be a Rafflesian and 'only' became a medic spec.<br><br>It stuck with me through my growing-up years and I grew up silent and withdrawn from others. But eventually I learnt that what my father did was wrong and that I had nothing to be ashamed of. My physically weakness wasn't the problem; it was the bullies taking advantage of it that was the problem.<br><br>I also recognised that while I may be relatively slower than my siblings, I work far harder than them. His calling me stupid wasn't the truth; it was pure hypocrisy, for at least I don't pass my time slacking in front of the TV. And yeah, I finance my study at NUS entirely from loans and from giving part-time tuition - I can safely say that I'm self-sufficient for the most part without his interference.<br><br>In the end he woke up his bloody ideas and started treating me better. I guess he finally saw the light.<br><br>What I can say is to remember that filial piety does not equate to blind obedience. If you know that what your parents are wrong, then just do whatever you know to be right. It's hard, yes, but in the end, your conscience remains intact.<br><br>Your parents, too, can see the light if they so wish to do so. You just gotta have faith.<br><br>Till then, take care.
