It hard not to be understood by people and parents who do not know what is Adhd.  it is hard to be study in singapore education system. it is hard to be myself. it hard to cope when you are a child and now an adult..

In my sec sc and jc, i did badly for languages despite studying hard for it. i tink i have a slight speech deficiency too. I do not like to talk and socialise much cos i don't feel talking naturally, more like forcing the words out.. have this difficulty in talking, cos i feel that i feel a bit short of breathe, like a very slight choking whether im talking.. as a result, i get pretty short temper faster and might sound abit harsh when im just trying to make a point.. im frustrated within<br><br>so when ur child might be suspected from adhd or other problem in learning, pls don't scold or beat them up... without understanding or proper communication.<br><br></div>
