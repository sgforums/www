In my era, grades are everythings.. When i can't concentrate, my parents brand me as lazy when they do not know my proble,.<br>Do u know the stigma for people who don't do well... <span style="text-decoration: underline;">they r branded as stupid</span>.. all of us are gifted and talented in someway but the system is moulded in such a way that they ignore people who are better off in sports, arts etc... though the system has improved much after my era... scraping away the position of schools as such... the stigma still lingers.<br><br>And to those who tink being physically or mentally handicapped are incapable and useless, pls tink again... some autistic kids are even more gifted than normal kids. Majority of ADHD are reported to be smarter but they have difficulties in some other function.<br></div></blockquote>Only you know best about yourself. No matter how much and what people say about you, it cannot change your intelligence. I understand your anguish. I have been labelled "stupid", "slow" by others when I was younger. I faced the same anguish , but I used it as my strength and motivation. However, most of these "others" people today are polytechnic or ITE graduates. Some are struggling at their undergraduate studies now. I am glad I have now established those people who used to look down on me <strong>are inferior</strong>. In fact, these people now look up to me. Do not let social pressure curb your intelligence.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Isis:</div><div class="quote_body">I cant still find anythings on adult adhd.. supportive system in singapore...</div></blockquote>I never went for those support classes. I also never hear of such things in Singapore. I think what you need is just a general support group. Typically, many Christian cell groups perform this function very well. Do not forget your close friends. They are the best people to turn to for support.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Isis:</div><div class="quote_body">N to geodome, did u take medication? I heard medication can mould ur personality whenever u took the medication.. people around u can be shocked of this personality change when u took the medication... for me, i try meditate.. it works for me gradually.. but i still have my up and downs.. i am still ponder whether i shld took the medication before my exam so that i can concentrate on studying better.</div></blockquote>I do not encourage medication. The drug for ADHD is Ritalin. Ritalin not only causes personality change, but also makes the patient more susceptible to memory lapses and psychosis. I think it is actually bad for your examination. I never took medication. For me, sugar does the trick. I read somewhere that the brain cells of ADHD people consumes glucose much faster than normal people. I eat a lot of sweets when I revise for examination or actually to sit the paper. It actually works for me.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurological disorder, usually diagnosed in childhood, which manifests itself with symptoms such as hyperactivity, forgetfulness, mood shifts, poor impulse control, and distractibility.[1] In neurological pathology, ADHD is currently considered to be a chronic syndrome for which no medical cure is available. Pediatric patients as well as adults may present with ADHD, which is believed to affect between 3-5% of the human population.[2]<br><br>Much controversy surrounds the diagnosis of ADHD, such as over whether or not the diagnosis denotes a disability in its traditional sense or simply describes a personal or neurological property of an individual. Those who believe that ADHD is a traditional disability or disorder often debate over how it should be treated, if at all. According to a majority of medical research in the United States, as well as other countries, ADHD is today generally regarded to be a non-curable neurological disorder for which, however, a wide range of effective treatments are available. Methods of treatment usually involve some combination of medication, psychotherapy, and other techniques. Many patients are able to control their symptoms over time, even without the use of medication. Some individuals who meet the diagnostic criteria of ADHD, according to the guidelines of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, do not consider themselves to be mentally ill, as the manual suggests,[3] and therefore may remain undiagnosed or, after a positive diagnosis, untreated.<br><br>ADHD is most commonly diagnosed in children. When diagnosed in adults, it is regarded as adult attention-deficit disorder (AADD). It is believed that anywhere between 30 to 70% of children diagnosed with ADHD retain the disorder as adults.<br><br>The symptoms of ADHD fall into the following two broad categories:[4]<br><br>Inattention:<br>Failing to pay close attention to details or making careless mistakes when doing schoolwork or other activities<br>Trouble keeping attention focused during play or tasks<br>Appearing not to listen when spoken to<br>Failing to follow instructions or finish tasks<br>Avoiding tasks that require a high amount of mental effort and organization, such as school projects<br>Frequently losing items required to facilitate tasks or activities, such as school supplies<br>Excessive distractibility<br>Forgetfulness<br><br>Hyperactivity-impulsive behavior<br>Fidgeting with hands or feet or squirming in seat<br>Leaving seat often, even when inappropriate<br>Running or climbing at inappropriate times<br>Difficulty in quiet play<br>Frequently feeling restless<br>Excessive speech<br>Answering a question before the speaker has finished<br>Failing to await one's turn<br>Interrupting the activities of others at inappropriate times<br><br>A positive diagnosis is usually only made if the patient presents with at least six of the above symptoms. In addition, a positive diagnosis is made if six or more of these symptoms presented before the age of seven; the symptoms usually begin to appear between the ages of four and six. Symptoms must appear consistently in varied environments. (Ex: At home, school, and in public.) One of the difficulties in diagnosis is the incidence of co-morbid conditions, especially the presence of Bipolar Disorder which is being reported at earlier ages than previously described.<br><br>Children who grow up with ADHD often continue to have symptoms as they grow into adulthood. Adults face some of their greatest challenges in the areas of self-control and self-motivation, as well as executive functioning (also known as working memory). If the patient is not treated appropriately, co-morbid conditions, such as depression, anxiety and self-medicating substance abuse may present as well. If a patient presents with such conditions as well, the co-morbid condition may be treated first, or simultaneously.<br><br>credit goes to wikipedia</div>

Hmm... A normal person is akin to a desktop with Pentium 4 (2.6GHZ) with Hyper Threading (HT) enabled, 1GB of DDR2 RAM. Someone with ADHD is akin to a desktop with Pentium 4 (3.2GHZ) with HT enabled, 256MB DDR2 RAM and partially functional keyboard and mouse. When it comes to short term memory retention, the normal desktop is better because it has more RAM. When it comes to data input, the normal desktop is better because its keyboard and mouse are fully functional. However,  when it comes to processing captured data, the ADHD desktop is better off because it has a more powerful chip. However, because of functional trade-offs, both the ADHD and normal desktops appear to be equally powerful.<br><br>Intelligence is about how well the patient comprehends the captured information. However, patients with ADHD are less adequate to capture information during communication with others (or access media) and deliver information to others.</div>
