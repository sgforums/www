It hard not to be understood by people and parents who do not know what is Adhd. it is hard to be study in singapore education system. it is hard to be myself. it hard to cope when you are a child and now an adult.. All my life as a child to teenagers, i feel life is tough. I can't concentrate. In fact i shut off easily durin class.<br><br>I aso have difficulty catching the words of others and easily forgetting how to pronounce words.<br></div></blockquote>I have ADHD. I study in a top university abroad. It is norm here to get first and upper second class honours for our examinations here. The academic competitioin is tough and close. Everyone is on the edge. Nobody will feel bad for me even though I am not able to concentrate on my lessons like most people. Like you, I also shut off during classes too. I also have difficulty catching the words of others and easily forget what others had just said. In fact, I find any speech to me longer than 10 minutes becomes audible gibberish. So what? Our intelligence has made up for our inadequancy in processing communication. It is not as bad as you think. You are smarter than you think you are. We are smarter than what others perceive, because we appear normal to them, despite our mental handicap.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Isis:</div><div class="quote_body">In my sec sc and jc, i did badly for languages despite studying hard for it. i tink i have a slight speech deficiency too.

They were my worst subjects. I admit it was frustrating that despite putting in so much time and effort, I made minimal improvement. At least, there was improvement. Instead of wasting time sulking about making hardly any improvement, rejoice that there is improvement. For every improvement we make in the language department, our capability in other departments also improve tenfolds.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Isis:</div><div class="quote_body">so when ur child might be suspected from adhd or other problem in learning, pls don't scold or beat them up... without understanding or proper communication. </div></blockquote>If only Singaporean parents are less kiasu...</div>

When i can't concentrate, my parents brand me as lazy when they do not know my proble,.<br>Do u know the stigma for people who don't do well... they r branded as stupid.. all of us are gifted and talented in someway but the system is moulded in such a way that they ignore people who are better off in sports, arts etc... though the system has improved much after my era... scraping away the position of schools as such... the stigma still lingers.<br><br>And to those who tink being physically or mentally handicapped are incapable and useless, pls tink again... some autistic kids are even more gifted than normal kids. Majority of ADHD are reported to be smarter but they have difficulties in some other function.<br><br>Marathon runner who had became blind and still continue to run a marathon. Terry Fox run despite losing one leg, start his cause against cancer by marathoning.. and a guy who lose both of his legs whom manage to conquer Mount everest.. who dare to chase his dreams and live life to the fullest..<br><br>it does not matter whether we are handicapped in some ways.. it is how we live our life..<br><br>I cant still find anythings on adult adhd.. supportive system in singapore...<br><br>N to geodome, did u take medication? I heard medication can mould ur personality whenever u took the medication.. people around u can be shocked of this personality change when u took the medication... for me, i try meditate.. it works for me gradually.. but i still have my up and downs.. i am still ponder whether i shld took the medication before my exam so that i can concentrate on studying better..<br><br></div>

My self-esteem had also beed reduced by the education system and put down by myself and parents for many years cos i don't do well for exam and end up in somewhere that i do not like.. even though im in uni now, i have diffculty concentrating in doin tutorials and studyin for exam, going for lecture, in the end i takeaway many subjects... it is hard to be hyperactive Adult.. it is hard to continue to study in uni. It hard not to be understood by people and parents who do not know what is Adhd.  it is hard to be study in singapore education system. it is hard to be myself. it hard to cope when you are a child and now an adult.. All my life as a child to teenagers, i feel life is tough. I can't concentrate. In fact i shut off easily durin class.<br><br>I aso have difficulty catching the words of others and easily forgetting how to pronounce words. In my sec sc and jc, i did badly for languages despite studying hard for it. i tink i have a slight speech deficiency too. I do not like to talk and socialise much cos i don't feel talking naturally, more like forcing the words out.. have this difficulty in talking, cos i feel that i feel a bit short of breathe, like a very slight choking whether im talking.. as a result, i get pretty short temper faster and might sound abit harsh when im just trying to make a point.. im frustrated within<br><br>so when ur child might be suspected from adhd or other problem in learning, pls don't scold or beat them up... without understanding or proper communication.<br><br></div></blockquote>I'm glad you've seek treatment. So what did the psychiatrist say?</div>
