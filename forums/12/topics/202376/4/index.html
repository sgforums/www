            <div class='col-md body'><br><br>A normal person is akin to a desktop with Pentium 4 with hyperthread disabled(2.6GHZ), 1GB of DDR2 RAM. Someone with ADHD is akin to a desktop with Pentium 4 with hyperthread enabled (3.2GHZ), 256MB DDR2 RAM and partially functional keyboard and mouse. When it comes to short term memory retention, the normal desktop is better because it has more RAM. When it comes to data input, the normal desktop is better because its keyboard and mouse are fully functional. However,  when it comes to video encoding, the ADHD desktop is better off not because it has a more powerful chip but because of the Hyperthread trade-offs. Both the ADHD and normal desktops appear to be useless no matter how much ram they have when HT were disabled.<br><br>Intelligence is about how much knowledge the patient have about the subject or situation. However, patients with ADHD are less bothered to capture information during communication with others (or access media) and deliver information to others unless its a topic of interest between both parties.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
