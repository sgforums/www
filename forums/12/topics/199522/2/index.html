            <div class='col-md body'>I emphathize with you.  when ur family situation is complicated like that, you just can't find an outlet.. u feel as if no one understands you or can help you - they either don't believe you, don't want to get involved, or don't know how to help..<br><br>I've only just pulled through a patch just as rough as yours.. I don't profess to know all your problems or be able to offer a eureka solution, but I'd like to share with u some of the things which prevented me from losing touch with myself, hopefully they will be of some use to u :<br><br>-  <strong>Get out and meet more people.. surround yourself with friends, positive people</strong> whom u can relate to (non-family matters) and enjoy doing the simplest things with.. because sometimes when family life is so complicated, you just need something simple and untainted in your life to keep your spirit up.  U could even take a part time job, get to know more ppl<br><br>-  <strong>Find a healthy hobby.. eat right.</strong>  When u look good, u feel good.  Although for me, it was internet gaming and irregular meals... I was too lazy &amp; pampered to break a sweat though I knew it would've helped  :\<br><br>-  <strong>Make a conscious effort to do a little something for someone/some good cause every now and then.   </strong>When i was stranded in Australia, i saved a cat from being put down (adopted her), donated to the RSPCA, and helped relocate other unfortunate pets.. these are small things, but it did wonders for my soul .. that little bit of love was probably my biggest refuge from all the madness that was going on around me, and it kept the self-pity away.<br><br>Well, meantime.. all the best to you, be strong <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
