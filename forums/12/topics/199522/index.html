Don't dangle around too much anymore... You would probably have to depend very much on yourself in the near future as you grow up....<br><br>Err.. Another thing which I've thought of but don't know if it's really right to tell you at this point...? Your dad... Might be on a 'drifting mode'... He might be a little confused at this point about most things... And I really don't know how long he might hold out in the future... Though it's certainly better if you know you want to go JC and subsequently where you wanna go... But you've to be FOCUSED enough this time round... Otherwise, POLY might be a better choice as you would be able to be better self-independent at a younger age... Just in case you can't rely on your dad anymore...?</div>
