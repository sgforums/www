When it's a stranger, it couldn't matter less what they think of you. And depending on their reaction, you have the option to become close, or run like crazy, and never talk to them again. But I've done both with my sad stories about my past, too. And if you've got a story, you should share it as part of who you are.</span></p>

               Who knows what you go through others may not been through before, or understand if you choose not to speak up.........

              <p>Echoing the above responses, I would also like to add that while others may know what that person has gone through, they would never know what that person have felt. And they, who didn't experience those things first-handed, tend to simplify the problem and just shake it off as the person feeling 'emo'. This aggravates the feeling of &lt;no one (bothers to) understands me&gt;, leading to a further draw-back syndrome.</p>
              <p>To TS response, expressing sadness/sympathy isn't what they want. From my experience, they just want someone to listen to them and give them a hug. Hugs are infectious.</p>
              <p>If you feel that you can't get through their tough exterior, it is because they have suffered a great deal and have locked themselves up. Time and sincerity will shake the spirit.</p>
              <p>To leave off,</p>

              <p>For people who is very close, like wifey, can still talk about sensitive problems.</p>
              <p>Beyond that, no point. Like what Sky_Blue says, others tend to simplify the problem without understanding the issues related to it.</p>
              <p>As an example, I cannot get a job (because of a host of reasons, FT, Cheaper alternatives, old age, etc.). But people will just simplify it and says "don't be so picky, lower your expectations". But does it work that way in real life. Only when the other party experiences it himself/herself, then only the full impact of the situation can be understood.</p>
              <p>But my wifey will understand me.</p>

              <p>I know a person who used to complain his problems out. Then his girlfriend tell him to shut up because she can't stand his complaining. To her, she regard it as a sign of his inability to take lead and she began to insult him and say he is useless, gutless, etc. So he shut up.</p>
              <p>Then later on, she ask him why he never tell her his problems and never trust her with sharing the burden of his problems.</p>
              <p>In two words, he told me "vomit blood".</p>

              <p>Because you don't know who you are talking to. Is this person - whom 
                  you plan to confide in - going to hear and/ guide you? Is he or her a 
                  trustworthy person? And is it done in a timely fashion where he or she 
                  is ready to listen?</p>
              <p>Secondly, the stigma. Nowadays, you are 
                  automatically considered "a problem" if you voice out what's been 
                  keeping you down. I understand that most people are living life on a 
                  hectic pace and the last thing they want is to be bogged down by someone
                   who, inadvertently transfers his worries onto you. It's tiring, it can 
                  be off-putting at certain points to hear someone out when you yourself 
                  are preoccupied with your own things and/ don't have a 
                  marathon-of-an-energy and patience to deal with such complex issues that
                   involve emotions.</p>
