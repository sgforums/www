              <p><br>You should not think of your depression as a problem. Depression is what you feel because of these external influences. If everything was going great in your life right now, great car, great job, great salary, sweetest girlfriend, your depression wouldn't even be present.</p>
              <p>Depression is a disorder that makes everything even worse. Don't think of this as a main problem because without the other problems, this wouldn't be a problem at all. It's just a multiplier effect.</p>
              <p>I know you feel sad about your breakup, was the breakup over something either of you did? If it was her fault and you initiated the breakup, have you thought about calling her up anyway? If it was your fault... I don't know not much hope for this relationship, just wait for another...</p>

              <p>I have not really felt any better. Just living each day as it goes, its still the same for me. I had to wait till 24th June to see the psychologist.</p>
              <p>Hope I can last till then.</p>

              <p>Hi all,</p>
              <p>I have lost it. I am suffering from a double blow right now.</p>
              <p>I have depression and my gf just broke up with me today.</p>
              <p>This double pain is makeing my heart so heavy, so painful. How I wish this was a nightmare and I would wake up to see its all false.</p>
              <p>My heart feels so hurting. I could not even do anything today. I have lost my apetite. I just ate a piece of pizza with a glass of water (Normally I would have eaten at least a few pieces).</p>
              <p>I do not have the mood to do anything. I do not wish to go back to work tomorrow. I only had a couple hours of rest yesterday because of my depression.</p>
              <p>I feel so tired. Can I just sleep forever?</p>
