              <p>Hi all,</p>
              <p>I have lost it. I am suffering from a double blow right now.</p>
              <p>I have depression and my gf just broke up with me today.</p>
              <p>This double pain is makeing my heart so heavy, so painful. How I wish this was a nightmare and I would wake up to see its all false.</p>
              <p>My heart feels so hurting. I could not even do anything today. I have lost my apetite. I just ate a piece of pizza with a glass of water (Normally I would have eaten at least a few pieces).</p>
              <p>I do not have the mood to do anything. I do not wish to go back to work tomorrow. I only had a couple hours of rest yesterday because of my depression.</p>
              <p>I feel so tired. Can I just sleep forever?</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>I am facing two things at once. My depression and my break up. Depression is causing alot of problems for me. Add in the break up with puts further pressure on my mind and heart, its really tiring.</p>
              <p>I have never felt so tired before. I have never cried a few times in a day being an adult. I feel like a zombie now with no mood for anything.</p>

              <p>Yes, you are right. I need emotional support now. Alot of them. But I am sad to say, I could not find much from my best friends. I called 3 of them. 2 of them could not comfort me and told me what normal people would say like move on, there is life, be strong. I dont really find emotional support from these. 1 other who is slightly better but was busy with things so could not talk to me much.</p>

              <p>when you go back to work, just take the work lightly and don't put too much effort in it, if you do.....you'll feel worse. you should feel down and sian for a couple of weeks and then it will gradually get better.</p>
              <p>just let time do the healing, slowly but surely.</p>
              <p>i mean, come on.....at least you've a gf....a lot of people in their mid-twenties like me never even farking have a gf before, so you should seriously cheer up based on that alone! <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>

I called 3 of them. 2 of them could not comfort me and told me what normal people would say like move on, there is life, be strong. I dont really find emotional support from these. 1 other who is slightly better but was busy with things so could not talk to me much.</p>
              <p>how u know u suffer from depression in the first place ? have seen any doctor before? i think u r just feeling stress but not depression...</p>
              <p>what u friends said to you r the correct things..most of ppl will said that too...but u r right they have their own life and you claim that u need someone by u side in order to justify u presence..that;s what i think u said u need someone by u side...i not sure how close u and u family member are..maybe its time to talk to your family member and i;m sure they will by u side all the time....</p>
              <p>u need some moment to settle the toks in u mind now...i advice u to talk to u doctor if u think u can;t control u stress now and pls restrain uself from work..take a long break to find u own soul back first...</p>
