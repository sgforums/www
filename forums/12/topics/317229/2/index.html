              <p>TS, i've learnt that the best motivation is from within your heart.. None of anyone that u know even your very best fren can help u obtain your very own motivation. Never feel like your fren doesnt concern bout u, cuz they cant help much in this except for giving u the same advice as u heard from others.</p>
              <p>U just neeed to know, that you're not alone in this world having all those painful experience. Some are worst than your condition now that u couldnt even think bout. Dont spend time alone doing nothing cuz that will make matters worst.. try to find something to get busy or get a comedy or do your hobby stuffs. PLay game or watching porn will be good too. Tough life but once u know how to handle, its a piece of cake in some duration.</p>

              <p>In moments like this, when we should be at our strongest, inevitably we feel at our weakest. It isn't her fault that she treats you like a friend, and it isn't your fault if you misconstrued it as something more. But think about it this way, off hand, that if she were to become your girlfriend, you wouldn't be comfortable since if she could be like that to you, if she goes out with her friends and they are males, she could behave like that with them as well and send out wrong messages. What you have is freedom, choice, and a healthy bank account. The only thing standing in the way is your mind. Consider carefully if certain sacrifices are indeed worth making. Its not the easiest thing in the world, but do try.</p>
              <p>For depression, please refrain as much as you can from taking anti-depressants. Most people do get hooked on it and rely too much on chemical solutions rather than develop a strength of their own. On the extreme, if you feel suicidal, think about why you like her and if that aspect is really worth us losing a person like you. I have no doubt you're nice.</p>

              <p>To me, every sacrifice is worth it even if the rest of the world does not think so. Even if it does take my everything and I end up with nothing, I would still feel worth it because simply I love her.</p>
              <p>I did not take any medicine for the past few days as I also know I did not want to rely on it. Anyway, I do not have anti-depressants to take. I only have some kind of a relaxant which helps me sleep better at night. Doesnt work as I will still wake up in the middle of the night.</p>
              <p>I like her because she is her. She is unique and special. She loves her parents, siblings very much and is helpful. I like her for who she is.</p>
              <p>I place myself as 2nd importance because she is 1st. But am I really doing so?</p>
              <p>Thanks for saying I am nice but being nice is of no use because nice guys finish last and no one appreciates them the way they are. You say say its false but after what I been through, its a fact for me.</p>

              <p>I understand what you're saying. I'm a hopeless romantic as well and I sacrifice everything for my partner. Its not easy but when you do, you feel somewhat at your best even though it leaves you high and dry. But these are the consequences, and I have no doubt nice guys do finish last.</p>
              <p>You might be upset perhaps because you can't understand why even after all those immense sacrifices, the relationship still ended even though you thought it never could since you've been giving so much?</p>

              <p><br>My mind is going crazy at this rate. I might just go nuts if this goes on.</p>
              <p>I do not know what to do. Should I just give up and move on?</p>
              <p>Should I change myself and then chase her back to show her my sincereity?</p>
              <p>Since nice guys finish last, why bother to be one?</p>
              <p>Yes I do not understand why? Why do people fail to see how much you have put in and be touched by it or get affected by it?</p>
