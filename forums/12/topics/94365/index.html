Would you like to be called a ji*x or a fcuking b*tch who tries to snatch a married man? Get alive and face with reality.. He is married.. It Does not matter if he likes or does not like his wife.. You coming into the picture and trying to snatch him away, is something which is not to be done..<br><br>Be it he is attached or married.. he as another half... If he is single, by all means.. no one is stopping you. Get it into your thick skull.!!</div>
