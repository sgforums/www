            <div class='col-md body'>As some of you may know, my maid ran away recently. So now the issue outstanding is to cancel the maid's work permit and hand over the passport and get a clearance documentation signed. Sounds simple ya ? And my dad had to blow things out of proportion.<br><br>The maid agent was scheduled to arrive at our place last night at about 8pm to process the above mentioned. But there was no news of him until 10.45pm when he finally called. My dad picked up the phone, and raised his voice, saying 'Settle what ?? Its so late already !!'. What we all didnt know what that the agent was just outside our front gate.<br><br>We opened the gate, and my mum tried to be nice to the agent to explain that my dad has this booming voice whom everyone misunderstands as him screaming. But the agent then went on to make hell lot of noise, and kinda dragged everyone down, including me, who was standing at the front porch, with my hands on my hips, the way i sometimes do .. Agent said "Even your son wants to beat me liao. Look at the way he is standing !"<br><br>I went on to shout at him "Do you know what you are saying ??!! Be reasonable and grow up !"<br><br>The agent was a good friend of my dad in the past. They were ex-colleagues. And my dad, upon hearing the stupid comments made by that agent about me, then went into rage and asked me to call the police !<br><br>The agent in end, left without settling anything.<br><br>Now, this whole incident could have been prevented if the one who answered the phone right from the beginning was not my dad. On my part, I shouldnt have shouted back at the agent when he accused me of being an 'ah beng' but that remark of his was just too much. There was so much tension in the end, i could not sleep at night.<br><br>Now, the thing's dangling in the air, and day by day, mum's paying the maid levy for nothing.<br><br>A little backtrack on why we are all pissed with the agent from start :<br><br>- We paid 4 months upfront of maid levy + salary to the agent<br>- Maid does not get payment bcos she is paying back the agency for sending her to work in Singapore. In all, she will work in Singapore without any pay for 8 months. This is the standard guideline.<br>- Maid ran away only after serving 2 months, hence 2 more months outstanding.<br>- Agent called up and located the maid. Maid proclaims that dad 'screamed at her' and she cannot take it.<br>- Agent wants my mum to pay for her air ticket home when the fact is there was 2 months outstanding on his side.<br><br>The agent's a real bastard to this point. But mum's idea was to just settle this thing once and for all, take it as give that 300 dollars of airfare as a donation.<br><br>Though I dun like this idea of hers, but I'd do anything to make her feel at peace.<br><br>Sigh, sometimes I dunno how much more shit I can take.<br></div>
