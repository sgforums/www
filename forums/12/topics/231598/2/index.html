In his eyes, his family is first.  I have not felt like family.<br><br>I only wish to have my own place and peace.<br>I am thinking too. What should I do. I wanted to get my own place. I only want to be able to go home everyday and be happy and get rest. Not hear kids and people scream and see the house like a pig sty all sticky and dirty because everyone is waiting for me to clean up. No one wash up after themselves and leaves a pile of dished in the sink until you have no clean utensils to use. Or go home to see the kitchen sink clogged once again for 3 days and no one bothered to unclog it until I am home. OR have sh!t stans on the toilet floor or by the side of the toilet bowl hardened to a crust and you need a jet to soften it before scrubbing it.  Or find a pile of used tissue under the coffee table with a dish cloth soaking wet there for one week making the living room smell like the rubbish chute. Or that they dump food into the sink and didn't flush it that it rotted there for 3 days and then the whole kitchen smelled like sewage. All these happened and is still happening. No joke.<br><br>The sad part is, we only moved in for 3 months. The bad joke is that I want to move out. The worse part is, I work super OT everyday to avoid going home and avoid all these people because I cannot stand them.<br><br></div></blockquote>Welcome to my mom's world. But my dad saw my grandma for what she was worth because of the way she used to treat my mom, my sibling and I.<br><br>That is why I will never date a mommy's boy. That is why I will never give up working because money will be the power I hold sway over MILs.<br><br>Did you pay for the house in part? If I were you , I will let the old lady know she is living in my place out of MY GENEROSITY because I am the co-OWNER of the house and I paid for it in part. I will also let her know I have nothing against her staying as long as she follows the guidelines of being A GUEST in a person's house.<br><br>If she is not happy , she can go back to the house of PEOPLE WHO WILL NOT WELCOME HER BACK AT ALL.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A tip for you if you are childless. Get a son in asap. Sure change of attitude .<br><br>You can also do it this way to make the unwelcome invaders look damn bad while u look good .<br><br>Be very nice to her even if you cannot stand her.<br><br>Put ideas in her head to take money for babysitting and anything else there is she can claim money off the other side. They will look bad if she asks and they refuse.<br><br>Take her out and do something nice. Show how much better a DIL you are.<br><br>Whatever you do , don't be mean to her if your husband is attached to mommy.<br><br>Do it for 1 month or more  but no more than 3 months. Just be nice and smile.<br><br>Find a diplomatic way of showing what kind of mess they do to you and still smile and be nice.<br><br>Whatever you do - do not lose your temper. Just be very diplomatic and smile and be nice<br><br>Then when she starts softening up to you , that is the time to make life difficult for the other side. Your hubby will also be happy if his mother dearest get along withyou.<br><br>When they bring their brats over and they destroy things, cry in front of her and say you cannot take the destruction of those brats anymore. No matter what , people are people ...crying will make them melt but don't do too much.<br><br>You will be on the stronger ground of  getting rid of those brats and their family from your house instead of doing no favours to yourself.<br><br></div>

I never had toys, or new clothes. I studied hard to get what I have today and I owed no one but my parents.

It is his family - he can give them HIS money but you are not  obliged to although you might have married into his.<br><br>MAKE YOUR HUBBY HELP OUT and clean the sh<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>it , if both of you are earning the wages to pay 50/50 on the house. I never believe in the BS of woman doing housework when the woman is also paying for the house through work.<br><br>If your MIL say again that you are avoiding her, tell your hubs yes and tell him why. You are not making him choose between his wife and mother - just make it clear to him that you just want to give a reason why you avoid her (so to preserve the peace in the house) and expect him to support you in that aspect of avoidance especially if she is making your life a misery.<br><br>Next time if they ask for money - say loudly in front of your MIL - ahhh SIL , what pretty dress you have .....waaah GOT BRAND one ....must be worth a few hundred ...even I cannot afford that . That is only the first step - then do it repeatedly.<br><br>When the eldest ask your husband for money , you just say aaa ....I thought you are doing so well . Got money to buy one shirt for a hundred bucks. Make sure your MIL is there to hear it.<br><br>I don't know what is going on so I cannot help you much in that aspect. I only know my grandma backs off from using me for info against my mom because of what I say to her in very sarcastic but diplomatic terms. She backs off from my mom now .<br><br></div>

I know and I am sometimes bitter that I have to accept this lot and give way to this extend. Yet they are all ungrateful and it all seems like I am expected to do. Unfortunately she's not that old and she's very into eating bird's nest, ginseng, and all that tonics. She had brought up her oldest son and DIL with their kids to never touch overnight food and so I have become the trash can. The DIL even had the gall to pass us frozen food that had been overdue in her freezer. MIL made us eat it then tell us that its overdue food. The B*****.

She might accuse me of aggreviating any of her aches and pains. Anyways, I am in pain most of the time myself and no one help me or pity me. I walk with a limp and most of my joints are really aching. Why should I extend myself anymore for her. She's in better health than I will ever be. She never asked her other DIL to do anything for her - in fact she is always doing things for her willingly and serve the ungrateful b***** and next turn around to complain about her to us.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wow, your MIL seems like a terrible person to get along with. What were you thinking when you married her son?<br><br>Or did she only become like this after your marriage?<br><br>Kind of reminded me bout my ex's mum. Except that she'll be super nice to me in the presence of his father, and pretty sarcastic to me in his absence.<br><br>In the long run, I couldn't take it anymore cos to me, a marriage is definitely not about 2 persons but of 2 families.<br><br>I'd rather she tell me if she has any issues with me, rather den blowing hot and cold cos it's just so hypocritical.<br><br>And no matter what, dun contemplate suicide, cos it was your family who raised you and they are the ones who will be hurt, not your MIL, so why let her have the last laugh?<br><br>In my opinion, if your husband cannot empathise and understand you, preferring instead to side his Mum, den you're better off without him.<br><br>Like you mentioned, you have the financial ability and I believe, the emotional capacity to be independant, free from the clutches of your evil MIL and SIL.<br><br>Do NOT, contemplate bringing a son into the house ASAP cos judging by the way things are, you dunnoe if the MIL has a preference for boys or gers and the sex of the baby is definitely not something that you can decide on.<br><br>Don't bring a child into an unhappy family cos in the long run, it'll affect the child.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I saw how my MIL took care of the kids and I saw the kinds of things she teach them.  I think I rather get paid help - because she teaches the wrong values and encourages the wrong behaviour. Then I also see how the MIL neglects the children and spends hours on the phone gossiping. Then claims she is so tired and cannot do any housework. She does not wash up after herself and leaves trash all over the floor, under tables, in drawers and then there would be a stench of rotting things. Then you will know there is something not right so I had spend lots of time hunting down the rubbish dumps she created all over the house. My husband told me my MIL cannot change her behaviour. I told him my dad is 70+, his mom is only 50. My dad can change his behaviour why she is not capable.  She's just a old B**** who refused to change and wants status quo with a maid to serve her.<br><br>Besides, I know my MIL love that bratty grand daughter and constantly bullies the grandson. She talks endlessly of the tricks and the naughty things, rude acts, and bad behaviours so proudly like the girl is so intelligent.  The children learnt from their parents and grandmother to treat me like a maid. So she comes into my house and act as if I was never there. She quickly learnt from her grandmother to throw things around and have her bad temper as well. When I have dinner she always want a share of my food and climbs all over me and around the chair. So sometimes, I give up and let her play.<br><br>One time she refused to listen to anyone and was playing on a chair. The chair toppled. Anyways, she took the hint from the grandmother because she made all those senseless talk and noise until the child got the hint to cry. She really knows how to milk people, of course cried hard to gain as much sympathy as possible and then for the next couple of days got her way in whatever she wanted. After the incident, the girl had the gall to say that her daddy never took care of her therefore she fell. The grandmother was so proud the girl her age learn to blame her parents for her own fault.  From then onwards, whenever she fell down, she would blame it on an adult. Actually no one can prevent the accident because she was such a stubborn brat and would do the opposite just to spite people, she was up and down, and playing around the chair. She's always doing things like this just to show off because she gets praised by her grandmother that she is so smart. Then like her grandmother, she would show everyone her injuries and then keep telling you that someone didn't take care of her therefore she fell or got hurt. Mind you, this is a 4 year old I am talking about.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I cannot speak freely about his family because like what shinta observed, the guys are used to the family and will never see the things they do as wrong. My husband told me he's used to dirty house, with smells and he finds clean floors and fresh air uncomfortable.  It was seen as driving a wedge between him and myself and he would take the side of his family. I was seen as spoilt and demanding and adding troubles to his life. I point out some things but i was seen as whining and criticizing.<br><br>Yea, what was I thinking when I married him.<br><br>I have to start watching what I say and how I say things.<br><br>the MIL sometimes would be sane but what should I know. All I know is that this woman tells me not to go to any beach because there is tsunami, not to go tour because other countries are dangerous, not to fly because planes can crash and etc. She cannot accept a different opinion and she cannot accept I do not do things or like the things she do. She's a bit***y control freak. She likes fann wong and praise her as if she's her daughter but I asked her if she knows anything about fann. She cannot say anything but that she is beautiful and so she likes her.   She's shallow, small minded, obnoxious, boastful, stupid and hypocrite. She always speaks as if her son drives a BMW and have a 10K job and she does not know the stupid things she say start people sniggering.  She's the type of aunty you met on the bus that you cannot stand. During my wedding, my sister heard some things she said and come by and ask if she knows what she's saying is an embarassing, baseless and stupid. She also asked why the MIL face so black like she's paying for all these. I told her not to pay any attention to her.<br><br>My neighbour is moving away. I didn't think much of it and didn't always run into them. She came by one day to say that the neighbours are stuck up people and never greeted her. They are so arrogant they always pretend never to see her (I know why because she always dirty the corridor and throw her rubbish at the lift landing or along the corridor. No one on that level does this so I am not surprise no one like her.). She also claim the neighbours are jealous of her because she has so many grandkids and that they are childless and so cannot stand it. They are unhappy that the children make so much noise. All these are the stupid things that come out from her mouth - nothing is fact, just her shallow, stupid mind coming up these ideas about other people. I cannot imagine what made her think of things this way. Even if I am a happy person, listening to this sort of crap everyday, I will also become depressed and negative. I dare not tell my husband because I know its nonsense. I just felt that I would love to buy over the neighbour's house.<br><br></div>
