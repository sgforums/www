            <div class='col-md body'>of my plant cause those bratty kids in my house pull it out and and almost pull out another plant.  I only discovered the death in the morning when I saw my plant missing from the pot. The brat's grand mother and parents pretended nothing happened and no one apologised and no one made the kids apologise.<br><br>I have since moved the plants into my room for save keeping because the house, even though I paid for it Never felt like mine. Some people might just say that its just a F***ing plant and why get so worked up over it. So does it mean that another life form is lesser than us? Does it mean that brats being young and do not know the value of life is allowed to pull out all my plants just because these are "lower" life forms?<br><br>My plant is dead and someone knew it be decided to hide the secret from me the whole time till I discovered it myself. The person cleaned up the place and shifted the plants so that it seemed nothing happened. Hide things so that I would not notice. So that person is an accomplice to the crime, condoning the act.<br><br>The pain of my dead plant. Of my hard work, erased by the act of 2 brats. 2 Brats who I have to let them into my house because I gave way and allowed their grandmother to stay with me because otherwise she has no home at all. And also because she could not stay with her oldest son whose kids she looks after because they would quarrel. The selfish wife would not want to stay with her. I had to put up with the fact that I cannot choose another location for the sake of the brats, their parents and my husband. I have to put up with the old woman whose mouth always say sh!tty things even though she had taken her 3 refuge. I have to put up with ill bred kids because their grandmother takes care of them free of charge. I have to let the kids parents over because they do not want to dirty their kitchen and so do not cook but its alright to dirty mine and after all I am treated like a maid because I will always clean up after them after the kids spit food on the floor and cause the whole house to have ants. In the whole house, my things are only placed in my room because I know the kind of hurtful statements the old woman will say, the sons will say.<br><br>I feel like I do not have any right in this house even though I paid for it and paid everything these people use.<br>I am thinking of moving out. I am sick of these people.<br>I mourn for my plants.<br><br></div>

But the only room I stay in is my room . The rest of the house does not have my things because my MIL will have an opinion about it. She didn't want those plants and actually tried to get my husband to get rid of them.<br>She had always thought that its her house, so she would do drill holes and such things without telling us. Then she would open her mouth and accuse me of cooking bad things for her and the family, or said I never take care of my husband and asked him to fetch me. All of which I had not done. She is the sort who likes fann wong because she things this woman is smart and beautiful (she obviously never hear the interview by BBC) and hates adrian pang because he is adrian pang. She would tell me to cook this and that and then commented its not tasty or I am unhygenic or come by and micro-manage. She would eat and feed the kids and drop food crumps all over the house and blame my cleaning up was the reason there are ants. She would also claim that my scrubbing the tiles of algae causing the tiles to be damaged or that I am causing the wood furniture to rot if I place wet cloth over it.  When I cooks great food, or buy fruits, she would eat it all, or bring the whole pot to her ungrateful daughter in law (the selfish one who gave birth to 2 brats) and feed her family. I would have to eat bread for dinner. I brought home 2 japanese permissions, the next day, it disappeared. Not a single scrap for me at all. Not a single bite.<br><br>I have been accused of so many things and so much wrong doings I have stopped talking to her.<br><br></div>

In his eyes, his family is first.  I have not felt like family.<br><br>I only wish to have my own place and peace.<br>I am thinking too. What should I do. I wanted to get my own place. I only want to be able to go home everyday and be happy and get rest. Not hear kids and people scream and see the house like a pig sty all sticky and dirty because everyone is waiting for me to clean up. No one wash up after themselves and leaves a pile of dished in the sink until you have no clean utensils to use. Or go home to see the kitchen sink clogged once again for 3 days and no one bothered to unclog it until I am home. OR have sh!t stans on the toilet floor or by the side of the toilet bowl hardened to a crust and you need a jet to soften it before scrubbing it.  Or find a pile of used tissue under the coffee table with a dish cloth soaking wet there for one week making the living room smell like the rubbish chute. Or that they dump food into the sink and didn't flush it that it rotted there for 3 days and then the whole kitchen smelled like sewage. All these happened and is still happening. No joke.<br><br>The sad part is, we only moved in for 3 months. The bad joke is that I want to move out. The worse part is, I work super OT everyday to avoid going home and avoid all these people because I cannot stand them.<br><br></div>
