            <div class='col-md body'>Even though he had hurt you once and now he says he regretted it and wants to come back to you and you both are now couples, you should at least have some faith in him. He is not a complete jerk, I believe. Flirts CAN turn over a new leaf but BE WARY. Don't just think that "Oh, he love me! Never mind le, don't care!!" and don't bother about where he go.<br>I suggest you two have a man-to-man talk and YOU tell him what you feel. That you are uneasy because that you are scared he will cheat on you again. Just let it be heard. It's alright. He IS your boyfriend after all!!<br><br>Anyway, give him a CHANCE. Not all flirts can never change. =]</div>

Meaningless.<br><br>When you patch back with him, the conundrum that initially CAUSED you to leave this relationship reluctantly, didn't vanish. In fact, the residue of that virulent factor remained acrimoniously. It wasn't resolved previously, nothing will change then. You are just reiterating the exact behaviour you are exuding prior before the first break up - suspicious, having constant mistrust and becoming vindictive.<br><br>Flirt will eventually change - but generally, this relationship will not 'survive long enough' to enjoy the transformation. In fact, if you are the chosen catalysis for his transformation, he will only change with his next partner. This is the Karmic Law of Cosmic Love because even if he does change overnight - you will be mortally wounded and would be too overwhelmed with fatigue to continue this relationship.<br><br>My dad was a player. Woman loved him as he is the fun Sagittarius guy. It took him about FORTY years of lifespan to have <span style="font-style: italic;">some </span>understanding of marriage, family and the good woman he married. Thank God my mum is a simple woman. I accentuate... so fcuking simple that I reckon that her sort of simplicity is almost extinct in sg.<br><br>Can you be that simple... that it REVERSE your power to understand and to know? When a toddler hands you one hundred dollars willingly, it is because the child is too young to know the value of money. The child wouldn't even flinch when he has given you a hundred buck. Can you be like that child?<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">[b]Because you cannot be hurt by things you don't understand. </span></strong><br><br>Love is not about feeling it emotionally and thinking that it is a means to an end. It has to be substantial, measured by the degree your Love is coming from. All your nonchalant attitude and ill-treating is a sign of wanting attention from him. You are being defensive, yet yearning for his affection. Gradually, this confusion will bring another conclusion to your relationship with him.<br><br>And if you accept another patch cycle, you repeat that sad story over again.<br><br>P.S: Never turn your shoulder over and walked where you have travelled. Turning back doesn't heal our scars; it reminded us of it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers    [/b]</blockquote><span style="color: red;"></span>WELL SAID, WELL SAID!!</div>

I work hard to let her have trust in me again, and guess how long it takes? nearly 6 mths.
