Whilst I can understand that it is difficult to trust him, expecting him to grovel at your feet &amp; beg you everytime you ask for a breakup is kinda unreasonable.

Tell him you NEED reassurance, &amp; a basis to trust him again.  Then let HIM do the work.<br><br>BUT, you only patched things up with him because you were BORED.

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear BlueBerryJam,<br><br>Firstly I want to say....YUMMM...I love blueberry jam. ermmm right. back to topic. u mention...leopards never change its spots. well you are right. i was once exactly in your shoes. well.. the opposite of cos. im a guy. and the gal was a two timing whore as well. the first time she did it, i forgave her. she cried. i cried. end up both cried. promise not to do it again. so we patch things up. but after all that, like u i became to grow suspicious of what she has been doing behind my back. countless times ive said i wanna break up during quarrels. but she never wanted it. all her denial a year later seems futile. i found out she has another lover. i grew furious demanding an answer. she cried. i cried. end up both cried. Yet after all that i forgave her.<br><br>So after that, i remain who am i. remain suspicious over this whore leopard whom i loved so much. what can i do right. its the same process. we had fun times. we had bad times. we quarrelled. i ask for break up countless times again. she denied. and AGAIN one year later she found another secret which i found out unintentionally. For that i decided to be strong and move on. tell her goodbye. change hp number. and lead new life. imagine 3 times she betrayed me. all these in my relatinship with her for 3 years. tats like one year once. So anyway my jam, what i wanna say is...forget abt him. let my dealings with a person like tat before advise u a lil bit more of wat u shld do aite.<br>of cos.... whatever u do...follow ur head ok. not ur heart. u will be hurt more.<br><br>cheers....<br><br>little mhcampboy   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br></div>
