Imagine a candle flame sealed in by a bottle - It is like denying air to flame... eventually the flame will sniff out - which is exactly what possessiveness can do to a relationship.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>You said each of them broke with you because of this aspect that chokes them: You realise it too - this is something you have to work through yourself. If not, history will repeat itself over and over again. You said the former relation is due to possessiveness, which causes its destruction - therefore it shows that little is done to this characteristic of yours in the past.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>The last relation you did try to work things out - but it didn't turn out the way you wanted it to be. Let me say that it is a good effort on your own part, trying to get out of this cycle. To start and attempt something is always a good start, regardless of your result. Do not let it falter your attempt to do so in the future - because each relation, you will grow and mature - until when finally the right person who will appreciate the way you are and your improved self. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You can lose the relation, but never the lesson learned.<br><br>Cheers.</div>

Some guys like me likes having their girls being possessive of them i.e. not letting her guy go out clubbing, looking at other girls. It shows that the girls loves the guy and doesnt want to leave him. Can a relationship go far if the girl allows her guy to go anywhere he wants, meet up with a girl anytime etc? If u want a LT relationship, try to be a possessive.If you like this guy and haven learn to love him vice versa for the guy, try to lax abit with that guy..<br><br>Love Always,<br>Your Resident Master</div>

Some guys like me likes having their girls being possessive of them i.e. not letting her guy go out clubbing, looking at other girls. It shows that the girls loves the guy and doesnt want to leave him. Can a relationship go far if the girl allows her guy to go anywhere he wants, meet up with a girl anytime etc? If u want a LT relationship, try to be a possessive.If you like this guy and haven learn to love him vice versa for the guy, try to lax abit with that guy..<br><br>Love Always,<br>Your Resident Master</div></blockquote>my sentiments exactly. i like my girl to possess me!</div>

A doctor asked a patient to take a medication... 1 tablet a day... As the day passed, the patient is feeling much better... He wishes for a faster recovery so he took 5 tablets at one go...

A person's mentality and demands on relationship(s) would probably change with his/ her age and what he/ she experiences... Especially true for women cause they tends to be the more affectionate creature....<br><br>So your bf has a certain form of mentality... In fact different people probably have different characters and mentality with some characteristics which would overlap between 2 different people... Your bf has a certain belief and you ANOTHER? He could be genuinely having that form of mentality or just making up something to excuse himself... In a relationship, ALWAYS choose to TRUST as far as you can.... If you think that he's NOT trust-worthy, you'll either have to live with it or LEAVE it.... Can try and change him if you want to, but most people are not open to that....</div>
