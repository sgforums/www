Romance life as top priority is very hard to do so in the current fast paced moving society such as Singapore.<br><br>Youngest age for romance made possible would be secondary school.<br><br>But so if romance was to start from there, how many people end up marrying their sec sch lovers? Ie if they were the right one.<br><br>Chances are very few nowadays...<br><br>I know many sgaporeans who have to leave their love ones behind and go to UK, USA, aussie, HK, even New Zealand to study. I would say 60% of all LDRs fails miserably.<br><br>Those to stay in Singapore, have to cope with going to a different school or courses, when they enter the work force, priorities in life start to change again.<br><br>Ie the saying those who wear their hearts on their sleeves tend to get hurt more, then those who keep it deeper in their pockets.<br><br>To alot of people, careers, school, work, takes first priority... more so for guys than to girls.<br><br>Its possible to keep romance life as top priority, but in reality, you have to please your parents, friends, colleagues, bosses... yourself.... wah you can't please everyone!!! haha...
