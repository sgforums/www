              <p>Hi guys, erm i hav dis problem. 2 days ago, i confessed to the girl i like, and she kinda didnt give an ans, so i asked her to think about it and tell me the next day. So last night, after a concert, i walked her home, and then asked her, and she still said she asked me what kind of ans i wan, so i said" i dont know"( i noe im srsly very stupid), so she started walking slower and slower until we reached the lift, and then she waved goodbye to me, and so i waved back while the doors were closing.</p>
              <p>After that, i got a text from her, saying that she is really sorry as she didnt expect it, and that we'll be better friends. So i asked her do i have a chance, and her reply was, " i dno, coze i cant imagine the 2 of us together."</p>
              <p>End of story, so until now, i have been feeling very very sad, i cried last night but didnt want to tell her as it will bother her. I dun wna trouble her anymore, but at the same time i really want to be with her, what shod i do?</p>

              <p>You might still have a chance. Exphasize on the word 'might'. I'd suggest you don't think too much about it, and don't hope or expect anything. Consider it as gone for now. The more you expect something, the lower the chances of it happening.</p>
              <p>Consider her as a friend for now and continue being nice to her because you might never know what would happen next. In the mean time, don't think about her and distract yourself with something that can cheer you up. No point being so upset about it.</p>
