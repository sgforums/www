Personally, I believe that there're REASONS for their individual existence and MUCH to learn....<br><br>I'm born in a Taoist family too... Like you, me too wondered about those rituals &amp; statues.... I thought little of them until I came about the 'WAY of TAO'.... Sort of like the 'theories' behind those 'practicals'... I should say that my preception of TAOISM changed GREATLY after that... Made me realised how IGORANT I was.... I believe that MOST religions have various 'angles' to them.... It just depends on HOW you're introduced them and how you SEE them and intend to understand (or avoid?) them....<br><br>Larren.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  My mum used to tell me the same kinda CRAPS... And when I questioned her further, she usually FAILED to answer my questions... But that doesn't neccesarily means that there're no answer to my query? I've realised that sometimes we'll just have to find the answers ourselves....<br><br>And one more thing? No matter if you choose to believe a religion or not, give a little RESPECT to other's BELIEF if you want some respect in return...? That's all I have to say for now...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

But then, besides seeing religion as something that people turn to when they, for example, have problems... I don't know what else. Like some Chinese (I don't know which religions), instead of taking practical action, they go to temples and pray to the deities. And similarly, Christians pray for God to aid them in helping to solve the problem. Maybe in a way this is good because with the hope found in religion, it's easier to do the things you want to do because you have something like.. I guess something like a guarantee, or something that puts your mind more at ease...<br><br>My view towards life has always been: if I encounter problems, the only thing, or rather the only person who can solve the problems is myself, regardless of whatever external factors there are.<br><br>I welcome more comments.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><br>Yeah okay ha so you agree with me that my view was narrow minded. But then, besides seeing religion as something that people turn to when they, for example, have problems... I don't know what else. Like some Chinese (I don't know which religions), instead of taking practical action, they go to temples and pray to the deities. And similarly, Christians pray for God to aid them in helping to solve the problem. Maybe in a way this is good because with the hope found in religion, it's easier to do the things you want to do because you have something like.. I guess something like a guarantee, or something that puts your mind more at ease...<br><br>My view towards life has always been: if I encounter problems, the only thing, or rather the only person who can solve the problems is myself, regardless of whatever external factors there are.<br><br>I welcome more comments.<br></blockquote>Well, i do know some people( I often go for a saturday City Harvest Cell group meeting, though i'm not technically a christian) who lived very productive lives. They got lots of friends, very enthusatic, score pretty good grades and have a very optimistic view on life.<br><br>Though it is true that some people seek religion for salvation when there are something crappy with their lives, most seek a higher purpose and reason to exist. They find it i dunno more fufilling in believing that all the good things happen to them because of a reason(Being faithful enough to God to deserve it).<br><br>But though i am an self acknowledged free thinker, there are still things to learn to learn from religion. It may have been tainted somewhat by human arrogance, it also consist of many wisdoms. So i attend christian sessions and recently buddhist classes to see what i can learn from them. It is better to learn first before judging people who chose to follow a certain faith.<br><br>I am enjoying this discussion Mooku <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

They have chosen their way and are happy with it so as long as they are happy that's all that matters.<br><br>Actually, up till now Science has not been able to explain a sudden leap in our evolution history when we evolved from Nethereals to the current human skeleton structure. They couldn't find any bone remains that indicate that the change took place gradually so who knows, maybe Adam and Eve were made then.<br><br>I do believe there is a God but not the God of the Bible because it was written by Man and thus tainted by Man's arrogance and delusions. I belive that God made us to see which of us is worthy to follow him but he doesn't want us to blindly worship him. Those that follow him are men who can reach a perfection of mind not of faith. Sorta a  Buddhist/Christian mix.<br><br>Frankly i find it replusive that preachers claim God will burn those who do not follow regardless of how they lived their lives. That's probably the main reason why i don't follow Christianity.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well Said.<br>First of all .. larren, its really very very bad of u to smash the statues. True, u dislike the idea of ur mum being so supersition. Don't follow her then. thats her beliefs right ? u break the statues, and her heart... guess she has been 'praying' to them for a long time...<br>I believe that no one can says stuffs about every religion. i used to be a taoism...  everyday light those incenses or burn those papers. i dun want to do it... but at the same time i dun wan to disappoint my mother. things changes over the years... so many things happen..<br>I start to believe in myself until at a point of time, i realise i need somebody else. then i begin to explore other religions like christianality and buddhism... i find that behind every religion, i learn alot... its so amazing... till now, i am still learning whats with my life, how to improve it.. bit by bit ...thru their teachings, and thru everyday life.  i agreed with Stevenson101 that the 'self acknoledged free thinker' term exists...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><br>why?<br></blockquote>Because the greatest liar is one's self. When you lie to yourself it will be transformed as the truth because you can't bring yourself to believe otherwise. You use the phase "believe in yourself" but do not understand the meaning of it by experience.<br><br>The true meaning in believing in yourself is to not shake under peer pressure and pursue what you believe is right regardless of whether people believe in you or not. I have known a few that claimed that believe in themselves but would not dare to test their faith. If you want to understand what i mean, considering the numbers i saw i think some of your friends should be City Harvest church followers, attend a session and you will understand what i mean about testing your faith under peer pressure.  Call me a freak but i attend Evangelist church sessions also because it can  really test my beliefs and faith in things.<br><br>But really, if your parents chose to believe a religion but you do not want to you should just bring it out front and explain your position. In the end, your parents will understand that there is no point in praying to the gods for your happiness if you are not happy doing it. They are praying to the gods for your sake.<br><br></div>
