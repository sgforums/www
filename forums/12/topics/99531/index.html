            <div class='col-md body'>Do you take love as an investment or as a companionship? No such thing as give and expect something in return. You give to make somebody happy and thats the bottomline. If she leaves you with a smile, acknowledging your love, you have succeeded. But she leaves you in tears, you have failed.Cos what matters most is that she is happy. And that's the bottomline. So dun be an idiot and think that it is all your fault.You were never wrong. As long as she is wearing a smile, you were never wrong.</div>
