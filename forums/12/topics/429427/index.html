              <p>As the title states, need opinions from you ladies and the more feminine aware of the male population(which i'm not as i'm already asking this).</p>
              <p>Really childish of me to get myself into such a situation but here goes the story:</p>
              <p>Here's the thing. We had just finished a rather long school day ending with a rather boring chemisty class, while going back to our lockers, for some reason (maybe it's because i stayed up all night the previous day mugging,too tired and alittle irritated perhaps?), i uttered, quote "you love to stomp around don't you?". Now nothing super serious sounding at first impressions. Not really, on the contrary it was a diaster. </p>
              <p>Why stomp? well she does walk(more of stomp) wherever she goes(wears shoes one size too large). Find it alittle irritating yet at the same time sooo cute(the part i regretted not saying).To the girl with some insecurities about herself (which teenager would not have one eh??). </p>
              <p>This would not be much of an issue if we were just classmates. Thing is we both have feelings for each other(i'm a guy and the other's a she just in case). Its like the cold war right now. She stays about a metre away from me nowadays whenever we sit beside each other. Rather silent and glancing at me from time to time in a not so good way. Keeps coming up to me yet suddenly turns away once she's really close to me. All are polar opposites for the day to day interactions between us. Its as though she's waiting for an apology. Saying goodbye to her today felt weird.Yet she's all so cosy with me at certain times today(maybe she's just testing me???).</p>
              <p>Did i commit a cardinal sin by damaging a girl's self-esteem?? Is she angry? and should i apologise. Gahhh all this drama for one sentence........</p>

              <p>Say you're sorry. You may not fully agree with her reasons for
              being offended but if her friendship matters to you, you'll not
              wait for HER to make the first move.</p>
              <p>Try this:</p>
              <p><strong>I'm a total idiot. I say things sometimes. Stupid
              things. It bugs me that I may have made you angry. It bugs me more
              that I may have made you sad. I've obviously hurt you by saying
              that 'STOMPING' thing. I miss talking to you. I'm
              sorry.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Okay. I actually wrote that with a straight face.</p>
              <p>Almost.</p>
              <p>It doesn't matter. If you miss her that much, then repeat
              word-for-word what I wrote above. If she doesn't turn into a puddle
              then she's a heartless STOMPING b1tch anyways and you're better off
              finding less leaden-footed ladies.</p>
              <p>Damn. I'm good.</p>

              <p>As the title states, need opinions from you ladies and the more feminine aware of the male population(which i'm not as i'm already asking this).</p>
              <p>Really childish of me to get myself into such a situation but here goes the story:</p>
              <p>Here's the thing. We had just finished a rather long school day ending with a rather boring chemisty class, while going back to our lockers, for some reason (maybe it's because i stayed up all night the previous day mugging,too tired and alittle irritated perhaps?), i uttered, quote "you love to stomp around don't you?". Now nothing super serious sounding at first impressions. Not really, on the contrary it was a diaster. </p>
              <p>Why stomp? well she does walk(more of stomp) wherever she goes(wears shoes one size too large). Find it alittle irritating yet at the same time sooo cute(the part i regretted not saying).To the girl with some insecurities about herself (which teenager would not have one eh??). </p>
              <p>This would not be much of an issue if we were just classmates. Thing is we both have feelings for each other(i'm a guy and the other's a she just in case). Its like the cold war right now. She stays about a metre away from me nowadays whenever we sit beside each other. Rather silent and glancing at me from time to time in a not so good way. Keeps coming up to me yet suddenly turns away once she's really close to me. All are polar opposites for the day to day interactions between us. Its as though she's waiting for an apology. Saying goodbye to her today felt weird.Yet she's all so cosy with me at certain times today(maybe she's just testing me???).</p>
              <p>Did i commit a cardinal sin by damaging a girl's self-esteem?? Is she angry? and should i apologise. Gahhh all this drama for one sentence........</p>

              <p>I dunno wat is the big deal???</p>
              <p>You didn't call her fat or old, rite?</p>
              <p>So why is she so angry?</p>
              <p>I oso dunno.</p>
              <p>Apologise? For wat....woman ah...the more you apologise to them, the more they trample over you. Apologise only when you need something from them. Haha.</p>

              <p>She must have been offended.</p>
              <p>Seriously, some guys are sensitive themselves; what more a lady/girl?</p>
