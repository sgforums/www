              <p>I am not sure how old you are, if you are still in your early 20s, you should decide to change your field. No point doing something you don't like. Don't do accounting just because you don't know what you want to do. There are people who succeed in other fields without needing a degree. I have a friend who is a wedding photographer. He was like you, he was working as a QC manager until one day he found something interesting to do because he liked cameras so he decided to become a wedding photographer. He makes lots of money more than he did when he worked as a QC manager.</p>
              <p>Probably not easy to change field, maybe you should continue your accounting while you find out what you really want to do.</p>

              <p>Before you find anything you like. Maybe you can take a good look at your attitude. Are you the sort who's not able to complete what you have started? Are you the kind who lack the determination and perseverance? In your own personal standard, where is the ending point for you? What are your targets? What kind of money you want to earn? </p>
              <p>If you lack the discipline, no matter what field you think that your interest is in, your attitude would kill you before you could even start on the real business. </p>
              <p>I have friends who thought accountants earn big bucks. So they went to pursue CPA, ACCA, LCCI all the accounting stuff. When they are out in the working world, they realise, they didn't like it at all, everything was routine and they were earning $2k plus and minus. So they decided to switch career. One went into tutoring, citing that the tuition industry in Singapore in booming. Another went into the F&amp;B industry, saying F&amp;B is a confirm plus chop money machine, and added that she herself love to eat, so she knows whats good food.</p>
              <p>Well, a few months later, the tutor is searching for a job so that she can have a stable income as she doesn't have enough student. She refuse to sign up with agency because she didn't want to give away her 50% commission. She didn't want to print leaflets as she didn't want to waste that money.</p>
              <p>The F&amp;B fellow is earning a few hundred in profit. The food she is selling is not very nice, her overheads are very high because she didn't bother to keep track. Both wants to give up. Let me tell you, a few years later, they will experience the same thing, because both do not want to put in the effort in making things work. </p>
              <p>Everyone has to start small and learn through experience. If they had gritted their teeth and work hard to excel whatever little task they were in, I believe they would have been earning a considerable good sum now. Same goes for you. Think over, is it your attitude or really it just isn't your flair? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>Right now, you seem to be lost in direction, yr ambition and vision.</p>

              <p>better to do what you love than attempt to love what you do. Salary can only sustain that energy for so long. The key is interest in the job and of course, haha good $$. Once the interest is there, many things fall in place.</p>

              <p>Before you find anything you like. Maybe you can take a good look at your attitude. Are you the sort who's not able to complete what you have started? Are you the kind who lack the determination and perseverance? In your own personal standard, where is the ending point for you? What are your targets? What kind of money you want to earn? </p>
              <p>If you lack the discipline, no matter what field you think that your interest is in, your attitude would kill you before you could even start on the real business. </p>
              <p>I have friends who thought accountants earn big bucks. So they went to pursue CPA, ACCA, LCCI all the accounting stuff. When they are out in the working world, they realise, they didn't like it at all, everything was routine and they were earning $2k plus and minus. So they decided to switch career. One went into tutoring, citing that the tuition industry in Singapore in booming. Another went into the F&amp;B industry, saying F&amp;B is a confirm plus chop money machine, and added that she herself love to eat, so she knows whats good food.</p>
              <p>Well, a few months later, the tutor is searching for a job so that she can have a stable income as she doesn't have enough student. She refuse to sign up with agency because she didn't want to give away her 50% commission. She didn't want to print leaflets as she didn't want to waste that money.</p>
              <p>The F&amp;B fellow is earning a few hundred in profit. The food she is selling is not very nice, her overheads are very high because she didn't bother to keep track. Both wants to give up. Let me tell you, a few years later, they will experience the same thing, because both do not want to put in the effort in making things work. </p>
              <p>Everyone has to start small and learn through experience. If they had gritted their teeth and work hard to excel whatever little task they were in, I believe they would have been earning a considerable good sum now. Same goes for you. Think over, is it your attitude or really it just isn't your flair? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>Idk de. Went ACCA at mum advice. Don't like. So I tell her, she say try working first. So I ok lor, just go try-try, no harm right? But end up, I hate the working life too. Even though the starting pay is not good, and I bet the pay when/if I climb ladder will be good too. Theory no like, working life no like...The reason I chose my science dip is cos, I love science. But when I graduate from Poly. I realise, my passion stop at Poly level. Cos I think of what my friends (the perm staff at my attachment place) earn, what they do, and what they are doing to go up (they doing masters and pHd), I see what it's liek in real life, then I realise I "don't like" science liao.</p>

              <p>Base on your reply, I kind of think that you get very dejected easily. When you hit the rough road, you would tend to give up, rather than move on and find the beauty that lies ahead. You must always remember that all these obstacles are there to help you learn and mould you into a better individual. </p>
              <p>From what you mention, "if cannot then don't do le", it means then that whenever there's a good opportunity to learn, you run away from that lesson instead. Its through these adversities that you can rise through the top, don't take it as if they are there to pull you down and make you lose interest. Stay positive and do not go out of track. You won't want to end up to be a jack of all trades, a master of none. </p>

              <p>It's true the obstacles mould us. I always tell myself not to give up as well, but it is so easy to not heed that advice! For those who give up easily...you will understand..but those who don't, will not.. I don't know if there is a way to stop myself from giving up easily. I can force myself to complete something if I really want to, although the moment I feel 'sian' my work/efforts will not be as great. I did manage to get my piano grade5 (beyond that getting too hard cos hearing is super impt), my swimming my poly my license.. at least sth to be proud of...but need more.</p>

              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">really, just believe in yourself, and just stick in there. bear it out and things will slot themselves into place sooner or later. just do things one step at a time i guess.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">i'll admit that we arn't in your situation, so we wouldn't know exactly all the trials and tribulations that you have and are faced with. but you know what, as much as things suck now, they can't stay this "bad" forever. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">age/experience-wise, i'm in no position to start spewing out advice, but i just wanted to share this crazy decision/journey that my mom took on round 7+ years ago. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">Her "dream career" was to work as a geographer, she even had a job with </span><span style="color: black; font-family: SimSun;   " lang="ZH-CN">ä¸­å›½çŸ³åŒ–</span><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">, but left halfway for further studies, which landed her down the path of IT. so in the end, she spent most of her time working in NCS, doing IT stuff. in around 2003, she made a radical decision to swap and study ACCA (accounting) because she was genuinely interested in it. most people thought she was mad, going into a completely alien field at her age.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">it was pretty bad, it was like for ever 2 subjects you take, you end up failing 1. And even fro the ones that you pass, they're bordering along 60s and 70s. and that was the common occurrence.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">in between taking care of us, and embarking on some weird schemes trying to set up her own online curtain shop, and everything else, she pulled through and completed the whole course :D</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">but now she's into the stock market, and is avidly reading up on stocks/econs.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">so all i'm trying to say is, life is what you make it out to be. she's nearing her 50s, and you are just starting out in life. there's so many possibilities. you might feel like giving up,but just hang in there. </span></p>

              <p>When I was young, 20s+, I will hop if the salary is higher than the present one. When you reach a certain age, you have to think of settling down. Older less value. Younger more value. I mean tender resignation.</p>
