            <div class='col-md body'><p>I don't always add girls on fb but when I add them means I'm really serious to get to know them but every time I try to spark a conversation they just ignore me. The thing is I don't think I have bad looks because I work at a 7eleven once beside tiong bahru market where there are many Chinese/China hostess. They always say to me 'ni hensuai' and I get to know it means handsome. There's one even ask me to have sex with her and She's really pretty but I'm not that type so I just txt her an all that. For Singaporeans encounter they'll just look at me and look away when I look back especially malay girls, Chinese are few but they'll pretend to look at something else at the last minute...BUT WHY I CANT GET TO CHAT WITH GIRLS??????? I just need one goood relationship that's all, sex can wait coz I don't need that for now. I always attract the wrong people, I always go geylang to buy contraband cigarette coz I work near there and the prostitutes the will hug me and won't let go say that I'm cute. Can you state some possible problems with me? Personally I think my style of communication is boring because I try to respect girls as much as possible. I used to say corny words to girls and they like it. Does it mean sg girls like bad guys? What will you do in my situation?</p></div>

              Well you really can't expect consistency/similarities in the attraction and responses shown by hostess and hookers with those who aren't. They would even find fuglies hot.
              
              Simple reason that you couldn't chat with hot girls on FB is cause they dont know you, there are numerous other guys with similar motives as you saying "Hi" to them on FB for a chat and they are bored on responding by now, and finally, if they were even decently goodlooking, they wouldn't need to meet guys on FB.

              <p>Can you list out other good points about you.</p>
              <p>Other than the "handsome" part as perceived by the prostitutes.who probably say the same about any guy they met. </p>
              <p>1. you smoke. You don't care about your health and personal image. </p>
              <p>2. You're a cheapskate, thats why you buy contraband.</p>
              <p>3. You're gullible. You believe what you want to believe. Possibly a self absorbed personality.</p>
              <p>These are the 3 negatives about you just from reading your post. </p>
              <p>If your mom told you , a girl will accept all your flaws if she loves you.. please do not believe that bullsheet , unless you are Tom Cruise. Even the screen god got dumped by his young wife. So go figure.</p>
              <p>If you want girls to notice you, you need to be attractive first. Or be as attractive as them. </p>
              <p>So if you go after a girl who smoke, just as gullible and as cheapskate as you.. perhaps you may stand a fighting chance. </p>

              <p>Hey jojobeach thanks, I love that you can spot part of my flaws. I'm not really a cheapskate because I don't buy contraband always, I only do that when i'm bored at work and decided to walk along geylang at the same time buy ciggarette.</p>
              <p>Since you mentioned gullible I think I am..I don't think I'm that good looking.. Maybe I don't care much about my health since i'm smoking but I do have good body since I work out and I'm the lean type. Today I just realize that the only one who compliment me is either hostesses, prostitutes, my family members or a few strangers, so I think that dosen't count. The one good thing about me that I know of is i'm a thinker, i'm not necessarily smart but I just like to think just about anything every single time. To be exact I'm a introvert, I'm a thinker and I'm shy and I don't really like to socialize with people but I don't really avoid people I just like being alone. Maybe that's the main problem.</p>
              <p>The reason I post here is because I'm really depressed and you guys don't know my identity so yeah...Please find my flaws I need opinions. I have done everything I can think of to be a better person..I'm trustworthy, honest, I protect people I know little of just because they choose to be nice to me once..What I mean protect is i protect them from bullies when i'm in ns..i'm anti-bullies and I once hospitalized one guy and have to personally send him to hospital since i'm a driver..lol...and please don't say i'm violent and aggressive because im not at all, and I don't even dare hurt peoples feelings. I'm just anti people who do injustice....hope to see some replies. My english sucks please bear with me...</p>

              <p>Being an introvert is not a problem. There's some introverts and extroverts in all of us, it's a question of how much socialising one prefers. And many of us do enjoy some solitudes.</p>
              <p>Since you tend towards introvert, you are looking for love in the wrong place, aka Facebook. Extroverts are attention seekers, it will be hard pressed for introverts to give an extrovert what they need. </p>
              <p>Join other types of social groups that appeal to introverts like yourself. Go solo backpacking, volunteer to help the needy. All types of altruistic activities will get you connected to people like you.</p>
              <p>Consider a holistic appeal. Unless a girl sees you fighting off bad guys today, they won't know you're a guy with a noble heart. It's like winking at the girls in the dark.</p>
              <p>First, you need to clean up your image. Quit smoking. Smokers stink, from their breath to their sweat. Smokers produce lower quality sperm. Smokers are at high risk of health issues. Nobody wants that.</p>
              <p>So you work out, but you also smoke. That's oxymoronic, not smart.</p>
              <p>Second, live a life others want to be part of.</p>
              <p>If you tend to sulk at home, and blame the world for your shit life, it's likely girls will be running away from you instead of towards you. Nobody likes a negative viber.</p>
              <p>Work on your self confidence. English is not a marker of success, stop shining a spot light on your weaknesses.</p>
              <p>Your self-confidence will go up after you've clean up your act. </p>

              <p>You are overly attached to the outcome.</p>
              <p>To you, if you add and msg her then she is a special snowflake. But to her, you are just one of the many ppl who add and msg her. There is a mismatch in thinkings.</p>
              <p>Start thinking that getting turned down and being ignored is okay. Keep talking to girls and make you intent clear. If your intent is to know her better because you like her then let her know.</p>
