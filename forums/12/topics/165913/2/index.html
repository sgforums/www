You're at an age where everything appears to be all roses, there's Nothing for you to really worry about, apart from your studies.  From time to time, you bump into people who don't have the same ideals as you, or even jerks, but this is all part of growing up.<br><br>Your ex is still young, only 16.  In time, when he has his heart broken, he'll grow into someone more mature.  Right now, it's the experimental age, &amp; experimenting is probably what's right on his mind right now.  We wouldn't know for sure whether he'll grow up, or whether he'll be stuck in the jerk mode (some guys do, I know 1 &amp; he's past 30!), but put it down as a life experience.<br><br>There're plenty of good guys out there.  It's just a matter of luck, &amp; perseverance.<br><br>FeowFeow<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by sunpastilles:</div><div class="quote_body">my one year 2weeks 4days relationship ended a few days ago. found out he's been flirting, smsing girls things like "miss you alot, really. but you don believe, neither do you miss me, sighs" he even says "i love you"... hais.<br><br>he's been doing that for the past 3 months le. i was being lied to for our last 3months by my bf. i cant believe it.<br><br>theres even once he said he wanna meet me in morning, but in the end didnt came, he said he went for breakfast alone.. now then i know.. he went to a girl's place. he wanted us to quiet down during O lvls, like no more smses/calls. im okay with that. den i only msged him GoodLuck for his paper n stuffs, he says things like "i say don msg me anymore, i wan study, wont msg u either".. den im like, fine then. no msgs loh.<br><br>but now i know, he's been smsing others all along. for every paper, he sends Goodluck to a particular girl, but not me. the girl take diff subj and there were days he didnt have to go sch for papers, he'd woke up early to just send her a msg.<br><br>things were so cold between us. after which i found out all these abt a week ago, i asked him. he said sorry and those msgs were just for fun. hais i dun understand wats so fun about it. idiot. he said he's guilty and sounded reluctant to break. so i kept it aside. till one morning, i woke up and still don see any msgs from him, i thought about it for awhile. i msged him. he still gave me those attitude and i feel that he dont think he did did anything wrong.. stuffs like that. i couldnt take it. i said "lets break.." all he replied was "fine. lets break then"...<br><br>the feeling of being lied to, and then not being sincerely apologised to, sucks. and even after i told him i knew the truths, he still carry on msging girls. hais. even up to the last moment.. he couldnt answer me when i asked if he still loves me.. i guess the answer's no..<br><br>hais. everything just keeps reminding me of him. it seriously sucks. and my frens who went out with him after we broke, said that he's still as happy.. seems to be enjoying himself. sighs, i wonder how he 'recover' so fast...</div></blockquote></div>

Actually technically, he didn't lie to you - he merely kept a certain truth and had you discover them by chance.<br><br>It has come to a stage where your Love has been declining rapidly without your knowledge... having virus within the structure of your relationship and annihilating all healthy 'cells'. You probably thought that a year old relationship means strong-going, but obviously, reality speaks of a different tale. Your relationship surfaces an unknown issue and this wasn't communicated. Then, it breeds hideously in the heart of your man and poison his feelings.<br><br>This breeding causes him to rethink his own relationship - the Love he has been receiving... is it what he wants?<br><br>His anger and irritability is a mask to justify his flirty act. His nonchalant attitude is a result of his failing relationship and fleeting Love. He understood the theory that this relationship must go... thus embracing his new found life at first sight of freedom. There is NO point retaining a souless man who doesn't love you anymore.<br><br>It's truly over - but are you going to let this relationship crumble you like a pack of cards? Or what if he wants to patch? Are you going to allow a man, who only has a small chamber for you in his heart, to delude you further? Are you going to strengthen yourself and out-live a better life than he has?<br><br>P.S: He has already moved on - when will you begin yours?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>
