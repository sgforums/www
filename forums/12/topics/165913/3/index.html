So are you suggesting that she have sex with him to satisfy him and thinking that with that he will stick on to her?<br><br>sunpastilles -<br>You already made a very wise decision by leaving him. Don't make a big mistake by thinking of patching up with him. He's not worth you making such a big mistake. You are still young and there's a lot more good guys out there waiting to love you and take care of you. Enjoy the privilages a girl should have. And please don't make an even more foolish mistake listening to Cavin. Sex is no longer a tool to make a guy stick to you. Just keep a lookout of the rate of all the unwed mothers.<br><br>A guy, being a flirt, is never a fault of the girl. Remember, it's not your fault that he flirts around. If they want a good F**K, go Geylang. There got professionals with ample experience! *god bless them with Aids*<br></div>

But now as an adult and thinking back, I do realised that what they say are true afterall.<br><br>Life is not just about relationships. Relationships are just a minority portion of life.

If you can't get through all these now, how can you possibly survive for another 60yrs?<br><br>I bet you a dollar that in another 10-20yrs time you'll probably be like me advising a young adult to move on in life as there's more important things waiting for you to fullfill.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

It's always best to listen to both sides story.<br><br>When I was with my ex-gf, I admit that I almost strayed or I do have the intention. Not because I don't love her anymore but for a woman who keep giving me cold shoulders on and off for no reasons and sudden "disappear" from my life and become uncontactable then "reappear" again. I don't know how to handle this kind of relationship. I started to doubt if she even ever exist. I do love her still but then the doubts of her love for me was building up. And during this period, I become very close to another female colleague and often she will try to cheer me up and listen to my problems and is always constantly there for me and seemed like we started to have feelings for each other but we were never together as I felt wrong to two-time my gf despite the fact of how she treated me. But then again, even having the thought of straying is already wrong in my own sense.<br><br>Who knows, maybe she (my ex) posted in AA before that her partner strayed and have an affair with another woman behind her back without realising her own comings.<br><br></div>

It's always best to listen to both sides story.<br><br>When I was with my ex-gf, I admit that I almost strayed or I do have the intention. Not because I don't love her anymore but for a woman who keep giving me cold shoulders on and off for no reasons and sudden "disappear" from my life and become uncontactable then "reappear" again. I don't know how to handle this kind of relationship. I started to doubt if she even ever exist. I do love her still but then the doubts of her love for me was building up. And during this period, I become very close to another female colleague and often she will try to cheer me up and listen to my problems and is always constantly there for me and seemed like we started to have feelings for each other but we were never together as I felt wrong to two-time my gf despite the fact of how she treated me. But then again, even having the thought of straying is already wrong in my own sense.<br><br>Who knows, maybe she (my ex) posted in AA before that her partner strayed and have an affair with another woman behind her back without realising her own comings.<br><br></div></blockquote>yup... i think i'm in the same situation as you.... the only thing different is that i don't have other female frens to confide to.. unlucky to do an all-guys course in sch, all-guys cca.. and other all-guys activities. besides that, i don't hang ard much..<br><br>since for yours it didn't quite work out... i guess mine will end in the same fate. i think at any point when u feel like quitting, its already over in a way.. a failure.<br><br>sigh... women. can't live with them, can't live without them..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

Me and that colleague never ended up together. So nothing to celebrate either. But one thing I can tell you now is, I'm glad it didn't work out or else I'll miss the chance of the lifetime to be with my current gf who happens to be a very wonderful woman.<br><br>If it happens to me, it'll happen to you too. Just a matter of time pal. Sometimes when we meet failures, see it as a lesson and learn it well and when you do that, I'm sure you'll be well rewarded. It's like a maths problem sum. You might not be able to do it initially but after much learning, I'm sure you'll be able to solve the problem and the reward? Of course an "A" in your report card!</div>

HeÂ’s got balls to say that in front of you.<br><br>Notice that he has never hidden the fact that he has a player mentality.<br><br>You knew his playful character right from the start (he probably flirted his way into your heart as well). Yet you chose to be with him thinking you can change him.<br><br>Two points you should think aboutÂ…<br><br><strong>1. Is it his fault that he is unwilling to change and mould himself into the right kind of guy in your imagination?</strong><br><br><strong>2. More importantly, why do you want to change him?</strong> I suspect that your own insecurities is generating a need for you to change him and force him to prove to you that he cares for you. No wonder he felt stressed about meeting your expectations.<br><br>I am not saying what he did is right. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">However, all of us make choices in our lives and we have to learn to accept the outcome of our choices. </span><br><br>You chose to be with a boy with some player tactics, you screwed up by being insecure and rubbing him the wrong way, so you should accept the outcome.<br><br>My advice for you is to walk away...you are not in his league.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by sunpastilles:<br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">den i asked "why u nvr msg ur ke ai and cute de girl.. ytd u just said I LOVE YOU to her again right.. haha" den he said "dunno la.. don say her le can. i also don love her wat, sms for fun cannot ah, bro n sis only ma. think i wont msg her again le ba"</span></strong></blockquote>I will not be surprised if after the breakup he had already went for that girl and hinted about his interest. But the girl snubbed him and he is feeling lucky that he still has you.<br><br>He is keeping you as a backup girl while his priority is in chasing other girls. Think about all those Â“good luckÂ” messages he sent to those girls before every examÂ…is there any valid reasons why he should leave you out?<br><br>You have to make the choiceÂ…either put up with him or walk away.<span style="text-decoration: underline;">And donÂ’t bank on the possibility that he might change his ways anytime soon. It will not happen. </span><br><br>The boy is too young right now and probably has to crash and burn a few more times before he really sits down and think about changing his outlook in life.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>seems to me he isnt really sincere...about now i think you might regret your decision to break, but what i gather from what you said kinda says that he isnt serious at all (yeah i agree with the others that it is highly probably hes using you as backup). then from the sms about saying your friend wouldnt want a flirt sounds more disappointed and helpless than remorseful, like its not that he doesnt want, but its she doesnt want thats why hes not trying for her...so he falls back on and confides in you cause both of you were once very close together....but i dunno much about him, so i cant say if he will appreciate you if you show ample care and concern. but anyways i think you should treat him as a friend meanwhile and continue to provide him with support...maybe it may turn out for the better, but if not, then time to move on, cause jc/poly/ite whichever youre going to will provide many opportunities for such relationships too.<br><br>all the best in whatever choice you make =)</div>
