            <div class='col-md body'>actually to me, when u are with someone that you really love but she lost her virginity you will feel a bit wierd unless you have had sex with too many guys or girls depends on if you are a girl or a guy and you feel that virginity is no longer a topic you are bothered over. normal people would mind more or less if their partner is a virgin or not deep inside their heart. love is one thing. virginity is one thing. if one girl gives off virginity too easily for eg. 50% of her past relationships, that shows that she no longer cherish her body anymore being "extremely close" to so many guys then how SPECIAL can you feel compared to her past boyfriends? since sex is often thought as the "most intimate" act and she had experienced it with other guys.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Anyway to me if my gf gave off 1 or twice its fine with me. because most of the girls gave off their virginity at their first relationship having little knowledge of the world of love therefore to me its forgivable. but of cause i would feel wierd in the start and its okay as the feeling fades. minding one's virginity is because that you love that person so much and have a minset that shes yours thats why you mind that shes not a virgin cause "someone did something CLOSE with the person thats "yours". but well again if its 1 or 2 times... i wouldnt mind.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  everyone make mistakes. one should be forgiven for reasonable explainations.. but for those who did it more than that hmmm.. well they should think over if what they are doing are correct.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  -peace out-</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To those virgins out thr be proud if you are one keep it up, you wont regret your choice at least I have not regret mine but pls don condemn those who aint. You nv know one day u might b part of the non V grp and others saying u too. (things r unpredictable esp feelings)<br><br>Love = loving the person everytink including their past.<br>What some say tinks used cannot be unused... actually you don really love him/her, you just want possession of them to be your own, irregardless is person or tinks. (although I admit will have funny feeling). when you wan them to only yours, its ideal thought however thr is no perfection. So some people don mind monster to be their them partner than (attitude,character etc) in order to want a virgin partner?<br><br>People can accept divorced ppl but no sex b4 marriage. actuali both same products, diff approach. Besides, if ur partner is determined to lie, I doubt you can find out. Lastly, If one is willingly to give up someone who is willingly to die for jus bcos they aint Vs just to want a V. I seriously tink sth nds to change. Its hard to find someone who goes thru thick and thin but easy to find virgins even in a time like this.</div>

Love novels are pure. Relationships is complication. hmmm... U know even I being a V wants to spk up for those who arent because I hate to see them being condemn. Love is sth special and beyond words of explanation. I guess, when you truly taste it than you perhaps might understand why those things took place. To me, humans are selfish. No humans are perfect. Being not a virgin is one of the imperfections. virginity is just a status. I keep it cos thr r just too many selfish ppl ard, I dont want to regret. Many are perhaps restraining themselves for the sake of watever reasons they had.<br>Like I said, its hard to find someone dying for you but easy to find a virgin partner even in times like this. You know, giving up someone who is willing to go thru thick and thin wif u for the sake of virginity is silly.I dun really know how to put them into words but I hope u understand wat I mean.<br><br>If you aint curious, you will probably live in the shadows not knowing the truth. Your life would be happier.</div>
