Before I start, I would have at ANY time... Better advise you to get professional advices from a doctor than compared to myself...<br><br>How old are you? Do you have any known critical disease or illness? Or anything like that might run within your family? How often do you go for medical health check? When was the last time? How throughout was it?<br><br>Other than feeling 'very tired'... Would you often feel better after you've slept..? You mentioned that you've no strength to exercise... Do you feel any pain at the joints or in your muscle...? Do you feel swells at particular parts of your body...? If yes, where? Any particular sensation you feel or obvious difference you can see at the / those area(s)?<br><br>How many hours after you've studied or work after which you would feel tired? Before that? Any obvious difference in your performance before you tired yourself out these days...?<br><br>Do you have sore throat or headache?<br><br>Often when you feel 'very tired' after long hours of work or studies... Anything you do that might help you feel better...? eg. you take a nap or sleep then you feel better or something...? How long do you feel tired for after you've start to feel 'worn out'?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I've gone through a period of wad you've described. It was like I was dead in the heart and mind. Yet, I was still alive. Just going through the motions only. Zombie I truly was.... Dat was when I quit from my job and took off for a long vacation...... Wad was lacking was motivation. I had to rediscover myself and my enthusiasm. Dat was quite some years ago already!<br><br>Now, I'm much more careful in wad I do. I try to give some balance to my life and cut out the deadwood in my life. I avoid doing wad I deem unnecessary so I pretty much live for myself now and not for others....... Dat works wonders for me! Dunno if doing this will work for you but what have you got to lose trying it out? If you need more details, pm me.
