              <p>Thks for the concern. Really appreciate it. I went to the doctor
                  yesterday and he went there to meet and wait for me there. Later, I
                  went out with him and had dinner together with his friends. During
                  dinner, he showed me a msg that she sent her... It's something like

              <p>Why do you care what she is thinking and what she is doing with her life? She is saying that without regard to her position, her dream is to marry into wealth. And she's making it come true. You think its crap? At least she is doing what she thinks she deserves - taking the guy she wants!</p>
              <p>Why don't you care what is happening to you and your life by your choices? So what are you doing to make your dream come true? sharing a faithless guy with a PRC woman and then coming here to complain to us she's here shopping and spending money? Seriously, you are asking us for what? Sympathy, concern? Are you thinking clearly? Its your life, do you know that. You make decisions, not us. Today's choices determines tomorrow's happiness.</p>
              <p>Why are you so full of things that are not important! What is important? What do you want out of this relationship with your guy? Are you playing with the guy? Are you playing with yourself? If you are, then there is nothing to talk.</p>

              <p>However for sg gal, unless you are handsome and young and in good shape, if you touches them, you can get sue. Same goes to me, i choose the person i want to talk to, if i see the guy is lousy, i dun even give a damn. That is our culture, the dao culture, head high, chest up, rear in, and walk with an air of hao lian. But sg guys have to understand, cos we are better breed, higher education, virgin, good family and have money. But for sg gal, if you want to hao lian, at least got something to hao lian, otherwise people laugh at you.</p>

              <p>That time when i am in MRT, one PRC gal squeeze in and my body and her body contact and still she apoloqize to me, i was thinking squeeze somemore i love it, don't need to feel sorry one. But if that time is a sg girl, i will quickly pray to god, i still have old parents to feed and they pump in so much $ for my education, i cannot go jail just like that and my backside cannot withstand that cane. So i think i like PRC girls also....</p>
