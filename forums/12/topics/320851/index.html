            <div class='col-md body'><p>Me and my boyfriend were to get married earlier this year but this PRC woman came along and broke our relationship. He initiated a breakoff coz he wanted to be with the PRC woman but I was so in love with him that I refused. We were together until now but with the PRC woman around. The PRC woman returned back to China after her PVP expired. My boyfriend went over to visit her a couple of times when she was there. Recently, she came back to Singapore to look for my boyfriend and living off him. My boyfriend still loves me but he also loves the PRC woman. My boyfriend wants to get married with either one of us but can't decide who... Lately, she had been making noise with my boyfriend when I send him smses and asking him why he did not have a clean break with me. She even send me an sms using his mobile phone. In fact, I suspect that the PRC woman is back on a work permit but is not working at all. Is what she is doing an offence?    </p></div>

              <p>I have a boyfriend whom we had been together for four years. He
              met with a PRC lady end of last year and they were together until
              now. The PRC lady went back to China after her pass exipired but
              she was back lately to be with my boyfriend. My boyfriend still
              loves me and love him as well, but at the same time he also love
              the PRC woman. I suspect that the PRC woman is back in Singapore on
              a work permit but she is not working at all. Is what she is doing
              an offence?  </p>

              <p>LOL go with your heart ...hahaha . Her boyfriend is seeing a girl behind her back and the girl went off . The girl came back and he resumed seeing her. That is a pattern of behaviour.</p>
              <p>Let me give you a piece of advice sweetie :</p>
              <p>Listen to your head, not your heart. Your heart can be broken but it will mend in time. Your head can be broken but that's the end of you.</p>

              <p>Hi Ace,</p>
              <p>I know what you are thinking. You are together for 4 years and this woman just gate-crashed in. Why should you let her win. You are here to ask for advices on how to get rid of her. Am I correct?</p>
              <p>You've mentioned about work permit. It is her employer's responsibility that she is working for the employer and only the job stated in the work permit and nothing else and also the employer's responsibility to cancel the work permit if she is no longer with the employer. You really wanna know more, goto MOM website for more info.</p>
              <p>In my opinion, once a guy strays, he is no longer worth it. In your case, he is openly doing it and enjoying his 2 timing. My advise is learn to let go. What's the point of winning? If he can do it now, he can do it again next time. And what's the point of sending her back? You had already mentioned he will just fly over there the meet her.</p>
              <p>You are lucky that this happens before your marriage. Let go. there are better guys out there.</p>
