              <p>not to sound prejudiced or anything, but i have a gut feel that the woman is likely to only make use of him, in ways such as money and citizenship. many PRCs use singaporean(men) as a stepping stone to getting a green card in the US.</p>
              <p>furthermore...i have personally witnessed cases of relationships gone wrong due to the man's love/infatuation with PRC ladies. it is very common, and i feel sympathetic for ur BF as when he comes to his senses, he would have realized that he has lost everything, including you, dear TS. so, learn to let go, it isn't worth it to sacrifice a forest for a tree.</p>
              <p>p.s: how old is your bf? the first digit would do lol</p>

              <p>Love is Blind. No matter how much you do, the person will not see
              through many things his lover may have did. He will try to find all
              kinds of excuses for her. He is already blinded by Love.</p>
              <p>Dear
              TS, i think because you had refused to leave him, that is one of the
              reasons he still stay with you, while he is enjoying both world. i know
              it is very painful for you to make a decision to completely leave him.
              you are just wasting your time and youth for him. Are you sure that
              even if you have finally won him this time, will it be another time?
              how much can you take it?</p>
              <p>I also made a painful decision
              years ago. But its not about third party. the ex actually hit me. If i
              had not made a decision to leave him, where will i be now? you have to
              think for yourself. How many woman he has besides you and the PRC? do
              you want to take the risk of getting infected with diseases? if you
              decided that it is worth, then go ahead, but do not regret what you
              have decided. it is your choice.</p>
              <p>Take care</p>

              <p>I wish I would be able to let go of the relationship but it is

              <p>i know it's so hard for you. Many has gone through this kinda things before. This man is neither worth your love nor your tears. If the PRC woman decides to cheat on him, serves him right. He'll learn his lesson. You'll only suffer if you stay with him. Don't be fooled by his tears and words, he just wants both you and that slut. Let him lose you. Just ask yourself what he has done for you all this years. Tolerating won't make things any better. You might as well get a dog then to have him as you other half, at least a dog can make you happy and is loyal to you. Get another guy and let him have a taste of his own medicine. Look, everyone is so supportive! Oya and talking about caring-driving 40km to you doesn't make him look any better. A cabbie can do that as well! I mean everyone!</p>

              <p>You BF does not Love you anymore. His heart is changed. A changed heart will not change back. So don't hope for anything except more abuse and more heartaches. Hope that the PRC will dump him and that he will come back to you? Then you are just asking to be further abused. If I am your bf, to me, since you are so sticky and so you will be just a convenient spare tyre around when he needs to get laid like an egg. He's just playing around with you condoning it and agreeing to the bad treatment. You are being used by him. I wonder when you will stand up and see your BF love the PRC and NOT YOU. So you shoudl change the title of this thread to YOUR BF has LEFT YOU FOR PRC and Seriously, you are a loser for sticking around asking for more bad treatment.  Make a clean break, take care of your own heart and yourself first.</p>
              <p>I feel like slapping some sense into you. I've heard of many stories of women who are willing to be abused, in bad relationships, used for sex, stick around as mistress, and then KPKB to everyone when they should have done what they should have...</p>

The PRC lady went back to China after her pass exipired but she was back lately to be with my boyfriend. My boyfriend still loves me and love him as well, but at the same time he also love the PRC woman.<span style="color: #ff0000;"> I suspect that the PRC woman is back in Singapore on a work permit but she is not working at all.

              <p>When a man fall in love with PRC gal, it is very hard for him to reawaken himself to reality. Once the score is 1-0, i guess the second half will be PRC gal 4 - Sg gal 0.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>PRC gal got the whitening feature, younger complex, nice shape, big ones, sweet cute native talk that can sway sg guy into the 7 heavens.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sg gal, darker due to weather, fat due to food, small and sag due to working stress, big lips and lack of sweet talk skill, and those with money and education are quite stuck up like me.  </p>
