You are <strong>NOT</strong> a lesbian unless you acknowledge and wants to be one. Even acting like has nothing to do - (Have a good friend who became a butch for popularity sake - don't ask me why, girls sch usually have such politics)<br><br>Before you define a lesbian, you must understand how a lesbian is form. There are many school of thoughts in this case, but mine will make you fully understand (at least a good insight - but of course, if you are a christian - you can stop reading totally and probably seek help from your pastor if things are getting harsh inside you. My theory would probably conflict with religions ones)<br><br>First, you have to believe in the existence of reincarntion. (If there was a God, no God will create a homosexual man/woman).<br><br>Next, you will understand basis science theory. (Like pole repel and unlike pole attracts)<br><br>Third, you have to understand simple maths theory. (Two negative equal positive. E.g. 1- -1 = 2. Positive + positive is still positive. E.g. 1+1 = 2 )<br><br>***<br><br>A soul and a body is different. Soul contains two energies - one mascline and one feminine. (Gonna skip another theory which will explain the existance of true love). During reincarnation, the soul and unite with the body - a life is created. What makes a person's gender can be explained by scientific means. (What XY, etc). Then after birth, a biological girl/guy is born.<br><br>Throughout countless of reincarnation - you will be re-born from man and woman or either one of them generally. For a lesbian to form, you must understand that a soul that is born many times of a woman will be a feminine soul. During one reincarnation and this soul is born a man - there will be a free will conscious decision later in teens stage. (Biological growth pouring in and Higher Twin Self theory seeking for other half). <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>This girl may feel more man than a woman - because biologically she is a woman, but her soul is inclinced towards the abundance of mascline energy. Astrology theory of South/North Nodes is applicable here. (South Nodes: we are familiar with what we are good at, our past, our achievement. But we receive zero growth because we have already been-there-done-that. North Nodes: This is where we must go. We must move to new areas, learn new things. But this area is dark and bleak. Future is uncertain. But if we never try, we never know)<br><br>In very simple words: This girl's soul, being very mascline, would want to revert back to its original feel and reject the current lesson of her being a woman. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Psychologically, people are more comfortable with things that they know and familiar with. This is same for the soul.</strong></span><br><br>Then all your psychological theory comes in - if your environment, blar blar blar, influence you, this will affect your decision to succumb to your soul. You acknowledge them, you became a lesbian and reject your biological gender. Then, emotional, mental and spiritual conflicts will hang around for as long as you re-accept your life lesson again.<br><br>What is a lesbian? A girl falling in love with another girl. Maths theory says two negative makes it positive. That's the reason why people are more comfortable in seeing lesbians than gays. (Woman are negative and man are positive).<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">But I thought falling in love must be unlike poles?</span><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> You are right. Only unlike poles attracts.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Then how come a girl fall in love with a girl?</span><br><br>Love is spiritual. The answer is your soul's energy. Mascline and feminine energy attracts. And since negative and negative = positive, girls are more prone to such thingy because it seemed 'more ok'. Both can be girls - but one has mascline soul and the other feminine soul.<br><br>****<br><br>Thinking of her is nothing. Everything is pure admiring on your part. You connect with her, but doesn't mean anything. Unless you wants to be - its all about free will and your decision. Some people don't have a choice - actually they have, but their situation is heavily link with their personal karma, it's difficult. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>
