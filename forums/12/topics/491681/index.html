              <p>I'm currently 18 years old. Enrolled in a private school, thus does not have a school counsellor. Currently working part-time along when schooling. </p>
              <p>I have a few issues, especially anger issues, eating disorder etc., and I can't cope with life. My childhood was messed up and I think that's why... anyone knows about the process/ what can I do to seek professional psychiatric/counselling help? Are there any affordable ones, as I do not want my parents to pay as I do not want them to know anything. I will be struggling financially but that's okay. Thank you so much</p>

              <p>You can give IMH a call info here:</p>
              <p><a href="https://www.imh.com.sg/contact-us/">https://www.imh.com.sg/contact-us/</a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There may be private instituation but i think government ones like IMH should be affordable. Youare 18 years of age so i think seeing doctor and paying bills on your on should be no problem?</p>
              <p>Give them a call and discuss about your situation. They should be able to advise how you can proceed from there.</p>
              <p>Otherwise you can also call S.O.S though i think they can still advise on non-emergency non-suicidal cases.</p>

              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Check out these guys from Chat Hub https://www.chat.mentalhealth.sg/ </span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">They are based out of Scape in Orchard and handle youths. Not sure how much they may charge, maybe nothing at all.</span></p>
              <p>But I do encourage you to speak to a family member, either parents, siblings or extended family. You may need some form of support at any point.</p>

              <p>You can seek help at your nearest Family Service Centre. Each neighbourhood should have one. They are staffed with social workers and other professionals that will be able to help you with your issues. I think it might be FOC, or at a very low rate, since they are meant to help people in need, and are funded by the government. http://app.msf.gov.sg/Policies/Strong-and-Stable-Families/Supporting-Families/Family-Service-Centres </p>
              <p>Also good job on seeking help! :) Stay strong. But I would also advise you to let your friends and family know of your struggles. The reason you don't want to share with them, i'm guessing, is because you don't want to burden them? But trust me they would very much prefer to help you with your difficulties. And social support is crucial for strengthening one's mental health. So do consider seeking help from them too, yea?</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>bro, stay strong, we are living in a very harsh society nowadays, things are hard but life isnt meant to be easy otherwise it would be pointless, look at things in a more positive view instead of negative (i know its easy to say this but really is feeling depressed, constantly reminding yourself that your childhood was messed up gonna do you any good?) I suggest you give yourself some time to reflect, do some therapeutic things like sweeping floor,washing stuffs, wiping stuff, jogging,running, as for the other issues like eating disorders, theres alot of eating disorders form, i think these issues can easily be solved by doctors or so, take care of yourself and try and stay positive, sometimes it doesnt have to be real positives, if you constantly remind yourself to be happy even when it seems impossible, after some time it will come true</p></div>

              <p>I think you should let your parents and family know about this issue. But you mentioned your childhood is messed up and that maybe that was the reason. Was it like child abuse or you aren't on good terms with your family?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you get pissed off easily, try to mix with friendly people, or not to get into situations that angers or frustrates you. About eating disorders do you just eat when you fell like it or when anger or frustration triggers it?</p>
