But after I went for a part-time counsellor course, I learnt to my surprise there is no such thing as 100% confidentiality... Let me explain why...<br><br>First, before a counselling session, the counsellor MUST tell the client there is NO promise of confidentiality and the client must accept before the session proceeds.<br><br>Confidentiality is maintained with respect to the SAFETY of the client, even though the client may hold it against the counsellor.<br><br>The counsellor cannot be with the client 24/7, so for cases where the client's or others' lives may be endangered, information CAN and MUST be revealed to the ppl involved...<br><br>Classic example, client is suicidal, so immediate family members must be informed in case client decides to ask family members for some sleeping pills and they give him/ her unwittingly...<br><br>Or client shares that she intends to take a chopper and kills her father who has abused her sexually since young, information must be divulged to the relevant authorities.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

They have a full teaching workload, plus other extra-curricular matters to attend to... It is to their credit they have the passion to volunteer their help... so please empathise before criticising...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>And counselling, just like any profession, needs lots of real-life practices... Seriously, how many certified counsellors have enough practice when they begin to work with their first client?
