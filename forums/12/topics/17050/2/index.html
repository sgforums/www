            <div class='col-md body'>Lestersia,<br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>The Zen teacher's dog loved his evening romp with his master. The dog would bound ahead to fetch a stick, then run back, wag his tail, and wait for the next game.<br><br>On this particular evening, the teacher invited one of his brightest students to join him - a boy so intelligent that he became troubled by the contradictions in Buddhist doctrine.<br><br>"You must understand," said the teacher, "that words are only guideposts. Never let the words or symbols get in the way of truth. Here, I'll show you."<br><br>With that the teacher called his happy dog. "Fetch me the moon," he said to his dog and pointed to the full moon.<br><br>"Where is my dog looking?" asked the teacher of the bright pupil.<br><br>"He's looking at your finger."<br><br>"Exactly. Don't be like my dog. Don't confuse the pointing finger with the thing that is being pointed at. "All our Buddhist words are only guideposts. Everyman fights his way through other men's words to find his own truth."<br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>This i cut and paste from somewhere.  The thing is your thinking is like the finger pointing to the moon.  all you need to do is live in the moment.  try breathing, it works.</div>

You just move on as life dictates you, and never ask why are you doing what you are doing now? Like some people say, you exist for the purpose of existing."<br><br>I wondered about this before 5 years back and never got myself any satis answer! i suppose it is just the attitude you choose to adopt in life! to find the your purpose or just to go with the flow! most of us just flow with others, buying car, condo...<br><br>It is good that you still look at the moon, and sky, although it is limited here!<br><br>just another quote for us to ponder!<br><br>"Twenties years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you didn't do than by the ones you did.
