            <div class='col-md body'>hahaha, so up till now, we have 2 people trying to make other people happy, 1 who is weaving out the purpose and 1 good-for-nothing who definitely needs to see a therapist or psyhcologist, .... but I wouldnt recommend Bear to that sicko.<br><br>Yes, if everyone on this earth can make it a point to make just one person very happy every day, conflicts will just be halved down in numbers.<br><br>But till now, no one can really convince him/herself what that sole purpose is. Some just walk away from that purpose in life, and decide to strike out on his/her own, some just get focused so much on the purpose and ended up in a mess or the wrong path. For myself, I am still seeking that purpose. Only recently, have I decided that the IT industry is not really for me and have decided to jump wagon.<br><br>I have known the purpose of humankind thru another participation of an association, that is achieving "peace through dialogue", that humankind of today is suffering, war, famine, violence, death, etc, and that they can start realising the hopes of peace and happiness through 1 step at a time, through action and culture, holding useful dialogues. It is negotiations that prevented a direct confrontation between India/Pakistan and Israel/Palestine. Those who forsake dialogues through violent actions resulted in terrorism to voice their thoughts like Osama.<br><br>So now, it comes down to , should we weave out our purpose for ourselves, or for others, or for both? and is that purpose all that is to it? when one stops to search for that answer, he/she is leading with no purpose, no life....<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>People stop to find that purpose in life and carry on what they are doing, sometimes being so monotonous that their personality start to decay, or come to a standstill. Goals are set every now and then to achieve some purpose, without that one purpose you will not have succeeded in anything. Ever heard someone tell you before, "You know, I still dont know what I want...."<br><br>But is that purpose solely yours to benefit while ignoring other sufferings or to benefit society. What we have benefited from society, we should also try to serve or give back something in return?<br><br>The moment of pause at every crossroads of your life, considering impt questions, like "your purpose in life is to ...??? what have i achieved??? " might help you to stay focus or re draw your life plans. Humans stray away from changes, resist changes, and once being comfortable, they hardly ask questions to see if they are doing the right things.<br><br>Remember when someone said that, you should go back to your own roots, now how many of us are really proud of our heritage and serve to strengthen that heritage. Do I call that our purpose too?<br><br>People want fun, want to enjoy, and they forsake the most basic of questions, that is, why are they born here? Is there a purpose of their existance here in the world?<br><br>alright maybe it sounds boring up till here coz it is just like having to attend a performance review with your supervisor every year but was that review worth it? to pause and check with your own performance, just like when I have put up the first question, What is the sole purpose in our life?<br><br>Well if you really shut yourself up in your own room in an one hour darkness and ask this question, perhaps you have a new insight to what you can/may do for your future life.<br><br>Live life, with a/some purpose/s and get on with it. Waste life, when you have no purpose at all.<br><br>Hahaha, till the end, while living my life fully, I am still searching that purpose  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

That's why it shapes our character and thoughts in life... Even if you clone a Hitler out again, he is highly unlike to be that charismatic as the one we read in our history...<br><br>Anyway, just some questions... how you know we have got spirits in us?? How you know we will go somewhere after we die?? It's because of your religious belief or encounter right? If you have been told that people just die off and that's the end from the very first place you will believe that too...<br><br>It's hard to imagine... but consider this... There was this email which my friend typed out, entitled if men were to menstrate... A friend read it and replied me, 'If men were to menstrate where will he be bleeding??' I was shocked to think he studies sociology.<br><br>I replied him, if men are to menstrate in the first place, it doesn't matter where he bleeds. He can spit the blood out or drip out from his fingers or ear or anywhere. The thing is that we see women bleed and we all know from where, but all this is because it's a set framework that women bleed and from 'there'. Without these mental framework, you will begin to think and find that almost anything can be a norm should it be done or be there in the first place..<br><br>think a little hard to understand horz.. but I'm not against you... just pointing out things that I learn.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by YawnYawn:</div><div class="quote_body">anyone thought of y we tink differently and thought of where our spirits come from???thin air ??

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello lesteria,<br>Like youself I have occupied myself in finding the answer to the meaning of life. And it is not just moments in which I indulge in such ontological thoughts.<br>Maybe you would like to share with me your thoughts on the meaning of life? Are you prepared to sacrifice " to discover the sole purpose of your existence?<br>And my reply to your question, not all humans are programmed to live in that postulated manner. Some philosophers spend their entire life dedicated to unlocking the secrets of the universe.<br>And if humans were said to be programmed, then what is this experience of freewill that i, as a human, experience? Perhaps I am not human? For we do not see the freewill in others except in ourselves, makes us Gods.<br>Weird is it not, why did this message appear?</div>

It was round and bright, all i was doing was breathing very slowly under the moonlight.  the wind was blowing the clouds across the moon, and when they passed the moon, they light up like little illuminated fluffs.<br><br>So what is your purpose in life?  It's only fair if you share them with us.  promise i won't make fun or laugh at your sole purpose.<br></div>
