            <div class='col-md body'>this is something which i've observed and experienced myself. consider this:<br><br>there's a girl who's interested in you. along the course of her friendship with you, she pays special attention to you, often taking the first step to come and have a chat with you. she drops you hints that she's interested, sms you regularly, buys you xmas gifts etc.<br><br>you, on the other hand, are undecided. you do feel something for her, but don't know if you should really carry this relationship any further. when you finally reach the decision to give it a try, u reciprocate to her hints, and, in no time, you two are together.<br><br>your status is supposedly "lifted" from a platonic friend to that of a boyfriend. what we normally understand from the status of "boyfriend" is that it is an exclusive and privileged level attainable only by that special individual. HOWEVER, contrary to that belief, a "boyfriend" status usually only means a massive downgrade from your previous platonic relationship with her.<br><br>for example, that special attention which she gave to you previously would no longer be there. in your normal group meetings, she would be chatty and friendly to other friends (guys in particular) and you would most probably be left out.<br><br>she ceases to sms you (but expect u to sms her first). she dun ask you out (you got to ask her out). and if you don't take those initiative, she doesn't give a damn too. it's like you've got to do all the work. and in the first place, she was interested in you first.<br><br>any comments? any others with such experiences?</div>
