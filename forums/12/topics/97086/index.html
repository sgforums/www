Not sure why... perhaps becos i had my frens who are going with me... the tot of studing with them really excites me....<br><br>In Australia, it is a good experience... however, not in paper qualifications... it's the environment, the new friends and the independence that you enquire throughout the whole study program.....<br><br>I seriously think that a paper qualification from Australia <strong>does not stand out </strong>now in Singapore... if i were you, i will take the job offer... check if there is any personal upgrading program for employees in that company.... if there is, so much more the better....<br><br>Anyway, it's a hard choice..... good luck.....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have 2 groups of friends, some egging me on to go to Perth, but then I ask myself after I'm back then what? Will spending that 90K there be worth it? Another group is telling me to screw the degree, right now even grads can't find jobs left alone you. Having a job come knocking on your door is indeed a rare opportunity.<br><br>They both have their fair share of hits and misses, I don't wanna be firing blanks and end up regretting...which makes it all the more confusing and fustrating, I asked virtually everyone I know, and somehow I just can't come to a satisfying decision. I would want to take the job but I face mounting pressure (from parents) as well to get a degree...<br><br>I'm utterly stressed out... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"></div>

You can try applying the job as a writer as what you mentioned.. Leaving next feb, from now is at least 4 mths.. Since you quiting in Nov, you still have Dec, Jan and maybe a little of feb to see if the job as a writer will be good enough for you.. You need to know that tuning and modification of cars may not be all that is required.. There may be other things that is "hidden" for you to figure and find out..<br><br>Or, you can go to perth and pursue your degree, coming back with that degree will maybe earn you more than what you maybe earning as a writer.. In this case, it depends from individual to individual..<br><br>Personally, i will pursue the earlier.. I am that sort who would rather do something that i enjoy rather than stick to something.. which may although bring me better benefits to me, but don enjoy doing..<br><br>Good luck.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

I would be pursing a degree in Media Studies over there. IÂ’m currently employed as a PR executive right now, quitting in November. I actually made up my mind about going there despite the negativity surrounding the issue. Until one dayÂ…<br><br>I received a message in my blog from a well know car magazine in Singapore, they were looking for a writer, just the thought of working in a magazine that involved car modifications and tuning tempted me and left me sleepless for nights on end. The thought of forgoing my studies and pursing my dream bounced around in my head. What was I to do?<br><br>I weighed the pros and cons of my decision. In the end I was still left with the same situation. There is no win-win formula. ItÂ’s more like nothing risked nothing gained.<br><br>If I do take the job offer, I would be finally attaining one of my biggest dreams of finally writing for a car magazine while fulfilling my undying passion for cars. I probably be able to afford my own set of wheels seeing which the job requires me to have one.<br><br>If I do go to Perth then what? A degree need not necessarily guarantee me anything, but itÂ’s still a paper qualification. ItÂ’s concrete and proof that I achieved a certain level of accomplishment in what I studied so far. I could return and hopefully find a well-paying job. Would I want that?<br><br>After all the main reason why I wanted to pursue my degree was to get a better job and perhaps work in something related to cars, what dumb luck huh? The pay they are offering is extremely attractive, it encompasses lots of car subsidies to ensure I can comfortably afford a car and maintain oneÂ…this is so difficult a decision to make..<br><br>I shouldnÂ’t pass this chance up right? How many people can choose their jobs? Or even have their jobs find them? What is the possibility of me working in this line if I do come back? How many people get to go overseas to study? Who is that fortunate? IÂ’m extremely confused as what should my next move beÂ…Studies or Career?<br><br>Should I fail in my job, thatÂ’s another half a year wasted in waitingÂ…should I go for my degree I might never work in the car industry ever againÂ…Someone help me!<br></div></blockquote>Choose the job and take up the job offer. You can always return to study anytime if you are not doing well in the job or you miss studying.<br><br>The course, textbooks, assignments, teachers and school are always going to be there. But such an attractive job offer doesn't comes by easily, so treasure that opportunity and grab onto it. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>
