If a man cant do that, is he ready to be in a responsible relationship?  </div></blockquote>petti,<br><br>The gist of the problem is the fact he trivialised your feelings. You said it yourself.<br><br>No, it's not acceptable for a guy to trivialise his partner's feelings.<br><br>It's not so much the flirtatious act, but what happens after that. If he truly apologises and is embarrassed and goes out of the way to show that he's truly sorry, I am sure you two would have made up by now.<br><br>The issue at hand is I think your bf is likely to be discontented with the relationship, and perhaps both of you have underlying problems which need to be addressed, and this "7-11" issue is only the tip of the iceberg.<br>I am not saying who's right and who's wrong here.<br><br>Indeed, a responsible man should not sulk and let the relationship go to the dogs. He is kind of hiding in his cave right now.<br><br>Two further points:<br>Is the flirtatious act acceptable? Well, I would say that strictly speaking, those men/women with partners should not flirt, but that's the ideal scenario. We live in an imperfect world, and all human beings have weaknesses. As long as we learn to recognise that we are weak, then can we try to work around it and improve ourselves. Guys obviously have a harder time keeping their eyes off sexy women, not that it doesn't happen the other way around of course.<br><br>So the answer is it is not acceptable, but people have weaknesses, as do you. So the key thing is how a guy/gal handles the aftermath. In this case, your bf disappoints you greatly, and rightly so.<br><br>Another point, I have learnt that unless a guy is gay, there's no way he can ignore other girls. He is just building a lot of pressure in himself, and that's unhealthy. Ignoring other girls to prove his faith is unworkable, and may result in an imbalance of sexual feelings, which may create an uncontrollable avalanche later. It's okay to feel sexually attracted to another person, but how you handle the attraction is then another matter. Denying the sexual attraction is unworkable.<br><br>Hope that helps.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by FocusPoint:</div><div class="quote_body">Many a times women has this notion of a 'perfect love' or perfect relationship that must be smooth sailing all the way. But in reality there is no such thing of a perfect relationship. Every lasting relationship will always have their ups and downs and will always go through many many trials and errors.<br><br>Dare my wife and I claim we have a perfect marriage even though we have waded through almost 2 decades of trials and errors? Nope we didn't. But we count our blessing that we are still together and happy. There is still a long future ahead of us that will still continue to test our love for each other. What do we do? We will continue to face it together. Come what may we will try to overcome it.<br><br>There was a time in my life I was looking at other women! Why? I don't know honestly. Not that I don't love my wife and sons or got bored with them. It was an unexplainable phase I was going through. Surprisingly my wife saw it and instead of making a fuss or screaming and shouting about it she helped me overcame that phase. That is how good and understanding she was and still is. For that I do thank her from the bottom of my heart.<br><br>Now, if one day she is going to go through the same phase I went through. Will I be there to help her or will I straight away penalise and blame her? You bet I will do what she has done for me and help her through that phase too.<br><br>People go through changes in their lives all the time. And that is a fact not a myth. Learn to recognize these signs and help that person you love to cope with the changes instead of instantly pinpointing his/her faults.<br><br>TS, remember there is no such thing as perfect love. If you can't even withstand this small trial then I suggest you evaluate this relationship thoroughly before continuing on. Otherwise in the long run you will suffer and so will your boyfriend.<br><br></div></blockquote>I think this is the best piece of advice I've read here so far, obviously from someone who has been there, that is very useful to me and to those people in relationships.<br><br>Everyone has weaknesses, and it is important to work to overcome such weaknesses.<br><br>And there's no such thing as perfect love indeed.<br><br>Well said.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>lady,<br><br>aren't you making a fu*cking big deal out of this ? so what if she's sexier? Don't you have confidence in yourself? Maybe it's really true she is sexier than you. Then you should do something about your looks. But if you have a great personality, who cares? Maybe ur guy is just patronising the woman.<br><br>what's funny is you let a simple comment by a stranger make you feel insecure instead of trusting your boyfriend or even trusting yourself? That's very unattractive and a no-no for a relationship to be happy.<br><br>the choice is clear: break or don't break. Up to you. You don't expect to be attached to a man and then start to control him. And neither should men try to control their women.<br><br>doko</div>

The problem here is not wat he said that triggered you... It all boils down to one thing; you're insecure and you don't trust him..<br><br>So yes.. maybe he's not the guy for you<br><br>Frankly, when a guy is flirty, it doesn't mean he's gonna go round cheating on you...</div>
