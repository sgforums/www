May be you need to get to know him more to find out.   Ultimately, it is trust we have to build on relationship.   Just watch to see if there is any of such similar encounter occuring.   Probably, you would see better for yourself if you were present when such words came from his mouth.  Listen to words and his body language, more or less you can tell his intention.   Probably the next time you goes there again you can hide in one corner to see and hear what he says to the staff there.</div>
