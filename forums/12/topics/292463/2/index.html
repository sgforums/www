What you said make me recalled what happened to my past relationship.   My ex boss was the one who saw how good and great interest/liking my ex had for me so I was encouraged to go with him.   Guess what, she was the one who said she saw him intimately with another gal.  Well, I finally broke up with that jerk.  However, before that by observing my ex and based on my gut feeling I had decided to break off with him and then words from my ex boss just expedited my break off with him.<br><br>It depends how close the bf is with those around him, I believe to some friends the bf will reveal almost everything to them.<br><br></div>
