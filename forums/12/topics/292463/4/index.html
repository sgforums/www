            <div class='col-md body'>With the greatest respect to some well-intended postings, I find some of the views here absolutely laughable. If you're going to follow them, I'd be amazed if this relationship of yours would even last another 6 months (well, maybe exaggerated, but you get the drift), much less a lifetime (if that's even your ultimate aim). Ultimately, this is another example of a relationship founded on the basis of <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic;">insecurity</span></span></strong>.<br><br>For a start, whatever your take is on the incident, you're pretty much entitled to it. That said, I just can never fathom how affirming a belief on the basis of someone else's views (so what if your mutual friends vouch for his (un)faithfulness? ultimately, it's what you think that matters) or adopting a tit-for-tat approach (as some have foolishly suggested that you do "not commit fully" to this relationship - look, if you aren't going to commit, why not just call it a day? it's going to do both of you a world of good, instead of sparking a tit-for-tat war) would actually rectify this problem. While the facts of the circumstances are seemingly innocuous to me, you could interpret it very differently - which you're entitled to do, obviously.<br><br>That said, this is <strong>your</strong> relationship - not mine or your mutual friends' - and ultimately, it's you who will be taking full stock and responsibility for what comes out of it. It's pretty much senseless for you to seek the validation or repudiation of whatever your values or perception of this incident to be - ultimately, if this incident is unacceptable to you, it wouldn't matter an iota if everyone told you it's actually pretty harmless.<br><br>The least you could do - if you believe this relationship is still special and worth something - is give this a fair shot at working by ironing out the differences with your beau through the communication of your fears and worries. By that, I don't mean communicating nonsensical ideas like ensuring equality and playing on each other's insecurity (your beau, from your description, is hardly a secure person to begin with) through reasoning that he shouldn't have done what he did because he wouldn't be ready to put up with something similar involving you and another guy. Ultimately, all relationships are founded on the basis of give-and-take and an inherent problem that seems to surface in many insecure relationships often stem from both parties wanting to take more than they're prepared to give.<br><br>On the other hand, if you believe this relationship to be condemned beyond salvation, you might just want to call a halt to proceedings - either way, I'm sure you wouldn't want either course of action to be a result of anyone's influence other than yours and yours exclusively. That way, at least it'd be much easier for you to live with your own decision even if you should get it wrong. Do yourself a favour and start having more faith in your convictions and actions regardless of how you perceive this incident.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Many a times women has this notion of a 'perfect love' or perfect relationship that must be smooth sailing all the way. But in reality there is no such thing of a perfect relationship. Every lasting relationship will always have their ups and downs and will always go through many many trials and errors.<br><br>Dare my wife and I claim we have a perfect marriage even though we have waded through almost 2 decades of trials and errors? Nope we didn't. But we count our blessing that we are still together and happy. There is still a long future ahead of us that will still continue to test our love for each other. What do we do? We will continue to face it together. Come what may we will try to overcome it.<br><br>There was a time in my life I was looking at other women! Why? I don't know honestly. Not that I don't love my wife and sons or got bored with them. It was an unexplainable phase I was going through. Surprisingly my wife saw it and instead of making a fuss or screaming and shouting about it she helped me overcame that phase. That is how good and understanding she was and still is. For that I do thank her from the bottom of my heart.<br><br>Now, if one day she is going to go through the same phase I went through. Will I be there to help her or will I straight away penalise and blame her? You bet I will do what she has done for me and help her through that phase too.<br><br>People go through changes in their lives all the time. And that is a fact not a myth. Learn to recognize these signs and help that person you love to cope with the changes instead of instantly pinpointing his/her faults.<br><br>TS, remember there is no such thing as perfect love. If you can't even withstand this small trial then I suggest you evaluate this relationship thoroughly before continuing on. Otherwise in the long run you will suffer and so will your boyfriend.<br><br></div>

He went into the store while you waited for him outside. Waited for a few seconds and decided to go in to join him.<br><br>The convenience store keeper, a rather plump yet sexy malay girl said to you "guess what did you bf said to me.  i was asking him is that sexy girl outside your gf, and he told me "not as sexy as you""<br><br>Is this betrayal?  Is this acceptable to you?</div></blockquote>hi, hope i am not too late in this thread, well i am a guy but i do find this unacceptable. this is what we call lack of discipline. bear in mind...please understand the real meaning of discipline. dont call yourself you are disciplined enough even though you have been loving and caring, never misses any dates or late for anything but behind his or her back, did something small flirtatious act like that.... thats absurd you know.<br><br>well to all, guys and girls alike, cant you commend about the strengths or good points of ur loved ones in front of others. well i am not saying we have to lie or what....if he or she has some weakness in anything, just confront them and tell them nicely....not in front of others. it also sounds like making fun of your loved ones, though you didnt mean it in the first place. you made fun of that malay girl rite, at the same time, you successfully did the same damage to your loved ones, do you know that?<br><br>well, try to fit in other people's shoes, if you cannot accept that behaviour by your loved ones, then better stop doing that or even contemplating of doing it. well i quite disagree with some people here saying you can love your loved ones but dont trust him or her totally. to me, you have to trust him or her, otherwise no point to be together, its suffocating everyday wondering what he or she has done behind my back. but what i wanna stress here is trust with your heart...as long not blindly then its acceptable.<br><br>but i do agree with some people here saying there are no perfect couples, we make mistakes and hence we shouldnt jump into conclusion too early. make sure he realises his mistake, tell him dont repeat this act anymore...coz giving him death sentence too early is not fair....anyway just my point of view here....remember....whatever you say counts, so be careful on what you say to anyone ok. cheers. wish you all the best in your relationship.</div>
