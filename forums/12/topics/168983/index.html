If you leave the house without informing her, she might lodge a police report or she will be worried sick about you.<br><br>You should discuss with her on your thoughts and persuade her that you are already a grown up and you are able to take care of yourself. Remember, in your parents eyes, you are always a child to them! All parents think this way. Hope this advise is of full use to you. Thanks!<br></div>

And at least a way for her to contact you (provided that she doesn't abuse it)... Afterall, you're her daughter and it's only natural that she could be concerned?</div>

Define bad terms, have it gone to a point of physical abuse?<br><br>Actually you're of legal age to move out on your own to stay.<br>But if your mother files a Missing Person Report on you, it will be recorded in your name for the rest of your life.<br><br>I don't quite understand. Youre in bad terms with her.<br>You want to move out.<br>She wants to/ she will find you.<br><br>That means it's not really in bad terms afterall?<br></div>

You wish to move out, plus your legal age. The case will likely be on your side.<br><br>Your mother cannot do anything because you're already protected by law. In any case, you might want to bring her to civil court, it is possible.<br><br>Cheers</div>
