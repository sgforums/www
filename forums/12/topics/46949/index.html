The real reason is due to two possible reasons.<br><br>I) Spiritually, you are empty  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>II) Emotionally, you are empty.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>You feel that when in company, you enjoy it - but the minute you come out of it, sorrow seemed to fill you for some unseen reasons. Generally, this is what people calls it the 'you think too much.' - but I shall say this: <strong>'There is disapointment in life is because there is desire in life. If there is no desire, there will be no disapointment, in turn, there will be simple happiness</strong>.'  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>
