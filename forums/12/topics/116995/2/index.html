            <div class='col-md body'>I been in your situation before. I met my friends church friend in zouk. We were dancing closely. She held my shoulders and she held my waist while we were dancing. I held her hand and lead her when she need to go to the comfort room. End of the night, I send her back. I was ABIT interested in her then, maybe can say it's a passing crush, we kept contact after that day and we date a couple of times. Eventually, we still remain as friends till now. Now, don't get this idea you are falling for her or she's into you now. My advice to you is too stay busy, and whenever you are free or not, tell her you are busy, see her reactions. When she sms you, tell her you are busy. Play hard to get. Now MAYBE she's interested in you. Boy, you have to play hard to get with her. You control her. Just act busy. Now don't spoil this golden chance telling her you like her all that shit. You will regret. Wait for her. Now you have to play lil' hard to get with her.

I never told her I liked her at all even though initally i liked her back then. We are still friends now, ocasionally still going out as a friend. She asked me out for the past two weeks to catch a movie, but was busy with my school and work. Three times to be exact she asked me out for a date. And at one time, she smsed me and commented " You very busy hor". Then I replied, "Yeah lor... tuesday sat and sunday got work, and the rest school lor...<br><br>Something funny happened when I was at work today. There was this gal whom I approached at cosy bay (Kallang) Christmas eve. She's a waitress down there. The reason why I approached was because my friend had a bet with me If I were to get her number, he would treat me to Jack's place. What I did I did an eye contact to her and go up to her and introduce myself and asked her name. *Next* I got her no.<br><br>And guess what? I din't know she has a boyfriend untill today, the boyfriend called me up and asked me whether I was free today, I said no. I'm working. And asked me whether I'm going down to cosy bay tonight, I said no. I asked him what happened? He said nevermind.<br><br>Obviously her boyfriend is feeling so unsecure and not confident. I guess this gal whom I approached must have told her how I managed to get her number. That's the problem with we guys nowadays, does this action justify that we guys make the girlfriends feel insecure?<br><br>If I were the bf, I just don't give Fcuk what happened or how rather that night. I'm confident of myself, of what I do, what I am.<br><br>Later on, she smsed me, apologised to me about her boyfriends behaviour.<br><br>Hope we learn something from this event.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Woah... this is like really turning to a hot debat session.. You know what? it hard to know what the other party is thinking... so normally guys, Being guys, just does want to throw away all his pride and also does not want to act like a SOB. so he just plays it cool hoping that he can catch a hint on what the other party is trying to say. Its not that we are playing with feelings or not prepared.. its just ... ladies are not as transparent as they think they are and expect us to know everything? No hard feelings.. We all just want to prevent an nasty situation  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

I told you to do what exactly what i meant. Now you screwed everything up by telling her you have feelings for her. I told you to act busy right? By doing this I can say you pratically give yourself 0% chance from progressing to more than friends. I advised you to move on and find a new chick. That's what you GUYS ALWAYS MAKE THIS SILLY MISTAKE. LOOK AT YOU. YOU ARE A FAILURE. LOOK AT MY ADVICE AGAIN ON TOP. ABSORB IT.</div>

Should have continue to go out get to know her more before the confession.<br><br>1) If she's toying, then she will be happy u fall in her trap liao  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>2) If she serious, she might think twice now...cos u confessed too soon (only after meeting twice...might be frighten of the speed of development   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>3) happy ending  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Anyway, too few inputs to be certain which direction it will go.<br><br>Just "shun qi zhi ran" and in time will "sui ruo shi chu" one....so  hope for the best prepared for the worst....<br><br>Good luck</div>
