            <div class='col-md body'>Weekend... Was at a friend's BBQ chalet... Invited a female friend of mine to join me as she was having some problems.. Was chatting through down there...<br><br>She couldn't stay for the night. My original plan was to stay in the chalet for the night as she was living pretty nearby the place and I'm living at the other corner of Singapore...<br><br>Finally... We both left together... I was pretty tired and I didn't really want her to walk the way out all alone...<br><br>When I was out of there, I met up with my gf... She told me a story...<br><br>One of her friends was down at the same chalet. Saw me and sms her. Told her that I was having an affair outside and trying to do something funny outside in the chalet behind her back.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>When my gf told her to calm down and that everything's not like what my gf's friend thought, she insisted that there's something fishy... Volunteered to go down to catch us (me and my friend) at the chalet... When my gf's still not convinced, she insisted to ask her out one day to 'tell her more things'...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>Shucks...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  Thinking back, it's really quite important to have a good foundation and quite a great amount of trust in relationship these days... Otherwise don't know when your relationship might just end thanks to some 'friends'?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>My thought gone back to another chalet I went to the other time... A friend's birthday... My ex back then insisted that I leave the chalet... Asked me to join her for clubbing instead... Later even claimed to be sick...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  What she said back then really pissed me off much... She said I wasn't there for the chalet but for a f*ck with the sl*tty girls down there (even name some of them...)... YES... I was quite PISSED... You can say and think WHATEVER you want of me, but NO RIGHTS to JUMP TO CONCLUSION and INSULT my friends like that....<br><br>Anyway, it's all over...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

Thus the reasons for me to be putting up this thread...<br><br>1. Not all things said by others can be trusted. Not even when they're your best friends. They might not be out to harm you and in fact trying to protect you, but they might be doing things the wrong way... Ultimately, it's YOUR relationship at STAKE...<br><br>2. Do NOT doubt your partner unnecessarily. If there is a need to, find out more before jumping into a conclusion. The worth of your relationship, the trust for each other.. How much is it all worth? Is it worth it?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My ex-girlfriend broke off with me, was partly due to some gossips behind me. Her friends, or so-called my classmates then, didn't know me well, and they jumped to conclusions and sort of convinced her to leave me.<br><br>Funny. What do these people have to gain? Satisfaction? Or more gossips and rumours?<br><br>From long ago, I knew that gang were always gossiping about every single person in the school. Hence, I was always quiet when they were exchanging rumours and all. After we broke off, I knew my ex-girlfriend was one of their hottest topics as well. Well, and yet she trusted them so much?<br><br>What's more funny was, she used to tell me how she didn't really enjoy their company.<br><br>Humans.<br><br>But anyway, that was more than 2 years back.
