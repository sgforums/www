              Devoted girl,  
              
              I feel you.  Want to move on also hard right now cos of the emotions.  When time of month coming even more worse... cry n cry... cry until want to die.
              
              I cannot sell the flat lah, no family at all, i sell then I gotta rent room, and the rental is so exp nowadays... it will be alot more exp than what i pay for my flat now thru CPF sia.
              
              Maybe we 2 can go bowling together...  My friends don't play.  And I know bowling abit is cos my hb is pro player...

              By the way, my hb and his woman - i no idea what they are up to also, i heard from my friends that she is not properly divorced yet, as she is counter-filing against her own husband for adultery.  then she n my hb - not adultery?  very funny.
              
              
              I hope my hb will file the div papers lo, otherwise more $ out of my pocket... I alr pay, pay n pay during e 5 yrs he jobless... and I owe ppl $ also... now I still paying debts, bank loans and the bills...  while he so good life, everytime go eat good food w his woman ah.
              
              He treat her so good, go KL, go batam when he only start date her... with me he don't even celebrate birthday or anniversary. its always me celebrate his b'day for him... I got nothing.
              
              I only scare he don't want file and wait for me to file... then more $ fly... more stress for me.

              I hope you can get over your own hb also, slowly see how you want to go about it.
              
              I don't know what I will do if my hb decide to come back to me lo, v scare of him... 7 yrs of being scolded in public, his jobless state landing me in debt... 
              
              I also trying to improve my looks, but e pimple scars on my face won't go away although I managed to lose weight - hopefully soon will go down to my pre-marriage weight.
              
              Holidays cannot afford for now, I am not like my hb so hao ming - no need be responsible for anything de.
              
              I won't put their photo in FB, let God decide their karma...  If I am lucky, God will let me watch.

              <p>The Starter Wife.</p>
              <p>A man's first wife that (usually) marries out of love and helps him achieve wealth, power, etc., but is then promptly discarded upon reaching said goal for a younger more attractive woman. Can sometimes result in the starter wife getting half.</p>
              <p>Example..As soon as he made his first million, Donald (Trump) left his starter wife for a young Slavic model named Melania, which cost him half.</p>

              Flat - yes, joint tenancy - bo bian; we bought when we still only 26, 23 that time...  he is older than me lah.  I checked w HDB liao; they said I cannot have sole ownership until I turn 35, bloody hell :(  I changed lock already, and he is fuming with me.
              
              Actually 7 years I stupid lor - he got my ATM card so he just take money when he wants.  Same I got his ATM card la, but I never use it also since he left me.  I don't want him say I 'stealing' his money - since I finally cut my POSB account and he cannot access my bank acct liao.

              In the end; after marriage - he revert back to his old self and I am 'trapped' liao... 
              
              Haiyah, I guess to men, 'forever' really means 7-8 years lo, except the really good men like my dad (despite my mum being a 'tigress' he still loves her w/o complain).

              <p>What he will do to you is not much of a problem..</p>
              <p>The question is.. what will YOU allow him to do to you?</p>
              <p>With low self-esteem.. you will likely believe you don't deserve to be treated better. And will continue to let him manipulate and hurt you.</p>
              <p>As Devotedgal mentioned... you need to raise your self-esteem.</p>
              <p>When you allow a man to treat you badly, chances are.. he will.</p>
              <p>When you detach from him emotionally , he will no longer be able to hurt you.</p>

              I am picking myself the last week.  
              
              and ya, I gonna be strong.  All in all, i decide i won't keep the flat le.  Else very hard to move on.
              
              I already got a housing agent and lawyer on standby liao.  Once hb contact me I will let him know I want sell the flat (70-30 maybe)... then file for divorce.
              
              Will have to find a room in Bedok to rent (nearer to workplace).
              
              Then.... slowly sew my heart back together and see how :)
              
              Thanks so much my dear online friends - you all have been a constant encouragement to me since I came in here.  If got a chance; would to meet you all face-to-face and give you guys a treat.

              <p>TS, Try to settle your emotion using logic. What kind of a husband is this? Instead of supporting you financially he is a burden to you, Instead of loving you, he is hurting you , there is no sex etc. This is a guy that is all minus and no plus at all. When you finally walk out of this mess, you will be glad you did so.</p>
              <p>Regarding the flat, if you really don't want to sell, you can let him file using separation. After 3 years, when he file for divorce using separation, you contest, this will give you another year. By then, you would reach the age of 35 and qualify to own the HDB flat by yourself. But be prepared to buy out his share though, so start saving.</p>
