              I need opinions on what to do.
              
              My husband have left me for his friend (he call her his godsister).  This woman is in the midst of getting a divorce (her 2nd) and she has 2 teens to support.
              
              My husband had sex before with other women during our marriage when I was working night shift and he was jobless - he had asked his female friends to come our flat.  When I asked him about it, he denied it, so I let the matter slide after he accused me of trusting my best friend more than I trust him.
              
              Now he has walked out on me in Jan'13.  He said he wants a divorce as he no longer love me.  He said I am boring, can't cook well, stingy (because I can't afford to buy a motorbike for him) and too stupid in bed.  Also that I am ugly and fat and nag too much.
              
              I was not aware that he was actually dating another woman until during CNY when my higher being made me check his email account (my husband had insisted I memorise his passwords).  And I found a photo he send to her calling himself her husband.
              
              He said he will file for divorce after he moved his things out of our flat, and that he wants to sell the flat.
              
              Can someone please tell me if he can actaully divorce me?  If the flat is sold; I will be homeless.

              I am seeing a church counselor now.  My hsuband refused to see the counselor with me though.  I don't want a divorce, but it seems I do not have a choice :(            <blockquote>

              <p>Good that you are meeting a counsellor.</p>
              <p>But, you would need one with financial and law background to handle the issue.</p>
              <p>Nothing wrong about having divorce as you have no love for each other.</p>
              <p>I know it is against the policy of some religion.</p>
              <p>But, you should take control of your life and formulate a new and better chapter in your life.</p>
              <p>It is not a sign of failure or weakness, just making a decision to pursue happiness for yourself.</p>

              Thank you for everyone's advice.  At this moment, I am not sure how to go about seeking a lawyer - financial wise, I am quite broke right now. 
              
              He used up all my savings and I am still in debt to a few banks because I took some loans to tide us over the periods when he was jobless.  
              
              Now that he left me; I am just starting to save up again, $50 when I can afford to - since I am paying all the bills/loans myself right now.  His phone line is under my name and I am paying for him, at least until the contract for the line ends...  Maybe everyone thinks I am pathetic for still trying to protect him.
              
              I honestly still love him; but on his part I understand that he totally have no feelings for me left.  And honestly it hurts a lot, because I really commit my all to this marriage of 7 years.
              
              I just keep wondering what I do so wrong for him to walk out on me.  He said everything is my fault - his job-hopping, his loss of interest in me...

              To TS,
              
              You have to prepare to engage a lawyer if needed.
              
              In the event that he should file for a divorce, you need a lawyer to protect your interest. Or someone who know the process and can protect your rights.

              Dear all,  Thanks so much for your replies.
              
              Some points I have failed to mention:
              - We do not have kids.
              - I know I should be the one filing; but I want to keep the flat.  He can stay with his mistress while I only have this flat.  
              
              To TehJarVu: I will check the link for lawyer from you earlier, thank you.
              
              As far as I have checked, I can only keep this flat on my own when I turn 35 years old.  I am only 31 now :(
              
              I think he will go through LAB (Legal Aid Bureau) to file for divorce - but I don't know on what grounds he can file against me.  While if I were to file; I can say he is committing adultery.  But if I file, I lose this flat.   That's why I am waiting for him to file.
              
              
              To BotaHead: I doubt he will come back to me - as I can see from his photos with that woman - he is very happy - in fact he is happier with than when he was with me.
              
              I must have been blind to not see that he isn't happy in this marriage.  All the signs were there:
              - constant job hopping
              - blaming me for everything that goes wrong for him
              - not wanting sex since years back
              
              I want to get on with my life; but I can't get him out of my mind!  How do I just stop thinking of this man?
              
              People keep tell me to get on with life, that he is not worth it.  But for 10 years; I keep thinking I wasn't good enough for him and he tells me the same also.  My self esteem is at rock bottom; somedays I don't know why I still bother living.

              Dear Devoted Gal8888,
              
              
              Thank you so much for sharing for me.  I am seeing a 'mirror' here.
              
              We stayed in this 3-rm HDB flat for near 7 years already.  So definately can sell.  I am paying the loan on this flat since May 2011 - after his CPF got depleted, but be4 that we were both paying 50-50 on the loan.  And yes, we are both HPS insured.
              
              I have photos of them close tgt and also his FB messages to her and emails... (FB n emails - not I spy, but cos he insisted I memorise his passwords - and he hasn't bothered to change them... weird). -- so mean I can sue, but I rather not waste my money since I only just start saving again.
              
              I can't stand talking to him right now; I don't even want to see him.  Thinking about him make me cry (at work, at home, on transport - like you)  And somehow I know the minute I see him I will start crying and begging him to come back - that is how pathetic I am.
              
              What I am doing right now - 
              
              1) Checking with AWARE if I can do a follow up on the legal aid clinic - cos the last time I went, I thought I was the one who had to file, but now I am told to let him file - cos he wants the divorce.
              
              2) Finding things to occupy myself - reading, trying new recipes, eating LOTS of ice cream, go jogging... etc.  My friends got sick of me lamenting about him/her and told me to help myself first... Maybe I will go back study again also.
              
              3) Saving up what money I can put aside - so that I can hire a lawyer when the time comes to fight.
              
              4) Prayers... I trust God to take care of this His way.
              __________
              
              If he choose to come back:
              
              I know I can't harp about the past if I accept him back.  This is the hard part; cos its so difficult not to think backward.  I am not sure what I will do actually.  My friends predict that I will straight open door and let him home :(  Not a very good thought to me.  I feel if I do that I am weak - becoz I won't even know if he truly change or not right.
              
              **Devoted Gal8888, you need to stay strong also ok?  I am cheering you on.  And thank you again for the advice - to make me think.  God bless you!
