            <div class='col-md body'>Personally I don't see the point of a time out.  If there's a problem, both of you should work on it immediately to solve it.  Why drag a problem out?  Worse, a time out without any objective? Problems won't settle by itself.<br><br>Anyway since a time out is imposed, I guess you just gotta wait till he tells you he's ready to give it another try?  Which puts you in a weaker negotiating position, don't you think?<br><br>I feel if you both still love each other, both of you have to reach a compromise on how much time to give each other and to the relationship.  An agreement could be, for example, during office hours you are not to call or message him at all, because he's too busy.  And you must not feel that he's neglecting you during this period - he simply needs to concentrate on work.<br><br>But during weekends together, he must make the effort to reciprocate on the "little gestures" like SMSs and the like, because they mean something to you.<br><br>Don't feel that it's ALL your fault lah... he was wrong to lose his temper although he was stressed out.  But a failed relationship is due to actions of both parties .  Don't think only you're in the wrong, or you're the "bad person", else you're just setting yourself up to be taken advantage of.  Stay calm and think things through carefully, logically, and things will work out to a good conclusion (although break or patch , can never tell).<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Prec|ous:</div><div class="quote_body">I cannt share his burden, n i could only sms to await him to cool down or i dunnoe.. yes, blame it on my own stupidities as claimed, if it realli fail n he wanna gif up, i really dunnoe wat i could do.
