I think we both nid peace for all the happenings especially him. If one fine day, he still haf me in his heart, he will be back. If he is fated to be mine, he will be mine, if not..haiz...but i dun think he will wann continue wif me anymore since he say until like that we should haf break last time. he shouldnt be given me chances n i think he proved that his theory is correct. Im not gd enuff for him to maintance the whole r/s. He wun haf time for me. I really regretted for supporting him wif this job as well. Everything changes...why everytime when i reall put effort into a r/s, it strains. Other couple could alway break n patch break n patch n therefore live happily everafter.But not mine...<br><br>I noe i should move on, im doing so...but at heart matters, i dun think that will heal fast.Im juz a pathetic failure whose veridct is death penalty now. Thanks for all ppl here giving me all advices to n fro, realli appreciated all.. thanks again</div>

And it takes lots of courage and guts to lead life on ur own again.  Luv urself...for if even u wil not luv urself then who will.  I took a very long time to get over my first luv....4 yrs, and I was miserable for 4 yrs.  But after 4 yrs, when my ex tried to get back together with me...I finally look ovr the r/s after 4 yrs, i realise we were nvr meant to be and will nvr be.I was too possessive and he needed the kind of freedom which I will nvr be able to give and he would nvr have the kind of time which I needed a guy to commit in a r/s with me.  In fact, I should nvr change him...he will be happier the way he is.  So I rejected him...and then suddenly the whole burden was taken of me.<br><br>Look at me....I m now happily married with kids.  After my ex, I nvr thought I could find someone.  I was cautious to a new r/s for a very long time.  But my husband, then boyfriend was patient, kind and perserved.  He gave me time to slowly accept a new relationship and I found someone who was willing to commit the time to nurturing a r/s w me.  Yes, my husband and I are bz, I work close to 12 hrs a day, he works too  and many times overnight, but we make sacrifices just to sustain the r/s.  Yes...I luv my hubby more n more each day.  My ex....he became my very good friend...he is also happily married to a woman who does not need him to commit time.  I m good friends w his wife too....and when I look at her, I realise I will not be able to be like her, she is truely meant for him.<br><br>Now looking back, the first relationship didn't work out not because I was at fault or he was at fault.  We just had different views on what was to be committed into a relationship, if anyone had changed our views for the other, we would have been miserable.  Yes, in a relationship, couples do compromise sometimes, but nvr to the point u become uncomfortable...or feel that is not worth it.  And it takes two to clap.<br><br>No one is asking u to start a new r/s.  But just don't close ur heart when the next one comes along...u nvr know....the next one might be the right one.
