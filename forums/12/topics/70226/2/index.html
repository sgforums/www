A understand his situation &amp; seldom contact B also so that he can haf enuff rest. Thus they seldom conact nor meet.<br><br>Then suddenly A sms B at nite (11.30pm) asking him "how is work?" She saw no reply after a few mins n make her 2nd sms "I think u r real bz or maybe you wun bother. This upset me alot &amp; i keep pondering r u alrite or wat gg on.Nvm Take care n shant disturb u". Immediately B called A back in a frustrated tone and say<br>"Wat is ur problem?, Im at this place, do u noe?" A replied she dun noe. Then B replied "Muz i tell you everything? Im at this place preparing for 2morrow roadshow, very bz. U think i always do nothing?". A was all long quiet in the conversation. Then B hanged up.<br><br>A was sad. She feels that is there anything wrong in her sms? Then after a fw mins later, B called A back in a nicer tone n asked A wat is it. A despite feeling sad on wat happen earlier, replied "Juz trying to find out how is ur job, i noe that u r bz at work n that is why that makes u abit bad tempered, and i thought u r at home &amp; if i noe u are still at work, i wun be smsing u". Then she asked him abt his rdshow duration n wat he is doing now. After that they hanged up.<br><br>People keep telling A that that is no way B should treat A this manner. Muz be something wrong in the r/s, either he changed heart or wat. B as usual defended A by saying that he is very bz etc.. So wat do u think..someting wrong?</div></blockquote>nothing wrong.... think A should play it cool and let B do his stuff... or we might not be getting enough information.

            <div class='col-md body'>guess you just need to understand the amount of stress he is going through... and find some stuff to fill your free time.... I know it's difficult especially if you used to get alot of attention previously and now he doesn't even seem to care.... however, if he is really busy with work etc, i guess you should be understanding enough to give him the space... i guess everyone need their space and no one loves to be working till late everyday and not get to see their love one.<br><br>in fact i do find your initial sms to him, the too busy or cannot be borthered part a bit of a spark for quarral ... he is probably think ... i'm working my ass off here trying to make enough money such that we can have a comfortable life together in future and there you are accusing me of cannot be borthered.... what do you want ....<br><br>Forgive him for being irritated at you ... coz i dun think you will sound really nice to someone after many long hard days at work and a seemingly accusing sms of being "can't be borthered"... just human i guess .... I'm sure under such pressure from work etc ... the last thing you need is a bf/gf at your back demanding some attention from you. what you would really want is someone who can be supportive of you and not "punish" you for not being available to him/her.<br><br>when his work load gets better but his attitude does not improve, then you can start worrying about  the occurence of a 3rd party.</div>

And again it shows, man cannot multi-task career and love.<br><br>Somehow man's curse is within him - the inability to seek comfort from love ones especially when one is coping like hell with reality. I am sure many people would crave for a hug, simple soothing words or even complains to your love ones when reality is choking you. It's not in his case. A man's curse - his own burden, he rather carry himself. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>I think I did tell you to avoid pressuring and tact is talk is essential.<br><br>P.S: Give me <span style="text-decoration: underline;">BOTH</span> your <strong>date of birth</strong>, <strong>time born </strong>and <strong>place born</strong> - I help you check out your relationship astrologically.
