            <div class='col-md body'>Precious.. lingos used to have a bf that was really busy. But cos i was lifeless and friendless at the tender age of 19. I was really upset that i couldn't contact him anytime.<br><br>If he's at work, i think you should understand that it's hard to get time to do your personal stuff doing work. Especially if he's organising road shows. He's not at a desk sitting there doing nothing. When you get a job later.. you'll understand what i mean.<br>So MS A, your friends who say that he shouldn't treat you like that obviously have bfs who are in school and has nothing to do. If you want to be with someone that's older than you (I'm assuming he is) then you have to understand that he has work commitments. And be prepared to not see him for a long time. Unless you are dumb like I was once, and bring lunch to him. URGHHHH, the embarrassment of what i did when i was young!</div>

Sometimes it's hard to restrain the tone. Maybe on the phone it's hard to like tell what he is really feeling. Once i was drivng and my bf was calling me cos i was late. I answered and said i'm driving, can't talk and slammed the phone down. But he knew that i didn't mean to be rude. You know what i mean?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i feel what lingos has said is true. the amt of stress in organising a roadshow for the next day is extremely huge. that explains why the guy sounded frustrated.<br><br>also, did it ever occur to the both of them that sms can be a poor medium for communication? //Quote: "i think you are real busy or you wun bother..."  Ms. A could meant well when she said this. but how would a stressful guy react and perceive this sentence? sometimes, nothing beats a phone call.<br><br>it could just be a case of misunderstanding. not necessary a change in heart on the part of B. if so, he wouldn't even have bothered to call back again.<br><br>btw precIous, u are a night owl!!!</div>

Based on the above alone, it's certainly not enough to prove much. Could very well be just a frustrated man's response though he might be genuinely caring to his gf. Then again, there's no evidence to prove that there's nothing wrong too?<br><br>A word of advice... If things are pretty groundless, don't go about wildful guessings.... It's unhealthy and would probably hurt the relationship in one way or another in time to come....<br><br>Regards.</div>

Now i noe  when i want hubby to call me....i sms him and tell him things like....i miss u....i m thinkin of u..... wish to see u soon or when he bz wif work....kempetai.....he always try to call....it gets him in a lovey dovey mood and he tries to come home as soon as his project finishes.</div></blockquote>the problem is he wun reply sms for msges like miss u, love u, or any encouragement sms to ask him to jia you. He reply me sms that needed to be reply like enquiries or gg out. I noe guys got some dislikes on wat their gfs do. But it feel so strange for me for me that we neber communicate for days n i dun even noe wat is gg on for him..maybe i should juz leave him alone. Not to say meet up.. it even worst. He had no time for it..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My hubby didnt like the fact that i too sticky.  So i got around problem by finding things to do when he not around.  he got more "kan cheong" when he realised i was more indepdt.  but i always assure him i would be there 4 him.  i make more effort by cooking him a good meal when he comes home from work...btw i work too but still make effort.  sometimes by letting go a little, it gives him room to breathe and he comes back more, its like flyin a kite ...every relationship is unique.....u need to noe what works for ur guy.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>BTW communication needs time....i took a lot of time (a few years in fact)  to train him to talk to me.....now he tells me abt his day at work, the good....the bad, everthing....what he had for lunch....i also tell him abt mine. i try to pamper him more when he has a bad day. he doesnt need advice, just a listening and sympathetic ear.</div>

Like with my ex boyfriend, I used to tell myself that i could tolerate certain aspects of him that i didn't really like ie.. tight arse. He would freak if i bought anything remotely expensive. Even when i bought a watch for half price (not on sale, through connections) and it was a bargain, he flipped out and nearly fell down the escalator.<br><br>Anyway point is, if there is something that you are not satisfied with at the moment, getting married solves nothing. But i think this has been discussed again to the point of ad nauseum, i'll leave it as this.</div>
