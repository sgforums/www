            <div class='col-md body'>didn't read ur previous post, but thot i will jus give me 5-cents worth. hope u dun mind...<br><br>guess there is always a time when relationship (be it bgr or just pure buddies) will fade. As pple grow, their environment changes, their thinking changes and their feeling changes as well. I hv come to accept that relationships can fade even if u put in ur fair share of effort to sustain it. it takes 2 to clap; one-sided relationship can't work. While frens are important, it is imperative that we do not end up too dependent on frens as this will merely add burden to the other party. At the end of the day, no frens owe it to u to listen or stick by u. it's still urself at the end of it. Lonely it may sounds, but by doing that, u accept the fact that fate ("yuan" as we chinese call it) may end and u hv to go on wif ur own life, which will entail meeting more new frens.<br><br>ur fren has moved on to his own life... u hv to let it go and live ur own as well. dwelling on the past too much will oni make u more painful and lonely.<br><br>As for gf, well sometimes if it isn't meant to be, u can't force. take it as good experience for we grow thru' the various experiences we have had. it just mean that ur special one is still waiting for you some where in a corner of the earth... as u have been waiting for her as well..<br><br>so, do cheer up, for u are bound to find her... one day...<br><br></div>

Good if you can keep the old ones, nonetheless.. Nothing's stopping you from making the new ones... Friends don't owe you anything to stick by your side... If you find that there's something wrong with you, reflect on yourself... Mooding on such thoughts would probably only make it twice as bad...<br><br>Focus on your studies, know more friends from school? About the girls you've dated... Reflect on how you're treating them... Are you 'overly giving in'...? Personally, I think you're just stressing yourself too much in most of the relationships you try to handle...? Try to relax a bit...? 'Simple bliss' which you see in others' relationship is what they've created and maintained... Often than not, it's nothing which just falls from the sky....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, I almost can't believe that your fate is similar to mine. I had a couple of very very good pals whom I always hanged out with and shared our woes and happiness all the time. Although we came from different schs, we were really very close like sisters during our teens. But after some time, people do change and after I turned 21yrs old, things turned out so differently. All of us lead our own individual lives. Alot of unpleasant things happened. Sometimes I wonder whether it could be my fault that things turned out this way. Or maybe my expectation of friendship is too high? But I do blamed them for not treasuring our friendship alot. I do not want a plain friendship, I wanted good and pleasant friendship which is meant to last. Haizz..... I had decided to stop all contacts with them. Great disappointment.  Efforts should be done to make our friendship good and steady mah.<br><br>Same for all of my past bfs. ... disappointment too.<br><br>I guess life has its ups and downs.

I bump into 2 old frens (A &amp; B) &amp;  one ex-girlfriend on separate occasions. And they actually appeared pleasantly surprised to see me. In fact the frens actually saw me &amp; came over to greet me.<br>The only thing was I had on many previous occasions asked A out but he wld asked appeared tired or disinterested. I guess he preferred B companyÂ…<br><br>so maybe they dun hate me after allÂ… I guess its easy to become overly sensitive after many subtle rejections.</span><br><br></div>

I had a couple of very very good pals whom I always hanged out with and shared our woes and happiness all the time. Although we came from different schs, we were really very close like sisters during our teens. But after some time, people do change and after I turned 21yrs old, things turned out so differently. All of us lead our own individual lives. Alot of unpleasant things happened. Sometimes I wonder whether it could be my fault that things turned out this way. Or maybe my expectation of friendship is too high? But I do blamed them for not treasuring our friendship alot. I do not want a plain friendship, I wanted good and pleasant friendship which is meant to last. Haizz..... I had decided to stop all contacts with them. Great disappointment.  Efforts should be done to make our friendship good and steady mah.<br><br>Same for all of my past bfs. ... disappointment too.<br><br>I guess life has its ups and downs.

But, u hv to fight that; no one can help u but urself. Jus rem, such feeling can be a vicious cycle in itself, the more u feel this way, the more alienated u find urself.
