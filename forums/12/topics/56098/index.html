It's a superficial issue and it cannot just being measured by looks.<br><br>If you are looking for a lifetime partner, what are ur criteria?

            <div class='col-md body'>Its just a date, nothing more right? Going on dates are is just a way of judging if you get along with the person and you can see yourself being with that person. The same will go for the girl. If you feel uncomfortable. Looks are superficial. i do know the whole concept of first impressions but personality will make the impact on the relationship. Try to be relax around her and see how it goes.<br><br>PS. Im dating a foreigner but im aint an SPG. I like the guy geniunely. I wont be with him if im uncomfortable in the first place.<br><br>My take on this: FInd someone who you can be COMFORTABLE with. Sounds to me that this girl is a wild party animal. If she is just sorta "acting", then let her know that she doesnt have to do that at all.  You can try telling her how you feel for once. If she thinks thats not good enough. then maybe you should date others who can at least be natural with you.</div>

Wow, usually its all the Eurasian girls that complain to us that guys only go out with them to look good lol! Now we've got one Eurasian guy saying girls go out with him to look good, man you are so full of yourself Eurasian boy. All Eurasians are stuck up pompous pricks in my opinion. Anywayz, the other guy is right, you've got an SPG chick, so exploit her while you still can man, if i were in your shoes I would **** her upside down like we men all do. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div></blockquote> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> tsk tsk..such sweeping remarks.</div>

Okie, firstly, she is hot, she's Singaporean Chinese, but her face aint that attractive, but that;s no problem. Its her personality, we are only like JC1, she took me to pubs for expensive drinks, she's got this put on fake American accent, she goes clubbing, i don't like such places cos they are too noisy and the kinda places for bad company, i nearly got into a fight twice cos of my race at such places.<br><br>Anywayz, she dresses reeeeaaaally skimpy, last time we went out, she wore this Sarong and a very revealing top, plus beach slippers, while i was walking with her ( i was fully clothed by the way), i got these stares from me other friends. She was really like an spg, prolly is, and its like SPGs are hated here i know. But i feel like she's not who she is,,, i'd prefer it if she would be herself, i feel that she is just kinda fake... she aint never been to the US before, her friend has got this tota colonial mentality about her... and when we were out, its like her friend was going :" Oh your hair is sooo soft blah blah blah" like she has never seen an angmoh before...or she aint never got too close to one.<br><br>My other friend said these 2 girls, this gurl and her friend... are experienced daters... and they are going wild cos they aint never been with someone like me before... half white and half local... so they are like... acting weird he says. I find it just... uncomfortable.<br><br>Call me innocent if u will, i find it just scary... not typically what i am used to in girls... you other guys may be going " WHOA man!" But i don't feel right with it.... i am just confused... help me guys.<br><br>Its just, sometimes i feel like I am some kinda... fashion object when i am with them... so they can look good or something...i dunno... </div></blockquote>From wat my point of view, nowadays local gal are bitch coz they think they dress in this way they got 'sey' and morever they think they attract attention to every ppl around, best advice dun get along with those gal who usually go clubbing.... If u r find serious partner but flirt around its ok..... For me i dun go there with newly intro gal friendz i usually go there when my friends is have an occasion mostly.....</div>
