            <div class='col-md body'>Mixedblooder my brother, you remind me of my last "date" with a gurl from my school. I think your like super innocent aren't you? I think you've never gone on a date with a hot girl before huh, so that's why your all nervous and "confused" and all that stuff, and so what if girls dress skimpily? Anywayz, I don't think girls here dress that skimpily anywayz, maybe its because your in ACJC. My advice is to just let it go, your only in Jc1 right? Just like me, so just take it easy, you speak as if you are gonna get married with this girl ha! We are the same, accept your a frenchie, but anywayz, i think I know how you feel man. I guess these days girls are more open here in Singapore, so just try and be as equally open. I know how it feels when people keep asking you where your from and all that stuff, its as if they are looking at some alien lifeform, believe me I get that too, so just relax and calm down, we're all people. But it can get tough, like when I was with my guy friend (he's chinese) and these 2 girls, they kept bombarding me with comments like my facial features etc etc, whilst my friend was like real neglected because he was not a mudblood/Eurasian, so there was some tension between us because of that incident.<br><br>Ha, i've gona and wrote too much, what's my point? Well my point is errrrr, just hang in there, its not as if you are marrying her. And so what if your a fashion object? Its not the end of the world mate.<br><br></div>
