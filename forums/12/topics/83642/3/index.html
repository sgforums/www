There is so much hatred and anger in me that they are tearing me apart.  I am afraid I am losing the battle.<br><br>Recently, I am starting to have thoughts about taking lives, man, children, etcÂ… I am sick!  I was kick out by my karate instructor a few months back for almost killing my classmate.  He refused to teach me further.<br><br>I think my psychiatrist has also given up hope on me.  But he did advice me to channel my hatred and anger into words.  And that is why I am here.  I will be postings some very sick thoughts here, or maybe I will start a forum so that nobody will have to read my sick postings.  I know I am very sick.  If I offended anyone, please forgive me.<br></div></blockquote>whoa cool!! would u like to serve as my assasin?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> you have all the necessary traits and mindset.</div>

All tis little things do fusturate us, esp when we r not in the best of moods... It takes jus a little to blow our top... I am also caught in tis kind of situation, though not as bad as urs... I loved children very much... But when i'm in a foul mood, i wish they would jus go away...<br><br>My suggestion is tat each time u feel fusturated, tak a deep breath n calm down... Think of the consequences tat will happen to watever action u have done... Or... think mentally wat u wanna do in ur mind... Think, but not do... At least u feel better!<br><br>Cryin is a gd way to let out ur tension... Or mayb u could listen to soothin music... Think of happy thoughts... thoughts tat makes u happy n forget wat is happenin now...<br><br>Mayb u could pick up kickboxin? Think is a gd way to relive ur anger also... or... Go xiao gui ling at bukit timah if i not wrong... go shout!!!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
