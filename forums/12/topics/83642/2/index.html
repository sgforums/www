There is so much hatred and anger in me that they are tearing me apart.  I am afraid I am losing the battle.<br><br>Recently, I am starting to have thoughts about taking lives, man, children, etcÂ… I am sick!  I was kick out by my karate instructor a few months back for almost killing my classmate.  He refused to teach me further.<br><br>I think my psychiatrist has also given up hope on me.  But he did advice me to channel my hatred and anger into words.  And that is why I am here.  I will be postings some very sick thoughts here, or maybe I will start a forum so that nobody will have to read my sick postings.  I know I am very sick.  If I offended anyone, please forgive me.<br></div></blockquote>Inner Voice, I would like to give it a try to offer you my own solution...if you don't mind. I'm no psychiatrist but I feel that they are not helpful...not that they don't want to help, but they can only help from books...not from experience.<br><br>Think what you need is to know where you can release your feelings first. If at any point of time when you really control your own anger, go ahead and take it out on a wall. Punch and kick a wall in your own room...preferably, until you had enough or your fists and feet are so painful that you cannot do it anymore. It works for me...still. Think the wall in my bedroom is almost becoming my buddy liao...so sometimes I just punch and kick it for fun.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Then you need to know how to calm yourself down be normal after you have released your feelings. Go and listen to some good songs that you like...preferably eng/chinese/jap sentimental love songs or songs with good soothing melodies. I'm sure that you got a few of those types of songs that you liked right? If you are not a song lover...another way to do so would be to indulge yourself to watch some good comedy/action/romantic movies...not violent/horror movies. For me, I watch animes, english/jap/korean movies...I don't watch hongkong/chinese movies because they don't help me much. But that's what works for me.<br><br>After you have calm yourself down, the last thing that you need is to build up on your love...your love for yourself and everything around you that you can learn to love. For me, I read some jap comics with chinese translation, go out and hang out with my cousins, gather a few good friends to meet up and go out on a regular basis, spend time to interact with my parents whenever possible...at least greet them and ask them if they had their meals already or not, and lastly...spend time online chatting with friends/strangers and talk cock and have fun posting in sgforums.<br><br>Depending on what your religion is...for me, I'm a Christian. So I do pray and talk with GOD on my bed before I go to dreamland. Errmm....sometimes I'm guilty of going to dreamland while halfway during my prayers...too tired lah when I was working. And woke up the next morning feeling  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> that I forgot to say 'Amen'. Hahahaha.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Not to worry lah, if that also happens to you...make sure you pray first before you go and touch the bed.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Hmm...I guess that's all then. I hope you can overcome your anger problems soon. I wish you all the best for your anger management.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

I used to punch the wall in my room too.  Also in washroom, MRT's door, etc. It helps a bit lah.  Thanks for all your suggestions, I will keep them in mind.  Actually after a while I am okay.  It is at the point of anger that I am having problem in controlling. For example when I spar with my opponents, the more I fight, the more excited I become, I cannot control my punch. Or at the time the stupid 'Best Bet' movie at the MRT, I almost threw a stone at the screen.</div>

They are very good. Maybe I will try writing in the future. Now I just need a place to vent my anger into words rather than actions. The more I post here the more guilty I feel because I may be posting some angry/sicks topics in my forum.  I will be asking my psychiatrist to read my postings here too.  Hope she is free, nowadays quite difficult to make appointment with her. Maybe she is avoiding me after I shouted at her during our last session.  Whatever...</div>
