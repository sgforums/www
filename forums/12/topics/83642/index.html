I am trying to be in control with my emotions everyday. For example if someone block my way at the escalator, I have a very strong urge to push them asides, or tell those people who talk loudly in the cinema to shut their fcuking mouth.  But I have to fight back to control those urge. Maybe I am not sick, I am just a coward.</div>

If not, you should ask about it during your next session with him, because those urges are the results of compressed feelings which are caused by underlying factors, so if you can deal with those factors, whatever they may be, you can more effectively deal with the other problems - which in your case is expressing anger in the wrong method.</div>

Before I see her I used to be more violent. All my friends and even my family members avoid me.  Even my dad forbid me to learn karate.  But I heck care him.  But when I fought with my dad one day, I realise it is time I need to get some helps.  I actually thought of being a monk. Maybe I will do that.</div>

Well, I think she is a decent psychiatrist, so don't worry about it but what a psychiatrist can do is quite limited within their appointment schedules and office.. quite sad, but there is nothing we can do. She is not your wife. Hehe. Thats the good side of getting a psychiatrist for a wife. LOL.<br><br>She is good because you feel safe with her, and you cried probably from guilt.. that proves your condition is mild, not serious at all.<br><br>Another advise other than posting here, you can also write an online diary/blog which I recommend must be made public annoymously, in which you can build up your self-confidence in dealing with these specific set of problems, on top of what you are doing right now.<br><br>You are not a coward, in fact, you are one of the bravest soul in the world that have the courage to face their emotional problems. Nor are you actually sick, because by definition of sickness, <span style="font-style: italic;">you are not genetically defective, nor influenced by bacterials, viruses, and such</span>. The most you can be is that you are emotionally disordered, thus you have problems expressing your anger compared to other people, but changing how to express your anger does not allow you to know why were you easily angered by those reasons in the first place.<br><br>She said its due to work pressure and stress right? That is a rather general reason though.. in my opinion.</div>

Or at least try to, until we reach a critical level and do things in a moment of folly. Regardless of positive or negative. Like.. I love my girlfriend so much I just ran over and hug her.

Things that I fought so hard to keep in control in my real life, I can safely say/do it here. I may be posting some sick topics here in the future.  I may be ban by Jason.

But I think I am going to disappoint you.  The reason I come here is to release the beast within me.  Things that I fought so hard to keep in control in my real life, I can safely say/do it here. I may be posting some sick topics here in the future.  I may be ban by Jason. I need to get them off my mind.  So please please don't be my friend or try to help. It makes me feel even more guilty.  I really appreciate your, and the others, help.<br></div></blockquote>actually im not. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> juz telling ya wad i think of yr situation. if u wan to rant, den i suggest u do it in one topic, rather than in many topics.. dat way, jason may be more forgiving.</div>
