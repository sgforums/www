            <div class='col-md body'>Well, try to be more understanding. Maybe he is a already very frustrated with things around him, just want to find somewhere to release his tension and let go of everything and just waste whatever energy he has on computer games.<br><br>Give him some allowance. Don't always think of ME ME ME. Try to let go on that. Always look at things at another angle. Nagging ain't going to help. It's really up to him whether he wants to spend time with you. You don't have to always stick onto your bf. Find other things to do with your life. No point thinking too much.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You know, nuchio and PerfectlyGreen are right.<br><br>The world does not revolve around you, and neither does a relationship. He forgot your bday, and you think that single act shows that he doesn't care about you?<br><br>You know what they say... it takes a thousand good deeds for people to build your reputation, but only one bad deed to ruin it all. I suggest looking at the 'thousand' good deeds he has done, instead of focusing on that one bad thing.<br><br>Regarding the ORD, slacking at home insteading of going to the job interviews you got for him.<br><br>I totally understand(but maybe because i'm a guy myself). We guys have a tendency to slack. Yea. After O levels, instead of getting a job right away(unless we're saving up for something), we'll just slack and play games at home. Or just hang out with our friends. Its the way we are. You have to accept it in your boyfriend.<br><br>Of course at one time or another, we'll 'wake up' and start focusing on our jobs, family, marriage. But until then, let us enjoy our youth a little more, before it gets lost forever...</div>

ORD already stay home everyday meh? i wan him to have a good life, if he finds a job, also not good for me cos he wont have time for me what. but i stil wan him to work instead of slack at home. i also dun nid to depend on him for $$ cos im self sufficient.<br><br>SIANZ.</div></blockquote>Dear velvetgirl,<br><br>Be glad that he still have the heart to get you a present.. Though he forgets your bday is exactly.. At least the dates and month is not a great difference right?? If next time you don't wan him to forget your bday.. maybe when you are out shopping with him.. give him a hint lah..<br><br>Your bf must have a goal for himself.. right now.. he don't even know what he wants.. that's why he's been slacking.. and don't wan to look for a job.. give him some time.. or maybe you can ask him wat kind of  job he would like to do.. or and plans for the future.. or any dreams or goals.. that he wants to attain?? maybe from there.. can talk to him about it.. if he really wan to acheive something.. he has to work for it.. Let him know the importance..<br><br>Cheers..<br></div>
