They tried so hard to rely on their brains to the extend that, some become engineers.  Why do you think there's PDA, digital organiser, mobile phone with contact details, e-mail softwares and ICQ contact to write down anniversaries dates?  Some man even forgot about their own birthdate... and some of these man get married for this reason.  Yes, their wife will remind them.<br><br>Anyhow, just embarass him about remembering it wrongly.  After a few years maybe.. he may re-wire his memory to remember it as 3rd of Aug.<br><br>"Man are like Teabags.. you know..., you need to put them in boiling water in order to appreciate the full taste of it."  If he is not able to apprecaite what you have done for him.  They don't say 'there's a lady behind every successful man' for nothing. If he can't take your pressure.. well, I'll wish you good luck for taking care of a little brother if you still have the patience.<br><br></div>
