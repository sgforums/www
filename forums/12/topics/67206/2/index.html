When<br>you fell in love, you forgot about everything else including<br>your own self. You experienced a lot of pain because many people took advantage of your kindness. All your lovers were beautiful people but they possessed narcissistic qualities, which was the result of your breakups. Their selfishness never allowed them to return the love that you continuously provided for them. But you never despised them for the wounds they left on you. What you should do in this life-time is to become more sensible, rational, and calculative, so that you will not have to endure so much pain as you did in the past. Don't just settle for anyone w! ho cross es your path but wait patiently for someone who will provide you with a reciprocal love.<br><br>It true .... that me ! I still waiting for my LOVE ....
