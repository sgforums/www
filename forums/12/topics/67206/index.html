            <div class='col-md body'><span style="font-style: italic;"><span class="large"><strong>The Results: </strong></span></span><br><br><strong>A-type: Cinderella Type </strong><br><br>Just like Cinderella, you were the heroine of a beautiful and<br>happy love story in your former life. This does not mean<br>that you were born with this privilege or that you necessarily<br>had this happiness until the end of your life. You actually<br>witnessed the harshness of reality as child, including the<br>loss of your parents and poverty.But all this darkness disappeared the moment you met the love of your life and a new bright light started to shine toward your way. You ultimately gained happiness and honor through love.<br>Both of you genuinely loved each other and enjoyed a blissful<br>life for a very long time. It is just natural that this genuine life in your previous existence can only be a blessing in this present moment.<br>This may be the opportunity to work for charity by helping out other people in need and to be thankful.<br><br><strong>B-type: The Charitable type </strong><br><br>You were the devoted lover in your former existence that<br>dedicated your whole being to the object of affection. When<br>you fell in love, you forgot about everything else including<br>your own self. You experienced a lot of pain because many people took advantage of your kindness. All your lovers were beautiful people but they possessed narcissistic qualities, which was the result of your breakups. Their selfishness never allowed them to return the love that you continuously provided for them. But you never despised them for the wounds they left on you. What you should do in this life-time is to become more sensible, rational, and calculative, so that you will not have to endure so much pain as you did in the past. Don't just settle for anyone w! ho cross es your path but wait patiently for someone who will provide you with a reciprocal love.<br><br><strong>C-type: The Lascivious type </strong><br><br>You were a very fickle person in your previous life, who could not stay with one partner for a long time. Love was something you had to experience through as many people as possible and only then<br>were you happy as a person. You met many, diverse people<br>whom you shared an intimate relationship with.<br>Although you were an amorous lover, you possessed a cold and rational mind. It gave you this power of never being hurt by someone. It will be difficult to settle down completely for you unless you meet a very charismatic person that will capture your entire heart. And a journey for you would not completely end with<br>marriage either.<br><br><strong>D-type: The Reckless type </strong><br><br>You were the center of a love triangle or an immoral love that<br>was destined to end tragically. Your rash and independent<br>spirit set the stage for a love story like this. You were an<br>egocentric character who broke many people's hearts. In<br>this way, you were much like the C-type that was previously<br>mentioned. You moved on from one person to another as soon<br>as that spark or passion for you faded. A person who existed as this type in the past is bound to be affected by these remnant qualities today. This is why it is vital to appreciate the other person in your relationship now and to become more mature. Getting rid of your selfish desires may be the key to a happy relationship for you.<br><br><strong>E-type: The Romeo and Juliet type </strong><br><br>You are one of the few people who experienced the most passionate love affair in your former life. It was love at first sight and both of you could not think of anything else during the day than to dream about each other. It was a Romeo and Juliet love affair, which may not have ended in disaster just like in the story. Your families may even have been very accepting about your relationship. But the likelihood of a passionate love incre! ases the more obstacles are between the two lovers. But the affection tends to fade when there is no conflicting element involved. Therefore, it is important for you to be more patient in your present relationship. The challenge is to keep that passion going by constantly introducing new and interesting ideas.<br><br><strong>F-type: The Plain type </strong><br><br>You did not find love through your own actions but with the<br>help of other people. You were in your own comfort zone, so<br>that it was not necessary for you to find someone special.<br>This is why you were far away from experiencing a fervent love<br>affair. Everybody accepted your relationship with your partner and<br>stability may be have been the pivotal characteristic of your love. Many people would not even consider this peaceful and simple relationship to be love but it may just be the true essence. You may feel perfectly comfortable with an arranged marriage.<br><br><strong>G-type: The Abusive type </strong><br><br>There is no human being who perfect and therefore a certain contradiction exists within us. Thus, an internal conflict between cruelty and kindness is apparent in us. You were familiar with this conflict in your previous life, where mistreatment was used on people. There was a lot of anger in you and this may be a reason why you were open to challenges without a blink of an eye. You often found this sardonic pleasure when you made a person feel sad or perplexed. Monotony did not exist in your vocabulary and so you looked for excitement. A little child exists in you that is waiting for stability and you have shot a at finding love when you find the person who is able to provide this comfort for you.<br><br><strong>H-type: The Glass Marble type </strong><br><br>You were a purely naive person who was scared to be hurt. This led you to love a person from afar but the chance that you came together was very slim. You were a sociable person but oddly enough, you became the shy and quiet person in front of the person you liked. The painful event occurred when the day your object of affection became another person's mate and moved to another faraway place. You have to accept the fact that you will not see a relationship in the future if you don't start gaining some courage to make that crucial advance. You can start with taking subtle steps toward that person.</div>
