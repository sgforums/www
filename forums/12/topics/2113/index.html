            <div class='col-md body'>I've started internet only in 1997. Since then, I did make a lot of net friends. But our relationship didn't last... about 2 yrs only. Initially, we did meet up once a month for dinner. But now, totally no news from them anymore.<br><br>We got nothing in common except the internet, so, when they're bored with the net, that's the end of the relationship.<br><br>There's only 1 whom I still keep in touch till now. All thanks to my another friend who would invite us to her house to play mahjong every weekend. If not......<br><br>Till now I am still making new friends in the net. But I wonder, how long will our relationship lasts?<br><br>It is very saddening to see friends come and go. What are the ways that I can maintain a long lasting friendship? BTW, I am 29 and my net friends range from 19-40++. Thanks for the advice.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ruth|E!!!  I oso wanna join can or not?  I promise to behave, can can?<br><br>Raingal, the problem with internet is that it just brings lonely or bored people together.  In the immortal words of the SDU "This is a beginning, the rest is up to you." Be more proactive in making friends, call up once in a while, e-mail them see what's up with their lives.<br><br>The greatest thing in life, is to be loved and be loved in return.  If you haven't catch "Moulin Rouge" go and catch it this weekend. The whole movie plays like a discotheque+opera hall+concert hall+MTV... wonderful music and highly entertaining.  It got me humming that Elton John's "Your song" for the last few days..... It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside... I'm not somebody that can easily hide, I don't have much money but if I could, I buy a big house that we could live in...... How wonderful life is while you're in the world..... er... sorry got carried away and I'm too lazy to delete it.  Hehe  :p</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ya, same here, I met my net friends in the forums and in IRC. We organise outing once a month. Even so, I always see new faces. Some join us for a few outings then disappear already. So saddening.<br><br>The group I met in 1997 prefer email than forums. So we started to talk using emails. Then slowly one by one lazy/busy to write, till my another friend had to sms them to see if they're fine..... no reply from them, so you know what happened.<br><br>Klactovak, I watched Moulin Rouge already  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> with my another Forum friends.... it is a nice shows indeed....</div>

Looking at what a person types and how he/she expresses what he/she is typing physically would determine whether the friendship can last or not. I prefer to meet up with my friends now and then as we share the common interests. Just be easy on such matters as nothing is forever.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>ruth|e:<br><br>Never tell me where u guys/gals were that evening.

Its easy to get aquaintances but not eazy when forming a frendship.. there r lots and lots of people whom we've met and know them, see them, even tok to them for quite sometime.. but somehow they have yet to be recognised as friendship.. even though we have place some or big amount of trust in it. sad, but well it happens! u might not believe it but well, you have already experience it.. only some people would realise it.. we r juz too buzy for this world, this country, even at this time.. Cruel and Merciless i suppose..<br><br>how about it when u met an "old" frend or a long lost frend?? yeah, its true at first, "frends are frends forever".. but as time goes by.. do u think we have more or less merely "downgraded" them to juz aquaintance?? look at the way we tok to them, spend time with them, or even behave when they r around or met them along the streets.. issit as same as if they r juz aquaintance? instead we spend more time to those people whom u r interested to tok to..building the bridges of communications with them..destroying those bridges youve made with other people whom you have met before..<br><br>A few big Examples to strengthen my point is that.. DO YOU EVER ASK YOURSELF THIS.. When u r in SECondary skool.. do u ever ask yourself WHERE ARE MY NURSERY AND KINDERGARTEN FRENDS go to? do i still remember ALL of them?
