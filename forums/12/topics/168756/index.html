They sit up there, with their "i think i am so right and i rule over all of you" attitude when in reality they are small low level dogs. And they happily allow injustice to slip by them, and everyone just happily lives in their own ignorance. Find some small trivial issue and they all want to jump on the bloody bandwagon to show their self importance. For what? To crucify some old man? why not apply your sense of "justice" somewhere worthwhile? but noooooo they can't offend the powers that be can they?

There's this particular time when I'm simply just too tired to argue with him and let him have a chance to stumble on his own stupidity. Both of us came out with a proposal each for a project and submit to my HOD for approval and behind the scene I ask the HOD to use my partner's proposal and I'm sure his plans will fail and I've submitted together with my proposal a remedy for my partners stupidity. My boss agrees and everything just falls nicely as I predicted. Boss is extremely impressed and definitely impressed by my partner's stupidity.<br><br>You get paid for what you sell.</div>
