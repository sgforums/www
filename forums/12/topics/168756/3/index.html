Maybe i am one of those blind all along, but what exactly caused you so much grief and anger til you hate? I would like to know more, and to understand more. This is the 1st time i have submitted up a post. Hope i dun get rebukes for my concerns. Is Singapore and/or its people really such a disappointment? Are all my work, beliefs and hopes for Singapore unreal, meaningless and unrealistic? What is love, patrotism, care and unity for our fellow countrymen?

Does the govt care? No. They don't even bother to seek justice for people who died in NS, in service of the nation. All they care is to protect 2 sons of somebody important. They don't care that the scapegoats who got convicted in their place had spent how many years in the service of the nation, they don't care that the scapegoats are loyal to the nation.

The only price is perhaps discomfort or disruption to your life. But everybody wants to be comfortable. Nobody wants to disrupt their own lives to discover the truth do they? So hey, its a shock when someone finally shouts the truth out for everyone else to hear. Now there is a "shuffle in your shoes" sort of unease, because u know its the truth, but you wish it wasn't.

If more people would put themselves at some risk to speak up, if people learn to be more open-minded, then a lot of things would naturally change. If you look at what I've said, a lot of them are down to narrow-mindedness, greed and selfishness.<br><br>People in power who think primarily about their own benefits. The common people who also think primarily about their own benefits. Thats why the former can do many outrageous things and get away with it. They know that the common people won't really make noise because they don't want to risk offending the ruling party and making their lives a tad more precarious. They adopt a "if you don't tell me, I don't want to know" attitude towards things.<br><br>The education system also encourages this, with a spoon-feeding policy being the norm. There is no system in place to encourage the development of other forms of careers. Nothing that allows you to defer things like military service so you can establish a career 1st. The only people who are allowed to defer? Why their own scholars of course. Scholars who have passed a multitude of tests and interviews to make sure they think along the same line as the ruling party(I prefer to see this as a QC inespection to ensure the scholars whom them accept have been fully brainwashed by the educational system). Either scholars, or people who want to be doctors(and once again, they get deferment because after they become doctors, they will be useful to the military). What about letting people who wish to pursue a career in the arts, in the culture, in music, to establish a career 1st? What about acknowledging there are other ways to serve the nation? Many people claim its not fair if some people do not need to serve the military. Its even more unfair to dismiss the contribution of people in jobs less ordinary to the nation.<br><br>There are too many wrongs to right in Singapore. I honestly don't know if it can ever become a "better place" in my lifetime. And from the resistance of most singaporeans to even acknowledge the truth, I'd say its not likely to happen anytime soon.<br></div>
