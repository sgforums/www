            <div class='col-md body'>Just wondering what is love?? He didn't reject you also.. so what get affected so much?? if rumors are to say that he is something, you just don't love him as much?? IF he's you bf, and rumors say that people catch him with another girl (friend only) without telling you, you're going stop loving him?? It's like you're going to tell yourself you will lose before you even prepare to fight a battle..<br><br>LOve him like he's your bf.. at least then if you will not regret if anything turns out bad. At least you really love him before, and really gave you best in a relationship or getting a relationship. Rahter than regret if he was not a homosexual and ran off with another girl.<br><br>besides there's nothing wrong being a homosexual. Sometimes, homosexuality is inborn, not in the genes lahz. but becoz of testosterone, a homone that determines your gender when you're born and also you sexual drive. Maybe when he was hit by testosterone when he was still in his mama's womb, it did not mold him into a full male... well when creating humans it is such a complex thing, just the mind will do. it's so huge and complicated, hence some places will get some error and stuff, like a girl being hairy, or a guy with a female voice. All these happen, and of coz guys being gays and girls being lesbians. they all are said could have started even before they are born. is it their fault? or is it their mother's fault?? can't really blame anyone.. so can't really say who is in the wrong. sometimes they just don't want it.<br><br>Don't mean to be harsh.. try reading up.. and exposing your mind to these issue.. I was like you, kind of sensitive towards this topic in the past, but got to understand more abt it in my sociology and psychology class, I begin to be more open towards it.

Your bf/gf could be a bi-sexual, something that he/she has kept from you too. It could also be something that he/she never knew before too. It just takes time before things are revealed. If you really love him/her, would you not want him/her change?? It's just like in a getting a boy/girl to trust you, to love you wholeheartedly, to forget about his/her ex. Why are you willing to do that?? and not try changing his/her idea to love you properly instead of someone of the same gender??<br><br>I agree that effort does not necessary sum up to success, but at least you have tried to change his/her way of thought. Just like you're willing to prove to him/her that you will be a better bf/gf than his/her ex. In the latter case, you are most willing to take the risk, even she keep on telling you that he/she loves his/her ex more. Why are you willing to fight for your own happiness in the latter case, and not fight for your own happiness in the former case??<br><br>Something new to you?? Something that has things that you have not idea what it is about?? Don't dare to try?? That's why I say, expose yourself more to the subject. but not necessary change yourself to be one.<br><br>I can only you, whether you like it or not. By our grandchildren's generation, whatever is considered a taboo now will be a norm then. I always use this example, divorce was seen as a taboo in the 1960s, look around you, what's happening now?? at least in every 100 people, 1 is a divorce, and one of your friends could be from a divorce family. Taking permatual sex too. Used to be a very negative thing, but look around you, how many such cases are around??<br><br>Not saying that you should be one too. but it's changing towards that direct, and you know with your own ability you can never revert it, especially we are talking about the society here. Why not learn to accept it?? and see what you can do about it should a friend needs help in that field?? At least you can wish him/her all the best and see his/her smile.<br><br>------------------<br>()""()     ************************<br>( 'o' )     Barely Bearing Berry Belly Bear<br>(,) (,)   =======================<br>(.)_(.)

            <div class='col-md body'>Glad to hear that you have sought out you thoughts and made up your mind also. Happy for you too.. =)<br><br>Well, I attended this lecture in my uni, and the things that are mentioned is kind of thought provoking and made me change my perception about gays and lesbians.<br><br>Just a note. The following is somehow related to biology, so it will contain some words which people may find insulting. My apologies before I continue.<br><br>Ever wonder why males have nipples?? I mean those are used to feed infants for girls, but useless for guys... Yet the forming of our body parts is complex, why would then nipples be form since it is useless?? This is the part which will shocked a lot of people. It is believed by some medical and some psychological experts like my lecturer that ALL humans are initially FEMALES at the point of conception. that's why doctors cannot check whether a baby is a male or female until it is at least few months old in the womb. I'm sure you have heard of it.<br><br>It is during first 6 weeks after conception that actually molds the sex of the child. Whether testostrone has hit the child or not will then decides the gender of it. A male if testostrone produced by the mother gets into contact with the child, if not it will be a female. So what I'm also trying to imply here is that the penis and the vagina are actually the same thing, just that whether the baby is being hit by testostrone or not.  Hence, just imagine the complexity of changing from one gender to the other. The body that's going be formed, all the muscle parts will change, the way the brain will change.<br><br>It is in this process of changing which all the defects of body will come in, esp for a guy. If you can recall, some yrs back, in the news, a Filipino man gave birth to a baby, because he had a male and female reproductive parts. The Brain which is the most complicated of all body parts will create some errors too, as the amount of testostrone that changes the brain will decide how much the brain will be changed. If too little, the transistion will be incomplete and MAY result in the person being a gay, or having a female brain. or coz there are also things that are more trival like a girl growing a lot of hair on the arms, the legs or the underarm, but could be a reason why some girls are lesbians and some girls and guys are bi-sexuals<br><br>There was this British who actually divorced with his wife and left his 2 children because he felt that his thoughts are very feminine. He went to an op and and married to his boss. He felt much better and comfortable after that. This shows that testostrone has missed out on the brain, it's a female brain that we will have.<br><br>In another instance, a set twin boys are being born. however, one of them, when circumcized, the doctor accidentally burnt the penis, and a decision was made by the parents to change the gender of the child from a male to a female. When young the 'girl' was treated like a girl, and did what girl should do. As yrs goes by, when she reach puberty, however, her become more male,a nd was being teased at by other guys in her class for being so manly. After know the truth from her parents, she then went for an op to be changed back. This meant that if your mind is developed to be a male socially, it is hard for you to be a female, even when you're brought up to be one.<br><br>Well, I believe you can read them up in some psychology text or some psychology documentaries. this is only through all these 'live' stories I began to have a different perception about gays and lesbians. Since they don't have the chance to choose, so does it mean that it is their fault to be abnormal from us?? why must we treat them as if they are some kind of funny people??<br><br>No doubt, with social conditions may make one to become a gay or lesbian, like I have a friend whose female friend turned to girls after she was being ditched by a guy. However, I do believe whether we will accept to be loved by the same sex or not, has some psychological factors. Do you think you will change your preference from a guy to a girl if I were to put you in company of lesbians? or will you shun away from them?? It's all the mind. For me, I would say accepting the idea is socialogical, but taking action is psychological and in-born.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by luvofmine:</div><div class="quote_body">geez..thanks for all the replies..<br>well, have been thinking about it for this whole period of time..b4 reading ur posts.<br><br>hmm,came out with a conclusion.<br>I still like him as much ..maybe even more as time passes...and i will not just give up just like this. =)<br><br>i think i was too affected by the rumours that day when i posted...so not very rational in my thinking...hee<br><br>firstly, i guess its unfair to him that i don't try to find out the truth but choose to believe the rumours.<br><br>secondly, even if he really is, it doesn't matter. i don't expect any feelings in return but i will try to change him (if i can)...<br><br>thirdly and most imptly, i can't make myself stop liking him. =)<br><br>thanks once again..will update if there's any..<br><br>P.S: Bear: homosexuality is inborn?! prob not...most are due to peer pressure and the influence of the environment they are in..that't what i think   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> correct me if i'm wrong..</div></blockquote>------------------<br>()""()     ************************<br>( 'o' )     Barely Bearing Berry Belly Bear<br>(,) (,)   =======================<br>(.)_(.)
