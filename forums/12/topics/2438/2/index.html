            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Hmmm.. what do you study?? and where did you come across this information??</blockquote>Well, at the moment I'm not studying any specific course yet, because I'm still in secondary school... I'm probably a kid by your standards  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I got curious about homosexuality, bisexuality, and all the different kind of alternative sexualities, when I found out about them through movies, friends, etc. Because of that I started reading up on this, and other areas of interest I have on the net, which is where I got all this information from.<br><br>I still find it sad that so many people choose to fault people for the outcome of choices they didn't intentionally make. I don't think this sorta mindset is going to change anytime soon, though.<br><br>Some reports I've read online, claimed that a possible reason for normal heterosexuals belittling and discriminating against homosexuals, is due to the biological "propagate the species" imperative. Since homosexuals won't be able to produce offspring, they are rejected by normal heterosexuals, since they become a liability. Liability, in that they take from the community (food, shelter, etc), but dont give anything back (offspring basically).<br><br>Actually, our genetically encoded "biological imperatives" can explain a lot of unique aspects of human behavior.<br><br>For example, I read another report that claimed that a possible reason why a lot of men tend to cheat on their wives, is because humans by nature polygamous, and not monogamous.<br><br>This can be seen if you observes other primates, like gorrillas, chimpanzees, etc, where it is typical to have an alpha male in charge of a brood of females. This also coincides with the "propagate the species" imperative I mentioned earlier, in that one female human with 5 males can only produce one baby in 9 months provided they all get pregnant at the same time, whereas one male human with 5 females, would be able to produce 5 babies in 9 months, also provided they all get pregnant at the same time which isn't too hard for a (sexually) healthy male.<br><br>This would also explain men's chivalry, where they tend to be protective of women, since a woman's life is viewed as more precious since she's the one that can bear children.<br><br>About the stuff I knew about how male genitalia is actually formed from female genitalia, I've always been curious about the line down the underside of my dick and balls so I read up on it, and found out how they're actually formed. It actually makes me feel that the way women and men are segregated in society is really stupid, since we're actually all very similar at a base level. Its also kinda sad, actually, when you look at how women are subjugated and discriminated against men in power like in Afghanistan, or how men are also discriminated by women in feminist societies such as USA and Singapore, and most other "western" societies.<br><br>You know I learn so much more from surfing the net online than I ever could from school...makes school seem rather boring and dry in comparison  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
