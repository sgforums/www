              <p>siao liao.. recently my gf asked me about what my ex and i did in the past.. don't want to lie to her mah.. so i told her everything.. then now she can't get over thinking about it.. says even when i hug her or hold her hands, she starts thinking about what i said and feels a little disgusted..</p>
              <p>don't know what to do now.. so much for honesty and trust in a relationship.. i guess there are still certain secrets which even couples have to keep from one another..</p>
              <p>any one faced this kind of problems before? don't know what can i do to help her get over it..</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Sometimes to lie or be honest the person also will doubt you.. so might as well be honest and get over it. Guys/girls sometimes lie even though it was really nothing just to reduce or destroy any chances of conflict/quarrel.</p>

              <p>Sometimes to lie or be honest the person also will doubt you..
              so might as well be honest and get over it. Guys/girls sometimes
              lie even though it was really nothing just to reduce or destroy any
              chances of conflict/quarrel.</p>
              <p>when we want to be honest about it, we expect to talk it out and
              get over the issue. But always, honesty just brings unhappiness.
              and some people can't get it out of their minds which is the big
              problem.</p>

              <p>Killing them is hardly punishment enough. But then why is it the girl's fault? Men don't know how to control their urges... whose fault is it? I can leave a brand new TV in the streets but if people were honest, nobody'd take it. If someone takes the TV, is it my friggin fault that he's dishonest? Hey so its my fault for leaving it there, but you don't see the honest people taking it do ya? ^^</p>
