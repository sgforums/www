              <p>Ah Elindra Elindra. So different from when I met u. heh</p>
              <p>You realise the newspapers don't always report whats going on, neither do rape victims. Maybe if you dated some girls u'd realise that.</p>
              <p>Of course, men aren't outright vicious barbaric creatures, or else how many thousand years of evolution would have been for nought. But like I said, is it my fault for leaving a TV in the street when a honest person wouldn't take it? No. Men who don't cheat, fine. Men who do? Can't control themselves, simple.</p>
              <p>And I love the "it takes 2 hands to clap" logic. Suddenly all victims of crime have some part to blame too. Oh dear being victimised is bad enough. Suddenly, they're to blame partially too! Heh love the Singapore mentality.</p>

              <p><br>Thats not true. Lots of people in polygamous relationships are straight. There ARE people who are by nature not monogamous. I don't pretend to understand how they think or feel, in fact, I frown on it. But fact is, it happens and some people are capable of *shudder* selfless love. It ain't for me, but lets not knock those whom its meant for.</p>
              <p>And you can pack up your discrimination against gay relationships thank you very much. coitus is overrated and is hardly the key to a monogamous relationship. Its all up in the head and if you fail to realise that, you fail. Epic fail.</p>

              <p>all humans are polygamous by nature. we're just being restricted because of culture. it is in us that we have mating seasons just like animals.</p>
              <p>Polygamy is not wrong, it's human nature. Not to say we should go around doing it with anybody like animals, just that in the barbaric times, humans are not bounded by culture.</p>

              <p>Sorry thats a fallacy.</p>
              <p>Some people are monogamous by nature, some are polygamous. Humans aren't exclusively one or the other naturally.</p>
              <p>Just as there are people who need to fu*k with lots of other people, there ARE people who genuinely do not feel the need to be with more than one person. Some people are even naturally asexual and want to be with nobody. To say monogamy arose strictly out of culture is wrong.</p>
