              <p>Sorry thats a fallacy.</p>
              <p>Some people are monogamous by nature, some are polygamous.
              Humans aren't exclusively one or the other naturally.</p>
              <p>Just as there are people who need to fu*k with lots of other
              people, there ARE people who genuinely do not feel the need to be
              with more than one person. Some people are even naturally
              asexual and want to be with nobody. To say monogamy arose strictly
              out of culture is wrong.</p>

              <p>anyway, most of the men probably won't mind if they get free fks with girls. But it is only when he is really with someone he loves, he will choose to restrict himself to her.</p>
              <p>like I used to say, you may argue that sex with different people gives different experiences, but it is after all a hole and a stick. It's the connection between the two that makes the intimacy enjoyable. That's why some men chose to stick with their partner for life.</p>

              <p>my personal take is that if you can be intimate with your current partner, then surely your past and your partner's past might have some form of intimacy as well..</p>
              <p>but why be bothered about the past? let it be, the present and the future is more important.. love he/she to the best of your abilities and try not to let anything come in between..thats important i would think..</p>

              <p>If your best friend told u he's hokkien instead of cantonese after years of hiding it, its not like anything is going to be different, why would it be just because u know he's gay? He's not made a move on u, and he won't. Gay people dont hit on everyone of the same gender you know. They have standards too.</p>

              <p>I wasn't aware that sex is just a hole and a stick. Sex is a few holes, a stick(or 2 or more!), thousands of vibrators, 20 fingers, 4 hands, 2 tongues...</p>
              <p>But no, there are people who are by nature exclusively monogamous even to people they don't really love. Its their NATURE, how do you expect them to behave polygamously when they're like that since birth? And what about asexuals? There you go. Disproved, thank you.</p>

              <p>wait up.</p>
              <p>I think the scenario is worth exploring.. Lets say someone were eyeing on the plasma tv and the guy/girl just left to grab his kid running off limits, and the dishonest someone came and steal it. Then that's the fault of the someone.</p>
              <p>In terms of man and woman, like someone said, it takes two hand to clap.</p>
              <p>the man is bent on bedding his female colleague, brings her out to pub and drink and stuff. make her drunk and high and brought her home. In the name of alcholic influence, they done it. Such a scenario, probably both has a part in the blame..</p>
              <p>but the TV scenario is more like, the man spiked his colleague's favourite drink that is put in the common fridge and when the colleague black out after the sip, he took advantage and do it. In what way it is similar to the dishonest person you labelled? because the drink was something the man knows the colleague liked. the Plasma TV is something u know people would love to have in their homes.</p>
              <p>So you threw the bait for the unknowing person to bite it.</p>

              <p><br>You're welcome. It's time someone told you like it is. Hoping that she'll wisen up is the worse way to deal with it. Sit down and talk about it, or just accept your lot in life. Having expectations and hopes opens you up to disappointment, and when you get disappointed you'll end up feeling bitter, and that, mister, is the surest way of destroying a relationship.</p>

              <p><br>The big hole in your logic is the existance of people who are asexual by nature. Simply put, humans are never exclusively one or the other. Therefore you are wrong. We can't say humans are monogamous by nature or polygamous by nature. Fact is, we're a mix of both.</p>
