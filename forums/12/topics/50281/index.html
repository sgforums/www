My take is that observe that guy carefully and cautiously - any details that could spill his true self, take note.

            <div class='col-md body'>Latest Update : Just last nite she confided in me regarding the problem and she herself came to realise the guy isnt serious abt the potential r/ship. Then later in the same nite, that guy himself in the end told the girl he feels 'its better to be just friends' ... lucky that guy told her all these now.. and frankly, I am very relieved she saw the light before even that guy confessed.<br><br>And for those interested to know .... <span style="color: red;"><strong>YES. I am interested in her</strong></span>. I didn't know what I should be feeling prior to all these, cos I am not sure if its just a crush or is she someone I like.. and after tat guy 'swooped' in, I got my answer.. and I tot it was over for me. But it seems, things have changed in an instant. And I forsee a chance for myself.<br><br>Issit Fated that all these happened ? or mabbe just some coincidence ? I dunno... the world really works in strange ways.<br><br>I've initiated a date with her, to meet up next week. Slowly and hopefully, things will blossom.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey bud, from the way I see how she confides all her problems in you, she's treatin you more like a confidante than a possible partner. It's the mysteriousness between both parties that makes them fall for each other, look what happened between them within 9 days.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  I would think maintainin a distance from her would be good, not too close but yet not too far. Don't ever become her best buddy where she goes about telling everything to you, when that happens, chances of her being together with you is like zilch. You've seen how other forumnites complain about being so good to the girl yet not getting them right? I'm sure you don't wish to end up like that.<br><br>Alright, with this advice in mind, go get em' tiger!<br><br>I will not be responsible should any backfiring occur while following the advice given above.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>1) How long have you guys known each other and has she always been confiding in you??<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> if it's like over a long period; say a few yrs, and she's been constantly confiding in you, I think she merely treats you like a buddy of some sort. (Rem, platonic r/s happens to a gal, but not so for a guy)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>2) How often did she mention her likings for other guys to you?<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Rarely, Ocassionally, Often, All the time?<br><br>3) Probably she has got other intentions by telling you about that guy whom she knew?<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow">  from what I see, maybe she knows you kinda like you from your gestures/body language and stuffs, thus, telling you abt this guy she barely knew for a wk and how much she likes him blah blah blah, hopefully to make you express your likings for her? Kinda make you jealous and see your reaction. (Rem, mind game is often played in this area of field.)<br><br>4) You mentioned you like her, how intense do you think this is?<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> In a spur of moment, you may feel you like her bcoz she confides to you, you may have this sense of possession of her as a friend but not bgr kinda feeling. I hope you get what I mean.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>5) Seems like she falls in and out of 'love' easily. Maybe she's really in need of a companion, but have you ever asked her for her expections of a potential bf? If she don't even have the answer herself, then I think any guy who comes across her path, someone 'nice', 'sweet' can be her bf?<br><br>At the end of the day, please take all suggestions/comments with a pinch of salt. Just my 2 cents worth. I may be wrong though. You know her personally, not us. We're just giving you our opinion from your posts.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Of coz should you decide to go for it, I wish you all the best.<br><br>Cheerz.<br><br></div>
