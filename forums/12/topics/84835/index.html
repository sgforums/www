Is not the matter of whether you mind or don;t mind that age gap..  there are many cases where couples age generation are so wide.. Basically, is the emotional needs they wan from each other.. Will your friend be able to give what he needs??  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>The thinking from a 20-year-old young adult... is very much different from a 37-year-old guy.. Your friend is jus too emotinal here.. and she jus go with her heart without much thinking of the consequences behind it.. The guy make the first move to back out.. cos he knows that this won't work out.. but of cos.. he shouldn't done it in this way..<br><br>Telling your friend age gap too wide.. she won't listen.. cos she already had her mindset that this doesn't pose any of a problem to her.. You must try to convince her that this guy isn't suitable for her in another way.. Let her is jus her "YI SHI CONG DONG" and crazy over him.. Since that guy has already hinted to her by not returning her sms.. She should jolly-well know that the guy wants to put a full-stop to it.. Even thought he declared that he likes her.. But then after... he realised.. like is jus about liking.. he couldn't get the things/needs he wants from the girl.. like marriage..   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Well.. at this point of time.. your friend will definitely says.. "YA i'm READY" blah blah blah.. If that's the case.. no matter how much you all advised her.. it won't help.. unless there's someone out there who can really knock her senses up.. If not. i suggest you ask your friend to have a talk with this guy.. and settle it once and for all.. Tell your friend what's best for her (and the guy).. Loving one doesn't mean is a MUST to have him by your side..~  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>CHeers..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">*someday somewhere she meet her MR.

A litte more open and readily accept such ideas. The guy on the other hand probably might have a little bit of generation gap?<br><br>Anyway you can find out the horoscope of the guy? Not sure about his initial thinkings... But main possibilities may be...<br><br>1. He wants it to be an 'underground' relationship. Meaning he might not really be into a proper relationship. (this is hard to judge for now if he's this type as such mentality would really varies among different people)<br><br>2. Consciously or subconsciously, he's applying <strong>'age gap pull technique'</strong>. Meaning he love your friend and don't wanna let go. Somehow figuring that though things might not be so readily accepted by the society now, in about 5 years' time or so when your friend matures even more, their age gap would appear relatively smaller? By then the relationship can develop into a more open one. Now he perhaps is thinking of nurturing it 1st.<br><br>'Alternate' is a method for your friend to give up on him? But guess both of you don't want that huh?<br><br>The guy's avoiding her might be out of fear (in case 1 mentioned above) of his intentions leaking out / guilt of such a thought. OR just a MINDSET that such a form of relationship won't be accepted (especially now that case 2 is exposed and lost).<br><br>MINDSET is something which is usually HARD to change. Especially as you AGE. Especially if you're someone who's not used to such.<br><br>Do you think your friend can CHANGE his MINDSET? From here... I figured that one of the best chances would be to OVERWHELM him with LOVE... So that it'll become a HEART over MIND situation. The rest can slowly work on it...</div>
