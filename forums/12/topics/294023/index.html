It really depends on how the teachers transition them over, and the personality of a child.<br><br>So choose the school carefully, what is most important is that the children in that school should be happy and enjoy going there.<br><br>So yes, if financial is not a problem for you, it is better for your child to go.<br>Children at this age are like sponges.<br>You will be surprised how fast your child picks up skills.<br><br>Although, what I cannot tahan is that they also picks up sickness from other kids real easy.<br><br></div>

Are they enjoying the activities ? Are the teachers engaged with the children or do they just teach and stand one side ?<br>Do the school allow parents to visit any time they want ?<br>What is the teacher to child ratio ?<br><br>If the school is boring and teachers don't deal with bullies, which child would be happy to learn ?<br>Observe, study, choose wisely, and your child will have more to gain.<br><br>Frankly, I sense you are unwilling to send your child to school.<br>Are you a stay at home mother ? or a working mom ? OR<br>Has it to do with the fact that it was your MIL who suggested it ?<br><br>At first, my SIL was very against the idea of putting her first child to school, I remember she had a big fight with my brother.<br><br>But after 2 weeks, she told me she was glad to see her son actually enjoys going to school. And his language skills picked up super fast.<br>The boy used to be very shy and would hang his head when a stranger talks to him.<br>Now he's a wascawwy flirt with the girls !<br><br>Now, the twin girls are attending schools at 18 months.<br><br></div></blockquote>hmmm my baby cousin speaks very good english for his age due to his early pre-schooling. Just don't overstress your child with education.</div>
