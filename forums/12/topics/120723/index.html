            <div class='col-md body'>First Of All , Thanks To People showing Interest in this topic .. I like to get started by telling about my relationship with a girl .. She was younger than me by two years and we were in the same CCA .. one fine day after cca event , i got a chance to talk to her (junior) .. back then i didn't really know her , just found her cute .. she was waiting at the bus stop for her parents , the rest went to have dinner .. to my own surprise .. i got this compulsion to stay instead ... waited with her ... it was around 9-10 p.m ( public performance then) i guess i was infatuated .. she seemed so perfect .. i had a lot of concidence with her .. too numerous to quote .. it was september last year .. i got her number and contacted her ... over the weekend , i jumped into a silly mess by asking her to be my gf .. back then i was silly .. can't blame .. she thought over the weekend .. agreed on monday .. ever since i would be with her after cca , send her back whenever i could .. but she had a best friend who sort of liked me before .. rumors were that she made my gf agreed to get back at me .. my gf was easily influenced .. throughout three months i was only with her during dawn and dusk .. came to school with her during holidays for cca .. and send her back ... we didn't went out once on a serious date ... the next thing that happened stirred up everything .. her cousin (one years older than her) objected to her having a relationship for she thinks that my gf is too young ... from then on .. we drifted apart .. first i couldn't talk to her in school , couldn't sent her back , can't wait at te bus stop for her ... my gf was afraid that someone sees .. eventually her phone was taken by her parents as they were expecting more from her results .. then i couldn't call .. couldn't message .. but i still kept on waiting .. believing that we would continue .. her best friend continue to avoid me .. dragging my gf along . i had practically no contact with her till she got her phone back .. we managed to message .. however her tone was that as if we broke up already .. i managed to make her feel comfortable with the waiting .. she said that i should find somebody more worthy of my love .. (addition , she told me months ago about something bad that happened to her in the past .. i accepted her still ..) .. just when it's possible that we would get back together again .. she gave me a message saying that she hates me , wanting to return my things .. she reject all my calls and didn't reply my messages .. i waited for things to cool .. called her sister .. who said that i should wait .. lots of my friends thinks that it's her best friend that influenced her decision .. in fact .. one of my friend quoted that my physical gf was indeed her but mentally is her best friend .. i got lots of advice .. saying that she would believe in her friends more , and prefer their company .. well .. all this while i accepted it .. on valentines' day .. i gave her a present which was .. expensive to a certain extent .. she didn't want to accept .. now she gave me back everything .. i' wondering whether i should continue to wait for something to happen or for time to pass then talk to her .. her best friend is forever in the way .. perhaps all hope is lost ... sorry for the long message .. thanks for listening .. feel free to comment</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Like you, I have my BGR when I am very young. I have several relationships that don't last long. Let go of your infatuations.<br><br>You would find that as time pass by things would be better. Time can heal wounds.<br><br>If you really love her, then wait for her. Just be a friend to her. Remain in contact as days go and perharps in future, this would spin a long lasting relationship.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

No phyiscal contacts like a bf though.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Forget about spending money on expensive stuffs...it's the thought that counts.<br><br>I could read that you like her alot, so I'm not going to ask you to give up on her. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Instead, I would like you to see situations from her angle. Put yourself in her shoes instead, if your actions are going to put her in a difficult position...by all means, avoid those actions. What she needs right now is not you, she needs to regain her parent's support.<br><br>Continue to be her frd up to the point of becoming her close frd, treat her like your best frd and you will do fine. Remember...I said frd, so please limit your rights to frd only and not bf. But you can still show her your love while you are still frds.<br><br>Tell her that you still like her...if you still does (Don't do this often...only occasionally and perhaps rarely when the moment is correct). <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> And you would rather be her frd than not in her life at all...agree? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> So go ahead and be her best and closest frd. I'm sure she won't mind to be frd with you at all. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>It is really difficult to find someone that you truly like in this wide crazy world, and I'm happy that you have found yours. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Good luck and all the best to both of you. Be patience and when things don't go well...remember that you are her frd and not her bf, so don't go and analyse her single day cos it is definitely going to make you a miserable boy. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> Give her a call if you miss her and be honest about yourself, honesty brings out the real frd in everyone...including you. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>It is definitely not going to be easy for you, but think of it this way, if you are not there for her...how would you have felt if she's in trouble or having problems in the future? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Be there for her, for yourself and her. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
