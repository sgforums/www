I've sms her 4 times to ask her out for dinner---she gave me a valid reason for not being able to go out with me for the 1st 2 times and for the last 2, she did 'nt reply at all. Each sms i sent her is about 1 to 1 1/2 weeks apart...and i get to see her about every 3 weeks....NOW the problem is she has been avoiding me and treating me like a total stranger everytime i get to see her and this happen ever since she did'nt reply my 3rd sms....<br>B4 we exchanged numbers i did hinted to her (in an indirect and not serious) that i like her....<br>I ask my peers and some said that i might have offended her by IRRITATING her...but how is that possible??  i dun see her very often and i dun sms her very often as well..i have not even tried calling her before....someone pls help...</div>
