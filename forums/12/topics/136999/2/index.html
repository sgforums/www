            <div class='col-md body'>Hello,<br><br>Since u call her almost everyday, of course the 2 of u will 'run out of topics' , meaning, almost every topic has been discussed already previously. Coz the 2 of u are not like new friends.<br><br>Basically she's not asking u or expecting u to come up with interesting topics, she just wants to 'stay in touch' with u. She wants u to continue to show care and attention/ concern. She wants the 2 of u to stay 'connected'. At the very least, and that's why she'd ask u when u don't call her.<br><br>Don't worry about how long u talk, or that there's nothing interesting to talk on that day. Coz that's not what the both of u want from that phone conversation. Right?<br><br>Trust me, when the 2 of u can talk about uninteresting things, u should be happy instead. Coz it means u have progressed the relationship.<br><br>When she just keep quiet sometimes, like what had happened, and still expects u to call her daily, she has basically 'accepted' ur 'connection'. Again, u should be happy instead.<br><br>Just chat with her daily and talk about how ur day went, and ask her about her day.<br><br>This is what she really wants. Care and concern. A certain 'connection'.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Usually I think the girls can talk more compared to the guys. So after a while if your topic dept. runs dry and you cannot think of anything interesting to talk abt, get a "sounds good" excuse to end the conversation.</div>

She will share gossips abt her frens, sch, work etc. U be a good listener &amp; offer advice/ sympathy if she is feeling moody</div>
