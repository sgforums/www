I am almost sure that in the end, you still cannot communicate and handle women. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Worst, you would be likely to prefer women in this Â‘new worldÂ’ instead, where all you need is to employ money and these slatterns could give you the Â‘confidenceÂ’ you need as a man.</strong></span><br><br>There is no rejectionÂ…no fearÂ… no need for personalityÂ… looksÂ… or anything other than cash, which will probably reduce your anxiety when you are around their presence, but certainly not to the women you meet outside this line.<br><br>I am against prostitution not because of moral grounds, but because I personally know someone who works in this industry and it saddens me to understand the kind of things man do to her... which, to me, is classified as blatant violence.<br><br>Although I did what I could, but yunhaier is not God.

Seriously, I'm considering visiting a prostitute as I can't see myself ever having any kind of fruitful relationship with a woman in the near future. Is it really that sinful? It is legal and I am not a religious person. So, what do you think?</div></blockquote>It is your choice isn't it? I have a frend who is sailing with NOL and I think he must have slept with thousands of pros... he gets lonely because he does not have a GF or wife... other than that, I do not find anything wrong with him.
