            <div class='col-md body'>Hi outofcontrol, My 2cents worth of assumption &amp; opinion...<br><br>Must be tough on you siah... What's worse is knowing that those around you, and even people who're 10 years younger, have tried the "forbidden fruit"... You may even worry that next time your gf may be disappointed at your inexperience in sex blah blah...  since you're well pass the age of social acknowlegement of "first timers"... aiye... "Loser" may be the word to describe many males that fall under this category by females.. I can understand your pressure. I believe you did consider many factors before coming to this thought of visiting prostitutes...<br><br>IMO, alot of people despise those paying for sex... but look around you.. ONS is happening everywhere in SG too... Just check out the night spots in SG &amp; you'll know... Males &amp; females alike... Only difference is that the ONS is "free".. but not necessary STD free.. At least prostitutes have regular checkups.. LOL Yet I don't always hear the same condemnation on ONS...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Morals aside. Society has already eroded far enough, there's no need for more hypocrisy on my part... It's the 21st century, You're not religious, You're single, You have your urge, You don't owe anybody an answer. If you STRONGLY feel that it's a step towards breaking your stigma, I respect your decision. It's <strong>politically</strong> correct to advise you against it but, you're old enough to decide and face any consequences. Life's always a learning experience...<br><br>I wish you all the best in whatever decision you made! &amp; may all lonely souls out there find their sincerest other soon without resorting to extreme measures to quench their longing thirst... aiye...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My advice is do not visit the prostitute when you're at this state of mind. It is similar to getting into another relationship after you just broke up. The state of mind is wrong. Morality aside.<br><br>If you really want to resolve your problem, go join some activities or arrange to meet with your friends more often. You can also go do some charitable work.</div>
