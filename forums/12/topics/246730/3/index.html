            <div class='col-md body'>Let us look at this incident by stepping into the shoes of the 3 parties mentioned.<br><br>1.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">TS<br>He caught his buddy going to his gf's house. He got angry, he whacked<br>his buddy. Now, he's facing charge of assault?<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Q : a) Why did TS think his buddy is interested in his gf?<br>b) Were there any previous incidents whereby he saw his buddy going<br>to his gf's house?<br>c)  Did his gf complained to him about his buddy harassing her?<br>d)  Has he confronted his buddy about his perceived interest in his gf?<br><br>2.  [u]Buddy<br>Buddy was caught going to the house of TS's gf. He got whacked. He<br>made report to get TS charged.<br><br>[i]Q : a) How strong is Buddy's relationship with the TS?<br>b) Did Buddy got any encouragement from TS's gf such that he felt<br>he had more than a fair chance of wooing the girl?<br>c) Did Buddy felt that TS will not mind his being friends with the girl?<br>d) Did Buddy defended himself and returned TS's attacks blow for<br>blow?<br><br>3.  [u]Girl<br>TS's gf. Witnessed TS whacking his Buddy outside/inside her home.<br>She will be the main witness should TS be hauled to court. She will, for<br>sure, be told by her parents &amp; family members not to get involved<br>especially if the fight ends up as a police case.<br><br>[i]Q :  a) Does the girl regards TS as her boyfriend or just a friend?<br>b) IF, she and TS are an item, why didn't she inform TS about his<br>Buddy going to her home (citing reason if it's an innocent visit)?<br>c) Did she stop or try to stop the TS from hitting his Buddy?<br><br>The answers to the above questions will give us a clearer picture of what happened.<br><br>It is a fact that whoever is the one to FIRST hit another person, is in the wrong. But if there are no other witnesses, except for TS's gf, TS will have a very good chance of getting a lesser charge (disorderly behaviour in public?) if he said his Buddy was the one to provoked him to defend his honour or whatever.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>I personally feel that MISCOMMUNICATION always cause MISUNDERSTANDINGS.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> </span></span></div>
