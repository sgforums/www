            <div class='col-md body'>ok i guess TS probaly punched that guy, not because its for the girl. its probaly for himself. punches were thrown for mistrusting that guy.<br><br>TS was probaly also gentlemen enough not to lay a finger on the girl, though a bytch she was. ( if there's really smth btwn her and tt guy tt is. ) perhaps TS was abit rash at that moment and didn't really know the correct action to take and thus, the punches came.<br><br>no point crying over spilt milk right. nothing can be done to revert back. giving him advices on what he shouldn't do at that point of time wouldn't really help. guess what we can do is advice him on what he should do now.<br><br>and what i can advice for you to do, is probaly just go straight and tell him in the face that you're sorry for throwing the punches at him, and try to dig out reasons for him coming out of your gf house.<br><br>1) if its really nothing, tts if you still are able to trust him, sincerely apologise and just pray he forgives you and lightens the charges.<br><br>2) if he's really eye-ing for your gf, tell him that you felt so disappointed trusting him as a friend/buddy when he actually does this kinda thing to you. and afterwhich, start badmouthing him to all your friends and his friends  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Aww man that has to be one of the worst feeling to see your 'good friend' come out of your beloved gf hse. Seriously that had to be the worse feeling, the anger the rage, your heart suddenly drop down like mad. Boh of them were asses. Eventhough it was not rite for u to beat him up but I think in this world there would be lots of ppl that would have done the same thing if they were in your shoes. I mean come on..u got a heart attack when u arrive at your gf's place to see another guy in her hse. That would have made u feel disgusted. I cannot imagine the amount of stressed u suffered at that very moment u had to witness that horrible sight.<br>I think your 'girl-stealing' friend should drop the charges made against u just out of guilt and human dignity and then your gf  just forget about her. Maybe give her the option of whether she still wants to be wif u or him. If she chooses u, just forget about it. Go for someone else worth your time man.</div>
