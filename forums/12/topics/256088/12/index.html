Although this is not an election, the sgForums Inner Circle will definitely take on board, where appropriate, as much feedback from you as possible. It is also a chance for you to question and get to know your prospective future moderators.<br><br>Please avoid posting messages which do not contribute to this aim! (I know its hard but try lahÂ…) Also, if there is any feedback you would like to give in private, please feel free to PM me.
