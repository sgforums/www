            <div class='col-md body'>Dear sgForumers of Aunt Agony Land<br><br>Applications for the moderator positions have closed and 5 candidates have been shortlisted to proceed to the final round of selection. Congratulations to all of them!<br><br>As at the end of the day, the moderators will be serving our community, I would like for the community to be able to get involved in this selection process. To this end, I have opened this thread to give every member an opportunity to give feedback and also to have a Q&amp;A session with the prospective candidates. Although this is not an election, the sgForums Inner Circle will definitely take on board, where appropriate, as much feedback from <strong>you</strong> as possible. It is also a chance for you to question and get to know your prospective future moderators.<br><br>Please avoid posting messages which do not contribute to this aim! (I know its hard but try lahÂ…) Also, if there is any feedback you would like to give in private, please feel free to PM me.<br><br>The following posts will contain messages from each of the candidates introducing themselvesÂ…<br><br>---<br><br>Other info:<br><br>There are 3 moderator positions open but depending on how things go we might only fill 1 or 2 of them after these selections.<br><br>We hope to make a decision by early June.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>From BadzMaro:</strong></span><br><br>First of all, I would like to thank Jason for the vote of confidence in shortlisting me as one of the candidates in the final round of selection for the position of moderator in the Aunt Agony forum.<br><br>Dear People of Aunt Agony,<br><br>Your salvation is here.,Some of you may know me, many may not. I sincerely hope that this brief introduction of myself will allow you to know me a little better. I am currently working as a S.manager ) in a company which deals with construction , engineering/geophysical works , oil and timber.<br><br>During my short 25 years , I have been exposed to many incidents in life , both good and bad and. have had the opportunity to meet with all kinds of people. I have to say that the hardest job by far is knowing how to deal with people from all walks of life.. However, I have matured with every experience and as a result every decision I have made becomes wiser and more sound. . At work, I run a tight ship , but that does not mean I am humorless. I love to enjoy life too. about the brief introduction. Here are my reasons as to why I am interested in being a moderator and how I believe I can benefit the forum..<br><br>I am an active participant in forum discussions in general and have a good understanding of a moderatorÂ’s role. I am confident with my ability to rate the quality of a topic or comment posted on the forum - any abusive, offensive and non-productive comments will be deleted. I believe everyone is entitled to their opinions within the boundaries of reason and logic.<br><br>As the new Moderator of Aunt Agony , I will ensure the forum is strict but fair for all.. Under my benevolent despotism, I will look upon all views with impartial eyes, not to be swayed by petty emotions. and attempt to place myself in oneÂ’s position to better understand oneÂ’s circumstances. Recklessness and rudeness shall not be tolerated.<br><br>My life experience has taught me to be diplomatic. I understand that many people do not deliberately set out to break the rules, but mistakes can be made. Where necessary I will explain to people why their comments have been edited or deleted to better educate them on how to be good members of a forum. Most importantly I will not falter under the pressure of the masses if I know what I am doing is right. .<br><br>I believe I have what it takes to be a good moderator. I am dedicated to this forum and believe , that with strict regulation in place, Aunt .Agony can become a place where real people can come to share their problems and real answers and advices are given to help provide solutions. At the end of the day , know that we have all helped another some way or another.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>From Yunhaier:</strong></span><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Good day everyone,<br><br>Aunt Agony has always been an online domain for a vampire like me to lurk. A good six years in fact, but never have I seen how wretched it has become due to the recent hype and saga. I was asked to step up and take measures to clean up the mess and this will be my opening speech, addressing to everyone.<br><br>Perhaps virtual reality seemed too much like a reality for some; heated emotions were 'displayed' and debates went on incessantly.<br><br>Nobody is pristinely good, totally devoid of any misdeed or mistakes. The difference is just that our misconduct is not exposed for public judgement because surely if that were to happen, every single one of us would be negatively perceived, just like anyone else who did something socially unacceptable and got judged by it.<br><br>I remember telling some forumers who PMed me, not to picture that I am 'good person' because you never know who you are dealing with in this vast online world. Yunhaier could be a serial killer... seriously... you will never know. And sometimes, things are better to be kept online than to bring it offline... into reality.<br><br>And yes yes, Vampires are equally evil.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>***<br><br>Firstly, I will address the definition of a MOD:<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>A moderator's task is merely to moderate. </strong></span><br><br>However, take note that everyone is accountable for their own advice/s and everything else pertaining to their advice/s. MOD included.<br><br>Secondly, advice seeker, you are warned against revealing your personal identity and contact numbers to anybody - that includes me. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Trust nobody with your OFFLINE identity.</strong></span><br><br>Next, I will pen down my code of conduct (which I have abided them since my first appearence in AA). Some of you knows about this already because I said in private conversation, but well, here's it:<br><br>i) When it comes to doing Aunt Agony, I do not ask for your contact numbers/MSN/etc. The most I will only ask is your Birth Details (because there are times I am interested to analysis you as a person, since I do not know you real life and that's the closest tool I know to 'know' someone without knowing them in reality. Of course, if you think that I am going to cast spell at you... then I respect your decision for not revealing them too).<br><br>ii) My PMs are completely private. I do not share the content with anyone, much less other forumers.<br><br>iii) I know some of you who PMed me are clones. Rest assured that I won't bother finding out your real identity, since you have preferred to appear to me this way.<br><br>iv) I have told FireIce, even as your MOD, I have given her the full authority and permission to remove me if things go astray with my dealings. Jason will probably publish this for all to see, so I am including this as part of my opening speech to all.<br><br>So that it is.<br><br>I welcome everyone to post in Aunt Agony, especially if you are contributing constructively to the topics here. No hard feelings to those who have left here for whatever reasons because you are always free to pop by occasionally. This is my promise to you - AA is open for all who wants to contribute.<br><br>Although I don't have much spare time to hang around the forum as much as I would love to, but still, I will do whatever I can to keep things in order.<br><br>Lastly and the most important point I would like to say:<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Being a MOD doesn't affect my thoughts or the way I construct my advice/s and also being a MOD doesn't mean that my advice are 'better' than others. A MOD is merely to upkeep the forum. Shed that title, Yunhaier is still Yunhaier.</strong></span><br><br>I can't run the show by myself you know.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>Keep an open mind my friends! Let's make this forum a better place for all to use.<br><br>With that, I shall end my speech.<br><br>Cheers<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>From honeymouse:</strong></span><br><br>Dear AA community,<br>I have been a Sgforum member since September 2006. I was doing a google search for something (name of the restaurant in Singapore) last year and it happened to lead me to this Sgforum where I came across AA. I decided to sign up after I read some of the threads posted on AA from which I recognised the needs for help, advice, support &amp; encouragement, etc.<br><br>It's always been my passion to be able to help and serve others who are in great need. AA is exactly the opportunity I have been looking for, an opportunity for me to reach out to help/advise/support/encourage whenever it's necessary.<br><br>Before Sgforum, I was an active member of another forum which I signed up for exactly the same reason. I managed to contribute my thoughts and advice to people who needed it on that forum and during that time I managed to make friend with a woman who was suffering from depression. All I did was to spend time to listen to her problems and to encourage her through MSN and email. This is the extent I would go to help those who are in need.<br><br>The reason I have developed such a passion in helping others is that I have personally experienced hardship due to family problems etc when I was growing up. I knew exactly how it feels to be helpless and to have no one to turn to. I did also have the privilege to receive the blessings of people who cared enough to help me during adversity for which I am forever grateful and I believe it's now my turn to pass on the blessings.<br><br>I might not do a lot postings on AA unless it's necessary. My usual way of approaching people who are in need is through PM or email whenever I believe it's appropriate. I respect the confidentiality of people's problems and hence I will ensure everything I have been told would be kept confidential.<br><br>It doesn't matter what the outcome is going to be (if I am chosen to be the Moderator for AA or not), I will always seek for opportunity to help and serve. However I believe it's important to give you an account of myself so at least you know my motive of applying for the moderator role. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
