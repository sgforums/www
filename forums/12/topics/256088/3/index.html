Write your thoughts about how AA could help people.<br><br>Read my intro pls.<br><br>2) Do you believe in what you advice?<br><br>Of course ? Or why would i advice<br><br>3) Do you  practice what you advice?<br><br>Depending on the situation. Like i said , reason n logic in most cases. Any everybody has thier own circumstances because not all is truthful in what they say in A.A after few years of reading so many A.A posts. We only advice based on the information they give us under the circumstances.<br><br>4) lets do a few test cases.<br><br>Moderator role. Advice comes secondary.<br><br>a) For the would be moderators whom are guys:<br><br>A is a 16 year old girl taking her O levels this year, She broke up her bf of 3 years and is very upset about it. She has been admitted to hospital for killing herself but was saved in the nick of time. She came to AA for help and you were advising her. You meet up with her and she fell in love with you.<br>Question is what would you do?<br><br>First of all , she has O levels n maybe she should consider studying first. BUt then again she is a girl with a P for PROBLEM stamped on her forehead, rejecting her MAY cause her to suicide again. So in this case,  hell i wouldnt even meet her at all. I moderate.. not meet girls with troubles. Unless NO one in AA can give her any sound advice , i may just advise her on what to do n what is best for her. But then again u say she falls in love with me. . but how will she fall in love with me if i dont meet her ? In my experience , i wouldnt have met up at all. I have met all kinds of girls for ur information.<br><br>b) For the would be moderators whom are gals:<br><br>B is a 16 year old boy taking his O levels this year, He broke up his gf of 3 years and is very upset about it. He has been admitted to hospital for killing himself but was saved in the nick of time. He came to AA for help and you were advising him. You meet up with him and he fell in love with you.<br>Question is what would you do?<br><br>5) C is a 22 year old lady with a 5 year relationship with a guy and is due to get married in 4 months time, she is rape by her own father please note that the father used a condom and sperm is not found inside her private parts which could not be used against him. She comes to AA for advice and what would you do? Bare in mind the lady is a virgin at first and do not wish to sue her father.<br><br>Seek proper counselling or a proper psychologist or therapist.the dad rapes her before she is married ? man..since she doesnt want to sue what can i say ? tell the husband to be ? whatever the outcome , the husband will find out n things will most likely be in his hands. Like u said , she virgin , husband gonna find out. its damn it u do.. damned if u dont. so just do it n tell the husband first.<br><br>6) A 50 year old man with grandchildren comes to AA. He confess to you that he slept around and worried about his wife whom might have some STD becos of him but is at a crossroads as to whether he should tell his wife. What would be your advice.<br><br>TELL THE WIFE. they are going to find out sooner or later.<br><br>7) A 32 year old guy with a wife and 3 kids confess to you through PM that he accidently kill his lover while fighting with her. He had buried the body and is very worried that the police will find rhe body. Bear in mind his wife is not working and his 3 kids are schooling. So is your call now. how to advice?<br><br>Police. He should not have killed even if its an accident.First of all , i wouldnt even call it an accident under the circumstances.Recklessness is more likely , and when a reckless act is done  , means he carries out a deliberate act knowing that there is some risk ot damage resulting from that act but nevertheless continues in the performace of that act. It is done without thought for the consequences of it. N he will pay the consequences either now , or later.<br><br>The above test cases are to test each would be moderators on their advice and roles in AA.
