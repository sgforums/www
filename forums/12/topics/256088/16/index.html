Some of us are neutral, and won't take sides until concrete proofs have been shown.<br><br>What is going around now is that the real victims are not coming out to stand up for themselves, and you are left with people who are supposedly fighting for them. And just like in court, in order to convict a criminal, hard evidences are needed.

Second, because of his manner of reasoning here. I even PMed him and tried to talk to him nicely, so if I am just out to bash him, I wouldn't even bother to PM him.<br><br>Just as how you doubt Devil, there are people who doubt the credibility of Kenashi's words as well. You can't force everyone to be like you, we all have our own eyes and mind to see.</div>
