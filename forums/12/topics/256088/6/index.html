What is the ratio of guy perverts to gal perverts in the papers, news and gossips?<br><br>What a moderator does is to know his/her role as a moderator of a particular sub-forum. To understand what he/she can do and cannot do.<br><br>What a moderator of Aunt Agony in this forum does is different. Mainly because we, as general public/forumites, expected it to be different. We demanded it to be different. We do not understand how a true Aunt Agony forum functions and thus messed up the structure of the system in Aunt Agony here.<br><br>You read the Aunt Agony in the papers and magazines and you will discover how differently it works in the approach and 'advices' it gave to those who post their problems.<br><br>I have no problem with any of the 5 shortlisted candidates. I know Yunnie slightly better than the remaining 4, so I have no worries about him functioning as a moderator. I only hope that if any of the other 4 get selected, YOU MUST KNOW WHERE YOUR LINE IS. Where is your stand and which road you can take and which road you CANNOT take.<br><br>It is your responsibility to moderate the sub-forum and uphold your character as well. <span style="color: blue;">'Reap what you sow'</span> is a bit harsh here, so a <span style="color: red;">'Cause and effect'</span> is a simpler word, though many meanings, to give the selected moderators.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by zeny:</div><div class="quote_body">Since is tough for each and everyone of us to select a moderator for AA let me be the first one to post some tough questions to the would be moderators.<br><br>1) What do you feel about AA? Write your thoughts about how AA could help people.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">As the title of this forum say, AA i a place for agony. Mostly i think this forum is not just for agony, but life problems... like problem about life in work, school, and expecially relationship</span><br><br>2) Do you believe in what you advice?<br><span style="color: blue;">I believe in what i advice may be correct and of course, my friend normally come to me when they have problem with feeling... I can deal with feeling problem and often know how the person really feel. Yup this is the greatest thing that interest me to contribute to AA.</span><br><br>3) Do you  practice what you advice?<br><span style="color: blue;">I am very sad to say that, no... Thought i always feel that i can give advice to other well, but i can't handle myself well. I used to have a problem, a big problem, also a secret, about me. Ya i told myself what to do always, came up with my own solution but, it can't help. I also posted it in this forum and people like devil and honeymouse help me. it was feeling problem which i can't solve. I always believe in only myslef, in the sence that i won't believe a guy if my heart tell me he is wrong and i will believe him if my heart tell me he is correct. but still, even devil and honeymouse can't realy solve my problem but only lighten it... yup til now i haven solve the problem. </span><br><br>4) lets do a few test cases.<br>For the would be moderators whom are guys:<br><br>A is a 16 year old girl taking her O levels this year, She broke up her bf of 3 years and is very upset about it. She has been admitted to hospital for killing herself but was saved in the nick of time. She came to AA for help and you were advising her. You meet up with her and she fell in love with you.<br>Question is what would you do?<br><span style="color: blue;">Yup i have come an situation almost exact as the senario given. I have a friend, not from my school, not close to me at all... Breaking up with her BF, she ended up in hospital as her depression overtook her... she told me, once, and i gave her advice... advice on what she really want and result that i think will suit her best... she took my advice and well, everything went well...<br>I think this question you gave is to see how i repond to a girl who like me if something happens right? ya sadly the girl who i help didnt fell in love with me... anyway, if i had a gf, i would have told her i have one and told her to find other people... ya no one know the future... but if i don't<br>I depend how i feel about that girl and how close we are lor... Yup everything depend on situation, even both situation seem alike, a small different will need a different step. thats what i believe...</span><br><br>5) C is a 22 year old lady with a 5 year relationship with a guy and is due to get married in 4 months time, she is rape by her own father please note that the father used a condom and sperm is not found inside her private parts which could not be used against him. She comes to AA for advice and what would you do? Bare in mind the lady is a virgin at first and do not wish to sue her father.<br><br>6) A 50 year old man with grandchildren comes to AA. He confess to you that he slept around and worried about his wife whom might have some STD becos of him but is at a crossroads as to whether he should tell his wife. What would be your advice.<br><br>7) A 32 year old guy with a wife and 3 kids confess to you through PM that he accidently kill his lover while fighting with her. He had buried the body and is very worried that the police will find the body. Bear in mind his wife is not working and his 3 kids are schooling. So is your call now. how to advice?<br><br>The above test cases are to test each would be moderators on their advice and roles in AA. Please answer sincerely and let the people in AA decided.<br><br></div></blockquote><span style="color: blue;">My answer are in blue in the quote*</span><br><br>And btw for the last question 5 and 7, i would suggest them to go to a specialise as it is a too serious case which i think i don't have the right to judge. But still i will help the person to clam down and then advice him to specialise... This is link with law of singapore...<br><br>but for 7, it's a murder case and most probly i will edit and lock it imediately and tell other AA mod and PM him... It is a too big case to handle even for adults(i think)... And mostly probly, i will have meet him out asap, with an adult is posible from AA... then I think i will most probly clam him down and suggest him to go to police... but still i wont know what to do...<br><br>For 6, i also don't think i have the right to advice him... he is i think 2 generation away from me and i believe he know more then i do... but still i will try my best to help him and if he still can't decide what to do...<br><br>I now tell the truth about my weakness and my strong areas...<br><br>weakness:<br><br>-jus a kid... haiz everyone know this &gt;.&lt;<br><br>-lazy... haiz... but not very serous type lar...<br><br>-bad english... hmm... ya i am really bad in this... haha<br><br>strong area:<br><br>--&gt; decition skill<br><br>I guess my leadership in both my CCA and my job will be good enough to prove how good is my decision. i and both a going to be crew leader in my job and a station inspector in my NPCC... isn't that good enuf? SI rank is the highest rank possible in sec life. and crew leader, i only work for 1 year and already being recommended for it while other have waited for 3years and nothing...<br><br>Also has expireience of a mod... I was once a mod of britina sniper crops ( i forgotten), second in charge of the whole forum... btw it was just a small game forum which contain about 1k plus of people only... unlike SGF... Something happen there and i dunno what our admin doing as he say he wanted to give up everything and it was too boring... he quited the game and close the forum... i also lost the link to that website as i go it from directly from my game link...<br><br>--&gt; Next, my level of seriousness...<br><br>I guess alot of people don't know how seroius can i be as all they see from me is a childish stupid kid posting lame joke all the time... Yup that was the real me... a childish stupid kid who just post lame joke, but not all the time...<br>Think, if i am totally not serious about anything, how do i get my rank in both CCA and work? being i hold such high ranks, yup i was always not serious... But i have change over sometimes and because of i being able to know when to get serious, i was given the ranks...<br><br>My boss told me there is only one thing that is blocking me to take my crew leader test... My Sirs and Mdms in my CCA also told me that that is my my only problem... my lvl of seriousness...<br><br>because of being able to change from an idiot guy to a person know when to be serious, I was given those ranks. Being able both to bring the slackness in a leisure time, very serious guy in important thing, was my strong part which is able to satisfy both my joniors and higher ranks person, and my college and boss...<br><br>so don;t mistaken that i am not a serious guy...<br><br>--&gt;Next, i dont think you guys believe me for this... cus i can't prove anything or give any evidence...<br><br>I have an self aquired skill... to be able to know the real atmosphere and able to guess someone feeling... yup i done it lot of times... i guess this is the skill which make my friend come to my for feeling problem...<br><br>therefore, i started to have an interests in psychology... yup i read a few book in library... like book about lies, eye contact tell feeling, body language...<br><br>i seldom tell people this as i really wanted to keep this as a secret. There is a big reason lies behind it. and all my problem come from here... Its my only secret about myself... yup the only secret... which lead to other secret also...<br><br>so, i don't really often use tell other about how good am i in reading feeling of other... even if you give me an senario, i can't read those fake caracter feeling is the story are very real...<br><br>therefore, i always say this, if you guys have heard, "everything depends on situation"... yup. a small different will lead to another paths also...<br><br>k i know i writen alot about myself and i think this is all i know about myself.<br>Hope to see ya guys vote for me ^^<br><br>sorry for my stupid english and long post... haha<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Do you side wif any of them? or do you try to resolve conflict in a nice way?</div></blockquote>Yes to all 3 ppl asking for help. First of all , let me clarify one thing. They can be flamers , clones , racist pigs , sobs and fakes. Or they can be asses from bar , anywhere.. but once they are in A.A  and genuinely seek help , then help will be given. As long as they stick to the rules , everyone has a chance to seek help or give advices. I give them the benefit of the doubt... first.But if they break the rules , i'll just break them. Of course , i will take into consideration n perhaps warn them.. but negligence on thier part of the rules is no excuse.Only then , can real ppl with real problems get real advices from a variety of people in a nice and orderly fashion. And if they post recklessly , then they will be edited.<br><br>Some ppl may act like at @ss at times , but sometimes they can also give genuine help. Hey , everyone gets naughty now n then.. hell even i do. But at the right time and at the right places. Like i dont get drunk on the job.. i get drunk after.  =P<br><br>Everyone has differences. When the flame heats up , i will use both reason n logic to get them to see each others views. N if they persist , then i have the right to exercise my powers and shut them down. Everyone has thier own views,  its when taking some time out , looking at each others views properly can they truly learn from each other , rather then imposing thier own principles on the other. Sometimes ppl will flame out of anger n frustration and perhaps need some .... reminder to control themselves.<br><br></div>

First of all , let me clarify one thing. They can be flamers , clones , racist pigs , sobs and fakes. Or they can be asses from bar , anywhere.. but once they are in A.A  and genuinely seek help , then help will be given. As long as they stick to the rules , everyone has a chance to seek help or give advices. I give them the benefit of the doubt... first.But if they break the rules , i'll just break them. Of course , i will take into consideration n perhaps warn them.. but negligence on thier part of the rules is no excuse.Only then , can real ppl with real problems get real advices from a variety of people in a nice and orderly fashion. And if they post recklessly , then they will be edited.<br><br>Some ppl may act like at @ss at times , but sometimes they can also give genuine help. Hey , everyone gets naughty now n then.. hell even i do. But at the right time and at the right places. Like i dont get drunk on the job.. i get drunk after.  =P<br><br>Everyone has differences. When the flame heats up , i will use both reason n logic to get them to see each others views. N if they persist , then i have the right to exercise my powers and shut them down. Everyone has thier own views,  its when taking some time out , looking at each others views properly can they truly learn from each other , rather then imposing thier own principles on the other. Sometimes ppl will flame out of anger n frustration and perhaps need some .... reminder to control themselves.<br><br></div></blockquote>u answer my questions pretty well. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>no.2 person is usually posters who intend to hide their problems by posting another new nicks. N for no.1 and no.3, a mod must practice fairness to all, regardless of perverts, racists, jokers, gals, etc. there will be pple who selectively choose to flame or help whenever they see nicks when these posters. A flame may even cause a life n death matter.<br><br>for conflict resolution, it is important dat a mod not siding wif anybody n so far fireice has shown fairness. it will be worst if a mod also take part in the flaming process n shown bias.<br><br>yun is a automatic choice by default. perhap u might be another of my choice too. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
