            <div class='col-md body'>Q: What do you feel about AA? Write your thoughts about how AA could help people.<br><strong>A: I think AA is just like one of these many other online forums where people feel safe to reveal their problems without having their true identity revealed.  I believe itÂ’s good in many ways that people can just come in and have a vent of their issues and seek some advices.  However, it all depends on the seriousness of the issues/problems the people are encountering.  If it involves anything including depression, crimes, violence etc, I believe they shouldnÂ’t rely on AA alone.  They should seek professional advice. </strong><br><br>Q: Do you believe in what you advise?<br><strong>A:  Yes I do.  However, my advice is only based on my point of view and values so I donÂ’t expect the person to agree and I will leave it to the person to decide if he/she wants to take the advice.</strong><br><br>Q: Do you practise what you advise?<br><strong>A:  It really depends on the situations/circumstances.  In most cases, I do practise what I advise.</strong><br><br>Q: lets do a few test cases.<br><br>a) For the would be moderators whom are guys:<br><br>A is a 16 year old girl taking her O levels this year, She broke up her bf of 3 years and is very upset about it. She has been admitted to hospital for killing herself but was saved in the nick of time. She came to AA for help and you were advising her. You meet up with her and she fell in love with you.<br>Question is what would you do?<br><br><strong>A: N/A since I am female.</strong><br><br>b) For the would be moderators whom are gals:<br><br>B is a 16 year old boy taking his O levels this year, He broke up his gf of 3 years and is very upset about it. He has been admitted to hospital for killing himself but was saved in the nick of time. He came to AA for help and you were advising him. You meet up with him and he fell in love with you.<br>Question is what would you do?<br><br><strong>A: N/A. I am turning 30 and I am married. </strong><br><br>Q: C is a 22 year old lady with a 5 year relationship with a guy and is due to get married in 4 months time, she is rape by her own father please note that the father used a condom and sperm is not found inside her private parts which could not be used against him. She comes to AA for advice and what would you do? Bare in mind the lady is a virgin at first and do not wish to sue her father.<br><br><strong>A: I will try my very best to comfort her, help her in anyway I could (including support etc) and provide any constructive advice.  However, my ultimate advice to her will be to seek professional counselling.  A rape can affect her psychologically that might ruin her for the rest of her life and it requires professional help.  ItÂ’s her choice if she wants to report to the authority, my main focus will be her own well-being to ensure that she does seek professional help.</strong><br><br>Q: A 50-year-old man with grandchildren comes to AA. He confess to you that he slept around and worried about his wife whom might have some STD because of him but is at a crossroads as to whether he should tell his wife. What would be your advice?<br><br><strong>A: Based on the question, I only assume that he still cares about his wife and the marriage.<br><br>I'd encourage him to tell the wife the truth, at least his wife can seek medical treatment for the disease.  He needs to assure his wife that he would not make the same mistake again.  IÂ’d also encourage him and his wife to seek marriage counselling to resolve any issues they have in their marriage that led to his infidelity.</strong><br><br>Q: A 32-year-old guy with a wife and 3 kids confess to you through PM that he accidentally killed his lover while fighting with her. He had buried the body and is very worried that the police will find her body. Bear in mind his wife is not working and his 3 kids are schooling. So is your call now. How to advise?<br><br><strong>A: My one &amp; only advice to him is to turn himself in to police.  While I very much love to help people, this is a serious matter that involves murder which is completely beyond my responsibility as a Moderator of AA to advise on.</strong><br></div>

Though I should think generally that moderating issue in AA shouldn't be as bad as Chit Chat, Bar or even Speaker's corner...<br><br>AA's monitoring might more be within the advices of the threads..?

Anyway, I would like to believe that you people are just wishing to help and do your part for AA? Being a Mod would be a way to serve AA but not the only limited way... So long as whoever is selected does not create trouble to the system, I think it might not really matter too much who is selected as a Mod for AA right? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
