FireIce in the past had become involved in conflicts and attacks on forumers in the past, but has since become a better mod after complaints against her.<br><br>She has practiced fairness to a certain degree. But to use her as a yardstick of being fair is a different thing. There are other moderators who can and have been more fair than her. There are reasons why her discretion has always been doubted.<br><br>Sorry to digress so much from main topic, but just want to say not everyone feels FireIce is fair. You may have an issue on who or why, I'm just saying not everyone is as impressed by FireIce as you are.</div>

Like fall of japan, not only dropping of atomic bome cause WW2 to end... there are around 8 major factor and alot alot of other factor...<br><br>So my answer is the same, will contain thing good about me, also will contain thing bad about me...<br><br>So here goes my first factor, but, my answer will be in question form so that you would have a better understanding for this first factor.<br><br>1st<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> read each question slowly, don't rush to the nest so urgently...)<br><br>Why do you want to be a moderator? (as given by mooku)<br>Why wouldn't i want to be a moderator?<br>Why do you want that power? (as given by mooku)<br>Why do you don't want power?<br><br>A moderator or a person being mod, who would you like to be?<br>A boss or a crew, who would you like to be?<br>Why do i like to be a moderator?<br>Do you like being a moderator?<br><br>Isn't moderator just another name?<br>isn't moderator able to take control?<br><br>Yup. This i my first factor why i wanted to be a mod. Hope you guys understand when you read this.<br><br>When you are reading slowly, you sure have some answer past your mind right? These answer, is the same as what i am going to answer. So you know my answer, in your heart.<br><br>i know it sound quite confusing so basically, it mean the lust of power, the power of taking control... you will like to take control, instead of controlled right? you may want to take a look at those question again after reading these explaination.<br><br>2nd:<br>As i have said in my longest post there, I have this skill which i wanna used and not to waste it anymore... also it really feel bad not helping other people when you know exactly how they feel, like someone who has totally a heart breaking case as you, wont you want to help that person?<br><br>This factor means, I don't want to waste my talents... hmm?<br><br>3rd:<br><br>Basically, *pang ren wei kuai le zhi ben"... helping other will make oneself happy... i once used not to believe in this until one day, i dunno why i solve a bad conflict among 2 guys who is friend and i felt really happy when they thanks me...<br><br>This factor is about how does it help me... and it help me to be happy...<br><br>4th:<br>i dun think 2nd and 3rd really answer the question so this will link the question to my 2nd and 3rd. But also, some people may think this 4th factor my strength, some will think it's my weakness. For me, i felt that it is a good factor about me.<br><br>It is a target, a prove. yup this is it. I always wanted to have high aim, and only if i achieve that aim, i am able to prove myself good.<br><br>I wanted to prove to myself that i am not a bad guy, but a good guy in this world. This is why i am always to obtain high leadership position in many thing( guess i repeated this too many times liao) and of course, i does all my job as do what i should do, sometimes even more then what i should do...<br><br>This factor means, i wanna prove myself...<br><br>5th:<br>i believe in karma <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>This factor means, it doesnt does harm to help but it will eventually help me one day.<br>_________<br><br>Guess that answering the 2 question will be a bad idea cus some people may start to think differently of me because of this.<br>I know, but i have to tell the truth. And i believe, this is a serious matter.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Why do you want to be a moderator?<br><br>Why do i want to be moderator ?For the greater good. I have never been involved much in the online community. And due to recent events , i have decided that this forum needs someone who can get tough and at the same time someone who has been out there , in the slammers done that and knows what is right and what is wrong.How many of you have sat in a cell just for 1 dayor 1 month. To shoulder the burden of righteousness. I have done things that i have regretted until today. I have used underhanded methods to get what i want no matter the cost.I have monopolised and abused my position of power before , but i had my reasons,  many do no understand but sometimes it takes someone to sacrifice n get his hands dirty for the greater good not only for the company but was also actually persuaded by my superiors to do so. In this forum , there are set rules to follow, the transparency. I am not bound by corruption , petty feelings and many forms of external pressure in the real world and influences like politics to blur ur decision. Here is where one can exercise his principles to the fullest extent. By being anonymous in the online community , i will not fear being prosecuted for doing the right thing. It is the age of information technology online. There will always be 2 sides. But only time will tell if the decision i make is right or wrong and the mark i leave will forever stay here. A chance for me to right some wrongs and do the right thing using my past experiences.<br><br>Why do u want that power ?<br><br>Only with that power , can u change the system. Will u not go for the position of power , if u know that only by having that power  can u change the system for the better.Some people are too weak to respond or weak to take action even with the powers they have. Some may see me as an opportunist. But if i do not seize the chance now and do something better , then when ? I for one believe in karma , and maybe by doing the right thing i can reduce the big pile o sh|t coming at me. Maybe.. but in the end its still gonna come.<br><br>I have told some about this small philosophy. Some ppl will learn n listen n will know that the sh|t is bad. Some people are stubborn and just want to go against u n experience the sh|t to feel how BAD it stinks ..  some doesnt even have that choice n gets thier face shoved into the sh|t to know what it is and question to themselves WHY did they deserve it? What does it mean by all these ? We cannot help everyone n have everyone saved. In the end of the day it is up to themselves whether they want to listen or not. But with an elevated position of power , ppl tend to listen to those in power then are not.<br><br>This my sound harsh to many , but this the reality. Like many have said , A.A is a different forum and the expectations are high. And  i am here to accept that challenge. I have always loved a good challenge.    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

You cannot have everyone love you. The reality is there will always be attacks on ur character when u are in a position of power. Like i said,  time will tell who is right and wrong. And i will not trade pointless character attacks ,  i will be no better then the person who attacked my character. Like i said , to attack ones character and to accuse the person ,then the burden of proof rests on his shoulders. People make mistakes , but some mistakes cant be made and i will make sure that those mistakes will not be made.Especially mistakes that will condemn me forever.<br><br>Like i said , i am not a saint , nor am i someone with evil intentions.<br><br>Do i like kids ?mmm.... kids like me.. but.. they can get very naught n needs some spanking  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  I like them enough not to hurt them.. he he...</div>
