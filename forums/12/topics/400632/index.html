              <p>Yosh all,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ok. Me and my friends were all like one family now. We enjoy each other company now. Even my facebook, i put whole bunch of my friends names under my siblings category haha. Ok one day, i wanted to watched a movie and my friends agree to watch it with me about 3 of them since its their free time on that day which is wednesday. Once we enter the movie theatre i sit beside in between my friends. the left of me is a girl and the right one is a guy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>ok i think this is where the situation starts, u see i sit beside my guy friend and since we all like family, we all like to fool around (and no, he's not from that "irritating fellow leh" thread). In mid movies, i want to go to toilet and he wants to buy some drinks so we left together then return. We like chat here and there and joke around. While we wait for the queue to buy drinks, we really talk alot haha. It's really fun to accompany him. Then after that, we return to the movie. Even after the movie, we play around each other and he just broke off with his gf so he feel abit sad so i ask him out to KFC just a two of us to cheer him up abit and he really enjoy it. Thats the day 1.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now day 2, he beginning to act strange. Whenever im around him like in the same room and such, he would just like trying to avoid me and its been like 3 days. And finally he talk to me, he wants to go out with me, just two of us again. And yes, i just accept it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Then now the date comes, is just me and him and everytime im trying to talk to him, he just like emo-ish. And i said "whats wrong?" from there on, he began serious. And he talk to me, said that how long we know each other and such. Then he confess that he love me. omg. i thought he's joking, but i knew then from his eyes, he's really not kidding. He really love me. as in like fall in love. i was stunned literally. Then i said to him that i dont want to ruin our friendship because of this so yeah, it will be better off if we just remain friends and he took that not so lightly. So i just hug him as to present my forgiveness.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Day 3, i thought everything went ok but its kinda get worse. Everytime im in the same room as him, he would just say to me hi and smile then like trying to walk away. similar what happen before. He's trying to avoid me and i knew it. And everytime i want to strike a conversation with him, he would just give me a few sentence with his nervous speech like for example, "uhh... u know.. uhhh.... uhh". Which never happen to him before. i really like him not in the love way but i enjoy being his friends now its like awkward.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>please, i really in need of help. i know that this is too hard to believe but pretend this is some sort of drama ok and u write the script of a happy ending and post here. please i really hate to see him like this. please advice?</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>anyway TS, it's extremely irresponsible to think that he'll recover back to normal after a rejection... afterall, it's not like playing a game and u can save and load or reset the game...</p>
              <p>Anyway if u really wan my opinion, just tahan for awhile la... he'll get over it... afterall, most likely he see's u as a substitute for his former gf whom he just broken off...</p>

              <p>Yosh all,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ok. Me and my friends were all like one family now. We enjoy each other company now. Even my facebook, i put whole bunch of my friends names under my siblings category haha. Ok one day, i wanted to watched a movie and my friends agree to watch it with me about 3 of them since its their free time on that day which is wednesday. Once we enter the movie theatre i sit beside in between my friends. the left of me is a girl and the right one is a guy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>ok i think this is where the situation starts, u see i sit beside my guy friend and since we all like family, we all like to fool around (and no, he's not from that "irritating fellow leh" thread). In mid movies, i want to go to toilet and he wants to buy some drinks so we left together then return. We like chat here and there and joke around. While we wait for the queue to buy drinks, we really talk alot haha. It's really fun to accompany him. Then after that, we return to the movie. Even after the movie, we play around each other and he just broke off with his gf so he feel abit sad so i ask him out to KFC just a two of us to cheer him up abit and he really enjoy it. Thats the day 1.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now day 2, he beginning to act strange. Whenever im around him like in the same room and such, he would just like trying to avoid me and its been like 3 days. And finally he talk to me, he wants to go out with me, just two of us again. And yes, i just accept it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Then now the date comes, is just me and him and everytime im trying to talk to him, he just like emo-ish. And i said "whats wrong?" from there on, he began serious. And he talk to me, said that how long we know each other and such. Then he confess that he love me. omg. i thought he's joking, but i knew then from his eyes, he's really not kidding. He really love me. as in like fall in love. i was stunned literally. Then i said to him that i dont want to ruin our friendship because of this so yeah, it will be better off if we just remain friends and he took that not so lightly. So i just hug him as to present my forgiveness.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Day 3, i thought everything went ok but its kinda get worse. Everytime im in the same room as him, he would just say to me hi and smile then like trying to walk away. similar what happen before. He's trying to avoid me and i knew it. And everytime i want to strike a conversation with him, he would just give me a few sentence with his nervous speech like for example, "uhh... u know.. uhhh.... uhh". Which never happen to him before. i really like him not in the love way but i enjoy being his friends now its like awkward.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>please, i really in need of help. i know that this is too hard to believe but pretend this is some sort of drama ok and u write the script of a happy ending and post here. please i really hate to see him like this. please advice?</p>

              <p><br>Hmmm...well i don't think there's anything much you can do about it at least for now. It's up to him to get over the whole incident. He probably feels awkward after the confession and doesnt know how to face you yet. Give him time bah.</p>

              <p><br>If he's emo-ish about it, that's normal.</p>
              <p>If you want him to recover fast fast, then you need to drag yourself and ask him out together with you ALONE, act normally towards him ... hit him playfully *necessary to bring him out of his emo-shit cos guys just like it when we behaved closely towards them*</p>
              <p>You need to un-awkward yourself first before you can do the same to him. No point falling into emo-ish yourself then you got two emo-ish people...cos that might make him think that you're also troubled because you are confused and can't bring yourself to face the fact that you also likes him.</p>
              <p>When he's happy and no longer emo-ish, you can then become emo-ish and thank him for his confession but let him know that you need him to be someone better than a boyfriend. Just give him some title such as "saviour" or "protector" because guys likes to receive such titles to feed their hungry hungry ego shit.</p>
              <p>Then continue your friendship to him as usual and pay concern for him once in a while over smses/phonecalls and continue to hang out with him like best of pals.</p>
              <p>Guys are stupid, so you must be clever if not how are you going to rulez them in your lives? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>Hi simple gal,</p>
              <p>In my opinion, you made a mistake when you went out with him one-to-one when he just broke off with his girlfriend.</p>
              <p>Because during that period, his emotions was still unstable and he was particularly sensitive. So when you had a fun and good time with him, actually for you that is normal, but for him, since he was still in heightened and reflective state, he started to think deeper and start to think that he like you and he love you.</p>
              <p>Well.....it has been done already......it cannot be changed......But for now, I think you just try to act normal with him.....He may feel embarrased and disoriented....and thats why he doesnt know how to act in front of you.....after getting rejected......So just show that you are still willing to resume your friendship and act normally towards him. If he is still withdrawing and avoiding you nonetheless, I guess you just let him be and let him recover his bearings.....give him some time alone....Maybe after some period, he will recover.</p>
