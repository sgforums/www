              <p>Your guy friend seems to want to rebound fast. If I were you, a few weeks on ignore will put him back on track. Instead of being the pro active party, turn passive. Once he senses something, he'll try to right it back.</p>

              <p><br>Told you already guys are stupid, why you go and listen and take their advices?</p>
              <p>How do you expect your guy to recover and be back to his old wonderful self again if your behaviour are showing him that you don't give a damn about him?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We have the power to hurt guys but we also have the power to heal them.</p>
              <p>Go grab his arm one day and forced him to go shopping with you to buy something that he's an expert in. Let him know you need his expert help like you really need him to accompany you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Be assertive! Take control on your guy's neck and steer his emotions in the ways that you want him to feel. If you want him to be happy and normal again, by all means let him feel WANTED again and he will recover in no time like a dried starfish in a bowl of water.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Make him feel wanted and you can proceed to hurt him over and over again and he will be so addicted to your mental torture that he will never be able to get out of it.</p>

              <p>im really sorry parn. but i cant do that. thats way too mean and aggressive.  I normally dont force my friends including him to go with me =.=. But i do ask them nicely though. If they dont want, then its ok. But if they ask me out, i must come haha. its a somesort of friendship relationship mindset. im sorry parn, i can't just do that but i do take your words about healing him. Yeah i think i'm going to heal him xD. Although im not sure what healing are u really refering to.</p>
              <p>Besides i dont think he will agree to go out with me since all of these incident. So yeah, like u guys said time heal all wounds right?</p>

              <p>hey maskedangel, ok sorry if im being rude but ur really mean saying that to me. i can't said these problems with my friends. Thats why i post here behind their back, i dont want them to know ok. *pinch your ear* got it?</p>

              <p>im really sorry parn. but i cant do that. thats way too mean and aggressive.  I normally dont force my friends including him to go with me =.=. But i do ask them nicely though. If they dont want, then its ok. But if they ask me out, i must come haha. its a somesort of friendship relationship mindset. im sorry parn, i can't just do that but i do take your words about healing him. Yeah i think i'm going to heal him xD. Although im not sure what healing are u really refering to.</p>
              <p>Besides i dont think he will agree to go out with me since all of these incident. So yeah, like u guys said time heal all wounds right?</p>

              <p>I'm really sorry that I am not able to give you the encouragement that you seeked.</p>
