Haha...<br><br>i also advice doing Biz Management instead of accountancy, UNLESS u know that's what you want to do. Coz it's specialized and the other area you can work additionally also is in finance-related areas.<br><br>All accounting graduates, if you go into auditing line, in Big 4 companies, your starting pay is $2,000. All the same. it's because the turnover rate of auditors is so high that the companies want to see which are the junior auditors that really love the work or just have enough lifelessness to continue hanging on. This gives the impression that auditors have very good prospects. The truth is, because auditing is such a specialized job (even general accounting), you either love it or hate it, no in-between. So choose carefully. Most accounting students thinking that prospects of accounting is so good, they enter the course and find it's totally boring. U really must love numbers to excel and more importantly have staying power in the career line as accountant/auditor.<br><br>Do consider a BBM (Bachelor of business Management) if you want a more varied and mroe exposed degree. For SMU, our BBM has 5 or 6 majors, if i recall correctly. Most popular is finance, followed by Marketing, then there's also Management, Corporate communications, operations Research etc. Check out www.smu.edu.sg for mroe info.<br><br>SMU's finance is the most popular major. We have very good tie-ups with alot of financial institutions n houses like Citibank, Lehman Bros, UBS, CSFB etc. i'm in Marketing, and i sometimes feel neglected. haha.<br><br>Anyway, if you want to speak well n have the edge and know how to present yourself well. Come to SMU! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> I was very shy n quiet before entering SMU. The compulsory class participation and endless presentations forces one to be at least competent in personal presentations. it's not gonna be easy. Put it this way, in this world, it's no longer about what you know, it's about who u know, how you can connect with people and how you can bring people together.<br><br>Do consider hard in your choice of undergraduate studies! All the best!</div></blockquote>So lest say i took alot of prerequisite subjects like Business Statistics, Biz accounting, management science etc do i still have to take them in the Uni or will i be exempted?</div>

Once you grad, u can choose to be an accountant. Or you could choose to go into NIE.</div>
