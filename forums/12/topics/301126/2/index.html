            <div class='col-md body'>this situation is tough lah.. because u were at fault too (thanks to your sis and your cousin) so even if someone is out to squeeze you dry, you can't do anything. Its greediness that had landed you in your predicament, so you will have to pay a price for it.<br><br>one thing i noticed is that she says you dont love her, which means your r/s with her is weak, which also goes to say there is a chance that this whole thing might be a setup. in another angle, 1k to see a person's heart is pretty well worth it. it might save u a lot more if this drags on for years.<br><br>imho, just pay and see what happens. lol if i were you, i'd quietly observe and see if she goes on a spending spree after you have paid up.<br><br>1k... enough for me to buy a whole lifetime of shampoo.</div>

(If really so, how will your gf knows what he do with the $?)<br><br>Worst come to worst your gf can just resign from the company, if really can't pay. Did the boss have any hard evidence that your gf took the samples? If not, the company is unlikely to report to the police about the "theft". If ur gf had signed something that says that she stole the stuff, then ask her to produce it.

From what it looks like, you are probably being taken advantage by ur gf since u like her so much. As others have said, ask for hardcore evidence. Don't just be dumb and feel sorry and pay up!!!<br>Even if you owe others money, its your RIGHT to ask for proof of receipts/invoices. Good luck.<br><br>And if I were you, I will break up with my gf if she doesn't give me a proper, clear and accurate explanation as to what happened. Trust is very important in a relationship and you are just trusting her after being with her for JUST 2 months? Don't do that mistake..</div>
