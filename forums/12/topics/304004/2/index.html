Some ppl find fat as handsome, hence dun mind their partner to be fat. If u are not one of those and are fat, dun u think it is time to do something about it? Fat is something u can work on, but not flaw gene, true ugliness. But then again there isnt ugly women/men, only poor women/men.</div>

              <p><br>still same mah... Any standard advice or knowledge applies to everyone who does not have any other outstanding medical problems... It is just whether you want to take the first step.</p>
              <p>Other than that... A bit fatter or not doesn't really affect judgement. Gals that diet till too thin =&gt; prone to osteoporosis next time. Body does not have enough nutrients too. I dunno how to say, but gals that are too slim may be a burden in the future.</p>

              <p>You
              can use the BMI tool above to check whether you are in healthy weight
              range. Except for bodybuilders and pregnant women, everyone should put
              in effort to make sure they are in healthy weight range.</p>

              <p>I know of some men who don't mind fat girls. But they ALL HATE LAZY girls.</p>
              <p>Your knee problem could be weight related. If you don't control your weight now, you will have more problems, your internal organs will start to fail due to too much pressure from fatty tissues cramping up your inner space.</p>
              <p>You can always seek medical/professional help to keep your weight in check.</p>
              <p>If worst comes to worst, you may need a gastric bypass/band to curb your appetite. And these surgery comes with risks.</p>
              <p>Think about it, is it cheaper to go exercising and dieting now, which is almost free. Than to have to pay much more later when your health deteriorate ?</p>
