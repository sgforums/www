              <p>Never give up your studies...</p>
              <p>You can apply fortake study loans and apply bursaries, also approach CADC for help. Plus you can take up giving tuitions too. I have know many people gone thru such path and got their degrees and then now they are very much better off and in a position to buy their own condos at the age of 31 only.</p>
              <p>If you relatives are looking down on you, then work harder to proof them wrong, it can be a source where you can draw strength upon.</p>
              <p>Life is a cycle of ups and downs...sometimes is more down then up, sometimes is the other way. However, nothing stays down forever unless you let it be so.</p>
              <p>Hang in there and best wishes.</p>

              <p>It sadden me that the young one measure wealth with just money. I believe I should be your parent generation and have thus seen or gone thru more than that.</p>
              <p>We have been thru stages whereby pocket money is a luxuary, walking kilometres to school is a norm, seeing the principal to explain to him that we are unable to pay this month school fees is just as often. having electrcity and water source cut is just as often. Having flour dough instead of rice for dinner. White rice with black sauce is just another meal. Following our parent visiting relatives to borrow money to tide up for the month to see us thru.</p>
              <p>Yet giving up or feeling ashamed were never on our mind. Feeling inferior never cross our mind because we had never resort to illegal or underhand to acheive what we wanted. My brother had to stop his secondary school to come out to work to help out. That did not stopped him from achieving an "A" level. After finishing my "O" level, that did not stop me from going further.</p>
              <p>Why?  because we were contented with what we have and were just as happy to went thru thick and thin wth my parents and my sibling. and we NEVER GAVE UP.</p>

              <p>Why in the world would you sell your body for money? That's just stupid.</p>
              <p>Anyways there are other ways of earning more money besides selling your body. Even though you didn't manage to complete your studies, you could always work two jobs or work as a nurse (full time). Though the pay ain't good at the start, you can always learn to budget and save money at the same time.</p>

              <p>If u feel that financial is more impt now, then education can wait till u have time n $$$. There are ppl study at 20s, 30s, 40s etc....I heard that govt do help small businesses like loans etc, u should ask ard. Winding up the business might be ur last resort if it takes up too much time n not earning profit. Should sit down n discuss with ur papa. U only have 24hrs aday. Make full use of that but not to overload till u also down since u are the sole breadwinner.</p>
              <p>Or discuss ur situation with professional n ask for help.</p>

              there are still a lot of people living in poverty in Singapore. You are still so young, can still do a lot to help yourself. You still got both hands &amp; legs to help you.
              
              
              1) you can check with the government sector whether they pay for your Uni studies + salary while you sign bond with them.
              After completing your studies, you will work for them till the end of the bond.
              
              2) you can teach tuition where the money comes in faster &amp; time is flexible.
              
              3) your mother &amp; father will feel more sad if you do foolish things.
              
              4) Just as Bak la va quote : talk to the hospital to defer the medical bills or pay by installment after you gratuate &amp; get a job after your Uni. This can be done.
              
              5) As for your relatives, once you are successful or able to go through this, you will see them flocking to you with big friendly smile. 
              
              Jia you!

              <p>The first thing u need to do is acknowledge that its time u contribute to help your family, which you have already done so, so that's good. The next thing is, don't push all the responsibility to yourself. My dad is 60...and he is still managing multiple small businesses to help the family survive.</p>
              <p>Hey dude, don't give up. My own family have been through 10 years of poverty since the Asian Recession in 1997. And till today, we are just merely getting by ourselves. But we did not give up.</p>
              <p>The key is to not give up. Yeah, I know how it feels when there are days when there was no enough money for food, or enough money to cover the bills. But don't give up. About 18 months back, I was going through the exact same experience you. Well, except that I'm already working. and my mum is healthy, I really believe that I'm blessed in that sense. Yet financially, we were as bad as where u r...if not worse. There was a point when my dad thought of selling away our home, and we have to go look for places to stay. That was the state 18 months ago.</p>
              <p>However, one day, I decided that my dad and I, we are going to do our best with whatever we have. The small businesses, we will do our best in whatever we can. And with that, after 18 months, one of our small businesses is finally seeing fruits and growing. We are making good profit every month now. And I've thought of helping my dad bring the business to the regional presence.</p>
              <p>Hey, you can do it! Don't give up on yourself. You just need to make a decision to change your mentality. I know u can do it. You just need to believe in yourself.</p>
              <p>In this case...if u can't study, its alright. Work first. Your family needs you. Your dad sure needs your support. Go all out for him. Fruits will not bear forth overnight, but I promise you, if u persevere long enough, you'll see the rewards.</p>
              <p>I've personally had to overcome a debt situation over the past 18 months. I had used to borrow money and buy things on credit in the past. I was close to 20K in debt just 18 months ago. But after making the decision to change my thinking, and to be practical, and take it step by step. Right now, as of last month, November, I'm officially debt-free. As in, I don't owe the bank, or anyone else any money. I was 24 then, when I was 20K in debt. Just 1 year older than you..<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>
              <p>Right now, I'm just financing my own handphone bill. And with the business that is flourishing, my dad and i are using the profits to help pay for the house, bills, food, etc.</p>
              <p>I hope my experience might be able to shed some hope for you. There's is never such a thing as no hope. The only situation when there is no hope is when you have totally given up. Remember that.</p>
