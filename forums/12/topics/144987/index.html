            <div class='col-md body'>i share your sorrow as i myself had lost a good friend before...<br><br>Death is a way of life. Many great philosophers had always avoided the question of death as it is something horrifying and not worth talking much. It usually marks the end of all life journeys. Even in the warrior paths, death is the ultimate end for all warriors path. I guess the mention of death will strike fear in all mortal beings. Most people fear of death for they are afraid of sinking into some deep oblivion and never emerge again. Some just fear of losing all the things that they work so hard and had to be lost when death approaches.<br><br>As a free thinker, I did not have much or even any faith. I guess some religious people are able to draw their strength to face death with their strong faith. As I talked to religious people, most of them do not fear death. It is no wonder or something to be extraordinary.<br><br>To them, when they died, they do not perish permanently, but instead they move to the kingdom of heaven. In there, they will find entire life and peace. I guess that will make death a bit more pleasure and assuring lol<br><br>But people like us who are free thinker, our faith can be pretty low as we do not believe much in anything. It can be extremely difficult not to fear death. Instead I manage to find my revelation in death through eastern philosophy.<br><br>Lord Buddha is actually a mortal but due to his great deeds, people decide worship him as a god. I had nothing against that but I found his philosophy in death interesting and yet wise. Let me share this tale with you all.<br><br>There was once Lord Buddha was walking past a village. A woman who recently lost her child then came begging to him and asked him for a miracle to return her child. Lord Buddha smile but with sad eyes, he asked her, Â“If you can go through the entire village and get a mustard seed from families whom death had not come to them before, I will bring your child back.Â” Then the young woman tears became joy as she hurry searches the village for a mustard seed. However as she searches the village for the whole day, she just canÂ’t find one. She came back to Lord Buddha disappointed. Then Lord Buddha smile and slowly explains her why. As she can see, death is everywhere and it touches the lives of everyone. She is not alone in this world to have some one loved taken away by death, but everyone had experience the loss taken by death. ItÂ’s just a way of life. Those wise words eventually brought some relief for poor woman.<br><br>I must agree that death of a loved one is difficult to deal with it. It not only takes mortal courage but the will power to let go. I had came past of a story which I hear from the radio talk show. This lady had basically lost her child a few years back and until today she was still unable to forgive herself or even forget about her child death. She cried every time she remembers her dead child.<br><br>I pity her and I guess the mustard story will most probably do her no good for she had being suffering for many years and still unable to let go of her child death. The mustard story as I felt is only useful advise when one person just recently lost someone but when someone lost a loved one for many years, a different philosophy must be used.<br><br>As Lord Buddha said, we suffered because of the attachment we put ourselves to this mortal world. The stage is first hope, like, desire, attached and then sorrow. When a loved or closes one dies, we lost that attachment which so much can define part of our life as a person. It is nature for us to be selfish and for us to fall into a deep resent if we lost that attachment that defines us or fulfill us. Its a price we paid for having attachment to life but yet it makes our lives so much fufilling....<br><br>I will like to use this philosophy on time. When a person dies, most people will often indulge themselves at the point of the person death. They blame and linger like a ghost at the time of death. When they do that, they stay at that point in time and never move. Thus they suffer.<br><br>Time is a river flowing and how time follows is how our brain perceives. That means in simple explanation, when information comes to us, it goes to our eyes, then through our nerves, then to our brain and then our brain will break down the information and then create logic to make sense of the information and finally use our feelings and expression to express the information.<br><br>People who lost their loved ones and canÂ’t get over it, tend to stop their time movement in their lives (by mentally although physical time is still moving) Most of these people are lost and will need some sort of guidance to guide them. My philosophy, is to concentrate on the time of past instead of the time point of death. You see, people tend to emerge themselves in the pain and agony of death that they often had forgotten the good memories of the dead when they died. Instead they choose to linger on a lost cause of suffering. These people should firstly stop blaming themselves for the death and think of the memories when loved ones are still alive. Cherish their memories and time spent with them. Use the time frame of these past memories as source of strength to live. To be truthfully those dead loved ones will never want to see the living loved ones to be suffering for them too.<br><br>For the lady who lost her child, she should stop blaming herself as a useless mother as she is not. The fact she is remorse means she loved her child and had already given all she can do to love the child. Instead she should try to remember all the happy memories spent with the lost child when he/she is still alive. Memories are precious and powerful things which help us to define ourselves. Cherish the memories and one will find strength to stand up and continue living.<br><br>Ask you all another interesting questions, do you fear if you lost your all memories in life? Well think about it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I had a classmate who died in an accident when I was 16. Although Im not that close, I felt a certain sadness and pain in my heart. A year later I changed schools.. And one subject was on Death, Grief and Dying. Surprise surprise..it was my classmate's father who was teaching it. What a small world. Well, basically all u need is time..and to bring closure to the past. U be fine if you can pull through the depression/grieving stage  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
