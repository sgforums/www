              Hi people,
              
              I need some value advise.
              
              I am in heavy debts from credit cards and biz loan.  Biz not doing well and there is no way to revive.
              
              I am married with a kid and we are staying in my parents home.
              
              I cant take the pressure and stress here anymore.  I also don't wish to bring trouble to my wife.
              
              Does anyone know if I left a divorce letter with my wife and fled to other country. Will the debt collectors from bank pester my wife or my parent to return the debts?
              
              Can I get a work permit or permanent resident in other countries with my current status?
              
              Will the banks get the country official to arrest me and bring me back to Sg?
              
              Appreciate with your kind answer. 
              
              Am really depressed.

                      general credit management information, credit counselling and where

              <p> </p>
              <p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="headingGreen"><strong>Need </strong></span><span class="headingB"><strong>Help?</strong></span></span></em><strong><br> </strong></p>
              <p><strong>SEEKING ASSISTANCE FROM CCS</strong><br><br>There is this 3-step process to seek assistance from CCS:</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">STEP 1 – Compulsory Attendance of the Free Info Talk on Debt Management:</span><br>The
                   consumer is requested to attend a compulsory free info talk that is 
                  being conducted on a weekly basis.  This talk explains the various 
                  options in handling a debt problem and the common collection actions 
                  taken by the creditors.  It will also explain the services offered by 
                  CCS so that the consumer can self-assess and decide what he wants to do 
                  next.</p>
              <p>Consumers are requested to register for the free<span style="color: #ff6600;"> </span><a href="http://www.ccs.org.sg/infotalk.php"><span style="color: #ff6600;">info talk</span></a> online.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">STEP 2 – Credit Counselling to Explore Solution:</span><br>If
                   the consumer wished to seek further assistance after he has attended 
                  the free info talk, he needs to collect the Counselling Session Request 
                  Package at the end of the talk, complete and submit it with <strong>photocopy</strong> of the necessary documents to CCS. </p>
              <p>After receipt of the submission, CCS will call the consumer to set up
                   a one-to-one counselling session for him to discuss his situation in 
                  details with a credit counsellor.</p>
              <p>To ensure a meaningful discussion and assessment during the 
                  counselling session, consumer must have attended the free Info Talk 
                  first.  He must also submit <strong>all</strong> the relevant documents and be upfront about the assets, liabilities, income and other resources available. </p>
              <p>To achieve a plausible solution, the consumer needs to be open-minded to explore the various <a href="http://www.ccs.org.sg/help.php#need_help_option"><span style="color: #ff6600;">options</span></a> and be prepared to make lifestyle adjustment in resolving the debt problem.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">STEP 3 – Set up a Debt Management Programme</span> (<a href="http://www.ccs.org.sg/help.php#dmp"><strong>DMP</strong></a>):<br>At
                   the counselling session, the counsellor will assist the consumer to 
                  work out a monthly budget, explore options and identify the most 
                  appropriate solution for his debt problem at the moment. </p>
              <p>If at the end of the counselling session, both the counsellee and his
                   counsellor concurred that the Debt Management Programme (DMP) is the 
                  most suitable option, CCS will then work on it, <em>subject</em> to the DMP Review Committee’s approval, put it up for the creditors’ consideration and acceptance.</p>
              <p>A DMP is a debt repayment plan via monthly installment payment over a reasonable time frame.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><a name="need_help_option"></a>OPTIONS IN HANDLING A DEBT PROBLEM</strong></p>
              <p>There are basically four options in handling a debt problem, namely, 
                  Self Administration, Composite Settlement, Debt Management Programme 
                  (DMP) and Bankruptcy (or via a Debt Repayment Scheme, ie DRS).</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Option 1: Self Administration</span><br>As
                   the name suggest, the consumers are to administer the debt problem 
                  themselves by liaising with the creditors directly to explain their 
                  financial plights and appeal for assistance from the creditors (eg. 
                  request for an installment plan to repay the debt owed).</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Option 2: Composite Settlement</span><br>The
                   consumers may engage a licensed professional (eg. lawyer or accountant)
                   to make a composite offer to the creditors via a Voluntary 
                  Arrangement.  Alternatively, the consumers may also raise the money and 
                  negotiate with the creditors directly themselves, and appeal for a 
                  discounted lump sum settlement of the debt.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Option 3: DMP (Debt Management Programme)</span><br>This
                   is an unsecured debt repayment plan via monthly installment payment.  
                  It is put up by CCS on behalf of suitable individuals who have the 
                  desire, determination and means to repay the debt owed.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Option 4: Bankruptcy</span><br>This
                   serves as the last resort when all else fail to resolve the debt 
                  problem.  The indebted individual may either wait to be sued by the 
                  creditors or apply for a self-file bankruptcy petition.</p>
              <p>When an individual is sued by a creditor for or self-filed a 
                  bankruptcy petition, he may qualify for the Debt Repayment Scheme 
                  (DRS, effective from 18 May 2009) if his unsecured debt is no more than 
                  $100,000, holds a regular paying job and is committed to make 
                  repayment in about five years.  For more information on DRS, please 
                  visit <a href="http://www.ipto.gov.sg/">www.drs.gov.sg</a>.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;"><a id="dmp" name="dmp"></a></span></strong>DEBT MANAGEMENT PROGRAMME</strong></p>
              <p>The Debt Management Programme, known as DMP, is basically a debt 
                  repayment plan.  It is a monthly installment plan that allows the 
                  consumers to gradually repay their unsecured debt (eg. credit cards and 
                  overdraft), including the principal amount and interest charges, to 
                  their creditors over a reasonable period of time.</p>
              <p>This repayment plan is suitable for consumers who are <strong>willing</strong> (ie, have the desire to avoid bankruptcy and the determination to live within a discipline budget) and <strong>able<em> </em></strong> (ie, have the means) to repay the unsecured debt that they owe.</p>
              <p>The DMP is a voluntary arrangement between the individuals and the 
                  creditors.   In short, it is the creditors’ prerogative to offer an 
                  installment plan and to specify the terms of the repayment.</p>
              <p>DMP status is NOT on public record but is registered with the Credit 
                  Bureau Singapore whose data is accessible to financial institutions.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span class="headingGreen"><strong>You </strong></span><span class="headingB"><strong> Aren't Alone </strong></span></p>
              <p>Very often, consumer who has a debt
                   problem feels very alone. He tends to keep the debt problem to himself,
                   not wanting anyone to know because he may feel ashamed, silly, guilty, 
                  loss of pride or worry about losing his job… For some married persons, 
                  they don’t share or even dare to let the spouse know about the debt 
                  problem. In short, many heavily-indebted individuals carry the heavy 
                  burden alone and in silence. As a result, the debt problem grows bigger,
                   the stress level becomes higher, work performance is affected, 
                  relationships turn tense and subsequently, the individual may become 
                  depressed and suicidal thought may began to arise…</p>
              <p><strong>You are not alone. </strong></p>
              <p>Since people rarely talk about money problem, many consumers tend to 
                  think that he is the only one who has a BIG DEBT PROBLEM! Or that he has
                   to handle his BIG DEBT PROBLEM himself.</p>
              <p><strong>You are not alone.</strong></p>
              <p>CCS has come across many individuals who have BIG DEBT PROBLEM and 
                  were suffering alone and quietly until they have decided to do something
                   about their BIG DEBT PROBLEM. These individuals decided to help 
                  themselves by seeking assistance from CCS; and with their own 
                  resourcefulness, determination and discipline, they are slowly climbing 
                  out of the debt pit and looking forward to debt-free living.</p>
              <p><strong>You are not alone... CCS is here to assist. </strong></p>

              <p><strong><em>Mr Ben (in his 40s)</em></strong><br>This is my story:<br>I
               am working as a Manager drawing a salary of S$6,000 per month. To many 
              people I know, this is an upper salary bracket. However, to me this is 
              the minimum sum required to keep my family survive. This amount do not 
              include allowance for food. My wife has to work to help me make ends 
              meet. And I only have one son who is in secondary school now. This is 
              because three <br>quarter of my salary is used to pay my credit card debts.</p>
              <p>Sounds tough ... it was tougher two years ago when almost all the 
              banks who had issued me with credit cards, magnified and spelled out the
               fine wordings stated in the terms and conditions that I had earlier 
              signed; except I must add CITIBANK who was quick to equitably help me 
              restructure my credit card debt to term loan. The same banks who had for
               many, many years loan me the money and treat me like VIP as a customer 
              at the front counter had now transferred my acounts to their Collection 
              Dept who termed me legally as debtor. The legal language switched from 
              Banking Act to Bankruptcy Act. Many are armed with willing lawyers who 
              had memorised the Bankruptcy Act by heart to prey on obviously 
              unrepresented debtor. Some of the banks employed licenced ’Tai Long’ who
               are fond of offending and breaching the debtor’s privacy. It was a very
               tough period for me; psychologically.</p>
              <p>I requested the help of The Association Bank of Singapore who 
              directed me to Credit Counselling Singapore (CCS). The latter had helped
               me mitigate the situation by summarising my expenses and expenditure 
              thereby showed me my financial strong and weak point. My financial 
              situation was dire; I can easily submit to bankruptcy but I opt to be 
              responsible for my debts. Now I am still struggling to pay back my debt 
              but at least I can see the light. Four years more and I hope to be free 
              of the credit card debts and bank loans of more than S$100k.</p>
              <p>I now prefer Debit Card.</p>
              <p>CCS is well recognised by the government, the banks and the courts. 
              My advice is if you are having "credit card problems" talk to them 
              first.</p>

              carelessness, my little debt snowball to a huge debt of S$100K. I was 
              stressed when my total monthly repayment has exceeded my monthly salary.
               I was really desperate for help and unable to cope. On my own accord, I
               tried to approach banks, credit cooperative etc for help, but was 
              unsuccessful. For almost a year, I struggled to cope with the hounds of 
              my creditors. The feeling was terrible. I felt insecure, helpless, 
              hopeless, despised, rejected and a failure.</p>
              <p>I was overjoyed when I heard of CCS from the media. Immediately, I 
              called to enquire. I attended their awareness talk, counseling and 
              finally had my DMP worked out.</p>
              <p>At CCS, I was treated with respect. CCS has helped me to restructure 
              my debts and my lifestyle. I begin to appreciate the beauty of credit 
              free living. Today, I am able to meet my monthly debts repayment. My 
              stress was gone and I have gained back my confidence. I am now a happier
               person and I look forward to be debt free soon.</p>
              <p><strong><em>Mr Patrick (in his 40s)</em></strong><br>Hi, I am 44 yrs old. In 2002, due to cost saving plans in my company, I was left with free time due to less O/T in my company.</p>
              <p>To pass the time, i resorted to gambling and in a short space of 1 
              and a half yrs, i chalk up a debt of more than $100k. How to pay? In 
              2004, i called up the banks whom i am owing .Except for Citibank, the 
              rest of the bank did not respond to me. So every month, i just paid the 
              minimum sum. I then realise that i was not reducing my debt at all.</p>
              <p>Earlier this year, i read in the Sunday Times about CCS. I then 
              called up CCS and attended the talk at the Subordinate Courts. Afetr i 
              had filled up all the forms, I attended the councilling session.I was 
              then put on the DMP.</p>
              <p>CCS has helped me to appeal to the banks for a lower monthly 
              repayment which i am able to service, of course with a lot of self 
              discipline. However, i know that if i am to keep my part of the plan, i 
              will be debt free in 6 yrs time.<br><br>Thank you CCS and especially 
              Gillian for your help for i know that without you, my name will be added
               to the bankruptcy list. Thank you once again and will be grateful 
              always,</p>
              <p>Sincerely, <br>Patrick</p>
              <p><strong><em>Mr Leo (in his 30s)<br></em></strong>To vent the 
              escalating pressures of everyday working life, I had uncontrollably 
              chalked up heavy investment loses (during the economic downturn) and 
              also indulged in impulsive spending in order to relieve the stress. As 
              credit was then "readily available" as a result of the immense 
              competition amongst the financial institutions, I had plunged deeper and
               deeper into taboo of using one credit source to cover the other. Later,
               as my financial burdens got heavier, partly due to the debts’ high 
              interest rates and also the increasing medical/hospitalization costs of 
              my family, I had reached the point whereby I was having problems in 
              meeting even the monthly minimum sum repayments of the credit loans.</p>
              <p>I had, on my own, tried to make genuine and sincere appeals to all my
               creditor banks for a manageable repayment scheme by explaining to them 
              my financial situation. However, it may be because I am not a good 
              negotiator and also the fact that the credit control departments of the 
              some of the banks have generally set their priorities to recover as much
               as possible in the shortest possible period, my appeals, in the light 
              of my adverse financial situation, were doomed to failure. After weeks 
              of prolonged unsuccessful negotiations with some of the banks, a few had
               even initiated legal actions against me. It was at the point of having 
              received legal judgments awarded against myself that I totally gave up 
              on any further negotiations and virtually resigned to face bankruptcy.</p>
              <p>It was by chance that I later came across the CCS website and decided
               to give a last ditched attempt to salvage my seemingly hopeless 
              situation and avoid the social stigma of being a bankrupt. I attended 
              one of the weekly CCS briefings and was informed of the options 
              available and the assistance CCS can offer. Although I was still rather 
              apprehensive of what CCS can do in view of my precarious situation, I 
              nevertheless signed up for a counselling session. After learning about 
              my case (and the urgency involved due to the legal suits that have 
              already commenced), the professional and very experienced CCS officers 
              swung into immediate action by swiftly contacting all my creditor banks 
              in a desperate bid to stave off the legal actions and negotiate for a 
              solution that is beneficial to both parties. Within a few weeks, CCS had
               managed to draw up a Debt Management Program (DMP) agreement with all 
              my creditor banks and I had begun making my first installment 
              repayments.</p>
              <p>My advice to people who may be in the same situation as I am, is to 
              give yourself a decent chance by urgently seeking expert counselling 
              from CCS, especially if you are sincere about fulfilling all of your 
              financial obligations. On your own, you may not be able to bring your 
              case successfully to all of your creditor banks as you may not be 
              technically good in negotiation. It may also be extremely stressful in 
              trying to deal<br>with a number of creditors at the same time and coping with burdens of your<br>job and even perhaps your family’s growing financial commitments.</p>
              <p>Although I still have a long, long way to go, to repay all of my 
              debts, I am indeed very grateful to CCS for at least getting me to the 
              starting line, which I am sure I know I would not be able to on my own.</p>
              <p><strong><em>Ms Grace (in her 30s)<br></em></strong>I’m currently 
              holding an executive post with monthly gross salary of $4,000 per month.
               Rightfully speaking, I should not get myself into this financial 
              predicament.</p>
              <p>It all started when my second brother started to do his own business.
               In the initial stage, the business was good and he did make some 
              profit. With this, he ventured into another business and mixed with some
               ’bad company’. He started gambling the last year and got himself 
              stranded with debts and started borrowing money from the loan sharks. It
               became a snowball situation and owed the loan shark about S$100K.</p>
              <p>He was not able to make his credit card payment, phone bill and car 
              loan. With this, I lend him my savings to pay the loan sharks and also 
              pay his phone bill...etc. Worst of all, he left the house without 
              informing us. With his ’disappear’, I had to shoulder the household 
              expenses, take care of my father. In the end, I couldn’t even pay the 
              minimum payment for all my credit cards.</p>
              <p>Everyday, I’m receiving calls from the banks chasing for payment and 
              also received lawyer’s letters. At one stage, I really thought of 
              committing suicide as I do not know who to turn to for help.</p>
              <p>Luckily I read about CCS from the newspapers and attended the talk.</p>
              <p>With CCS’ help to negotiate with the banks, they allowed me to pay my debt using the DMP programme.</p>
              <p>I consider myself lucky, without CCS’ help, I will be sued bankruptcy by the banks.</p>

              compiled from different credit providers.<br> <br> As most lenders will check your credit file to assess your credit
              worthiness prior to making a decision, a good credit repayment
              history will make it easier for you to obtain credit and to qualify
              for loans.<br> <br> By reviewing your credit report regularly, it allows you to be
              aware of any information that is uploaded on your credit
              file.<br> <br> The other advantage of monitoring your credit file is that it
              protects against possible fraudulent use of your personal details
              to obtain credit.<br> <br> CBS’ ‘My Credit Monitor’ service checks your report daily and
              notifies you by email when key changes are detected. Early
              detection is key to minimising the damage that ID theft can have on
              your credit.<br> <br> You can subscribe to ‘My Credit Monitor ’ service at any Singapore
              Post branch or visit the CBS office to make an application.<br> <br> Your credit report also helps credit providers to make faster and
              more objective lending decisions. By providing credit data to its
              members (credit providers) under authorised conditions, CBS helps
              them to determine whether or not the person applying for credit is
              a good credit risk. In doing this, lenders can make better lending
              decisions quickly and objectively.<br> <br> This will also contribute to a more competitive credit marketplace
              among the credit providers. With the Bureau in place, responsible
              customers can expect faster and more competitive services from the
              credit providers.<br> <br>  <br> <br> 1. Pay your bills on time As far as possible, strive to pay up in
              full and on time.<br> <br> Late or missed payments will certainly lower your credit
              worthiness. Therefore, be sure to check your bills to see when
              payments are due. Late fees and interest penalties add up quickly
              and make it hard to pay the balance. Payment history is an
              important factor in determining your credit worthiness. Since
              recent history carries more weight than what happened five years
              ago, getting in the habit of making on-time payments is an
              incredibly powerful way to improve your credit worthiness.<br> <br> 2. Pay down your debts and consider charging less<br> <br> Lenders like to see plenty of breathing room between the amount of
              debt reported on your credit cards and your total credit limits.
              The more debt you pay off, the wider that gap and the better your
              credit worthiness. When you pay the full balance on your bill each
              month, you are taking advantage of an interest-free loan from the
              card issuer. If you make only the minimum payment on a significant
              balance, it can take years to pay off the full debt. If you are
              unable to meet the payment deadlines, let your financial
              institution know and the reasons why.<br> <br> 3. Limit the number of credit cards you own<br> <br> Avoid multiple sources of credit. It is more manageable to keep
              track of 2 credit cards than 10. Opening a new credit line may
              reduce your credit worthiness, especially if you do not have a long
              and favorable credit history.<br> <br> 4. Cancel any unused cards<br> <br> If you have many credit card accounts but are only using a few, it
              is a good idea to close out the unused ones. However, it is
              advisable to keep the cards that you have had the longest and
              cancel the new ones as a long record of prompt payments will
              improve your credit worthiness.<br> <br> 5. Stay out of bankruptcy if you can<br> <br> Bankruptcy is the most catastrophic impediment to your good credit
              reputation -- far worse than delinquencies, loans or collections.
              Its impact, however, is dependent on how many defaults you made on
              your credit before you filed.<br> <br> 6. Don’t be afraid of credit counselling<br> <br> Most of us want to pay our bills on time and as agreed. However,
              there could be unforeseen circumstances such as loss of employment,
              business failure etc, which makes it impossible to settle the
              minimum payments on the due dates stipulated by the bank. If you’re
              overloaded with high-interest debt and are in danger of falling
              behind on your payments -- or you already have -- consider working
              with a nonprofit agency such as Credit Counselling Singapore to set
              up a debt repayment plan. They can help you to reschedule payments
              with the creditors, negotiate lower interest rates and help you pay
              off your bills within a few years.<br> <br> 7. Get your credit report<br> <br> Your credit report is a record of your credit payment history
              compiled from different credit providers. As most lenders will
              check your credit file to assess your credit worthiness prior to
              making a decision, a good credit repayment history will make it
              easier for you to obtain credit and to qualify for loans. By
              reviewing your credit report regularly, it allows you to be aware
              any information that is uploaded on your credit file. The other
              advantage of monitoring your credit file is that it protects
              against possible fraudulent use of your personal details to obtain
              credit.<br> <br> 8. Know the differences between Debit Card and Credit Card<br> <br> When you charge a purchase on your credit card, you have a minimum
              of 30 days to pay the bill. If you do so, it will be to your
              benefit as you’re taking advantage of the card issuer’s money as a
              no-interest loan, provided you pay the balance in full each month.
              On the other hand, when you charge a purchase on a debit card, your
              bank will deduct your deposit account immediately. If you do not
              have sufficient funds in your bank account, the transaction will
              not be accepted.<br> <br> 9. Don’t close accounts if you still have debt remaining on
              them<br> <br> Closing accounts before they are fully paid can hurt your credit
              worthiness. If you are planning on not using a certain credit card
              anymore, you should wait to close it until after you have paid it
              off. In order to keep yourself from charging, simply cut up the
              card into pieces and keep it in a drawer.<br> <br> 10. Don’t apply for lots of credit at once<br> <br> People are bombarded with new credit card offers all the time.
              While it may be OK to sign up for a new credit card here and there,
              it is a bad idea to sign up for several at once. This sends a
              signal to creditors that you are desperate for credit and are a
              risk to loan to. Resist the urge to sign up for many credit cards
              at once and don’t overextend yourself.<br> <br>  <br> <br> <em>Credit is an integral part of everyday modern life. From buying
              movie tickets, to paying for a meal at a restaurant or buying a
              car, credit is used. The most common use of credit is through
              credit cards. Knowing how to use credit wisely is a critical part
              of managing your finances and key to your financial health.</em><br> <br> <strong>Advantages of using Credit:</strong><br> Able to buy need items now<br> Don’t have to carry cash<br> Creates a record of purchases<br> More convenient than writing cheques<br> Consolidates bills into one payment<br> <br> <strong>Disadvantages of using Credit:</strong><br> Interest (higher cost of items)<br> May require additional fees<br> Financial difficulties may arise if one loses track of how much has
              been spent each month<br> Increased impulse buying may occur</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>FAQs<br><br> <br><br>Q1<br>    <br><br>I wish to skip the Info Talk because I am very busy / I work in the evening / I work in the financial industry / I’ve already received a lawyer’s letter……<br><br>A1<br>    <br><br>CCS requires individuals to attend the free Info Talk first before they request for a counselling session for two important reasons:<br><br>(1)   The Talk provides information on one’s options in settling a debt problem, the collection process, and the services offered by CCS.  This will give the individual a better idea of what they can do regarding their debt problems and also what CCS can do for them.  Individuals will be able to decide on their next course of action which are more suitable for their situation and which may not involve CCS.<br><br>(2)   The counselling session assumes the individual already has an understanding of the procedures of common collection action taken by the creditors, the requirements stipulated by the banks, and the services provided by CCS which will be provided at the information talk. <br><br>The counseling session will explore in detail the options available to a debtor.  Therefore, the individual is required to attend the Talk to learn about the above first to ensure that no time is wasted covering information which would have been already discussed at the information talk, thus making the counseling session more productive and meaningful. <br><br>Q2<br>    <br><br>If an individual already have a legal suit issued against him, can he skip the Info Talk?<br><br>A2<br>    <br><br>No. The individual is advised to quickly register for and attend the next available Info Talk, this will help to ensure that he will have a meaningful discussion at the counselling session to identify an appropriate solution to address his concerns/problem.<br><br>If the individual decides that he still wants to go for a counseling session after the information talk, we can give priority in fixing the counseling session if there is an impending legal action against him, subject to the availability of counsellors.<br><br>Q3<br>    <br><br>Can CCS talk to my banks and tell them not to take legal action against me and/or to give me an installment plan?<br><br>A3<br>    <br><br>CCS can only intercede with the Banks after understanding the debtor’s financial situation and ascertaining that the debtor is suitable for the debt management plan. <br><br>This is why individuals have to attend the Information Talk and go through a detailed counselling session in order for CCS to ascertain his status and the options available to him.<br><br>To learn more about how to obtain assistance from CCS, please register online for the Info Talk.<br><br>Q4<br>    <br><br>How does CCS differ from the other debt consultancy firms?<br><br>A4<br>    <br><br>CCS is a non government organisation and a charity registered with the Commissioner of Charities.<br><br>CCS has been established since 2004 and is the only debt counselling organisation supported by The Association of Banks in Singapore.  Among its many sponsors is the Subordinate Courts of Singapore which first mooted the idea for CCS.<br><br>CCS provides professional debt advisory services to the general public in Singapore and is the only debt counselling organisation that has a formal debt restructuring scheme with the major consumer banks in Singapore. <br><br>Being a non profit organisation, its charges are nominal compared with other debt consultancy firms.<br><br>Q5<br>    <br><br>Will CCS inform my employer that I have come to seek assistance from CCS?<br><br>A5<br>    <br><br>All information provided by individuals to CCS is on a strictly private and confidential basis.  CCS will not divulge any information to third parties without the expressed approval of the debtor.<br><br>It does not inform employers of an individual’s debt problems or that the individual has come to CCS for assistance.<br>With the permission of the debtor, CCS will provide relevant information to creditors as well as the Credit Bureau of Singapore if the person qualifies and opted for the debt management program which it has with bank creditors.<br><br>Q6<br>    <br><br>Is Debt Management Programme (DMP) status on public record?<br><br>A6<br>    <br><br>It is a requirement that individuals who are placed on the debt management programme will be reported to the Credit Bureau.  Credit Bureau reports are only available to the individual concerned as well as the participating institutions (eg. banks).<br><br>Q7<br>    <br><br>Will the information I shared with CCS be kept confidential?<br><br>A7<br>    <br><br>CCS has a policy about keeping all debtors information confidential.  Information will only be released to relevant parties with the permission of the individuals concerned.<br><br>Q8<br>    <br><br>Can CCS help me to put up a Debt Management Programme (DMP) that includes my housing loan or car loan?<br><br>A8<br>    <br><br>CCS only deals with unsecured debts and therefore does not handle secured debts such as housing loans and car hire purchase loans. <br><br>However in the event that the security is sold and there is a shortfall, such amounts can be assessed together with the other unsecured debts of the individual.<br><br>Q9<br>    <br><br>How often does CCS conduct the Info Talk?<br><br>A9<br>    <br><br>CCS conducts the Info Talk every week (except during certain festive seasons, eg. Chinese New Year).<br><br>Q10<br>    <br><br>What is the duration of the Info Talk?<br><br>A10<br>    <br><br>The Info Talk lasts about 2 hours inclusive of a Q&amp;A session.<br><br>Q11<br>    <br><br>Can I bring someone to attend the Info Talk with me?<br><br>A11<br>    <br><br>Yes.  We would appreciate all attendants of the Info Talk to register in order to control the number of people coming for the talk.<br><br>Q12<br>    <br><br>How do I register for the Info Talk?<br><br>A12<br>    <br><br>Please register online by clicking "Sign up Info Talk"<br><br>Q13<br>    <br><br>Do I have to pay for the Info Talk?<br><br>A13<br>    <br><br>The Info Talk is free of charge and opens to members of the public regardless if s/he has a debt problem.<br><br>Q14<br>    <br><br>How to apply for a Debt Management Programme (DMP)?<br><br>A14<br>    <br><br>(1) The individual must firstly attend the Info Talk. <br><br>(2) After the talk, if he decides that he needs to attend a counselling session, then he will have to submit the counselling request form and supporting documents, provide us with information and data in order for us to ascertain his financial situation.  <br><br>After the receipt of the counselling request and the documents.  CCS will contact the individual to set up an appointment to meet with a counsellor.<br><br>(3) During the counselling session, the options available to the debtor will be discussed and explored.   The debtor will then have to decide whether he wants to proceed with a debt management program if he meets the requirements for the DMP. <br><br>(4) It must be stressed that the DMP is only one of the options available to debtors and not all individuals will qualify for a DMP.  Debtors should not assume that a DMP will be assured at the end of the counselling session as CCS needs to further ascertain the suitability after the counselling session. <br><br>(5) If he is suitable and also opts for the DMP, CCS will then process a DMP on his behalf for his unsecured creditors’ review and approval.<br><br>Q15<br>    <br><br>What are the requirements to put up a DMP?<br><br>A15<br>    <br><br>Briefly, the individual must have an income which after deducting living expenses will yield a surplus that will allow his debts to be repaid over a reasonable time period.<br><br>The details and process of putting up a DMP will be covered during the free Info Talk.<br><br>Q16<br>    <br><br>Can CCS help me get a lower interest rate?<br><br>A16<br>    <br><br>The DMP is only for genuinely distressed debtors who are unable to meet their debt repayments without some concessions from the creditors.  It is not a scheme to reduce interest costs for the debtor.  Any interest reduction is solely at the discretion of the creditors to help distressed and deserving debtors.<br><br>Q17<br>    <br><br>Does CCS handle debts incurred with overseas financial institutions?<br><br>A17<br>    <br><br>CCS only works on unsecured debts incurred with financial institutions and other relevant parties in Singapore.<br><br>Q18<br>    <br><br>Where can I check my credit rating or obtain my credit report?<br><br>A18<br>    <br><br>You may check your credit rating or obtain a copy of your credit report of your borrowings from all financial institutions from Credit Bureau Singapore (www.creditbureau.com.sg).<br><br>Q19<br>    <br><br>Do I have to pay for the credit report?<br><br>A19<br>    <br><br>Yes.  Please check with the credit bureaus directly on the fee of the report.<br><br>Q20<br>    <br><br>I want to know about bankruptcy and/or Debt Repayment Scheme (DRS)<br><br>A20<br>    <br><br>Please visit the Insolvency and Public Trustees’ Office’s website: www.ipto.gov.sg for information.<br><br>Q21<br>    <br><br>How do I file for bankruptcy?<br><br>A21<br>    <br><br>Please seek advice from the Insolvency and Public Trustee’s Office (www.ipto.gov.sg) or a lawyer (please refer to "Useful Link" for a list of free legal advice)<br><br>Q22<br>    <br><br>What is the difference between bankruptcy and DMP?<br><br>A22<br>    <br><br>(1) Bankruptcy is a legal process where the debtor is publicly recognised to be insolvent by the Supreme Court and the Official Assignee (OA) is appointed by the Court to administer the bankruptcy estate. There are laws and regulations covering bankrupts which have to be observed.<br><br>(2) DMP is a voluntary debt repayment plan put up by the debtor to his unsecured creditors for review and approval.

              <p>As good people mentioned it would be advisable to finish off your debts. 80k++ can easily become 200k++ in 2-3 years with fees and loads of charges. If you sell/close your biz may be you can get some and pay it off.Even if you find a job and pay 1k/month it can be paid off in 7 years and earlier with support of your wife/family.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Start with your wife and family to see if they can help.If you run off and lets say you find something in another contry, possibility of coming back for next 5 years would be quite hard. Most likely she will move on,get married with some one else and you will still be liable for debt. You will loose your child as well,perhaps never see your living parents again and probably have criminal case against you.Country official can get a warrant to arrest you or a debt collector can harrass you in your new country(normally with added charges to existing amount).</p>
              <p>All the best.</p>

              <p>People have shown you better paths. Yet you still choose the path of destruction.</p>
              <p>And believe me when I say destruction. Your debts will not magically disappear when you disappear. Yes, your wife and parents will be hounded by your creditors. Yes, your creditors can literally chase you to the ends of the earth. Why are you being so selfish to make your wife and parents bear your problems for you?</p>
              <p>80k is a lot of money, but it is not insurmountable. With the help of CCS, you can negotiate a reasonable repayment plan with your creditors.</p>
              <p>If you run away, the interest will make your debts balloon, and your child will grow up cursing you for being his father. </p>
              <p>For goodness' sake, just call CCS and let them help you sort things out with your creditors.</p>
