I know quite a few of them, and some of them have enriched my life in many ways.<br><br>I must admit, there are some of them who hates us chinese, and speak badly of us. But Hey, there are lots of us who do not like malays as well, so its all balanced (not good though.)<br><br>Point is, regardless of whether its a chinese, malay, or indian, Keep your eyes open when looking for friends. Its your judgement that matters, not the pigment of colour you see in your eyes.</div>
