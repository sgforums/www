              <p>i got a colleague who suddendly give me cold shoulder earlier part of this year (around March 09).</p>
              <p>now she's pretty much ignoring my existence, don't talk to me during lunch, no eye-contact, nothing etc. Go home take same lift, i tried making small talk with her casually but she only give nods and 1-word reply.</p>
              <p>However, when she needs my help, she suddendly smile very sweetly and cutely.</p>
              <p>this is what pisses me off.</p>
              <p>i think she's like this cos' i always tease her a bit, but i think like that she also cannot. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p>anyway, in such cases, what will u folks do?</p>
              <p>1) ignore her and treat she doesn't exist</p>
              <p>2) be casual and take it as if nothing happened, and smile and greet her whenever u meet at corridor etc., even though she don't even look at you</p>
              <p>these few months, i've been doing 2) because this is what gentlemen do, but i'm starting to question myself if this is what i should be doing.</p>
              <p>1) seems to be very petty and calculating, u know......and i'm a guy.</p>
              <p>she ignore me is no big-deal, but i just find it very insulting that she can change face and smile so nicely when asking for my help. It's like, she comes to me only when she needs help.</p>
              <p>i've no problems with other female colleagues, btw, and we get along well.</p>
              <p>and no trolling pls. this is a serious thread which i'm seeking opinions.</p>

              <p>actually, she's not my friend lah, but as colleagues, me and her and others used to be quite close and flirt somewhat in the past, but now she suddenly like that to me, i just feel sad. not very sad lah, but kinda like a bit disappointed she behaves this way. I mean, anyone will. Btw, i don't like / love her.</p>
              <p>i dunno, it's like complete change and now she's another person to me.</p>
              <p>anyway, i thought colleagues can also become friends? no?</p>
              <p>some people say never treat colleagues as friends due to obvious reasons, but i personally don't see why not. i mean, everyone should help everyone and be nice right?</p>

              <p><br>I think the reason of your frustrations is because she failed to behave according to your expectations?</p>
              <p>You probably expects to be appreciated by her after helping her on many occasions and you are upset because she doesn't give you the coy reaction and behave a little bit more open and comfortable towards you even after you have helped her many times.</p>
              <p>Things can go very wrong and uncomfortable between you and her even if she had a nightmare about you out of the sudden. And there is really no way she is going to let you know and also for you to find out what exactly happened. As we're very emotional type of people, you can only accept it the way it is...that is, she woke up one day and suddenly felt very uncomfortable towards you.</p>
              <p>You should help her ONLY if you are comfortable with providing that help or else it is better for you not extend your helping hand towards her.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>An alternative method is to buy your way back into her good graces by buying her flowers extensively over a period of time...maybe 1 to 2 weeks?</p>
              <p>Reason for doing that? Let her know you are trying your best to RESCUE the person who has offended her. (The reason why her reaction is super bad towards you)</p>

              <p>However, when she needs my help, she suddendly smile very sweetly and cutely.</p>
              <p>this is what pisses me off.</p>
              <p>i think she's like this cos' i always tease her a bit, but i think like that she also cannot. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p>anyway, in such cases, what will u folks do?</p>
              <p>1) ignore her and treat she doesn't exist</p>
              <p>2) be casual and take it as if nothing happened, and smile and greet her whenever u meet at corridor etc., even though she don't even look at you</p>
              <p>these few months, i've been doing 2) because this is what gentlemen do, but i'm starting to question myself if this is what i should be doing.</p>
              <p>1) seems to be very petty and calculating, u know......and i'm a guy.</p>
              <p>she ignore me is no big-deal, but i just find it very insulting that she can change face and smile so nicely when asking for my help. It's like, she comes to me only when she needs help.</p>
              <p>i've no problems with other female colleagues, btw, and we get along well.</p>
              <p>and no trolling pls. this is a serious thread which i'm seeking opinions.</p>
              <p>thanks!</p>

              <p><br>Your only problem is that you don't see her as a colleague you see her as a <strong>Woman</strong>....So Stop fantsaizing having sex with her and pay attention to your work....she is not giving it to you or you ain't getting it. (go drink cold water)  </p>
              <p>Treat her as your male colleague. Than you see thru a different lens.</p>

              <p>First of all, do you have a sexual/romantic interest in her? I mean, you have to be very clear and honest to yourself. From your post, I would say it's both. If she's not chio, I'd bet you wouldn't give 2 hoots about how she reacts to you. There are many ways to deal with this situation. By close and flirtatious, what do you mean specifically? And what kind of help does she want from you?</p>
              <p>I would say you shouldn't let her affect you and continue being your gentlemen self ie always smile when you see her. Do you get affected when a girl you are not interested behaves that way to you? You never know when you may need her help. But there are certain times I feel you should call her on it. Arghh.. these women, sometimes you should call her on it. Try asking her for help and see if she's reciprocates. Does she help you if you help her? How does she treat other people?</p>
              <p>From what you describe, she doesn't seem to be very interested in interacting with you as a friends or flirtatious level, only to a point of colleagues basis. You have to ask yourself if she is like that to others as well. If she doesn't want to have anything to do with you except for work-related purposes, I guess there's pretty much nothing you can do and accept it graciously.</p>
              <p>Finally, she's not the only chio girl in Singapore. There are tonnes around so I don't see why you should be affected unless you really have a liking for her, which is understandable.</p>

              <p>thanks a lot for the replies, guys!</p>
              <p>ok, 1stly, i'm not romantically / sexually interested in her lah.</p>
              <p>used to be, but after observation, i notice she's quite petty and very practical / calculative, so really not my type. since then, i already no interest in her liao.</p>
              <p>as for helping her, i don't have a choice either, cos' very few males in my company to carry those heavy document boxes and they usually out, so leave only me.</p>
              <p>and no, she only treats me like this, not others.</p>
              <p>it's not so much about helping her or not, because i can honestly say that even if she's not chio, or if she's a guy, or a auntie with BO and she ask for my help, i'll still help.</p>
              <p>the thing is she changes so much.....</p>
              <p>i mean, imagine u pass by your collick and she walk by you with no eye-contact, treat u as if you're invisible even though u try to greet her very casually (like "Morning!" or "Whoa! Go home loh!" etc)........well, i feel angry and anyone would.</p>
              <p>also, this thread is not about chio girls lah. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></p>
              <p>because ever since i experience this case like her, i told myself if i've to choose between a chio but nasty personality girl or a average but good personality girl, i will gladly choose the latter (in the past, long ago, i would choose the former).</p>
              <p>i don't think much about this problem but when i think of how good we used to get along, including setting platonic dates and going out for lunch, i just feel pity things suddendly turn out like this.</p>
              <p>and lastly, i don't fantasize about sex with her. she's quite thin xmm type and i prefer those MILFs, u know.</p>
              <p>and also, no vietnam or foreign girls for me. i don't like them and would rather stay single if cannot get SG girl.</p>
