Any advice on this?</div></blockquote>Realise why this could be happening to you and why others ain't having this problem?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>The answer to this mystery lies within the feel you give to people. When people are on two extreme ends - the feel they give is very different - something like a werido or wearing a mask kind of feeling. To others, they will think that being quiet is the real you and when you start babblering your conversation, people impression will be like 'hey, Orange isn't that quiet afterall.' But then the next time they were see you, etc - you kept very quiet again - you will be sending weird signal to people who doesn't really know you and they won't take chances to know the real you based on impression - which is sadly true for people in this world.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Since you have small circle of friends, it is a natural tendancy to spark a conversation with others when the chances arises. This urge appeared to be most likely unnatural - when you wanna get to know people, to give people the impression 'you-are-so-yourself' is always the key to everything, because you will be sending the I-am-being-natural vibes around. There is no mask - people will accept you for who you are.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>First and foremost you ought to work on is your self confidence. Trust me, you have no communication problem whatsoever - the thing you truely lack is self confidence in front of people. Understand why at times you kept real quiet? Its because the either you can't enter, or you don't know how to enter the conversation, therefore the key is to keep quiet. (Or the times when you really feel like being quiet - PMS, etc).  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>To be natural with others and yourself, is to exude self confidence. Having self confidence when others are around, you won't be on the two extreme - instead you will go with the flow and things will get better.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well i got the same problem... well with mostly girls...but i don't have that many guy friends either. It should be easy for you cos you are part of the same race as them, are u not? Cos of my tainted blood, i am in a completely different category of person, whereas u all fall under "Asian" i am neither here nor there, curse my parents. But anyway, too bad for u is all i can say, and i waited 4 years in sec school with the same dreadful experience of having like no friends, so my advice is go to a new school and start over. Advice: try not to be different from the crowd, be the same, be a clone, be like them, u should have no prob.</div>
