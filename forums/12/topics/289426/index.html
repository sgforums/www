All of us can leave with juz 1 week notice.Actually another reason for the low morale of the team is due to bad management. They constantly cut away our OT hours and expect us to work for free. they still don't understand how hard it is without any experience staff around to guide us , for example a case can be solved in 5 mins by our senior last time. Now it took us 1 hr or more juz to solve 1 case.<br><br>sigh...</div>
