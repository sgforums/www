Not because I don't love him anymore, in fact, I think he will always have a place in my heart. Now I think I am in love with another guy who has treated me like a princess, but the scar from that experience will always remain there. We continue to be close fren, but I think these few days when we spend some time together again, there was once I felt so much pain that I cried a bit. He never saw my tears of course...<br><br>There is always a price to pay for waiting. And for me, it is a big one, because now I can never really love anyone the same deep way again.

We continue to be close fren, but I think these few days when we spend some time together again, there was once I felt so much pain that I cried a bit. He never saw my tears of course...<br><br>There is always a price to pay for waiting. And for me, it is a big one, because now I can never really love anyone the same deep way again.
