            <div class='col-md body'>Hi everyone, posting on behalf of my colleague<br><br>my fren here have been courting this girl since March this year. it was a on and off courtship. First 2 months, girl was only lukewarm to his advances. he tried dating her out a few times but always kana "fly kite" last min. So Fren here kinda of pissed and actually moved on. Anyway he was posted to US for 2 months.  When he's back in May, he sorta missed her, and SMS her whether she remembers him. Got positive response and they actually went on date. Again they went out a few times. Then girl left singapore to visit her family back in Hongkong. Also she has some medical condition which needed attention back home. All this while, my fren received many SMS from her, supporting her emotionally especially during her medical examination. She came back in Aug. They continue seeing each other. However, there is suspicious tell tale signs. Sometimes this girl would say cannot meet for 2 weeks, becoz mother came to visit her. sometime say got auntie visit so cannot see each other. Anyway, the girl accepted my fren as bf last month. But here comes the big one. One sunday, supposed to meet for a show. She called last min to say her grandmother is in critical condition and now she is in airport flying off. well my fren here console her and ask her to call him once she touch down. 1 week passed, no news. Fren got worried, called her best fren whether can get in touch with her. 2 days later, she called him saying that many things to attend too, dun worry, she's fine. 2 weeks later, still not back yet. getting suspicious. Fren here decided to ask her best friend out.<br>Hinted at her best fren whether is there a third person involved? My fren went on to explain that if there is someone else, he would backed off as it is less painful to do it now. Her best fren assured him tat there is no third party involved. 3 days ago, fren knocked off early, nothing to do, drove pass her home, and actually saw her with another guy walking out of her home. My fren now is quite devastated, what should he do?<br><br>pardon me for the long post</div>
