It can occur when you feel overwhelmed and unable to meet constant demands. As the stress continues, you begin to lose the interest or motivation that led you to take on a certain role in the first place. Burnout reduces your productivity and saps your energy, leaving you feeling increasingly hopeless, powerless, cynical, and resentful. The unhappiness burnout causes can eventually threaten your job, your relationships, and your health."<br>"# Frustration and powerlessness<br># Hopelessness<br># Being drained of emotional energy<br># Detachment, withdrawal, isolation<br># Being trapped<br># Having failed at what youÂ’re doing<br># Irritability<br># Sadness"<br><br>omg... all of the above is really what is am feeling now...<br>i really have a burnout ahh?<br><br>if it can recover, i really wish to recover but the problem is, all of the dolution is to take a break...<br>however, i really dont have anytime to take a break... then how?<br><br>"Most of us have days when weÂ’re bored to death with what we do at work; when our co-workers and bosses seem irremediably wrong-headed; when the dozen balls we keep in the air arenÂ’t noticed, let alone rewarded; when dragging ourselves into work requires the determination of Hercules; when caring about work seems like a waste of energy; when nothing we do appears to make a difference in a workplace full of bullying supervisors, clueless colleagues, and ungrateful clients.<br>We all have bad days at work. But when every day is a bad day, youÂ’re flirting with burnout.<br>Most burnout has to do with the workplace, and itÂ’s present in every occupation. Those most at risk may be service professionals, who spend their work lives attending to the needs of others, especially if their work puts them in frequent contact with the dark or tragic side of human experience, or if theyÂ’re underpaid, unappreciated, or criticized for matters beyond their control."<br>"# Feeling trapped for economic reasons by a job that fits any of the scenarios above."<br><br>i am under this category i think? but i also have this kind of feeling in sch leh...<br><br>basically, is from everything...</div>

Are you still playing them...? Can you... Do me a favor? I think the minimum you can start is by kicking those online game habit... I used to be hooked to them like yourself... And yes.. Like you've described thm to be.. They can be sort of like drugs... Giving different people different effects... If you wanna find some 'online game' just for the 'kick' of it, I'll suggest maybe you can try something milder and less time consuming for a change..? (if you can't kick the habit at one go) Just like I'm currently more into atari games.. Which really are just for 'kick'.. Doesn't really serve much purpose as I don't feel much of any 'urge' to be hooked to online gaming anymore... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Personally, I think what yo might really need now is to join some club or ECA which have activities of your interest for you to spend your life with...? (or better yourself for that matter?) Take basketball for example? And if you find that nothing much in life really interest you too much now, then perhaps it's really time for you to explore yourself and life and find out what really interest you in real time...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

It can occur when you feel overwhelmed and unable to meet constant demands. As the stress continues, you begin to lose the interest or motivation that led you to take on a certain role in the first place. Burnout reduces your productivity and saps your energy, leaving you feeling increasingly hopeless, powerless, cynical, and resentful. The unhappiness burnout causes can eventually threaten your job, your relationships, and your health."<br>"# Frustration and powerlessness<br># Hopelessness<br># Being drained of emotional energy<br># Detachment, withdrawal, isolation<br># Being trapped<br># Having failed at what youÂ’re doing<br># Irritability<br># Sadness"<br><br>omg... all of the above is really what is am feeling now...<br>i really have a burnout ahh?<br><br>if it can recover, i really wish to recover but the problem is, all of the dolution is to take a break...<br>however, i really dont have anytime to take a break... then how?<br><br>"Most of us have days when weÂ’re bored to death with what we do at work; when our co-workers and bosses seem irremediably wrong-headed; when the dozen balls we keep in the air arenÂ’t noticed, let alone rewarded; when dragging ourselves into work requires the determination of Hercules; when caring about work seems like a waste of energy; when nothing we do appears to make a difference in a workplace full of bullying supervisors, clueless colleagues, and ungrateful clients.<br>We all have bad days at work. But when every day is a bad day, youÂ’re flirting with burnout.<br>Most burnout has to do with the workplace, and itÂ’s present in every occupation. Those most at risk may be service professionals, who spend their work lives attending to the needs of others, especially if their work puts them in frequent contact with the dark or tragic side of human experience, or if theyÂ’re underpaid, unappreciated, or criticized for matters beyond their control."<br>"# Feeling trapped for economic reasons by a job that fits any of the scenarios above."<br><br>i am under this category i think? but i also have this kind of feeling in sch leh...<br><br>basically, is from everything...</div></blockquote>Maybe you just need to loosen up a bit and go on a more 'relaxed' form of mentality...?</div>
