            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Scape_Goat_Token:</div><div class="quote_body">hi guys. im suffering from quite a serious problem, and i need feedback on what i should do.<br><br>story goes like this:<br><br>since the start of this yr (im sec 3 btw), i have been sleeping in class, slacking, not doin homework, and even skipping tests. im not sure whether i haf the "hackcare" attitude or simply because i think i still can make it even if i study last minute. maybe i was simply complacent. i slept at around 2-3 plus almost everyday ( i think i enjoyed too much the previous holiday...) and goin to school feeling sooo sleepy that i would just collasp in class.<br><br>midyear, i done it totally horribly. all f9s, including my english. actually my standard of english isn't that bad. probably a high C student. (due to my messy handwritting i had problems getting high marks in compo, somehow), and i just had to write out of point in that exam. i wasnt depressed or more like i did not even feel anything. i was simply hack-care at that time.<br><br>after some long talks, arguments, i finally awaken from all these mess. i decided that i did not want to retain. the condition to promote was a pass in 2 subjects and english. i had to get like 60 percent for my english to pass, and as my english has always been at the 50-60 range, i was feeling quite scared when i recieved the paper at the end of year. finally, after all CA calculations etc...i managed to pass the overall, at 51 percent. WHEW..<br><br>just when that happened, i failed chemistry, physics, geog and combined humanities horribly. all around the 30+ range. almost all the papers were quite difficult and all of them had their fair share of failures. i was one of them, and one of the f9 failures. the MSG (average) for some subjects was even a fail. i did put in effort to study, i wonder if it wasn't enough, or is it because im stupid. im quite sure i know all the facts quite well. i have a super smart friend who does nothing but read textbook and scores in exam. i tried doin the same but got stunned during the exam when i couldn't do the twisted questions. i did not try doin TYS partly because i wasn't discipline enough, i was still on my com, playing games, playing badminton but i took effort to prepare like few days before the exam.., thats what all my friends do...<br><br>but they passed and i failed.<br><br>i heard from teachers and my parents that an average student studies like 3-4 hours per day. i was like OMG, i do not study on a daily basis and only read the book the day before the exam. for this exam, i took the effort to prepare few days earlier and i took special effort to listen in class. but i only got a few marks improvement from last time...<br><br>okie right now i passed my Amaths, Chinese and English. my chinese, i did not get high enough to pull my overall grade to a pass. but im quite sure my amaths did (at 59%...haix. lousy compared to my other friends). the only paper which i have not got bac is emaths n im quite sure i will pass the paper. but however. im starting to feel as if i should retain..<br><br>im sure retaining at sec 3 sounds stupid, but sometimes i need this extra year to prepare myselfs for the o levels. getting 30+ for so mani subjects has crushed my confidence. unless i put in lots and lots of effort during this EOY holiday, i will probably not make it in my O levels. so why not just retain and take my time. but im holding back because i will not be together with my friends. and i will have to mix around with a new group of people.<br><br>so in conclusion, to sum up things, i have a few questions to ask.<br><br>1) how do you improve handwritting? i tried writing neatly, but due to the lack of time, especially papers like social studies, geography and english..., i had to scribble my answers and try to write as fast as i can. as there are multiple essays to do and usually answers are required to be like 5-7 full pages in total, (foolscap paper). how do you write neat, but at the same time fast, any methods to train handwritting?<br><br>2) how to stop being careless? fortunately, this amaths paper was easy, but i lost like 20+ marks due to careless mistakes. i guess. i get penalized for opening a bracket wrongly in a simple binomial theroem sum and the whole thing (usually 3-5 marks), gets a big fat egg......<br><br>3) what should i do now? should i actualli consider to retain? or promote and mug lots and lots during this long holiday..?<br><br></div></blockquote>if you cant even go to sec4 then there's nothing much you can do.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by HENG@:</div><div class="quote_body">i've read thru. all i can say is, even if u repeat a year, its nothing to be ashamed of, because to have the determination and guts to stand back up and continue forward after falling is a good thing. Do not think of repeating a year as something to be ashamed of. Think of it as a 2nd chance. Im also repeating my 1st year in Uni now. I am quite similiar to u in terms of studies, but in the past in Sg i've always managed to scrape thru. Last year tho, i finally had more problems than i could handle, and instead of trying to sort them out i just let my self sink deeper n deeper, and inside me i had this "i know i am dying but i couldn't care less" attitude too. only at the end of the year, i finally woke up, but it was too late to salvage the year. however, i pleaded my case and they gave me a 2nd chance to repeat the year, which is something im very grateful for. so dun give up, and repeat if u have to, and see it as a chance to put right the wrongs u have done.</div></blockquote>NICE.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Act,im a sec 3 student myself too.<br>I didnt do pretty well this time round.<br>But in your case,i think lets say IF you do get retained,you have to take it easy.Many people tend to look on the negative side,and think that,oh, "retain means waste one year!"<br><br>but look,so what even if you're promoted to sec 4.<br>for the "O"s, 75% of the syllabus is mostly tested on sec 3 work. Thus,your sec3 work is fundamental. This means,you must understand your concepts well enough. That means,even if you do get promoted to sec 4,you may find it quite a task to cope with your schoolwork. Besides,this does not easily gurantee a good pass for your Os.<br><br>Look at it optimistically.<br><br>Anyways,about your eng,feel free to drop by any libaray or spend a day at kinokuniya,the bk store at Taka,it's really big and huge and has got a whole loads of gd books.<br><br>As for your handwriting,i guess penmenship does't help yeah? Maybe you could try copying your text during the hols. It's two birds hitting with one stone. Firstly,you get to improve your handwriting.Next,some people find it easy to remember by copying.It does help,you know?<br><br>All the best!!!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br></div>

And ur attitude at tis moment is awesome. To have that drive to want to make it and prove people who doubt u wrong, tat is something priceless. And if there is the will, there will always be a way. So give it all u got. And live life to its fullest.<br><br>It turned out to be a "blessing in disguise" for me. And i'm positive it will turn out to be the same for u. Besides, tis one year tat u are retained will be over real soon and before u know it.. voila.. its time for ur O's.<br><br>"If you conquer your mind, you can conquer the world". I live by tis qoute. I was in that position at that point becoz i suddenly did'nt give a shit. I kept procrastinating and makin excuses. So learn from yesterday &amp; tomorrow will be brighter.</div>
