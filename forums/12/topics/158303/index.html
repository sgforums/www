            <div class='col-md body'>hi guys. im suffering from quite a serious problem, and i need feedback on what i should do.<br><br>story goes like this:<br><br>since the start of this yr (im sec 3 btw), i have been sleeping in class, slacking, not doin homework, and even skipping tests. im not sure whether i haf the "hackcare" attitude or simply because i think i still can make it even if i study last minute. maybe i was simply complacent. i slept at around 2-3 plus almost everyday ( i think i enjoyed too much the previous holiday...) and goin to school feeling sooo sleepy that i would just collasp in class.<br><br>midyear, i done it totally horribly. all f9s, including my english. actually my standard of english isn't that bad. probably a high C student. (due to my messy handwritting i had problems getting high marks in compo, somehow), and i just had to write out of point in that exam. i wasnt depressed or more like i did not even feel anything. i was simply hack-care at that time.<br><br>after some long talks, arguments, i finally awaken from all these mess. i decided that i did not want to retain. the condition to promote was a pass in 2 subjects and english. i had to get like 60 percent for my english to pass, and as my english has always been at the 50-60 range, i was feeling quite scared when i recieved the paper at the end of year. finally, after all CA calculations etc...i managed to pass the overall, at 51 percent. WHEW..<br><br>just when that happened, i failed chemistry, physics, geog and combined humanities horribly. all around the 30+ range. almost all the papers were quite difficult and all of them had their fair share of failures. i was one of them, and one of the f9 failures. the MSG (average) for some subjects was even a fail. i did put in effort to study, i wonder if it wasn't enough, or is it because im stupid. im quite sure i know all the facts quite well. i have a super smart friend who does nothing but read textbook and scores in exam. i tried doin the same but got stunned during the exam when i couldn't do the twisted questions. i did not try doin TYS partly because i wasn't discipline enough, i was still on my com, playing games, playing badminton but i took effort to prepare like few days before the exam.., thats what all my friends do...<br><br>but they passed and i failed.<br><br>i heard from teachers and my parents that an average student studies like 3-4 hours per day. i was like OMG, i do not study on a daily basis and only read the book the day before the exam. for this exam, i took the effort to prepare few days earlier and i took special effort to listen in class. but i only got a few marks improvement from last time...<br><br>okie right now i passed my Amaths, Chinese and English. my chinese, i did not get high enough to pull my overall grade to a pass. but im quite sure my amaths did (at 59%...haix. lousy compared to my other friends). the only paper which i have not got bac is emaths n im quite sure i will pass the paper. but however. im starting to feel as if i should retain..<br><br>im sure retaining at sec 3 sounds stupid, but sometimes i need this extra year to prepare myselfs for the o levels. getting 30+ for so mani subjects has crushed my confidence. unless i put in lots and lots of effort during this EOY holiday, i will probably not make it in my O levels. so why not just retain and take my time. but im holding back because i will not be together with my friends. and i will have to mix around with a new group of people.<br><br>so in conclusion, to sum up things, i have a few questions to ask.<br><br>1) how do you improve handwritting? i tried writing neatly, but due to the lack of time, especially papers like social studies, geography and english..., i had to scribble my answers and try to write as fast as i can. as there are multiple essays to do and usually answers are required to be like 5-7 full pages in total, (foolscap paper). how do you write neat, but at the same time fast, any methods to train handwritting?<br><br>2) how to stop being careless? fortunately, this amaths paper was easy, but i lost like 20+ marks due to careless mistakes. i guess. i get penalized for opening a bracket wrongly in a simple binomial theroem sum and the whole thing (usually 3-5 marks), gets a big fat egg......<br><br>3) what should i do now? should i actualli consider to retain? or promote and mug lots and lots during this long holiday..?<br><br></div>

If you have to be 'fast'.. ONLY SCRIBBLE on common words like 'if, what, how...' etc.. On more IMPORTANT KEY WORDS, try to write them out properly.. Unless you're repeatingly writing on that 'subject', in which case you can afford to scribble a bit more...<br><br>2) CHECK your papers after your exams. Or KNOW YOUR FACTS WELL.. Do NOT do your workings BLINDLY... As in just APPLYING and APPLYING... If you're more 'open minded' and aware of what's going on when you're solving your problems... CHANCES ARE.. You might just 'smell a rat' when something is wrong...? SLOW down a bit on questions which you can solve but ain't so confident of...<br><br>3) Personally I'll suggest for you to RETAIN if you're not really having a CATCH of 'what the hell is going on' for your Sec 3 studies.. Many might probably find it a waste of time or even suggest you might as well retain if you really have to in Sec 4 if you can pass Sec 3...? But I'll still stand on my suggestion IF you're SERIOUS about TURNING OVER A NEW LEAF...<br><br>Because BASICS are VERY IMPORTANT in your 'O' levels prep... And that 'BASIC' only starts from SEC 3... If you just BARELY MAKE IT to Sec 4, you'll probably just END UP STRUGGLING to 'keep afloat' trying to understand your Sec 4 teachings and constantly trying to 'recall' (which you probably can't even do because you've not LEARNT) things of Sec 3.... Even if you retain in your Sec 4.. Without a good foundation, you'll be having HELL picking up ALL OVER from Sec 3 and trying to understand your Sec 4 lessons... That might just be EVEN MORE WORK... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"><br><br>BESIDES... If you STRUGGLE and just manage to make it for your 'O' levels, the results probably won't be able to get you far... Then somewhere in the future, you'll be STUCK and back to SQUARE ONE AGAIN...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Let's just say this.... I see you as a borderline case. Not really good enough to proceed to Sec 4 but not bad enough to get retained. Ultimately, you're going to have to ask yourself this question: are you going to work hard from now on? A lot of damage has been done to your academic standing, and you really need to put in a lot of effort here.<br><br>I was something like you once.... I really heck cared the first half of Sec 3. When I realised I was near the bottom of my class, I bucked up and put in the ultimate effort. Even during the Dec holidays I would study like siao (believe me, I studied the recommended 3-4 hours during the Dec holidays). My Sec 3 foundation was very bad, and all that effort was needed to correct it.<br><br>If you truly believe that your foundation is very bad, and all-out revision over the holidays won't help, then it would be better to retain. Otherwise, trust me, your Sec 4 will be hell. You really, really need all those Sec 3 concepts to do Sec 4. Might as well retain one year, be a super pro in Sec 3 stuff, and your Sec 4 will be much easier. Of course, this still isn't a licence for you to slack in Sec 4.<br><br>My tuition student failed his Sec 2 streaming and was given the choice of whether to promote or retain. He chose to get promoted, and he's now suffering like hell. In my view, he made a bad mistake by not retaining because he can't even do very elementary mathematics like simple linear equations ( ax + b = c ) and similar triangles. No joke. I ended up drilling all those basic Sec 1 and Sec 2 stuff into his head instead of teaching him Sec 3 topics. It's really not possible to teach him Sec 3 stuff when his foundation is so weak.<br><br>I don't suppose your situation is as bad as my tuition kid, but ultimately it's your decision.</div>

But remember, that you are writing not for yourself to see, but for the Cambridge markers to see. If you keep reminding yourself, sooner or later you will pressurise yourself to write neater, until you reach the biting point whereby you do not have to compromise speed for neatness. It comes with practice, especially if you do Social Studies.<br><br>Careless mistakes. Sometimes it will save a lot of time if you read the question and do your working properly. Sometimes, esp for A maths, you wont have the time to re-check. So when you are doing your working, why not recheck at the same time? It wont take too long, simply recalculate on your calculator.<br><br>It is always a better option to promote. You did well enough to make it to Sec 3, you can definately make it thru your O levels. You don't have to mug, I.D. your problem topics/chapters, and work on them. No point mugging over a topic that you did well, right?<br><br>All the best!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Promotion or not. I guess you might want to discuss that with your parents and teachers? As for studying, you sow what you reap. Effort is a must. Like saying your friends study only a few days before exam is a bad thought to have. They might be studying full steam only a short while before exams, but how about homework on a daily basis? Being alert and in a clear state of mind during class? Certain amounts of revision on a daily basis? All those have a part to play. I'm sure they put in a fair share of effort to achieve what they have. Alright. Enough questions for you to think about. Let's look at solutions now.<br><br>1) Less games. Come on we all know it. They're addictive. I love them too. But perhaps you have to cut down on the time you spend on games. Maybe an hour of studies and an hour of gaming as a reward for that contructive hour you spent on your studies. Balancing work and play is a key in achieving the most during your studies and still keep your mind fresh and alive.<br><br>2) More commitment. Give yourself some reasons to work hard. Future aspirations? Dreams? Think of something that will drive you to work hard in your studies.<br><br>3) Get a study partner. Set your goals on someone whom you think is good. Then pursure your goal. Work hard to achieve a target you set.<br><br>Anyway effort is the most important. Do spend more effort. Wanting to improve is a good start already. Keep it up and all the best.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i've read thru. all i can say is, even if u repeat a year, its nothing to be ashamed of, because to have the determination and guts to stand back up and continue forward after falling is a good thing. Do not think of repeating a year as something to be ashamed of. Think of it as a 2nd chance. Im also repeating my 1st year in Uni now. I am quite similiar to u in terms of studies, but in the past in Sg i've always managed to scrape thru. Last year tho, i finally had more problems than i could handle, and instead of trying to sort them out i just let my self sink deeper n deeper, and inside me i had this "i know i am dying but i couldn't care less" attitude too. only at the end of the year, i finally woke up, but it was too late to salvage the year. however, i pleaded my case and they gave me a 2nd chance to repeat the year, which is something im very grateful for. so dun give up, and repeat if u have to, and see it as a chance to put right the wrongs u have done.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Scape_Goat_Token:</div><div class="quote_body">hi guys. im suffering from quite a serious problem, and i need feedback on what i should do.<br><br>story goes like this:<br><br>since the start of this yr (im sec 3 btw), i have been sleeping in class, slacking, not doin homework, and even skipping tests. im not sure whether i haf the "hackcare" attitude or simply because i think i still can make it even if i study last minute. maybe i was simply complacent. i slept at around 2-3 plus almost everyday ( i think i enjoyed too much the previous holiday...) and goin to school feeling sooo sleepy that i would just collasp in class.<br><br>midyear, i done it totally horribly. all f9s, including my english. actually my standard of english isn't that bad. probably a high C student. (due to my messy handwritting i had problems getting high marks in compo, somehow), and i just had to write out of point in that exam. i wasnt depressed or more like i did not even feel anything. i was simply hack-care at that time.<br><br>after some long talks, arguments, i finally awaken from all these mess. i decided that i did not want to retain. the condition to promote was a pass in 2 subjects and english. i had to get like 60 percent for my english to pass, and as my english has always been at the 50-60 range, i was feeling quite scared when i recieved the paper at the end of year. finally, after all CA calculations etc...i managed to pass the overall, at 51 percent. WHEW..<br><br>just when that happened, i failed chemistry, physics, geog and combined humanities horribly. all around the 30+ range. almost all the papers were quite difficult and all of them had their fair share of failures. i was one of them, and one of the f9 failures. the MSG (average) for some subjects was even a fail. i did put in effort to study, i wonder if it wasn't enough, or is it because im stupid. im quite sure i know all the facts quite well. i have a super smart friend who does nothing but read textbook and scores in exam. i tried doin the same but got stunned during the exam when i couldn't do the twisted questions. i did not try doin TYS partly because i wasn't discipline enough, i was still on my com, playing games, playing badminton but i took effort to prepare like few days before the exam.., thats what all my friends do...<br><br>but they passed and i failed.<br><br>i heard from teachers and my parents that an average student studies like 3-4 hours per day. i was like OMG, i do not study on a daily basis and only read the book the day before the exam. for this exam, i took the effort to prepare few days earlier and i took special effort to listen in class. but i only got a few marks improvement from last time...<br><br>okie right now i passed my Amaths, Chinese and English. my chinese, i did not get high enough to pull my overall grade to a pass. but im quite sure my amaths did (at 59%...haix. lousy compared to my other friends). the only paper which i have not got bac is emaths n im quite sure i will pass the paper. but however. im starting to feel as if i should retain..<br><br>im sure retaining at sec 3 sounds stupid, but sometimes i need this extra year to prepare myselfs for the o levels. getting 30+ for so mani subjects has crushed my confidence. unless i put in lots and lots of effort during this EOY holiday, i will probably not make it in my O levels. so why not just retain and take my time. but im holding back because i will not be together with my friends. and i will have to mix around with a new group of people.<br><br>so in conclusion, to sum up things, i have a few questions to ask.<br><br>1) how do you improve handwritting? i tried writing neatly, but due to the lack of time, especially papers like social studies, geography and english..., i had to scribble my answers and try to write as fast as i can. as there are multiple essays to do and usually answers are required to be like 5-7 full pages in total, (foolscap paper). how do you write neat, but at the same time fast, any methods to train handwritting?<br><br>2) how to stop being careless? fortunately, this amaths paper was easy, but i lost like 20+ marks due to careless mistakes. i guess. i get penalized for opening a bracket wrongly in a simple binomial theroem sum and the whole thing (usually 3-5 marks), gets a big fat egg......<br><br>3) what should i do now? should i actualli consider to retain? or promote and mug lots and lots during this long holiday..?<br><br></div></blockquote>hi boi,<br><br>Ive been thru all e above wat u r currently facing.. n I was worse off than u cos I flunked all 10-12 subjects of my 2nd yr(1st Sememster)  in polytechnic n it was a pretty tough course (law + management) .
