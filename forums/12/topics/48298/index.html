Let me tell you the consequences of saying that statement.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Your boyfriend will stick with you until he find someone better. Then the someone better comes along - he will use this excuse to leave you - the statement you told him. Try new relationship lor - then if he can make it with her, you are gone. If not, he will come back look for you if the needs to feel dependancy arrive.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Why he wuld do that? DON'T HAVE TO BE 'BAD' GUY wor... gf herself say one <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>Serious?

Your thoughts are not wrong - its filled with inferiority and the mis-conception of love and relationship.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Doesn't seemed contented as having you as a gf? Wtf? Girl - widen your eyes and look at your bf rather than looking at him with your emotional eye. If I was a girl and my guy told me that - right away, its a byebye. Or if I really love him alot - I will try to work for a way to change his preception.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You ain't trying to change his preception - you are leading it. There is no such thing as regret being with YOU without a taste of having another relationship with somebody else. This is an excuse your mind is conjuring because you are tired of this relationship. You said he is the only one to want to make you settle down - let me tell you, definitely there are people out there better. You should have someone who appreciate you for who you are, being with you because he loves being with you, than superficial reasons to be together.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>You feel that the relationship is leading to nowhere - this is a strong sign that you love descends into the Decline Stage - CloUdiSm remix III (Love life Cycle). You reason why you are not ending this reason because something is holding you back.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>However, your bf is holding back because there isn't anyone suitable to chase or to get YET. Its all about timing. When someone decent and good comes along - likes him too - He will kick you aside. I throw my bet on this 89.3%  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> <strong>WHICH DECENT BF WOULD TELL THEIR GF THAT HE WANTS TO TWO TIMED OR THREE TIMED HER? </strong> Absolutely ridiculous.<br><br>My take is that - if you rather wait for such scenarios to happen - might as well, date him out, have a serious talk with him about what the both of you wants to do with the relationship. Don't want to work towards it - forget about it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Let me tell you: the thing about relationship is not whether it has ended or not - its about good memories and how it ended. There is thousand of people rather use tactics to end this relationship - two time lar, etc - in the end, it leaves very bad memories and it sux. Talk lar - why cannot talk like a matured couple? How many times better than playing mind and waiting games. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Haiz... this is your first boyfriend I suppose - Probably there is alot for you to learn.
