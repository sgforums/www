He never love you and care about your feelings. Ultimately, that girl is of higher priority than you. Such guy cannot give you security unless he learnt his lesson which obviously, he never learnt. Because he still go back &amp; treat the girl like his queen (you should be the queen!!).<br><br>That girl reminds me of one of my colleagues. She broke up with her exbf 1 year ago. Now, he has a new gf and she is single. She told me up till now, whatever she wants, her exbf will get for her. Even if she knows his gf is beside him, she will still demand the exbf to serve her and the guy really did! That silly guy would tell his gf that his exgf needs this &amp; that and off he goes. When I asked her why is she doing this, she told me she is single and just bored. Also, she knows the exbf still like her alot and thus, will care about her. Therefore, she make use of him. I am quoting word for word, "If I want him back now, he will leave his gf and be with me." Anyway, she call herself b1tch.<br><br>If you happen to feel less charming or attractive than that girl, please don't be because their immoral actions don't deserve your self-worth.  I think perhaps, that girl doesn't come from a good loving background so she thrist for guy's attention (that's what happen to my colleague) or she was sexually abused before and so she lost her self-respect and started sleeping around with guys. (like Annabel Chong) Whatever the case is, that girl is old enough to choose whether she wants to be good or bad. She did not try to regain her self-respect and likewise, everyone will continue to disrespect her. Respect needs to be earned.<br><br>Cheers!</span></div>
