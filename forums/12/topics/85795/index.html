But sometimes if you know that person, it'll be much easier to advise...<br><br>Like I've said earlier, the mails are not meant to replace AA. As much as the problems would be entertained in AA's forum, they would be entertained by the same people (also from AA) who's interested in the discussion sessions...<br><br>3 issues to note here...<br><br>1. Rather than have those people who's not comfortable with posting their problems out in public bottoms up everything. We provide and alternate choice.<br><br>2. For those who's comfortable with the posting up but YET wants a more DETAILED discussion way of handling their problem, they can CHOOSE. And the session would consist of interested AA forumites. The person can even turn up himself / herself to hear his / her own problem being discussed without having to expose his / her own identity. Can even ask questions of more concern or interest since it's a discussion session. Like I've said, INTERACTIVE.<br><br>3. The problem (if the person is comfortable with it) would be posted in AA with the discussed reply. Others can still chip in their shares as USUAL. If the person is not comfortable with the posting up, it won't have made much of a difference because it wouldn't have been posted in AA anyway in the 1st place?</div>
