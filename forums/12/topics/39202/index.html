I knew that. but I couldn;t help it. I know I am very depressed and stressed over my poly attachment stuffs. In office I have no one to tok to. I was always alone. When I got home, sometimes when I see my bf play mahjong and would not bother me, I would find very annoying and sad, cos he will not even listen to a single word I said cos he so "focus" on his mahjong.<br><br>Then I would sit alone at a side to cool myself down. ever since attachment I did not contact my poly frenz cos everyone is so busy with their project. Been keeping a lot of things inside my mind...when my parents saw that I'm depressed in front of my bf, they would scold me for being petty.(they tot I'm angry with him)<br><br>When they are in bad mood, they would blow their temper to me. When I;m in bad mood, i keep quiet (to keep myself from blowing) and they also scold me.<br><br>I wanted so much attention from them(parents and bf) but they don't know. haiz.. life suxx at times.<br><br>there's this thing I kept in my mind for a very long time but I dun think it's appropriate for me to tell my bf.<br>He always told me that in between us we shouldn't have secrets but he actually has it and didn't tell me. well me, i would tell him anything. yesterday he ask me, ' we do not have any secrets kept right?" I didn;t say anything. but in my mind, i  'nod my head' and ans 'yes you have but you forgot that you never told me and you never meant to tell me'<br><br>he share a secret with a 'gf' of his,(well i wouldn;t mind that he has 'gf'), they tok for 5 hrs that night while they share this secret. i didn't knwo but I panick when I saw the both of them together, and the girl would msg him at times, with very sweet msgs etc...<br><br>he told me he could not tell me the 'secret' they shared as he promised thr girl but he would expect me to tell him my friends secret to him. I was so upset. but it''s his friend. I dun want to be unreasonable. so I kept it.<br><br>his bday is coming soon, so i search quite a long time for a set of 12 player pack of liverpool corinthian figures in 1995( for guys who might know) and finally got one shop to import it me from london. I was so happy when i got it. so I gave it to him....<br><br>because i know he likes soccer, so i tried all my best to learn players and team in EPL learn about what is all the so call 'odds' for soccer gambling...<br><br>but sometimes i just would like him to get more sensitive just by a little bit that would be enuff.....<br><br>I am not a person that like to blew up my temper, but I really have no one no confide in when I'm in great depression. cos my bf wouldn;t care more or less, he would just ans: relax a bit loh....<br><br>haiz... very sad lah...<br>hope these 2 days will get my mood better...<br><br>thanks for reading huh<br><br>cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi angeline,<br><br>briefly, i would say that keeping quiet isn't the best thing in this situation. communication is important and sometimes the other party just cannot tell wat u're feeling.<br><br>you can voice out ur concerns without losing ur temper. and even if u do, so what? u came as an entire package, including ur temper, and it's not that he can pick and choose. altho of course, keeping a lid on one's temper is always a prudent thing to do.<br><br>let me give u a personal experience on wat i mean by communication (or rather a lack thereof)<br><br>when my ex-gf and i were together i thot things were fine and dandy and i was really happy. after we broke-up, suddenly i had SO MANY short-comings that i didn't know about. she would tell me that i had been sh[/i]it at this and sh[/i]it at that. maybe true, maybe not, but that's not the point. had she voiced all this out, i MIGHT have changed, or taken heed, but i was lead to believe that things were good and that'd we last ages and ages.<br><br>u might call me insensitive and unable to "tell what she was thinking" (in her exact words). but u know i do have (at least a logical) point in my account above.<br><br>hope things work out for you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>a long story indeed. Ok.<br>Your bf is busy with his mahjong everyday huh? If that's the case, I think he needs to cut down some time and spend more time with you. You can go and watch some tv or call some of your friends while he's playing his mahjong.<br>You said that you are lonely during attachment, you can come to sgForums, icq, irc and chat mah.. And for me, during attachment, I did lost some of my friends too.. I'm currently on attachment now. opps. It's working life you know, when you go out work next time, you'll also be by yourself. You have to do everything on your own, cannot depend on others already. Learning every step you take, the mistake you have made.<br>Your mother don't understands you? Why not try telling her about your problems you have faced during the attachment. Maybe she will understand you better after that..<br>You like to keep things to yourself. Am i wrong to say that? You should try to speak up and tell your problems to your bf and parents. If not who can help you? No one eh.. only you can help yourself.<br><br>Cheer Up..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
