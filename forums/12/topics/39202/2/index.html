I knew that. but I couldn;t help it. I know I am very depressed and stressed over my poly attachment stuffs. In office I have no one to tok to. I was always alone. When I got home, sometimes when I see my bf play mahjong and would not bother me, I would find very annoying and sad, cos he will not even listen to a single word I said cos he so "focus" on his mahjong.<br><br>Then I would sit alone at a side to cool myself down. ever since attachment I did not contact my poly frenz cos everyone is so busy with their project. Been keeping a lot of things inside my mind...when my parents saw that I'm depressed in front of my bf, they would scold me for being petty.(they tot I'm angry with him)<br><br>When they are in bad mood, they would blow their temper to me.

I didn;t say anything. but in my mind, i  'nod my head' and ans 'yes you have but you forgot that you never told me and you never meant to tell me'<br><br>he share a secret with a 'gf' of his,(well i wouldn;t mind that he has 'gf'), they tok for 5 hrs that night while they share this secret. i didn't knwo but I panick when I saw the both of them together, and the girl would msg him at times, with very sweet msgs etc...<br><br>he told me he could not tell me the 'secret' they shared as he promised thr girl but he would expect me to tell him my friends secret to him. I was so upset. but it''s his friend. I dun want to be unreasonable. so I kept it.<br><br>his bday is coming soon, so i search quite a long time for a set of 12 player pack of liverpool corinthian figures in 1995( for guys who might know) and finally got one shop to import it me from london. I was so happy when i got it. so I gave it to him....<br><br>because i know he likes soccer, so i tried all my best to learn players and team in EPL learn about what is all the so call 'odds' for soccer gambling...<br><br>but sometimes i just would like him to get more sensitive just by a little bit that would be enuff.....<br><br>I am not a person that like to blew up my temper, but I really have no one no confide in when I'm in great depression. cos my bf wouldn;t care more or less, he would just ans: relax a bit loh....<br><br>haiz... very sad lah...<br>hope these 2 days will get my mood better...<br><br>thanks for reading huh<br><br>cheers</div></blockquote>Dear IamAngeline,<br><br>Since you took quite a bit of time to type this chunk of emotional words; I would spend equal amount of time in analysing, as I doubt you want people to reply the same thing as your bf, 'Relax abit lor.'  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Know why so stress? During work, women will display their masculine side - which will drain them spiritually and emotionally. Finally coming home - they seek to exude the feminine part of themselves (They want someone to listen to their woe, they want a good hug, sweet whispering of their love ones, etc) - lacking in this aspect - any woman will grown weary and tired, which is exactly what is happening to you.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Parents scolded you? Totally insane - I mean even if you were to quarrel with your bf; doesn't really got to do with them right? One thing your bf failed to do is to speak up for you - even by saying something like 'No lar, she is just feeling tired after work' that kind of thing would be good enough. Did he?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>About the secret thingy - this is a pretty common case among couples (risk factors including: Possessive partners, easily jealous partners, etc) - Why you might question; people are generally devious in this manner. They want to know everything about you, but they would only let you know 90%, saving the 10% in their private 'swiss bank' deep inside their conscious mind.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Here is an analogy: Everyone wants to be loved 100%, but many would only willing to fort out 80% - because they are afraid to be hurt, afraid to be betrayed, etc. Applied to your case - its more or less similar.<br><br>Advice?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Let me ask you questions: how long have you been in your relationships? (Definitely is out of honeymoon period - I can sense routine curse befalling onto your relationship). Why am I 86.3% confident? Think about this: your bf can spend 5 hrs talking with his platonic girl friend, listening (probably advising) about situations, point of views, etc - and he can't even spend 5 minutes listening to you? Or even bother you?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>You want to be a good gf, but what you are doing isn't effective in building this relation. You desire for his temporary company and attention - but you ain't telling him. Why are you keeping it to yourself? Does it really help you or *RATHER* this relationship? (Emotions &amp; feelings ain't exchange) Isn't it more important and crucial than to exchange gossips and litte secrets?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Regarding the little secret problem that you are facing - all I can say is monkey see, monkey do. If he ain't telling you everything and claims that he has already promise his 'gf' not to reveal - just do the same next time round. I mean - tell or don't tell: does it really matter? No right? The issue is regarding the *pact* you both made to each other and if he don't honor it, you don't have to oblige and get tie down by this too.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You need to seriously have a proper chat with him IF you wish to see improvement from him. No use hoping people will change because THEY don't even know whats wrong with themselves. Keeping negative feelings to yourself <strong>ISN'T</strong> going to help this relation <strong>AT ALL</strong>. I don't blame you because you are suffering from the infamous women curse of 'I-don't-say-but-I-expect-you-to-know' kind of thingy - men are straight thinkers - they don't (most) get bothered too much about how woman really thinks. (Some try, but in the end, they never knew anyway  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> ).<br><br>In short?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Learn to speak up your *REAL* feelings. Your key tactics is to be TACTFUL and not blunt. You want this relation to last right? It doesn't take a MCsquare, Joho or Devil1976 to predict that if you were to remain this way - this relation would be rolling towards the route of declining stage because you are BOUND to explode one day like a raging volcano that will blast at your bf so fatal that this relation will be crippled. Scars are difficult to heal and quarrels are emotionally disturbing - take things one by one and solve it as it goes than to absorb everything. <strong>You CAN'T</strong>, with passing time.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>P.S: I am so sorry for this hell-of-a-long essay I have wrote people. (Sorry XLN, I know you won't be reading this...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> hiak hiak) Anyway, just for fun: Are you are Taurus, Capricorn, Virgo? - *accuracy not guaranteed*<br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Fr wat u said, angeline, i think ur bf has to more sensitive to u. But had u ever told him wat u felt? As ur bf, he shld not hav a heart for others but u....... But u can even tolerate tt he is havin another gf, shows how much u love him. There are some times where we need to sit down and tok.... discuss wat is goin on. FInd out wat is his stand. What i mean is a proper calm chat , without any shoutin and outburst. I think in this way, the relationship can last longer. Better clear up any misunderstanding now , than wait to face the snowball effect of all the misunderstandings.... do u agree? some times its realli hard to get down to chat and admit all our faults.<br><br>For , Angeline... i think u must make ur stand some where.... pls dun let another women come btw u and him. KNow the whole story btw them, maybe they are just friends? find out y he prefers to tok to his "gf" than tok to u..... I think it always takes 2 hands to clap...<br>Try to see things fr his view point too. then maybe u 2 can do some corrections and improve on ya relationship !!!</div>

Hm... yeah was in that sh*t before too. Maybe it is not the sensitivity thing but for me, I think I took things a little bit for granted as everything just seemed to be so fine.<br>_________<br>Communication is very important and you must voice out and talk about it. If not misunderstandings will occur, like what happenend to me last time. And if some severe misunderstandings occur, no matter what you do, you cannot save anything. Once a mirror is cracked, the cracks will always be there.<br><br>As for secrecy between a couple... I used to think that there should be no secrets between one. But a girl-friend of mine once told me not to be foolish. Certain secrets still has to be kept. No matter how she tells you or in your case, he, that he doesn't mind, you wouldn't know how he feels.<br><br>Anyway, you are a sweet girlfriend. Just keep on going.</div>

Do NOT have too many 'tiny thoughts'. It's not healthy for the relationship. You can reflect on things in your relationship, but try to do it in a less stressful and positive sense...<br><br>2. Try to get yourself a group of FRIENDS you can spend time with. If the people currently around you belittles you or whatever, REMEMBER... You can always get a NEW group of friends... Find this as an OPPORTUNITY to expand your social circle...<br><br>3. BALANCE OUT your Life... Do NOT be too dependent on your bf and parents for company or whatever....<br><br>If you're feeling down, you can always pour out whatever ya have to..?
