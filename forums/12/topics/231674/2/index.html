Even girls will agree with me on this point<br><br>however, wad make us the human different from others? it is LOVE and morals dat differentiate us from other animals. if ur fren really love her gf, den he should respect her. his gf does nt owe him anything and she is not obiliged to hav sex with him. a girl is mos afraid to get pregnant before marriage in this "so called conservative" society. Your fren hav to understand her more.<br><br>as for his own urge, i suggest u ask him go see a pyscologist. or divert his attention to do more meaningful things with his gf rather den sex sex sex. sex isnt the only thing dat a dating couple can do. there are MUCH more meaningful things dat dey can do and acheive.......</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Your friend is not into the love aspect of the relationship but more to the lust side  of it. He should start thinking with this brain more and less with this d.ick, He really need to respect the gal's decision that he is asking for too much sex and he needs to stop. And how old is your friend? I dun think you wanna see him struggling soon because he needs to feed his 1 month old kid. And lastly......<br><br>Bleh sex is overrated!</div>

Self-control can be exercised. It also reflects the strength of your mind versus your bottom half  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Actually, without the premature involvement of sex, a couple will have a better chance of developing better understanding and building a stronger foundation based on love in a relationship. When sex comes into the picture, the focus tend to be on that, as can be seen in TS's friend, and so attention is diluted.</div>
