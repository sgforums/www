            <div class='col-md body'>I think when a couple has reached a certain stage in their r/s, it is quite hard to control themselves from indulging in more and more physical intimacy...unless the couple spent all their time outside, then cant do anything much oso except PDA every now and then  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Most of the time, the girl gives in cos she thinks it is an expression of love for the guy, and because she thinks she wans to become closer to the guy.

There are many consequences that will happen, she will start to think: Will the guy stay wif me? Will he get tired of my body and start to go for another girl?

But like I mention before, maybe the guy will start taking the girl for granted already, so she will start to regret for giving in to the guy.<br><br>So sex is tricky business. Best is dun indulge in it if you are not prepared to handle the consequences. And the consequence is not just about the girl mite get pregnant, it is that she will start to feel insecure also.

Sadly, if the bf cannot tolerate and handle such a topic in the first place, prolly he cant face it in future either as described by speedcam of the r/s now.<br><br>This guy's gotta learn how to be more sensitive to the feelings of his love instead of just letting his desire sweep all over him to ruin any possible beautiful partnership for life. Perhaps he may think what he's done is enuff and supposedly to keep his mate happy, but truly, <strong>does his mate <span style="color: red;">REALLY</span> think that way?</strong> Spare more tots for her. Dun laugh or jeer at her slightest ridiculous thinking or feelings to you. Hear her out more often than you wld like to blabber about your own opinions even in a 2 years or even 8 years r/s. Dun turn down or curtail any of her wanting to talk no matter in what situation. Be patient. It goes to show she is opening up to you. Failing to see all these signals cuts off all romantic feelings in a girl and she'd be less likely to respond to any of your advances. It goes a long way and i am sure he would be <strong>"amply"</strong> rewarded if he does all these.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>I like this last part though -<br><blockquote>Maybe the girl has found someone better <strong>whom she think will not keep asking her for sex like her current bf</strong> </blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>All the best to the girl then!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Poor guy!</div>
