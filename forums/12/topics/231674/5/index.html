If all they had was only sexual connectivity and since <strong><span style="color: red;">the guy is not trying very hard to make it come alive again anyway</span></strong>, and the girl seriously did not think there was any future in the r/s, it's doomsday for this r/s!<br><br>Bottomline is, who cares more for the r/s.
