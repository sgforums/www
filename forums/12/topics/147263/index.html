            <div class='col-md body'>3 years ago, I willingly lend my friend, someone I knew for over 15 years, a big sum of money without even asking why she needs the money.  She claimed that she will return me it to me after 3 months but I did not hear from her since .... Prior to this incident, we had gatherings yearly and talk about good old days but now ...  Sigh ...<br><br>I realised that she took the money to start a new business ...  apparently, the business failed and I understand she is now under remand for some financial problem ...  I signed up a few Line of Credit for her ... Due to some unforseen circumstances, I lose my job and I am now in debt with these sum fo money ....<br><br>Any kind soul out there can advise what can I do?  Any chance of me getting back the money?  I am prepared to forgo the friendship just to get back my own money as I needed the finance now ... Shall I seek legal advise?  And what is the cost of legal?<br><br>Incidentally, I engagd the services of Debt Collecting Agency to recover the sum and I paid an upfront fee of $1500 for their services, with the rest of the commission being payable upon recovery of the amount by the DCA.  As soon as I signed the contract with them, the DCA had never contacted me .. I am the one who has always pursued them for an update on the status ..  Am I being conned by the DCA?  I went to CASE to complain but they claimed I cant do anything as I signed a contract which specifies I willingly pay the upfront fees ...<br><br>Sigh .... All of a sudden, I felt life's sucks ....   with all these misfortuntes happening to me ...  hope I can have listening ears from someone and from those who can offer me some advice on how to proceed ...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually wat is on the paper? Did u lend her money, or u own shares in the company? Cos if u own shares, then good luck, bad business mistake.<br><br>Why employ DCA??? You do a better job. If ur friend take money and lose because of business decision, u ask DCA to ask her for money also useless. She take money from mid air and return to u?<br><br>Better to talk to her properly and discuss a way. Return over time small amounts or something. Your friend already lost a lot of money from the business thing. Think deep down she avoided u because she felt bad about it. Talk it out. Don't use emotions into it. Better to have the money return to u in segments rather than the whole lump sum.<br><br>Last, learn your lessons.</div>

You can give it a simple shot to see how things might go from there if you like..? Personal advice is don't pin too high a hope if any at all...<br><br>Try to look for loop holes within the contract with the debt collectors if you like to fight for yourself...? But for $1500, I could think it's barely worth the efforts...? Try a more friendly approach with them and see if it might work otherwise...?</div>
