I am also sad that we have to end our friendship in this manner ...

I am the one who always called them to chase for an update.  They gave me the same type of reaons that I heard when I called my friend i.e. not free to meet, arrange for an appointment, need to settle something first, etc, etc.  They even told me sometimes they don't have any update for me so there is no point calling me to provide an update ... what a fXX!<br><br>I know I may not get back my $1500 but I was thinking of registering a case with the Small Claims Tribunal court to dewter them for future dealings with other people?

It's not advisable to spend 'extra money' if you're not confident of any take back.. At least not now.. It's just not worth it... Would like to tell you more about the $100k but decided that it would be pointless and to spare you the agony... You have more important to look after in your life....<br><br>Talks are cheap if not in balck and white especially when you're with dealings... Whatever the DCA had promised you... Were they written in black and white..? If so, do you think it can be used against them...? Go down to legal aid with your documents if you think it's useful and get a $1 advice... At the same time you might wanna ask about your $100k issue if you want to? Not that I'm expecting anything much out for the latter case...<br><br>Doom? Job is job issue, get a job.. Get a living... Feed yourself... One thing which seems strange to me... You're still driving? Your car...? You might like to do some 'readjustments' to that before the actual storm hits you...? No use hanging around in a daze.. Though I can understand it's kinda hard to control sometimes... Especially when you've 'done nothing wrong'...? Yeah.. Sometimes life just get all sh|tty on ya... What to do...? That's really what makes things so interesting yeah...? Who would wanna spend a $7 watching a boring show anyway...?<br><br>I foresee that the worse that might come for you might be a bankrupcy or sort of things...? Then again, that might or might not even happen? I've got friends in sh|t with credits too... Blood sucking... Kills you only when you think too much about it... In other words, life can still go on and you still can learn to appreciate it in a different way... You're a guy yup? Remember NS...? Like imprisonment... Now things are not that terrible... Your friend's in jail? You're not... Whether you deserve it or not is not an utmost issue now... KEY is HOW ya handle it....?<br><br>I... Have a thought for your situation...? But I'm not that well-versed in your exact situation and legal implications... So where is that 'Mr A' now..? Are you still able to contact him...?<br><br>Instead of all blaming and cursing your friend, PIN A HOPE in her... Try to get to her and talk to her... If she's willing to carry upright all the debts and loads back on her shoulder, I'm not sure if there could be other avenue or implication legally...?<br><br>On a 'blind spot'... Try to work your way back to her if you can... At the same time, try to find out more about what this can do or mean to you legally... And... BE PREPARED? Cause it's gonna be a 'LONG TRIP'... Even if you manage to get back to her, she might or might not be willing to help you.. Not to mention how despaired she could already be... And how 'upset' you might get when you get to see her...? CONTROL IT... Though it might or might not be a ticket out, but at least it's trying something compared to nothing...?<br><br>Meanwhile.. Try to get a job and do some financial adjustments in your life-style...</div>
