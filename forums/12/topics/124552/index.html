The main thing is that how much u care for her, if u really care u should be prepare to have protected sex instead.<br><br>Now the problem u r facing if i correct about it, that is about her feeling and the stress that u might  get a child the next time u have sex. So what u can do is to think about what are her good points other then sex and try to love her in another way. Shower it to her, that u really care for her.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The thing is, most men only think with their private parts when dealing with the opposite sex, not their brains. Seriously, ask urself if u are in this relationship because of sex, or because u want 2 live with this woman forever. If it is because of sex, then leave her. If u wan 2 live with this woman forever, and she loves u as much, then quickly go get married. There are many reasons why a period can be late, such as work stress. If she is still worried, ask her go see doctor or buy a pregreancy kit to test. If she is pregreant, then be responsible.</div>

Let's try this test: Do NOT think of pink elephants.<br><br>Now close your eyes and try not to think of pink elephants.<br><br>Any pink elephants flashing in your mind yet? No? Congratulations you've attained nirvana. You probably saw Buddha on your way out. Amitabha.<br><br>For most people, not thinking about something is especially difficult when you're consciously making an effort in your mind. Rather than confront it head-on, why not sidestep it instead by distracting your mind with other thoughts?<br><br>And in doomz's case, a suggestion would be to focus on the activities that he had usually done (eg. hobbies, pastimes) before he tasted the forbidden fruit. Feel the urge coming? Go for a jog or a cold shower, or do something that'd keep your mind away from your other head. Sometimes that helps.<br><br>The only reason why guys think of sex whenever they see their girlfriends is that in their eyes, the girlfriend is just a piece of meat to satisfy their hunger for the flesh. Doomz, granted your task is made all the more challenging due to your self-professed stronger sex drive, it is still no excuse for you not to rise above your baser instincts and love her for who she is (ie. soulmate), rather than what she is (ie. meat).<br><br>Wait till you are both ready for the consequences and responsibilities that come with sex before you get on with it again. It'd be more enjoyable then.</div>

If you can write this, you are probably aware of your own weakness. Since you believe in God, let Him help release you from sin. Try reading the Bible whenever you feel the urge coming on.<br><br>Man may be born with sexual instincts, but Man is also given the faculty of thought to discern right from wrong. Use both wisely and I'm sure you would be blessed with a meaningful fulfilling relationship. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
