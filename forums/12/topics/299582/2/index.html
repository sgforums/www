Thank you for replying. Firstly I am 21 now.<br><br>We all go out as a group. Him and I have the same group of friends. So he could see what I do for the other guys is nothing and to him is everything.<br><br>I did not bothered to plan gatherings or birthday things for everyone but him. I did not get flowers for the rest but him. I did not buy food for the rest, but him.<br><br>I did not ever reject him of asking me out. I rejected some others before. He needes me, he calles me, I reach the place, always happens. Others call me, I make up stories to say I cannot make it. Or If I have nothing to do so then I meet up, if not I do not bother.<br><br>Others' perception affecting me, why so? I tell you.<br><br>Firstly Please understand he is not a very romantic kind of guy. He will dies if his guy friends are not around. Seems boring. He is crazy over games, during free time will always drive friends go to LAN shop and do Counterstrike the wholeday. He told me before he does not tolerate girls who are unreasonable and demanding, even if already is his girlfriend, he will ignore her. He feels that it is not right. From this I can say he is not those "giving in" kind of boyfriend.<br><br>But I am okay. I know I can have the patience to deal with him (Sadly I have no chance to). He is not romantic, Okay, I am romantic, I can do many things for him. He do not even have to lift a finger. I am willing to help him in all.<br><br>Going into others' perception after granny story up there.<br><br>I am not optimistic about the thing between him and I now. I never do think that we will be a couple even that has always always always been my wish/hope.<br><br>So Situation One if I do tell him I love him. He rejects me. Our group of friends, same group.. All will be very awkward to be together anymore. Because I am very surely that they will be informed of this "gossip". I do not know how to handle such kind of situations. So best is to not be in one. So I will not tell him how I feel.<br><br>Situation Two if we become a couple. Breaks off in a few years after. How do we still go out and have fun with the group of friends? Please remember, same group of friends. Hard? I do not only care about this group of friends, but I also know his sister. We go for manicures/pedicures and salons and we even travel together to Bangkok before. We are very close, his family knows me, but my family does not know him that well sad to say.<br><br>Even so close to his sister, 25 this year 2007. I do not tell her about my feelings of her brother. They have a younger brother of 14 but I seldom see him. I know his sister and him are very close, just like friends. They talk about everything, when no one to go shopping, he will accompany her. He will be like the boyfriend, help to carry bag and put arms around the sister. That is very close am I correct?<br><br>So I cannot tell the sister also. I met 3 close friends earlier on who known about my feelings of this guy. They say I am stupid to encourage him, I am stupid to suffer all these, I am stupid to even do so much for him.<br><br>Now I really do not know where to head. And by the way, he is same as me, 21 this year 2007.</div>

I stopped crying already but I feeling unesay the whole day. I have no idea what monster I will become. Every day I wake up feeling crappish.<br><br>Last time I wake up normal, because he was still single and stupid me Thought that it will keep remain like this until the day I am brave enough to say out my feelings Or maybe even do not need me to, I hope he feels for me one day and he be the one confessing.<br><br>It is all my wishful thinking.

I tell you.<br><br>Firstly Please understand he is not a very romantic kind of guy. He will dies if his guy friends are not around. Seems boring. He is crazy over games, during free time will always drive friends go to LAN shop and do Counterstrike the wholeday.

All will be very awkward to be together anymore. Because I am very surely that they will be informed of this "gossip". I do not know how to handle such kind of situations. So best is to not be in one. So I will not tell him how I feel.<br><br>Situation Two if we become a couple. Breaks off in a few years after. How do we still go out and have fun with the group of friends? Please remember, same group of friends. Hard? I do not only care about this group of friends, but I also know his sister. We go for manicures/pedicures and salons and we even travel together to Bangkok before. We are very close, his family knows me, but my family does not know him that well sad to say.<br><br>Even so close to his sister, 25 this year 2007. I do not tell her about my feelings of her brother. They have a younger brother of 14 but I seldom see him. I know his sister and him are very close, just like friends. They talk about everything, when no one to go shopping, he will accompany her. He will be like the boyfriend, help to carry bag and put arms around the sister. That is very close am I correct?<br><br>So I cannot tell the sister also. I met 3 close friends earlier on who known about my feelings of this guy. They say I am stupid to encourage him, I am stupid to suffer all these, I am stupid to even do so much for him.<br><br>Now I really do not know where to head. And by the way, he is same as me, 21 this year 2007. </div></blockquote>In a hypothetically perfect scenario, your confession would work out and this, in turn, leads to a blissful marriage.<br><br>Now, I can't add much more to the points not already discussed here. With the greatest respect, you just might not see the bigger picture at your age. For a start, many friends you make are just there for a phase in your life - just because you have been close with this group for the last couple of years does not in any way indicate you'd still keep in contact with them when you're 70.<br><br>What some have suggested in terms of you confessing would at least give you a chance (however futile is another matter and may not necessarily be an accurate reflection of his thoughts about you anyway since you don't really know what he thinks) is logical in the sense of looking at the bigger picture. Now, picture the ideal scenario and contrast that with the other possibility of a rejection that leads to awkwardness in the group and you effectively have to do an thorough evaluation as to whether a potentially risky action in the short-term is worth more than a long-term bliss. At your age, peer acceptance may mean an awful lot to you and it may be the single biggest factor in determining your course of action.<br><br>Perhaps, just let me shed some light on the long-term ramifications which you may wish to consider besides thinking exclusively in the short-haul. Let's assume you didn't confess and you actually stop socialising with the same group (include that guy in your assessment) 20 years from now. Would you actually look back and wonder what might have been had you been more proactive? For many, even a formal rejection is a proper closure (after all, there is a reason why most job and college applications yield an outcome, right?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> ) to move on and is something for them to look back on in the distant future that they had at least tried and not live to look back on things that might have been. In the event that, through some other circumstances, you actually find out your destiny might actually have been very different had you been more proactive, would you be able to live with that and be at ease with yourself? In that regard, you would then be deciding on whether a lifetime's regret is actually worth a momentary awkwardness (which may not even materialise).<br><br>The point here is do you like him enough to actually want to settle on the knowledge that you will never know what he really thinks just so that you do not feel awkward in the company of a group of friends which may not necessarily be everlasting? If it's just an infatuation, then it might not be that viable and prudent for you to express your interest in him. However, if you're convinced it's love you're talking about that would last a long time, you might just wish to reconsider the fact that the risk you're taking by not confessing could actually be worse than if you were to confess - especially if you looked at the bigger picture in the long term.<br><br>Good luck whatever you decide to do...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>it's easy for me to say all this because i haven't been through any love relationship at all. but i believe time will heal... get yourself busy with other stuff, get him out of your mind. i know it's so hard, your heart hurts like crazy, but if you allow yourself to carry on thinking about him, it'll only hurt you more and he may not even know about it. i'm sure you know all this, and i'm saying this just to remind you that you can control yourself and be strong. it's just a matter of time that things will be better. just let life flow normally, do the things you normally do. be happy. the world won't end even if you can't have him. there are better guys out there. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> take care my dear!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Oh no.<br><br>I posted last night but do not know why it is not up.<br>Sorry for not updating.<br><br>First thing first Happy 2008 to everyone hope nice things happenes to all. "Bad go, Good come" Haha.<br><br>Okay things between me and him remains normal he calls me as frequently we talked as normally only that we have one extra new topic and that is her. He telles me it is hard for him to not think of her. I said do not be bothered by it it is okay just do not stress yourself to NOT KEEP THINKING of her because if you do that, then you ARE thinking of her. Confusing?<br><br>I spent my New Year Eve with him and 4 Other friends.<br><br>There were moments left only just me and him when the others went to get something or just not there. It was my first time meeting him for dinner after I knew he is crazy for that girl.<br><br>Do not know why it was super damn hard to speak to him normally (the phone calls I say above were DAYS AFTER we met on New Year Eve).<br><br>I had to think in my mind what topic to discuss and things. I do not dare to look into his eyes. I am very afraid of him later looking into mine and then some how sees through me then knows that I am so affected by this girl's presense, I am dead because he will feel super disgusted by me and all my lies for these years.<br><br>I am afraid to speak as much as I always do when with him because I am very afraid that I will say the wrong things or accidentally say out how I feel and then again he find me weird and see the change in me.<br><br>Over the phone I askes him all that in my heart I wishs to know. Questions like if she never dance with him will he still love her so much, His reply was that when at first sight of seeing the girl only He is very much attracted to her and He think that no matter dance or no dance He is still crazy over her.<br><br>He telles me that they talk online once in a while and when he sees her coming online he do not know how to start talking and panickes. I told him that it is very easy to talk to girl I teach him go Youtube find some stupid or funny videos, or find funny pictures or food blogs or human blogs (examples da*nya*g or x*axi*e) or copyandpaste a few jokes from funny sites or just simple send her a song and ask her for comments like how she think of those that he showes her.<br><br>I met 3 friends for supper just now. They sort of scolded me for being stupid. They askes me why am I being stupid why am I still helping him and being here for him? Stupid to the point I can even encourage him how to approach her.<br><br>But everyone please understand, in his mind I am only his best friend, If I do not help him, I am selfish as a friend. But when I help him, my heart feels terrible. It is helping the guy I like, to be together with the girl he likes. Am I doing the wrong move? I thought all it matters is for him to be happy? Yes I think he is happy also.<br><br>If I do not be here for him and run far far away he will think why I acting cold and weird? He went clubbing again few days ago and I think she was there too.<br><br>Everyone again understand I am not trying to be or act noble If there is a choice I rather I run far away from him and her. I find it so painful to see him these days. Everytime I see him near me I just wish to go up and give a hug then may the time freezes. But I know it will never happen. I will not even have the courage to try.<br><br>Back to the noble part.<br><br>There is no choice for me to choose. As a friend I am to help him. I cannot possibly ask him to keep quiet and not askes me questions or telles me things about the girl am I correct? Some more I am only his friend in his mind. He do not even know that Inside me I have been carrying this torch for years! He is not to know of it either.<br><br>I wish them being happy and hopefully he can get her he seems really keenes on her. Oh He even told me before even she has a steady but he is okay with it because he is willing to wait for her to become single then start his pursuit. Haha.<br><br>He calles me yesterday noon and we talked many things I feel so different now because I know his heart is full of her and no space for me. Does any one can describe this feeling for me? The feeling of him telling me how much he love her and inside me I also wish to tell him how much I love him but I cannot I only can listen to him speak. It is making me feeling terrible. Now I understand what people always say about the pain.<br><br>Help.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>So I be like this-- a friend helping him to get his girl, all the way?

            <div class='col-md body'>So many days before I sleep at night (even before he met the girl)<br><br>I wish under my window at the sky that next morning he will suddenly be realising all that I do for him. The flowers I got for him, the foods I always pack for him, the birthday I plan for him, the cookies I baked for him, the things I always buy him when I go overseas, the happy times me him and his sister spent driving around Singapore at night when I moved here, the many times we talk on the phone until late late, and the times I look into his eyes I wish he can tell.<br><br>The list is very long. But in short, every night before I sleep, I tell myself next day Is a new day and I will be happy because it means another hope for him to realise all that I do for him and it means I still have a small little chance to be with him, to love him more.<br><br>Many "tomorrows" were gone and stupid me still wish like that. I am thinking maybe 5 years after today, I will look back and laugh. Laugh for being so stupid, Laugh for being blind. I do not have any routes to take for a move on now.<br><br>If I were to let go, the things I do for 4 years are wasted, I am okay. It is that I am not willing to tell him how I feel for the things I mentioned in earlier posts, and Do I really have to leave him without realising all that I do for him, is my love for him, not the "friend" part in me for him?<br><br>I picture the things we can do when we will be together everyday. I will buy him breakfast without him knowing on holidays. I will hug him every chance I get. I will look at him in the eyes and tell him finally you are mine. I will hold his hand and tell myself he is beside me and he is real. I will tug his shirt and hide behind him when I am scared. I will kiss him when I want his attention. I will bring his parents out for dinners. I will invite him over my place to spend special occasions. I will plan itineraries for 2 weeks holidays in Europe. I will burn his favourite songs on a CD so he can listen when driving to work thinking of me. I will put a packet of tissue in his pants because he is messy when he eats and he always forgets to bring tissue. I will help him to quit smoking.<br><br>Maybe the above all too idealistic things. All too good to be true. All hard to achieve, but one thing for sure, I will and I can definitely love him more than anybody else...<br><br>How I wish he surfs sgf. Sorry he does not. Sigh.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>He called me earlier on<br><br>But I was bathing and so I did not see so obviously I cannot answer his call.<br><br>I called back and he just said Nothing much already bye. This is not the first time that it happens. He is always like this. When He calles and I do not answer then I call back he will always say nothing. I wish to know what is it that he is looking me for but am afraid if I probe further he will think that I am very irritating.<br><br>Is this a sign that he could be taking me for granted?<br><br>Suddenly these days after all that happened (him meeting the girl) I suddenly do feel very tired and unappreciated.<br><br>In short I feel like giving up... yes, without even trying.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Yunhaier:</div><div class="quote_body">I am going to explain the concept of femme passiveness: most women don't end up with the man they want, because they would rather wait, like most femme psyche, for the man they want to express or initiative their love to. And if this chap doesn't do a thing, the chance is gone - usually forever.<br><br>Ironically, these women later end up with man whom initiative/chase them, but it isn't the man that they want. They somehow just accepted them - for some reason or another.<br></div></blockquote>This is so true.<br>For me is always this case.<br>I am the passive kind.  hai.</div>
