I guess if you are still interested in her, you would need to find means and way to create "accidental" meetings with her. Meanwhile, dun SMS or call her liao, will degrade your image further.<br><br>But I dun know why you took such a long time to take action. Should have started SMSing her once you got the HP no. so that she have a impression of giving you her number. Anyway, what's done is done.

However if she likes you, then its no problem.<br><br>Or, you can just be like me, let the depression become routine, it makes you stronger that way too, but is unhealthy.<br><br>I don't think if girls do that it means "hate" as in "SAURON kind of hatred" or even my hatred when I am angry... but I think its more irritation, like when my mum keeps bugging me about stuff when I want to be left on my own, I think its most likely irration that actual "hatred". So I suppose you should just back-off and wait for the opportune moment.<br></div>
