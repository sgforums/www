              <p>I know it sounds stupid, but please don't laught at me.</p>
              <p>He is a married Singaporean. At first I didn't pay any
              attention to him, but he tried to contact with me whenever he
              could.  He is extremely smart and very good at analyse other
              people's personality, I feel so happy and relaxed when I'm with
              him, he could find out what is in my mind even
              when I didn't say anything. so...I fell in love with him...I'm
              such a fool.</p>
              <p>Though I loved him very much I still refused to be his so called
              "girlfriend", I don't wanna be anybody's mistress. He tried so hard
              to persuade me to have sex with him, but he just couldn't get it
              from me, for one reason is that he is married, and the other most
              important reason is I'm a virgin, I'm not gonna give my very first
              time to a married man who doesn't love me at all. He even asked me
              to find a boyfriend then have sex with him. In the end, he became
              so angry that he said so many dirty words to me, and all those
              dirty sex fantasy he had...</p>
              <p>But that is not the worst thing, the "best part" is I eventually
              found out he is also chasing after a lot of girls, almost every
              woman he has met, no matter how old is she or whether she is good
              looking or not. and he actually do got what he want in most cases,
              he even had sex with someone I have worked with....That's really
              disgusting! , I feel like I had swallowed a fly. He is the kind of
              person who wants to get as much girls as he could, it likes a game
              to him.</p>
              <p>ALL THE THINGS HE HAD DONE, ALL THOSE THINGS HE SAID ARE FAKE,
              he is not the one who I thought he is. And I have been acting like
              a fool all the time.</p>
              <p>He said I'm too serious, it's very normal to just have sex with
              anyone you want, no need to think too much morality, right or wrong
              stuffs. But what I'm looking for is ture love, am I wrong? Or this
              is culture conflict? I mean do most Singaporean have the same
              thought as him?</p>

              <p>I know it sounds stupid, but please don't laught at me.</p>
              <p>He is a married Singaporean. At first I didn't pay any attention to him, but he tried to contact with me whenever he could.  He is extremely smart and very good at analyse other people's personality, I feel so happy and relaxed when I'm with him, he could find out what is in my mind even when I didn't say anything. so...I fell in love with him...I'm such a fool.</p>
              <p>Though I loved him very much I still refused to be his so called "girlfriend", I don't wanna be anybody's mistress. He tried so hard to persuade me to have sex with him, but he just couldn't get it from me, for one reason is that he is married, and the other most important reason is I'm a virgin, I'm not gonna give my very first time to a married man who doesn't love me at all. He even asked me to find a boyfriend then have sex with him. In the end, he became so angry that he said so many dirty words to me, and all those dirty sex fantasy he had...</p>
              <p>But that is not the worst thing, the "best part" is I eventually found out he is also chasing after a lot of girls, almost every woman he has met, no matter how old is she or whether she is good looking or not. and he actually do got what he want in most cases, he even had sex with someone I have worked with....That's really disgusting! , I feel like I had swallowed a fly.

              Ts,
              U are not in love with him but rather projecting ideas, images of love that u carry in your head and he coming along has made it real.
               Hence, it is an illusion and it will sooner than u know burst!
              His flirting ways is unhealthy not for others but mostly for himself - he lacks love, lacks self-respect. His love is more of an ego trip and nothing to with love.
              As long as it is unknown, unacknolwedged any relationship (???) is bound to be that of using another to fulfil oneself. In the short term, it will stay but in the long term only fear,anxiety and misery for both parties.
              Whatever he is is his choice, u are responsible what u are and feel. That is something no one can teach excepting pain which is a good teacher. The wise one observes, unlearns and moves along and yet grows.
              
              The unwise blames, escapes and only find onself repeating the same ... cos there is no unlearning excepting that of .... which comes painfully.
              
              One has to be wary of those who purport to love but only exploit and call it love
