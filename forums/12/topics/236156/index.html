            <div class='col-md body'>Okay, before I get shot down/flamed/bitten by those whom know me, I have asked for the consent of my Rainee dear  to post this for views and suggestions. (Since both of us are forumities it will be good for her to agree first :3 )<br><br>Yesterday dear she highlighted to me a growing problem which both of us think that  it must be addressed fast before it worsens into an argument. The problem stems from me still outside with my friends past the time we are supposed to communicate over the phone. (10:30pm)<br><br>A little bit of our background. Me and Rainee are having a LDR (I'm in Singapore and she is from JB) and we can only meet up one day a week (Sunday). Thus in order to maintain this relationship it will be good to communicate frequently and so we set a time to call each other everyday. Up till recently there's some change in the routine.<br><br>I have many circles of friends... online-gaming friends (who will meet up every now and then for get-togethers), designer friends (ex-classmates/colleagues), RT/army khakis, ex-arcade khakis (whom become my good friends now even though we stopped going to gaming arcades), university coursemates, church group friends, fellow SGforumities etc etc. Quite often I will go out with my friends for a get-together as we don't have much time for catching up (they have their own commitments too) and most of the time we will be staying out till midnight. (Most of the time have to meet up after 9-10pm as some friends are in sales-line, have late knock-off hours and designer friends OT most of the time) Dear she is pretty ok if it's only once every now and then but I can sense that she is unhappy when I have to meet up with different groups of friends over a 2-3day period consec. From what she told me is that she kept up her end of the compromise of trying hard not to call/sms/msn me in the day and in the end seeing the conversation last only 5-10mins at night because I need to go back to my friends.<br><br>Anyone has suggestions and views about this matter?</div>

And I will feel like it is left hanging...cos 5 to 10 mins is not enuff for me to say what I want to say.<br><br>I dunno if it is unreasonable for me to ask for this...cos already in the daytime we agree to not call/sms/msn each other...i agree to this becos I know dear got a lot of things to do also at home...so I let him have his private time during the afternoon and early evening until I reach home...</div>

Trust each other and patiently waiting. Knowing some "late" appointments, in some way, test you two's resolve in your relationships. Its like moulding your relationship and forging it to be stronger.
