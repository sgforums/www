And hor $200 can buy many things and be used for many good purposes. However when it comes to love between two persons, what is the value of $$$ compared to that? Some day when you dating a woman you love, you will be more than willing to splurge a little just to see her smile and the warmth in your heart. THAT... is priceless. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

FYI this is my first relationship and like Rainee, I really want this to last till marriage. One of the things we decided is to be truthful to each other, anything that we find is a problem we will say it out and try to solve it without any argument. Quarrels only worsens the situation and in the end resolve nothing but hurt each other even more.<br>This is why I asked my dear and post this thread on the forums, sometimes it's good to have other opinions other than our own as most of the time, own opinions are normally mixed with reasonings that are advantageous to ownself.</div>
