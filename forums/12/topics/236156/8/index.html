(Since both of us are forumities it will be good for her to agree first :3 )<br><br>Yesterday dear she highlighted to me a growing problem which both of us think that  it must be addressed fast before it worsens into an argument. The problem stems from me still outside with my friends past the time we are supposed to communicate over the phone. (10:30pm)<br><br>A little bit of our background. Me and Rainee are having a LDR (I'm in Singapore and she is from JB) and we can only meet up one day a week (Sunday). Thus in order to maintain this relationship it will be good to communicate frequently and so we set a time to call each other everyday. Up till recently there's some change in the routine.<br><br>I have many circles of friends... online-gaming friends (who will meet up every now and then for get-togethers), designer friends (ex-classmates/colleagues), RT/army khakis, ex-arcade khakis (whom become my good friends now even though we stopped going to gaming arcades), university coursemates, church group friends, fellow SGforumities etc etc. Quite often I will go out with my friends for a get-together as we don't have much time for catching up (they have their own commitments too) and most of the time we will be staying out till midnight. (Most of the time have to meet up after 9-10pm as some friends are in sales-line, have late knock-off hours and designer friends OT most of the time) Dear she is pretty ok if it's only once every now and then but I can sense that she is unhappy when I have to meet up with different groups of friends over a 2-3day period consec. From what she told me is that she kept up her end of the compromise of trying hard not to call/sms/msn me in the day and in the end seeing the conversation last only 5-10mins at night because I need to go back to my friends.<br><br>Anyone has suggestions and views about this matter? </div></blockquote>humm okie same situation between u and rainee and my ex &amp; I (except mine was sg-aus cannot even meet <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> )<br><br>neko, my advise is to keep your promise to set aside time for your gal. i'm not saying 1hr, 2hr, 3hr conversation. just spend 20mins-30mins to catch up on your daily ongoings and stuff. i'm sure rainee feels unimportant because you did not keep your end of the promise. LDR is hard to maintain so extra effort has to be put in if you want it to last.<br><br>Rainee, maybe you can try to go out with friends and not wait at home for Neko to call. Time flies when you are having fun and Neko might become the one that gets worried why you din call. (okie evil idea i know but it works okie). Cut him a bit of slack once in a while.
