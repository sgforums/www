(Since both of us are forumities it will be good for her to agree first :3 )<br><br>Yesterday dear she highlighted to me a growing problem which both of us think that  it must be addressed fast before it worsens into an argument. The problem stems from me still outside with my friends past the time we are supposed to communicate over the phone. (10:30pm)<br><br>A little bit of our background. Me and Rainee are having a LDR (I'm in Singapore and she is from JB) and we can only meet up one day a week (Sunday). Thus in order to maintain this relationship it will be good to communicate frequently and so we set a time to call each other everyday. Up till recently there's some change in the routine.<br><br>I have many circles of friends... online-gaming friends (who will meet up every now and then for get-togethers), designer friends (ex-classmates/colleagues), RT/army khakis, ex-arcade khakis (whom become my good friends now even though we stopped going to gaming arcades), university coursemates, church group friends, fellow SGforumities etc etc. Quite often I will go out with my friends for a get-together as we don't have much time for catching up (they have their own commitments too) and most of the time we will be staying out till midnight. (Most of the time have to meet up after 9-10pm as some friends are in sales-line, have late knock-off hours and designer friends OT most of the time) Dear she is pretty ok if it's only once every now and then but I can sense that she is unhappy when I have to meet up with different groups of friends over a 2-3day period consec. From what she told me is that she kept up her end of the compromise of trying hard not to call/sms/msn me in the day and in the end seeing the conversation last only 5-10mins at night because I need to go back to my friends.<br><br>Anyone has suggestions and views about this matter? </div></blockquote>I think so long as it's not happening so very often, it should be ok to an extent?<br><br>Don't call just for the sake of calling... If a 5-10mins phone call can feel very artificial or uncomfortable, make it a point to call again (eg. 3 days later ) when you're supposing free... Sometimes absence can make the heart fond? Though it's good effort for both parties to keep up with the practice, but have to understand that sometimes the unexpect can make each other miss phone calls for days too..? It's always better if you can learn to cope with such simple 'void' and learn to compromise with each other....?</div>
