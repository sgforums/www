I haven't fully recover though it had been awhile, there is just this emotional scar that won't go away.<br><br>Maybe you should i dentify the root of the problem. Is it because of your past? Is it because of certain things that didn't happen to you but affected you indirectly? Or is it because of your partner?<br><br>My bf is very good with girls and it caused alot of insecurities in the early stages of our relationship. But we talked and he had learn to draw the line.

Actually security  denotes mental emotional security than the physical presence.<br><br>How can we define insecurity feeling? Or on what do you depend for your sense of security? The simplest answer is that if you feel confident enough, if you are at peace with yourself you have all the rights to feel secure.<br><br>Just like one plus one equals two, for joining hands with your lover you should have doubled confident, doubled peace of mind and of course doubled feeling of security. It is common among lovers that they feel insecurity in the relationship. There could be so many reasons behind the feeling of insecurity. Negative self images, attitudes towards life, unable to know and understand your lover, disability to cop up with changing life situations, lack of trust etc... can bring the feeling of insecurity in you.</div>
