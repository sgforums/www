              <p>there's this gal tht i like and i'm sure she knows my feelings for her.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>recently i went jogging with her and everything went fine but when i ask her for another jogging session next week, she says no and prefers to jog alone.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>this is jus one of the few instances tht makes me confused.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'm really not sure what she feels abt me and really wanna give up liao but i really like her a lot and really can't tell myself to give up and move on.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i know there are times when the gal jus wanna test whether the guy and there r times the gal is trying to hint to the person tht she's not interested. I'm sure there's a line to be drawn to tell the difference but how?</p>

              <p>so some hog their reservse while waiting for the better deal to turn up..... as the expiry date draw nearer...... most just settle for wat is availble....</p>

              <p>Are you suffering from confusion or self denial?</p>
              <p>Isnt it all too plain that she is not interested in you?</p>
              <p>Sorry to be sounding harsh, but reality are often harsh, but a truth you must accept and move on in life.</p>
              <p>She is being very kind in letting you know in advance that she is not keen in you rather than to lead you on with false hopes.</p>
              <p>By all means, try to woo her friendship. Sometimes persistance will win, but in reality, you dun need to force your suit upon anyone else. There are plenty of others that are ready to become your friends if you just open your eyes and open your heart to them.</p>
              <p>Cheers, in whatever choice you make.</p>
