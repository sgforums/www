Not all. Some relatives I mean. Just make sure both of you can handle the gossiping.<br><br>I would say it was easier for me because my parents like him very much so no problems. I just had to handle the insensitive remarks from my relatives.

Some people seem to think it's all about the looks, and even if so, that no indian girl has "the looks." I suggest broadening your minds a little.<br><br>Inter-racial marriages are possible and can be successful. I think if you marry a Muslim guy/girl you would have to convert to Islam too.</div>

I admit first, I love curvacious girls. N of coz Indian girls most of the time win hands down. Some of them are also really beautiful and attractive. They are simply great. To those narrow minded guys, you should really date one man, it'll open your eyes, mind and erhem...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Anyway back to the thread, There's another option actually. The muslim person can renounce his/her faith. This is possible and allowed in singapore by law. So that's a consideration.

First of all, if the relationship play play who cares lah, but if marriage is concerned, the guy will have to convert to Muslim.
