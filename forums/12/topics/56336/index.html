Are you a local?<br><br>As for your option... I'll suggest SPLIT the LOSS if you can. Propose to your friend and see what's his reaction? Tell him you don't mind if he's broke now and you'll give him time. Ask him when can he return the money.<br><br>Meanwhile.... Not meaning anything in particular... But just stay wary of him... He MAY or may not have conned you... But once bitten, should know how to make the necessary adjustments to protect yourself.....?</div>
