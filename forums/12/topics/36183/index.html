I am a guy and I know quite a few lesbians and they made good friends, which is more important to me than their sexual orientation - because her preference doesn't concern me. As long as she is a good friend, that's good enough.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Your situations is unique and because it is unique - the best of both world option is not availble for you - I am pretty sure you have to lose either one of them regardless of whom you chose. My suggestion is that - before the plans is out, just keep her in the dark first. The impact of the blow will still be the same regardless of when you tell her, just that whether is the timing worth its blow anot.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>The best buy would be few weeks before you go overseas to settle with your stead - your blunt honesty will destroy this friendship, but at least you already sure that you will go over to States with your stead. But if you choose to tell her now, you will ruin the friendship and in the future, what if you and your stead not together liao (example! relax), then you will lose both side, right? Logical? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>As for parents - I doubt they will be able to take the blow. A criticial quarreling will bound to take place and probably they may disown you or similiar (taking into consideration that your partners are the older generation, which means they wouldn't be that generous to accept that)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>Basically, my advice would be this: Is getting married that important? I mean is that cert that important to have? Remember, if you have to go States to get married and because of that cert - you will probably lose everything you have here. My advice is continue life as it is here - your relationship is still going right? Marriage cert is only a piece of paper. Are you going to exchange that piece of paper for everything else?<br><br>Remember, never make hasty decisions. Your every move will have drastic effect around you.<br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm not too sure how you can do anything.. I would think that friendship would be unconditional... if she really values you as a friend, she would accept you as you are.<br><br>But that's me.  I would not want people to judge me so I will not judge people.. especially friends.  If they are gay/bi/straight or whatever, they are still my friends...<br><br>Off (or maybe on) topic, but Norman Mailer did say (not to sure if he was joking or not) "There is probably no sensitive heterosexual alive who is not preoccupied with his latent homosexuality."<br><br>On that, maybe your best friend is not handling the latency well so much so that there is a violent denial?  But then, it's never a good idea to confront anyone about this type of things (especially denial)... usually it will blow up disastrously as the defensive mechanism kicks in and brains stop working <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Whatever the case is, I do hope you and your partner find lasting happiness <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> the world is in too short supply of that, so wherever it is found, it's wonderful <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> good luck <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

(fixed mentality) that is of course.... unless ur parents are very open-minded... then it's ok loh....<br><br>parents side...i'm not really sure on how u shld go abt handling it... but i suppose, as long as u break the news slowly and steadily... like the case for ur fren, there might be some hope....</div>
