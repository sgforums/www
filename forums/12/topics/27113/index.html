            <div class='col-md body'>This past weekend I have also just found out my boyfriend of 1 year is gay. I am having a terrible time dealing with this. Not only do I love him very much and we talked about getting married I am pregnant and due to have his child in June. I have been looking for a support group in my area to help me deal with this and come to terms with it as I am totally going through the denial thing. I just can't believe that someone I love and loves me in return is gay. I have found on a few webpages that even tho a man is gay he may still want to have a girlfriend. This is not to cover up is sexual preference by because he can be physically attracted to women but have a preference to be with men. I am told it is common for a gay man to have very real and true feelings for a women and want to be with that women forever and that although he prefers men he may never be with a man in that way. This is helping me somewhat as my boyfriend tells me he doesn't want to be with anyone else and does truely love me and doesn't want to loose me because of this. I love him with all my heart and because of this I want to be there for him no matter how hurt and used and betrayed I feel. I keep trying to remind myself that this can't be easy for him either. Try to be strong for your boyfriend and in time I'm sure we will get through this and be better people for it, and if all else fails we will have one of the best friends anyone can ask for.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by SparkleOne:</div><div class="quote_body">This past weekend I have also just found out my boyfriend of 1 year is gay. I am having a terrible time dealing with this. Not only do I love him very much and we talked about getting married I am pregnant and due to have his child in June. I have been looking for a support group in my area to help me deal with this and come to terms with it as I am totally going through the denial thing. I just can't believe that someone I love and loves me in return is gay. I have found on a few webpages that even tho a man is gay he may still want to have a girlfriend. This is not to cover up is sexual preference by because he can be physically attracted to women but have a preference to be with men. I am told it is common for a gay man to have very real and true feelings for a women and want to be with that women forever and that although he prefers men he may never be with a man in that way. This is helping me somewhat as my boyfriend tells me he doesn't want to be with anyone else and does truely love me and doesn't want to loose me because of this. I love him with all my heart and because of this I want to be there for him no matter how hurt and used and betrayed I feel. I keep trying to remind myself that this can't be easy for him either. Try to be strong for your boyfriend and in time I'm sure we will get through this and be better people for it, and if all else fails we will have one of the best friends anyone can ask for. </div></blockquote>hi, sorry to hear that.. but i must say that ure really strong... so good that u are willing to stand by him.....he must be very happy and good also to derserve you as his gf...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have accepted him. He truely loves me and I truely love him. He said he has changed and has made the choice to live in the normal life. I believe nothing is impossible in this world. I gave him a chance to prove himself and the time will tell. Moreover, no one is perfect and will not make mistake in life. I asked him not to look into the past and just move forward. I won't bother about his past now because he also don't bother about my past.
