I won't bother about his past now because he also don't bother about my past.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by SparkleOne:</div><div class="quote_body">This past weekend I have also just found out my boyfriend of 1 year is gay. I am having a terrible time dealing with this. Not only do I love him very much and we talked about getting married I am pregnant and due to have his child in June. I have been looking for a support group in my area to help me deal with this and come to terms with it as I am totally going through the denial thing. I just can't believe that someone I love and loves me in return is gay. I have found on a few webpages that even tho a man is gay he may still want to have a girlfriend. This is not to cover up is sexual preference by because he can be physically attracted to women but have a preference to be with men. I am told it is common for a gay man to have very real and true feelings for a women and want to be with that women forever and that although he prefers men he may never be with a man in that way. This is helping me somewhat as my boyfriend tells me he doesn't want to be with anyone else and does truely love me and doesn't want to loose me because of this. I love him with all my heart and because of this I want to be there for him no matter how hurt and used and betrayed I feel. I keep trying to remind myself that this can't be easy for him either. Try to be strong for your boyfriend and in time I'm sure we will get through this and be better people for it, and if all else fails we will have one of the best friends anyone can ask for. </div></blockquote>Don't be too hung up on your boyfriend's sexual past.  Don't be too quick to label him 'gay' too.  What matters is whether he loves you now and whether he is willing to be there for you.  I think people go through different stages where they sometimes may experiment with their sexual preferences.  I think we must distinguish between people who have had gay experiences and those who are exclusively homosexual.  By the sounds of it, your boyfriend and that of the original writer may be people who may have experimented  with homosexual relationships in the past, but that does not make either of them gay.  What is important is what he is to you now.  If he is capable of loving you fully and is willing to be exclusive to you, then let it be a matter of "all's well that ends well".</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I wish that I could say this was only in his past. I have always none he was bi-sexual and did like men but now he is choosing to only persue men. Which mean I'm kinda on the outs. He tells me he still loves me and wants to be with me but doesn't think that it is fair of him to ask me because of his intense desire to be with members of the same sex. I will still be there to support him through this, and he has admitted that he is still a little confused on his sexuality. I will be there for him while he attempts to find himself. He tells me that he is not with anyone else and I believe him. I don't think that this is something he can just jump right into. I will be there for him to see him through this hard time he has helped to put us in. Take care and congrats on working it out with your bf...all the best.</div>

I am always against the idea of being pregnant before marriage, no matter what age group you are in. Else, it will lose it's meaning on the wedding day itself, wouldn't it?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
