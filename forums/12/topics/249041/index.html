            <div class='col-md body'>I'm having a big problem<br><br>Last year when I was in first semester of poly year 1, I was quite close to a group of 3 other people. We met when we sat together in class. Just like any group of friends.<br><br>But came 2nd semester, where my school shifted furniture around and my table got separated from them. Mine was near the outside, theirs were inside. At first I thought nothing of it, thinking sitting outside would be better, as it is less crammed.<br><br>But, things turned unexpectedly. We still met for lunch, walked out of school together, but there was a period when my computer was spoilt (sent for repairs) and so I had to drop by the library after school to open my emails and stuff. So I'll say bye to them when we walk pass the library.<br><br>Slowly, I found more and more difficult to 'click' with them, and slowly slowly I found myself drifting away. Like for example, I'll initiate to join them for lunch, and we went to the toilet. When I came out, they are already walking away without waiting for me. Not one but a few times, as if I'm some kind of stranger. I'm no longer told some 'inner circle' stuff, or the 'gossip'. They discuss stuff among themselves. And I begun to feel outcasted.<br><br>During small group work, they'll group together and when I said I wanted to join, they'll say group is full (not fiercely) or "join others lah, too big group liao". As if I'm a stranger.<br><br>Finally came our 3 months vacation, which I chatted with some of them on MSN, and everything seemed 'normal'. But now that school had reopened, I'm facing the same problem. Same problem of being 'ignored' in conversations, cannot click anymore, and excluded from group. In this group some people came in, and 2 transferred out. I'm still the outcast. As if I'm someone they hardly know.<br><br>I'm closer to my next door class friends, whom I hardly meet during normal lesson time then my own classmates.<br><br>Could someone advise? I don't want to lose any friends. Feeling very sad now.</div>

Yes, it's them.<br><br>Seriously though up till now I'm still wondering what happened. Just because I sit away from them and we slowly drift apart? Or is it that htey 'forgot' my personality and character? I'm most at ease and myself with people close to me. If the person is "cold" (in the softer sense of the word) somehow, I'll feel intimidated more or less.<br><br>Few months ago I was "reunited" with a primary sch friend from 12 years ago (lost contact for 12 years) on Friendster and we can still chat very well. I've maintained contact with friends from work and sec sch with no problems, even thought we rarely chat, I still SMS them once in a while, and when we meet up we can still chat normally.<br><br>I'm still acting normal, albiet 'forcing' a bit (no pun intended). Still trying to joke with them and stuff, but just suddenly can't fit in.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>

My group is next door, and due to schedule differences our classes don't usually meet in lesson time. Only during tutorials or at break / after sch. Yet when I ask them for lunch, they are always open.<br><br>Last year we had a study trip to Indonesia, and I practically spent all the time with my next door group even expanding my social circle over there, since teaching by classes and class based activities were not part of the trip, and we went as one big group, the whole School (individual School in the poly). As for my 'former group', only 1 of them went for the trip.<br><br>Now my 'former group' are very close to each other. I've overheard them going out to play or to eat and I was like, am I kena outcasted or something? They never tell me stuff now, unlike last time. Really miss the good old times.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Redstone,<br><br>I understand at your age getting attention and feeling being wanted/needed/included is important and it is a normal process of your growing up. But you have to understand too that friends come and go.<br><br>People, environment, things around you changes all the time. So just go with the flow. Of course, you may at first not find it to your liking but give it time. Who knows? It might just grown on you. Important thing is feel good about yourself. Life is not just about sticking to the same old group of friends/things/environment. Widen your circle by getting to know more people. Get yourself equip with more knowledgeable stuffs. Learn to listen to others as well. Don't just think of the "I" all the time. Not that I'm saying you are. But hey, the world won't end cos' you weren't included in certain groups anymore.<br><br>So, go out there and enjoy your life. Tomorrow when you wake up it will be another brand new beautiful day. Good luck <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
