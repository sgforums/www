Like 'rich' people will have seemingly bigger social circle. Let's say that rich guy one day isn't rich anymore? What will happen?<br><br>(No offense here) but I've seen some ladies sticking to guys cos of the guy's material possessions (eg motorbike, car, money, etc). Or educational qualifications. I've been thru NA and ITE before, seen lots of things.<br><br>I'll rather have a few close friends than many acquaintances.</div>
