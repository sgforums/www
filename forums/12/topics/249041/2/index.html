            <div class='col-md body'>Do u have friends that u can depend on in the other class? Is it common for people to transfer over to other class?<br><br>Do u still want to foster stronger relationships with ur old friends ? If u want to patch up with them, then u have to put in some efforts to make it work but then if people still treat u coldly. Then there is a limit. Walk away BUT without regret as u have did ur best. This thing can't be forced.<br><br>MmM I think u take this thing too seriously. Look around, there are many potential friends in ur class and outside ur class! U r not friendless as u have friends outside ur class. You have friends. I can understand, probably u feel scared, worried and probably "what wrong with me, why they don't want me as closer friend". Probably feeling lonely and bored in ur class? but hey, since they chat with u in msn and even joined u for lunch mean that they already accept u leh. U r not outcasted.<br><br>Probably frequency isn't there. Some people are like that one, u shouldn't force urself onto them. Find ur own niche and foster strong relationships with them. Though you can still be normal friend with this group of people.<br><br>MmM firstly i think u need to know how to love urself; wholly and unconditionaly accept urself as who u r. ( ok im just guessing here but probably u don't have this problem <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> ) You do not need this group of friends to ascertain ur value.<br><br>Join other cca, pursue ur passion and learn new things. Make new. like-minded friends! Look LIFE at a bigger perspective. NOW is only a temporary phase in life where u will be learning to grow up.<br><br>U want more friends? Give sincere care and concern for the people around u; without much expectation of returns. People will start to notice and even befriending u.<br><br>When ur heart is kind and full of friendliness, even when u r alone, u will not feel lonely at all.<br><br>Yeah i hate to lose friends but then..... somethings can't be helped too....<br><br></div>

We met when we sat together in class. Just like any group of friends.<br><br>But came 2nd semester, where my school shifted furniture around and my table got separated from them. Mine was near the outside, theirs were inside. At first I thought nothing of it, thinking sitting outside would be better, as it is less crammed.<br><br>But, things turned unexpectedly. We still met for lunch, walked out of school together, but there was a period when my computer was spoilt (sent for repairs) and so I had to drop by the library after school to open my emails and stuff. So I'll say bye to them when we walk pass the library.<br><br>Slowly, I found more and more difficult to 'click' with them, and slowly slowly I found myself drifting away. Like for example, I'll initiate to join them for lunch, and we went to the toilet. When I came out, they are already walking away without waiting for me. Not one but a few times, as if I'm some kind of stranger. I'm no longer told some 'inner circle' stuff, or the 'gossip'. They discuss stuff among themselves. And I begun to feel outcasted.<br><br>During small group work, they'll group together and when I said I wanted to join, they'll say group is full (not fiercely) or "join others lah, too big group liao". As if I'm a stranger.<br><br>Finally came our 3 months vacation, which I chatted with some of them on MSN, and everything seemed 'normal'. But now that school had reopened, I'm facing the same problem. Same problem of being 'ignored' in conversations, cannot click anymore, and excluded from group. In this group some people came in, and 2 transferred out. I'm still the outcast. As if I'm someone they hardly know.<br><br>I'm closer to my next door class friends, whom I hardly meet during normal lesson time then my own classmates.<br><br>Could someone advise?

Only a few friends will continue to stay with you in the end.<br><br>Transferring class may not solve your problem as you might face the same problem in the new class.  How many times can you run away from the problem?  You may find the same thing happen when you join the work force too, so does it mean you are going to change job each time when it happens?  Just let what you experience now to prepare you for your future and hopefully you will grow stronger and wiser.<br><br>Whether people want to be your friend or not, it's important to ask yourself how good a friend you can be to someone (to give support and encouragement, to be willing to share the ups and downs etc.).  We can't always just take from friends without doing the giving.<br><br>Anyway, I wish you all the best and hopefully it's not too long before you come across new friends!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>

We met when we sat together in class. Just like any group of friends.<br><br>But came 2nd semester, where my school shifted furniture around and my table got separated from them. Mine was near the outside, theirs were inside. At first I thought nothing of it, thinking sitting outside would be better, as it is less crammed.<br><br>But, things turned unexpectedly. We still met for lunch, walked out of school together, but there was a period when my computer was spoilt (sent for repairs) and so I had to drop by the library after school to open my emails and stuff. So I'll say bye to them when we walk pass the library.<br><br>Slowly, I found more and more difficult to 'click' with them, and slowly slowly I found myself drifting away. Like for example, I'll initiate to join them for lunch, and we went to the toilet. When I came out, they are already walking away without waiting for me. Not one but a few times, as if I'm some kind of stranger. I'm no longer told some 'inner circle' stuff, or the 'gossip'. They discuss stuff among themselves. And I begun to feel outcasted.<br><br>During small group work, they'll group together and when I said I wanted to join, they'll say group is full (not fiercely) or "join others lah, too big group liao". As if I'm a stranger.<br><br>Finally came our 3 months vacation, which I chatted with some of them on MSN, and everything seemed 'normal'. But now that school had reopened, I'm facing the same problem. Same problem of being 'ignored' in conversations, cannot click anymore, and excluded from group. In this group some people came in, and 2 transferred out. I'm still the outcast. As if I'm someone they hardly know.<br><br>I'm closer to my next door class friends, whom I hardly meet during normal lesson time then my own classmates.<br><br>Could someone advise? I don't want to lose any friends. Feeling very sad now. </div></blockquote>Any chio bus in the group or not? If not then tell them to fark off lah</div>

A lot of the bros here have given some very spirited advice.<br><br>Not just in poly, anywhere u are, friends come and go. Don't take this whole thing too seriously. You sound like you are very much in need of a belonging and without it, you are miserable.<br><br>RELAX man! If the group does not treat you as part of the clique anymore, accept it and move on. If you are alone while everyone else has friends so be it. Don't give in to peer pressure when it contradicts your values!<br><br>Meanwhile, move around and merge into other cliques. Get active in your clubs! But don't look for friends just because you NEED them, that's a bad mentality.<br><br>Relationships are weird, when you look for love/friendship, the more you look for it, the more it eludes you. My 2 cents of worth of advice.</div>
