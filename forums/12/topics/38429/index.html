            <div class='col-md body'>Sometimes we close 1 eye and let those things pass by telling ourselves its nothing.<br><br>When things get out of hand....... only do we start to take action. But sadly things had already gone out of hand.<br><br>It may be a positive thing or it may be a negative one.<br>People may say you do not put trust in your gf hence no point in the relationship.<br><br>People may also say your stupid knowing things already getting out of hand and yet you took no actions to cease the situation from developing.<br><br>People may also say should she "truely" love you, she wouldn't had "veered" off course and like another guy.<br><br>Whatever they may say. Ultimately you have the final decision to decide which of the above implies to you.<br><br>Do spend some time together more often on weekends and catch up on things with each other.<br><br>Worst you could do is the fire away by saying she's unfaithful and all that.</div>

But as what they say in the forum, you are pretty and guys will definitely be more caring for you. Compare yourself to another plump lady, you think your boss really will want to have supper with her or stuffs like that?<br><br>I am being very, very realistic and frank here and may sound a bit offensive. But I really think that this is true for most of the cases. Of course, if the boss is really that caring and kind enough, I have nothing to say. A true gentleman.
