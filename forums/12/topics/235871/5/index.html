            <div class='col-md body'>they did it  divert their own attention from other problems to physical pain and blood loss.<br><br>the scars are normally hideous... *tiger strips*<br><br>show guy cut themselves too... because they want to show the girls that they like the girls... but  the girls in turned will be scared off by this type of action....<br>somethings like tattoo...<br><br>Girls also cut themselves when they are feeling stress out and they break up with the bf... or other things... which they does not have the solutions or no in the ability to achieve it...<br><br>they need like is the care and concern and consantly reminded them that it can be solved and they need a lot of attention...<br><br>they are not trying to show off, it is other ways of venting out the anger which they did not have the outlet to channel our pain...<br><br>This are often contributed to the surrounding factors....<br><br>1 case is that a girl declare her love to a guy and the guy snide at her being ugly and dun know her limit.... the nest things, she jumps off the building and committed suicide.... But the guy is not that handsome too, in fact the girl had better factors and charms... too bad , she jumps off the building...<br><br>The bloody scene is gross, she lay on the ground and a pool of blood is beside the head... brain juice.... gross....<br><br>Hear that she is bullied in school too,  then the stupid school then tell the whole school to mourn for her.... damn it la.... then girl is already died then they do it.... a life... FUCK!!!!<br><br></div>
