A few are illustrated here as mentioned. You can also use 'violence' to stop them (eg: going in by force, restraining them, bringing them to IMH, hospitals, have them receive appropriate treatments). Although that is very last resort to me...<br><br>However every case of 'self-infliction' is different and special. No one way, which could have been effective for one or more cases, is effective all the times.<br><br>If I were to encounter these people who have a tendancy for self-hurting, I would have to tread carefully as with any other cases (suicide, depression, etc) and read up on as many case studies as possible to further understand the issue at hand. I would let them know I am approachable and they can trust me, thus they can tell me what is going on. If they are unwilling to trust me, I will get help.<br><br>Its just me and how limited my knowledge is to enable me to come up with this plan so far... I wish I know more...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Copied from Aunt Agony Forum, Are the Moderators Certified? thread.<br><br>~~~~~~<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Gedanken:</div><div class="quote_body">Hmm.  I've read through the linked thread and it's, um, interesting.<br><br>Speaking not only as a practicing psychologist but as someone who's worked with abused children for years, I'll come at this from a practicioner's perspective.<br><br>I agree with kitty that textbook answers don't really offer much help.  However, generalising from personal experiences is precipitous as well, and if the person you're trying to help thinks you're being ignorant, you'll be shoved well behind square one.<br><br>The fact is that the motivation for self-harm varies on a case-by-case basis.  Yes, some people are just drama queens, and in such cases an REBT approach, such as kitty's SIA girl example, might work.  On the other hand, REBT, when used in the wrong situation, can lead to things going pear-shaped very rapidly.  For that matter, any approach used in the wrong context will produce detrimental results.<br><br>This leads to the point that, as a rule, any competent practicioner would know to perform some proper fact-finding before attempting to generate solutions.  Self-harm (or any observed behaviour) is only the symptom, not the problem itself.  Fix one symptom and another will pop up to take its place.<br><br>The underlying problem also dictates how effective the solution is.  The DSM-IV (the diagnostic bible) lists self-harm as a diagnostic criteria for Borderline Personality Disorder.  A BPD person would be highly unlikely to have any interest in being a flying waitress for SIA, or any other airline for that matter.<br><br>The bottom line is that what's good for the goose is not always good for the gander, and jumping off the mark to close one door isn't going to do any good if the rest of the building's on fire.  You always need to make a point to find out what's going on before offering solutions - doing so too early is just a waste of time.<br><br>Anyway, for what it's worth (about a hundred bucks by the reckoning of the APS), that's a professional's take on this debate.</div></blockquote></div>

But it's really a based on per case basis that you can offer to handle a 'victim' a different way... And if they do happens to fall under the context you've mentioned.. Yes... It's quite unwise to feed them with more than enough attention they're already having... But applying your 'solution' to people who might really be needing that 'attention' and help would mean doing something quite drastic to them... Including the fact that you might be driving them up the wall...</div>
