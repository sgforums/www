Pardon me to say this, but I think you've got this bad habit of telling people 'how much you've seen' when people question the truth because the statements you've made... What I wanna tell you is... No matter how much you've seen personally, doesn't necessarily makes you aware of facts... You can easily have someone who have seen a same old movie over and over again but basically have no idea to exactly what it means...<br><br>The reason why I didn't wanna start any arguement or debate with you is because I know you can be stubborn on your stand.
