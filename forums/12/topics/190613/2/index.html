            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah. Be more daring. Courage is one of the key factor in a successful relationship. If u're afraid and wanna give urself a little bit of time, jus walk behind her, den slowly speed up and grab her hand. Yes. She'll be surprise and now all u have to do is give the most dramatic speech of ur life. Heh.. All the best dude.<br><br>Cheers.<br>C.K</div>
