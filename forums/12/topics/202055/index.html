            <div class='col-md body'>Bah, I was going to blog when I saw some annoying comments on my blog and when I checked the IP address, it was from one of his friends. I got so annoyed I messaged my BF and told him that if his friends hated me so much why don't they just say it to my face instead of insulting me? But he replied that he had no idea who that person was and I felt as if he couldn't care less. I got so angry I told him that one day if I couldn't stand the crap from his friends I would leave him...<br><br>Now I feel so sad cuz he's angry. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>
