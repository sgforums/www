            <div class='col-md body'>Greetings !<br><br>I was "awakened" from my sad past, through a nightmare .<br><br>Today morning , at 2am+ i was trying to coax myself to sleep . I couldn't . I was on MC today , so i cant switch on the lights to read or watch TV . I began "counting sheep" and gradually fell asleep ... But what followed wasn't what i expected .<br><br>I dream of my dad beating me up because i scolded vulgarities and hurled abuse at my sis . My dad was angry as a result and he began to slap and beat me up . I was very defiant and made him more angry ... He beat me even harder ..<br><br>All was ended when i woke up .. However , i was feeling very scared and frightened . Tears trickled down my cheeks . The reason being that this was no ordinary nightmare . What i dream happened to me many years ago , when i was very young . Me dad would beat me up very harshly whenever he was very angry with me . He used a cane (very ordinary , it didnt make any impact on me .) , belt with buckle , and last but not least, his hand . Dont underestimate his strength . If he gives you a wack on your hand , your skin will swell a little .<br><br>There was this punishment he gave me, which brought tears to my eyes when i remembered it . Have you guys seen before TV shows where the husband grabs the wife's hair and pulls and yanks ? Instead of doing it to others, my dad used that method on me , when he exploded in rage . He would grab my hair and pull violently for 3secs . The next day, i would get a series of headaches .<br><br>The belt punishment . My sis and I dreaded this . Altho i mentioned buckle , i couldn't remember any occasion where he used the buckle to inflict pain on us . He only used the strap as a substitution to cane . It hurts alot more than cane .<br><br>My dad has since ceased to show such violent behaviors , since we all had grew up . I never blame anything about him , for i know that i did something wrong and i ought to be punished . My dad is a very loving man . He would feel remorseful after he gave us such punishment .. But i guess the hurt inflicted on me is too deep . I forbid anyone criticizing my dad, for i know he's a great man .<br><br>Anyway back to myself ... I just couldn't control my emotions . Remembering this sad and violent past just never fails to bring tears to my eyes...Why is this so? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Scania, I hope you can be as strong as your nick suggests. The Swedish Saab Scanias make one of the best vehicles in the world.<br><br>My dad also does violent acts to me. He'd grab my hair and wham my head on any wall he can find. In the lift or at home. So long no one sees it. I always use my hands to cushion the impact. When I tried to stop him from attacking my mother during my secondary school days, he used my boken and whacked very hard at me aiming at my head. I blocked the attacks to protect my head with my left arm ending up in minor fractures &amp; severe swelling.<br><br>He still rains loads of different violent acts on me. It only stopped 10 years ago when I fought back the first time. That time, my gf was around, so I was very worried he might hurt her and I really fought back hard. He was totally unable to use violence on me anymore. Then he started to curse that I'd die, I'd move out of the house etc etc. Make up lies about me etc etc. He does these to my mum and sis too. The irony will be that when I called the police, he acted pitiful and told the police "I will never beat my wife and children."<br><br>My mum applied for PPO. Just last year, he initiated a divorce thinking he'd get 50% of the proceeds from the house. But ended up getting only 20%, it was even 5% short of the initial price proposed by my mum. Anyway, I haven't met him since 2003. I dun know how he looks like now and I'm not interested. For a man who doesn't work to support his family yet subjects the family to immense violence and suffer the effects of his integrity problem, it is best not to associate with him. I don't hold against him, but I will not want to have anything to do with him. He is the sort who'd for personal gains pretend to fall down and accuse you of assaulting him. How dangerous it is to associate with this kind of people.<br><br>There are many types of people in the world who are still fathers. Your story is not the worst, neither is mine. But we should be glad that you're not in the worst case scenario. Focus on your future instead. It is your foremost priorities now. Studies and career. You'll realise that they outweigh your past pains more than you can imagine.<br><br>Good Luck!!</div>
