              <p>hi,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>my english not very good ah, rebellious mean that the kid like to challenge u? u ask him to do A and he purposely do B?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>maybe u can try telling the kid the opposite ah, take for example if u want him to go left then dont ask him to go left ah, u can try telling him to go right instead. knowing that he will purposely go left and that will solve your probem ah.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>u can also try the encouragement way too, just dont challange him ah, tell him nicely that if he be a good boy and keep quiet for 5 min then u will give him a sweet.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i dont know will this work ah, but i think u can use it at your own risk ah</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>thank you ah</p>

              <p>[Actually is not really my problem]</p>
              <p>when ask why him did not like to study ? he say too boring, want to play.</p>
              <p>when ask why does he smoke? he say he dont know</p>
              <p>... <strong>the problem this guy does not listen, and he think that his decisions are right and yet his vision is so small.</strong> Does working at full-time Mc at the age of 15 bring him good career prospect. It is difficult to let him see the light. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>He is rebellious ( </strong>Resisting treatment or control; unruly) <strong>, defiance (</strong>Intentionally contemptuous behavior or attitude; readiness to contend or resist)<strong>  and lack of logical thinking </strong>(simple does not do things that make sense)<strong>. </strong></p>
              <p>(just added the meaning)</p>
              <p>Prehaps, some people are just not so bright. Feel like just leave him alone and let him suffer based on his own consequence.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Best any one of those kids might volunteer to explain yourself.</p>

              <p>LOL, the replies are hilarious!</p>
              <p>Anw, i believe that if a child from young , have good upbringing, they won't be rebellious. I'm sure not about ur definition of rebellious though.</p>
              <p>Talk to them is the best solution!</p>

              <p>hmm, how old is the kid?</p>
              <p>there are 3 types of parenting, depending on the age of the kid.</p>
              <p>dictatorship parenting - for kids. because they don't know what's good for them, what's right and wrong, you decide for them</p>
              <p>advisory parenting - for teens, because they are learning to be an adult, you have to allow them to make certain decisions (things that won't screw up their lives, like CCA choices) without always telling them what to do. they'll automatically resent that. just be there to support them, when they face the consequences of their decisions, for better or for worse.</p>
              <p>consultation parenting - when your child is now an adult. Do make yourself available if they need to ask your valued advices about life. But do not make decisions for them, ever. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>speaking of which, i just quarrelled and told my mum off. feeling horrible =(</p>
