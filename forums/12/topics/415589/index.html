            <div class='col-md body'><p>ah, the standard bullying problem, something that occurs everywhere, i think it has something to do with the way we humans think, in racial terms, mostly, and its sad many nations like australia claim to clamp down on racism, the very root of school bullying and yet what happens? indian students get attacked. recently, in australia, a muslim girl got tormented so bad by even her teacher and classmate for wearing her headress she couldnt hold it in and tore off the pants of the classmate. the school knew she had been tormented online and in school 24/7, but what did they do? ban her from ever using the school bus again. now she had to find her way tens of miles to school by herself. the classmate? oh, for calling her a piece of shit ever since she entered his 'superior' nation, he gets comforted for such 'humiliation' and 'suffering'. even in britain, france, muslims are bullied because of the way they live. like it or not, racism can never be quelled, and so bullying on every level of society can never be quelled, cos most of us will not think beyond our own 'superior' race.</p></div>

              <p><br>Actually if you keep bumping into such incidents in your life, it's the collective consciousness called "the world" that is trying to tell you to stand up for yourself and be assertive of your rights before you get swallowed up and digested into nothingness.</p>
              <p>It's a protective feature to preserve your consciousness, so you must awaken your yourself before it's too late.</p>

              <p>As you grow older, you too will realise your innate hate for students in general so don't worry about it, after a few years, you'll be bullying the students too.
