            <div class='col-md body'>i juz need a place to complain.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>have u ever had frens dat are reali damn fake ar?<br><br>i had this so-called 'fren' that is realli...i duno hw to describe..<br><br>I duno hw did we end up as frens in the 1st place...we were classmates..n in class..we both like 'xiang yi wei ming'..even thou our tots and opinions are reali different...maybe its like a bo bian situation. I was sincere in the frenship..but i was disappointed with her 'sincerity'.<br><br>She more open...whereas im the more conservative one...but she would come to me for advice cuz im pretty objective...but sometimes realli...its apparently her fault..but she can sae frm black become white? everything dat happened was nv her fault..its becuz pple or situation prompted her to do it..but she has the choice not to do it. like when she came late for test..lets sae its 10am..she came around 10.15..and i have already told her the time..she still can come blame me sae i nv tell her the time.even if so..she cannot check herself?not as if im taking the test for her.<br><br>She is such a two headed snake. one time she can be telling me hw she dislike the person..the other time she can be laughing with that person...sorry ar..im dat type..dun like means dun like..wun fake smile here and there one...i tink dats partly why i dun have many frens...im not initiative when it comes to making frens.. i sometimes do feel sad about not having many frens...but come to think of it..having 2 best frens is enuf..rather than those 'ping shui xiang feng' and 'zhu peng gou you' and fakeOs..<br><br>Neway..watever things i tell her...she tend to tell other pple..n dats not the worst part...the worst part is that she add or minus content from what i told her and it totally becomes a different story.<br><br>and she always 'er ren xian gao zhuang'..as u all noe..normally pple oni bother to hear one side of the story wat..den sure agree and pity with her. C liao oso sian...<br><br>But im glad ive drawn a line btw us.phew.<br>i feel better after ranting out loud.<br><br>so u guys...any similar experiences?<br></div>
