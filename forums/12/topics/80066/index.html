If I guess correctly, my phone is always open to you. Don't bother asking who I am, by this nick, if you know, you should know. If not, definitely wrong number liao.<br><br>Clue to the above claim: If your gf is Aries.<br><br>***<br><br>Your relationship has hidden and obvious issue you have to work through - it basically needs clarification, understanding, empathy, strength and lastly structure, to ensure growth and stability of your love.<br><br>Understand one thing - everyone is different in their own ways. Your girl is not the usual kind of woman you are dating - infact, roles have changed. She upholding mascline energy of the relationship, while you supporting the feminine energy. She is cool in her behavior, dislike emotional talk and is secured with preception of trust in relationship - You are the direct opposite. <strong>Jealousy slips in heavily because they are gaps within your insecurity</strong>.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Lesson one</span>: </span><br><br>Learn to see her as <strong>herself and NOT as a woman</strong>. The dynamic of her personality is different and this leaves much room for exploration. She is like a block of ice - she says she is 'like that want' because previous relationship did not break up this rigid emotional ice block she has constructed and crystalized over the years.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Psychologically, it could be her early childhood and environment that influence her.<br><br>Your job in lesson one is to keep knowing her better as a girfriend (No, you don't know her very well still) and to soften her up. Chip and break up the block of ice into cubes so that it is easier to handle. She can't be like what you are - possible clingy and emotionally dependant. You must realise that your relationship must evolve and mould her better and being better is <strong>BASED</strong> on her own personality and <strong>NOT</strong> your preception of what it should be.<br><br>***<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Different race relationship has their own unique form of problem. Once passed the parent's stage - next come the competitors.<br><br>You can't stop people from liking or chasing your girl - you are only defend your relationship with power of love. Embrace this theory and you will secure high trust in your relationship.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>What's with competitors? Humans, especially guys, are like that. Once relationship doesn't fall under the traditional version (Racial relationship, Long Distance relationship, Older woman, younger guy relationship, etc) - they sees it as a weakness that could slip in easily - failed to realise that this weakness could be strength of the couple because if both party wants it to work out - twice the effort is being put in as the relationship is being faced with constant threat.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Love grows stronger with emotional strength and challenge.<br><br>Grow irritated and everything else is natural. Your gf has nothing to hide, nothing to keep - she is the kind of woman who is open and live to her emotional conscience. From here, you can see that she is able to secure the kind of trust and stability because she <strong>BELIEVE</strong> in the relationship.<br><br>See how confidence she is when she told you that even though she would bleed when you leave (if that was your choice), she would let you go?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>External factor will try to ruin and destroy you - but how will you shield yourself? So what if the guy msg your gf and say if he has a chance and all the crap? Why get angry over how hypocrite you think he is when he cannot make it? You can't stop external factor - you can only believe in your love and work to make it invulnerable.<br><br>This relationship is of medium to high intensity. Your next lesson would be to evolve yourself. Learn to see correct positive value in you because she has saw the good out from you apart from the lamer engineers, etc. Treasure yourself and always fight a self esteem battle to surpress all negative look-down-on-yourself thoughts.<br><br>If you have fallen, who will fight for the relationship?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>

Like you've said, maybe she likes it but she just don't really show it? Afterall, who don't wanna be loved? Just do it at the appropriate place and at the appropriate time...<br><br>2. It's normal to get jealous when there are guys around doing things like that... Besides, you've mentioned that your gf is quite pretty? So it's also quite normal for you to 'overreact' at times?<br><br>It's only important for you to control your jealousy and especially emotions.. i.e. you can show your jealousy, but don't start to put unnecessary blames and such...</div>
