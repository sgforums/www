Nobody knows what lies ahead of us one minute, one hour, one month, one year from now.  Perhaps it is fate / destiny that certain things happen to us in our lives or perhaps what happens to us are due to the choices we make in life.<br><br>I believe it is a combination of both ... fate/destiny and the choices we make at each point in our lives.  Sometimes, what u wish for in love / life may not materialise even though we try so hard to make it happen (ie. making choices to achieve that goal).  Sometimes, things just fall into place even though you made no conscientious effort for it to happen. (you might attribute this to fate / destiny etc)<br><br>If you look back into your life carefully, I am sure you will find instances whereby you are where you are now because of a combination of the above.<br><br>If you want to let nature take its own course, then let it be.  If you feel something needs to be done, then just do it (make a choice / decision).<br><br></div>

Benefic relationship are seen around - like your best friend or someone you feel so good with emotionally (or spiritually in some case) that hardly any conflicts would ever spring up or even if they do, they can't damage the core of your bonds. They existed because of the harmonious attitude we have foster in the past. (Or the present if such bonds ain't available and FreeWill is employ to consciously keep the relationship well and intact)<br><br>Karmic relationship are usually our debt relationship. Because of our own personality flaws and attitude, many a times, life would force we to move to certain areas of our life we detest to go, face issue we subconsciously hated. Karmic relationship are steps for us to reached there. <strong>No possessive person will ever learn the destructive nature of possessiveness unless reality cuts and bleed them badly because of it.</strong><br><br>Ever heard 'Every relationship is a step to our final goal?' Each steps is hidden with lesson and there are times when we rejected the lessons and resist learning. History repeats and we rant about our ill-fated love life when in fact, the problem came from us. You may think 'Hey, but it's our partner not us...' CloUdiSm Remix III and studies has shown:<br><br>I) We chose our partner not the other way round (First Law of Love).<br>- <span style="font-style: italic;">You chose a jerk, you accept them, you accept what's in store for you.</span><br><br>II) We attract similiar qualities exuded from our personality.<br>- <span style="font-style: italic;">We are negative, we attract negative people.</span><br><br>III) Complementary qualities keeps the relationship going.<br>- <span style="font-style: italic;">The beauty of accepting, compromising AND more importantly - how we can complement ourselves to achieve things we never knew we had the power to.

            <div class='col-md body'>i believe whether you have the chance to even meet the special someone is fated. all things else depend on you two, eg how do you maintain the relationship, choose never to cheat and always be faithful.<br><br>i am very awed by the concept of the so many people out there that are suitable for you, and the even fewer you will feel a special connection between your heart and his. i am a hopeless romantic. i believe that if you were meant to be, you would meet. the problem is, will you know you are meant for each other when you do meet eventually? sometimes cupid wants to shoot you both but missed.<br><br>singapore may be small, but its cosmopolitan. that means we don't just have a choice of a few hundred thousand. travel. discover the world out there. shape your own philosophy. and hopefully you'll find someone who shares the same dreams. it is a lovely feeling when you have found (and continue to be with) someone with whom you can share your dreams with. someone who understands your pain, your happiness, and of course you understand the person too.<br><br></div>
