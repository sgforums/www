Like i said they will just persuade the girl to take the pills. The only sure way and safe withouth harmful effects n all that stuff unless her vaginal area is allergic to RUBBER.. which i doubt.. or know of any cases..lol and remaining 0% chance of pregnancy.. unless condom break is to use the condom.<br><br>There is another way like u say where they tie the knot . One of the organs .. the productive organs. That one i think very safe lo. Medically no side effects also. Thats what they claim ah. So far no hear any side effects also.<br><br>About the short and lame one , i cannot speak for them lol!<br><br>thats why like i said , condom lo.. condom is 100% . But sometimes girl may complain cause the rubber will cause friction n they dun like as maybe too big.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> .. and lack lubrication. But that is very very rare case for me.<br><br>no condom is only when thier cycle JUST up , and confirm no ovary n its up to the girl to know.. hell i wont know. Unless she want to make me make her pregnant n then force a shotgun wedding on my ass.<br><br></div>
