              <p>What is it you wish to accomplish by confronting her ? Drama for everyone to see ? Simply distance yourself from her from now on.</p>
              <p>A friend is just a friend, and frienship is forged with goodwill, trust and respect. Without these components, it is not a "friendship" anymore, rather mere "accquaintance"</p>
              <p>Obviously she is not a "nice" person. When she is around, just be wary of her.</p>
              <p>Her pretending to be "nice", is just her method to "fit in" with the group. Else , she'd be an outcast.</p>
              <p>There's really no need for you to "expose" her evil doings to the world, because by doing so reflects badly on yourself. Let others see for themself her true colours, they have their own eyes to see and own brains to think.</p>
              <p>When you are out on group gatherings, you just need to be "civil", you don't need to go out of your way to please her.</p>

              <p>The reason why she thinks of you as her best friend might be because you have been putting up with everything which she does and says, and that you are nice to her despite all the bickering and putting down.</p>
              <p>As I have suggested, you really need to have a talk with her and let her understand that there is a line which friends shouldn't cross, and that they shouldn't just simply take material-advantage of each other.</p>

              <p>Define friendship in your own terms. What is it to you? Is it just being nice and being called best friend? These are just words, but actions proved it all. Obviously, in my opinion, she's crossed the invisible line of trust and understanding required in a stable friendship. She rattled your cage, not you. If you're getting nightmare, it's time to pull the plug being a two-faced. Ultimately, it's up to you to make the right decision.</p>
