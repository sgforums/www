I was wondering how to ask her what happen...After dinner went to West coast park for a walk found a nice quiet spot and we sat down for a chat.<br><br>She looks at the ground and say softly that she loved me, I could not hear what she say and ask her to look at me, then she turn around and our eyes meet. For that moment, both of us are speechless, then she hug me tightly all of a sudden. I give her a warm kiss on her cheeks and I say that I am willing to be her bf. She was so happy that she was crying. I wiped her tears away and give her a long deep kiss on her lips and hug her.<br><br>After that we.........hehe.....<br><br>Went to West Coast Mac for a light snack, sorry boo we did not have sex haha , I still stick to my policy of no sex before marriage. I was too hungry liao cos did not eat much at first. After eating I sent her home, she pass me a nice cute  puzzle of a puppy and I thank her for it.<br><br>Sent her to work this morning and she was sleeping in the car all the way..hehe guess she was too tired...<br><br>Placed the puzzle on the wall beside my desk. She was so happy as she gave me, my morning tea.</div>
