Lo and behold! They produced a horde of small critters and one couldn't clean as fast as the whole family could excrete. Soon the smell of accumulated hamster excrement made the room more 'fragrant' than even the toilet in the nearby coffeeshop. (Coincidentally, the family also stopped having dinner at home and went to the coffeeshop instead.) One's face began taking an unhealthy tinge of yellow from inhaling excessive noxious gases, and one was forced to give away those which had not died from unknown reasons.<br><br>Oops... where were we? Ah yes, procreative creatures, those hamsters. Really admire you being in "Hamster paradise". The "Hamster" should not have scolded you -- he should take it as a compliment of his... uh, "exploration talents".</div>

Have you ever thought that it could pain the other person as well if he had felt that you loved him less than he loved you?<br><br>Try not to quantify love and to compare who loves who more -- the scales would always be tilted in your own favour and you would never be happy.<br><br>Rather, qualify love and judge for yourself whether you feel his love in this relationship, whether you hold a place in his heart.
