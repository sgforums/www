I send a sms wishing her happy birthday.<br>She replied and said that why she need to explain herself everytime and I don't understand her at all.

And said I go think whatever I want to think about her for being unreasonable, rude and heartless. Just try to explain things nicely to her that not everyone thinks the same way like her for rejecting ppl's present. She told me that it's because my family treat her well, that's why the more she don't want to accept the present.

Then what she want us to do with the present?<br>Geez.. then she keep on shooting me sarcastically with her sms..  saying that she can't stand me.. and she "shou bu qi" my friendship..<br>And lastly, told me to leave her alone if not she'll change her number and move house..<br>It's really crazy lor.. I didn't even go and look for her all these times.. except for once to clarify things..  And I didn't call her at all..
