So, I'm prepared for that with him.<br><br>Actually, all I've been doing is meet him after work at his place, have dinner, then we keep quiet &amp; cuddle whilst watching TV or reading a book.  Unless he wants to talk, we usually keep silent.  It's very strange these few days because we're usually chattering away &amp; teasing each other.  The sudden silence takes some getting used to, I have to confess <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  Still, it seems to make him feel calmer, so I suppose it's a good thing  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"><br><br>Perhaps the silence is just what he needs right now.  Oh well, he knows that anytime he needs me, I'll be around......<br><br>Thanks for your parting words too.  We do spend time together, but we also give each other breathing space (very important for me).  Luckily, he's usually Not so nian2 nian2 ti1 ti1 like some of my exes <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  However, presently, it's like he's clinging onto me for support, &amp; that, I'm willing to give.
