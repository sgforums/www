Drx and MC should know about it. She broke up with me just because she feels that she deserve someone of her same level..(as in qualification). It's not that we're not happy being together.. Just that, Love alone is ain't enough to satisfy her needs. She need someone who can support her in later life, to live comfortably without monatary constraint. Materialistic, some might said.. At least, I still have a decent job.. yeah... maybe it's not that "presentable" as compared to a "manager" or "engineer". but at least, I earn enough to support myself and still have enough to pay for her whenever we go out. But, it ain't enough for her. Not even when I be my own boss and startmy  own biz last year selling taiwanese dessert at food fairs and pasar malam.. To her, the job is so "Unglam" that she find it hard to tell her mum when she asked about my occupation. And sadly, the biz didn't do quite well, and I've stopped selling since the beginning of this year. I thought, maybe I should try to upgrade myself and take part-time course. But she refuse to wait that long.. she feels that by that time, she could have achieve much more than me. And there she goes.. left me with a broken heart and twisted mind.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>
