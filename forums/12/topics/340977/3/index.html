              <p>i feel for my gf cuz it's very annoying when she bring in wad she learned in previous r/s into our current one. cuz i know i'm not her ex bf and i'm not this kinda person.</p>
              <p>and yea, i'm unable to take it tt despite her ex treated her like dirt, she still side him.</p>
              <p>and i do understand wad u mean by -------&gt;</p>
              <p><strong>Seriously, Im kindda pissed that you are indulging in your hatred for someone whom your gf is tryin hard to forget.  You may hurt your gf unintentionally if you keep doin that.</strong></p>

              <p>U hav been together for like, 2 mths??  So how do u expect her NOT to "compare" when u keep harpin on it?! </p>
              <p>*Takin deep breath*   Sigh..</p>
              <p>It's in good women's nature to somehow protect the integrity of all her bfs - irregardless how bad they were towards her.  That's pretty stupid, I agree.  But you cant deny that.</p>
              <p>If you want this r'ship to work towards better future, learn to let go &amp; know what it means by "what's bygone, be bygone".  Unless that guy still pester her, only then you can do something as a capacity of a boyfriend.</p>

              <p>my gf and i got tgt 2mths ago. as time passes by, i got to learn from her abt her past r/s with her ex bf she met in her uni 1st yr. things were going well btwn both of them till they tried to have sex. the r/s btwn both of them soon depended on sex to kp going on and although my gf knew tt her ex was holding on to the r/s due to sex, she always give in and maintain their status. during the r/s, whenever my gf didnt feel like doing it, he would allegedly FORCE her and whenever she's forced, she will cry during the sex. however, this crap kept going on and on till my gf felt there was no point holding on a r/s built on sex. i'm really agonised by wad he has done to my gf, and totally disgusted that a uni undergrad who's supposedly intellectually wise actually did such dispicable act against a weaker party. my heart aches whenever i think about this. i know it takes 2 hands to clap but my gf keeps insisting she was forced, and she give in to him even when she doesn't feel like having sex just to satisfy the other party. till now, she doesn't feel outsmarted by the ex bf for he has done to her and what he wanted ultimately as a 'bf' to her. she gave her virginity to someone whom cannot be trusted and she feels that her ex bf is not very much to be blamed till today. she just feels that the r/s didnt work out well. but as a guy, i feel very much like he's gotten what he wanted. cuz as the r/s faded, he insisted sex and everytime after sex, he would leave my gf and treat her very coldly. i;m just here to rant abt this. thks.</p>

              <p><br>How did you find out about such intimate details between your gf and her ex-bf? Did you also know her ex-bf and pestered her to tell you the details? Or Did she revealed it to you on her own accord?</p>
              <p>Is her ex-bf a Singaporean? Which Singapore Universities was he studying at?</p>
              <p>I know you're terribly vexed by her past, but you have also shown me that you do not love her at all by revealing her past to us in here without her consent and insensitive to her past and her feelings. Shouldn't your gf be the best person to post such topics instead of you? Understand that you do not have the rights to betray her privacy and personal affairs without her permission. She could take you to court if she wished.</p>
              <p>Maybe you would like us to think of you as a better guy by sharing her story with us. But deep inside yourself, you're just exactly like her ex-bf or a even worse monster than her ex-bf.</p>
              <p>I don't think you will ever reflect on what you have done and neither do I think that you will actually love this girl. So next time don't waste your time posting such topics until you have fully developed your brain and when YOU ARE READY TO LOVE PEOPLE. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p>Hypocrisy is still the best way to identify a Singaporean guy. They are so full of it. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
