              <p><br>Who are you to judge her anyway?</p>
              <p>As her current bf, isn't she someone whom you should be protecting instead of disgracing her publicly like this?</p>
              <p>Just because your father paid your mother money to produce you, doesn't means that your gf should also receive money from her ex-bf after they have done their things.</p>
              <p>At least her ex-bf did not do something as low as what you have done to her by posting out her past on an online forum.</p>
              <p>No wonder she is comparing between you and her ex-bf, it is obvious that her ex-bf were so much better to her than you.</p>
              <p>Why don't you just go and die instead? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              i think what is more important is that you have to accept your girlfriend for whoh she is. I sense that you are pretty insecure about her losing her virginity to another guy as oppopsed to the fact that your girlfriend was partially forced to sleep with her ex.
              
              Your title reads gf was raped for nuts sake. Please weigh out your concerns.

              <p>I seriously have to teach you a lesson or two before you go into your relationship or you throw the face of the guys here.</p>
              <p>If you think that your girlfriend is no good and you cannot accept that her virginity was lost to another guy and you worry this worry that, you might as well go choose another girl who is prettier and is still a virgin. What's more where got boyfriends go post their girlfriend's past in public forum, much less than a past which is very sensitive. Call your girlfriend cheap, what's more in a public forum, OMG!!!! I don't even dare to tick off my girlfriend privately, much less than posting in a forum. You don't even know how to respect your girlfriend's privacy and pride, much less than going on a relationship with her. You are not young anymore, you are a university student yet you have a brain of a kid who worry this worry that. By the way, in your FIRST post you say that you sympatise her because of her past. Now your CURRENT post says that you call her cheap. Since you don't like her the way she is, then annouce a breakup and choose another girl. Why make things so complicated for you and your girlfriend and also people here when they are trying to explain things to help you to solve your problems and yet you make things even more difficult for us. Seriously, you care more about her sexual status than her pure heart. If you really love your current girlfriend, don't even bother about her past. Face the future ahead of you. Frankly speaking, currently you are not prepared to hold firmly in a love relationship. You should do your own thinking whether you deserve your current girlfriend or not. If it is sexual status you want, I suggest you better be off looking for another girl who is virgin and more beautiful than your current girlfriend. But if it is pure heart that you want, then leave that damn pathatic past behind and GET A LIFE AND MOVE ON YOU ASSHOLE!!!! </p>
              <p>I got an advice for you, "If you can't handle your girlfriend at her worst, then you don't deserve her at her best."</p>

Since she have moved on, accept for who she is. Protect her for now and future. I'm sure you wouldn't want her to go thru it again with other guys. Be with her, treat her better and she will be yours forever. But easier said than done. Just remember, Don't give up. Put the past behind and look forward.

              <p>Hey, To accept a girl, you have to accept her past. My ex also were once like you. I know how you feel when she break the news to you. But there's nothing you can do about it right? You whack him,she defend him. You cut him, u go jail. You kill him, you die with him(hang). So what can you do? Nothing. Since she have moved on, accept for who she is. Protect her for now and future. I'm sure you wouldn't want her to go thru it again with other guys. Be with her, treat her better and she will be yours forever. But easier said than done. Just remember, Don't give up. Put the past behind and look forward. Unless u want you want virgin girlfriend i bo wei kong lah.</p>
