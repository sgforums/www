            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>this is a letter adapted from http://poorfuhuanites.forum5.com<br><br>Okay. Here goes nothing:<br><br>I am a student currently studying in Fuhua Secondary School. I have tolerated the schoolÂ’s imbecile, inefficient and impractical way of running the school such that I am reduced to having to share my thoughts here.<br><br>Every school is bound to have students violating the school rules. Firstly, it's about the electricity problems in this school. Fuhua Secondary turns off the toilet lights 24/7 just to save electricity bills, but who doesnÂ’t know that air-conditioning consumes the most electricity? Are we trying to save that little bit of electricity just for the luxury of some, but yet the necessity of many? I find this case ridiculous as we can't possibly see even in the afternoon. The whole toilet will be left very dark and only when important guests step into Fuhua, will they then turn on the lights. So what kind of show is the school putting up in front of others? IsnÂ’t it indirectly inculcating negative values in the students?<br><br>The next thing is about grooming. Last Monday (29/01/07), when the school checked for the girlsÂ’ grooming, the teachers caught some students with fringes over their eyebrows. However, what was unexpected was that the girls were sent to the principal office and had their hair cut by the principal leaving them with straight ugly fringes. The principal should instead give a one-day grace or at least a warning before doing so, and not making the girls cry like a river in the toilets (which has no lights!). This will make them unable to concentrate on their lessons for the day. If they want to continue with their disciplinary actions this way, Fuhua students would not be convinced by the school as this is an act of public humiliation to the victims. There were students with their fringes pinned up, however some teachers caught themÂ… According to our handbook; School Rules for Pupils (2007), Page 9, Part 5.4: Girls should pin up fringes covering their eyebrows and tie up the hair covering the shoulders. Long hair must be plaited and black hair accessories may be used. So, are we also being punished for doing the right thing?<br>This made me think that Fuhua has a number of contradicting teachers, as I have also encountered such problems in the past.<br><br>Thirdly, another case I found ridiculous is that Fuhua actually reprimanded the pupils for wearing jackets in the school compound. My friends were being told off by the discipline master for wearing jackets during these days. As we all know, we are still experiencing the monsoon season. They told us that the jacket is not part of Fuhua's attire and we should not be wearing one even if it's a rainy/cold day. We are to report to the office if we are sick and our parents would be phoned to acknowledge that weÂ’re not feeling well. Only then, weÂ’re allowed to wear our jackets. But Fuhua didn't even design a jacket for us and expect us to wear only our uniforms even if we are cold. So who is to blame for not having a school jacket? The weather is really heartless these days, arenÂ’t the teachers being heartless too?<br><br>Lastly, students were caught and asked to remove their non skin-coloured undergarments and wait till their parents come with a white/skin-coloured undergarment for them. IÂ’d like to note that there isnÂ’t any restriction for females under 16 to be banned from coloured-bras, so should we blame the manufacturer for the rainbow range of colors available? I don't see the reason why girls have to take their undergarments off with boys inside the school. If the school is worried that the guys will have nasty thoughts about girls wearing coloured-bras, being totally exposed right in front of them isnÂ’t that more absurd? The disciplinary actions of Fuhua are causing the students to lose their self-esteem (Particularly girls). This is not the first time that I have read on articles regarding coloured-bras, and I feel it should be dealt with. If the school thinks that by stripping someoneÂ’s esteem will wake the student up, IÂ’m sorry. This Â‘traditional methodÂ’ has to be given up as the modern day society doesnÂ’t practice this anymore. We believe in reasoning things out rather than solving things under an iron-fist method.<br><br>The school should give an explanation to the students. Hopefully, this saga ends benefiting both the school and the students making it a better learning condition.<br><br>Thanks for your attention.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You know, I once saw a relieve teacher with white long skirt wearing pink undergarment. Then a group of my male classmate saw it and they discuss and admire at it whole for the freaking whole 2 period!!!!<br><br>See? Thats how great is the distraction. You know whats the best? At the end of the day, the group of classmate from my class meet with the next door bunch of classmate and discuss about it....<br><br>It is the 'obvious' that create the problem. Normally people won't go like stare at you to see are you wearing bra or not. It is when people give you a glance and see 'ahh i can see her bra colour through her shirt clearly' and then start focusing on you for clearer view.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>what's with the recent school attire thing ah? my younger sister was complaining to me about her new school attire rules when she started school this month.<br><br>when I was in sec school(2003-2006) my school's rules were damn slack. can wear colour shoes but must have a bit of white. can colour our hair abit, not striking colours though. short skirts weren't caught, unless the skirts are really micro-mini. can wear jackets regardless of school pullover or your own jacket. girls wearing coloured bra, not caught often. like maybe during the occasional attire check den catch. ankle socks were also allowed.<br><br>think my school really promoted "creativity" well lah.<br><br>how come schools are implementing strict school attire rules so suddenly?</div>
