Scary isn't it? But it is through such strict punishments/threats that Singapore maintain its society and it is through this strict punishment/threats that people think twice before doing it.<br><br>School selling cheap bras is kinda impossible. Think about it school selling bras, sound ridiculous isn't it? Besides, you can get bras, regardless is it cheap or not, anywhere.<br><br>I understand that there is other alternatives to punishment. This is why I say in my previous posts that TS failed to provide information on whether any alternative punishment is given. I also mentioned that all my post is base on assuming that alternative punishments is given before school takes such extreme punishment.<br><br>Even so, as a students myself, I said alternative punishments like detention and picking up litter will definitely not work, the only thing I feel is a waste of time and nothing else. Besides, there are not much litter to pick in school. Fines will not work too, in the past fines are given and some parents complained that their hard earn money being taken away.<br><br>With students taking parents as shield nowadays, it really leave school with not much choice in punishments.<br></div>
