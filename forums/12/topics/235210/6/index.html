            <div class='col-md body'>Look like I've have to make some comments on this after all...<br><br>The school should be a condusive place for students to study. As such, I think it's ridiculous to disallow students from wearing jackets despite in cold weather. How is anyone going to concentrate on their calculus question while shivering like crazy?<br><br>Yes, the students will probably not freeze to death like they do in 'The Day After Tommorow', neither will the temperature get below 20C. But they will indeed get sick. It's not about the students being pampered or not, it's not about the students' capability to endure suffering. It's about taking care of themselves.<br><br>You'll drink water when you're feeling dehydrated. You'll take a shower when you're sweating too much. You'll crave warmth when you're cold. It's only normal to wear jacket when the weather is cold.<br><br>And about the coloured bra. I find it amusing that some forumers here feel that coloured bra is a distraction. I've seen lots of girls wearing coloured and fanciful undergarments before, including some of my female friends. And frankly speaking, I don't find it worth such a big attention.<br><br>Seriously, don't you think only people who finds coloured undergarment 'extra-ordinary' will talk about it and call it a distraction? Really, coloured undergarments are so 'widely use' nowadays that they're really nothing worth talking about man.<br><br>And like I've mention in my previous posts, if the school is so strongly for the 'decency' of students, then don't design uniforms which are so thin and pale in the first place! Now even if the girls had wore white or skin coloured undergarments, it'll not make such a large difference after all for us guys can still see everything had we want to see it in the first place!<br><br>And about the fringes. Ya, perhaps long fringes can distract some people from their work. But think...some of the girls had been having longer fringes for like, years? What kind of distraction is that? And I'm pretty sure no matter how big a distraction long fringes are to the girls, it's never a bigger distraction than having to survive lessons in cold weather.<br><br>Yes, some may argue that school rules are meant for students to follow, as it inculcate a sense of responsibility and dissipline in the student. But I'm sorry, I don't believe in this. What I believe in is, yes, rules and regulations are there to help keep orders. But as thinking individuals, we should never follow rules that simply make no sense at all. If the law states that all girls has to bind their feet should we follow it?<br><br>Maybe some here would say yes. But I'll certainly say no to it.</div>

What are the girls trying to show to the school? For your info, to those that keep saying that making female students take off their bra is humiliating, do you really know what happen? TS did not mention is there any warnings given before they taken such extreme action.<br><br>My assumption (since TS did not give any info on it) is this punishment is given not long ago.  Warning is given beforehand for the first group of students that commit the mistake, however students choose to ignore the warning and other form of punishment is given. However, that did not improve the stituation and thus school is to force to take this extreme action.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by mahawarrior:</div><div class="quote_body">Look like I've have to make some comments on this after all...<br><br>And about the coloured bra.

Students at that age have keen interest in opposite sex, even a female students wearing coloured bra that can be seen through the uniform is equally distracting. DO NOT compare it with grownup, the mentality is different.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by niceboy:</div><div class="quote_body">And like I've mention in my previous posts, if the school is so strongly for the 'decency' of students, then don't design uniforms which are so thin and pale in the first place!

I say its the female students that need to be taught what is 'decency'. A female student not wearing a bra who have male students staring at her makes her feel uncomfortable? You're kidding, so what is that a different with wearing a bra and have male students keep staring at her?<br><br>The situation we are talking about is not school uniform that are so translucent that the coloured bra can be seen clearly. Come on brain have to be used here, if a school uniform become super translucent, the one with the right thinking will naturally think its about time she should change to a  new set of uniform, isn't it? If the girl still continue to wear it, does 'decency' still apply to her and what is the word 'uncomfortable' to her?<br><br>Uniform thin? When the school design a uniform that is thick, you all scream 'Wah hell! so Hot!'. When the school design a uniform that is thin, you all say 'So? Its the school fault for designing it thin'. What do you excatly wants from a school? Besides, the school doesn't design thin uniform, it is when after a long time of washing that the uniform becomes thin.</div>

What do you excatly wants from a school? Besides, the school doesn't design thin uniform, it is when after a long time of washing that the uniform becomes thin.</div></blockquote>The main issue in this discussion is whether or not the school has a right to interfere in a students private decision. The answer is a clear no. If we start allowing schools to implement any rules to suit their whims and fancies, what would be next? Maybe students must all come to sch with white teeth? (because dirty teeth is a distraction and does not match the sch's white uniform?) And does who dont brush their teeth will have their teeth being plucked out?<br>Students should come to sch with breaths that smells like mint? Those who dont will be forced fed mentos?<br><br>If we continue to allow schs to interfere with a students private life, we might as well appoint the school to be the parents of the students.<br><br>You sir, have yet to answer me on whether there is a pressing need that warrants a ban for coloured undergarments. All you have said is merely fanciful talk on the purpose of the school. True its a place for education, but you have yet to explain to me how wearing coloured bras is disadvantageous to a students learning. Does wearing coloured bra cause all the male students in the sch to fail their O lvls? And even if, there were cases of "distractions" occuring in some classes do the students stare at it continuosly for the next 5days that it has a debilitating effect on their studies?<br><br>I have repeatedly mention that there is no pressing need for such a ban because the "distraction" you talked about does not affect the students ability to study or score well in anyway.<br><br>To sum it up, you are wrong because you have failed to prove the need for the sch to ban coloured undergarments. Worst, you have shown how inhumane you are by condoning the sch's decision to strip girls of their bras. May I remind you that even prostitutes wear bras when they stand at the roadside. There can be no justification for such an unreasonable and preposterous action by the sch.<br></div>
