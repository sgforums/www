The main purpose of school is to educate students with knowledge. Here comes a certain female student who wore coloured bra and can be seen through the uniform, this distracted the male students in class and thus bringing difficulties in teaching the male students. You see my point?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by discriminated:</div><div class="quote_body">this is a letter adapted from http://poorfuhuanites.forum5.com<br><br>Okay. Here goes nothing:<br><br>I am a student currently studying in Fuhua Secondary School. I have tolerated the schoolÂ’s imbecile, inefficient and impractical way of running the school such that I am reduced to having to share my thoughts here.<br><br>Every school is bound to have students violating the school rules. Firstly, it's about the electricity problems in this school. Fuhua Secondary turns off the toilet lights 24/7 just to save electricity bills, but who doesnÂ’t know that air-conditioning consumes the most electricity? Are we trying to save that little bit of electricity just for the luxury of some, but yet the necessity of many? I find this case ridiculous as we can't possibly see even in the afternoon. The whole toilet will be left very dark and only when important guests step into Fuhua, will they then turn on the lights. So what kind of show is the school putting up in front of others? IsnÂ’t it indirectly inculcating negative values in the students?<br><br>The next thing is about grooming. Last Monday (29/01/07), when the school checked for the girlsÂ’ grooming, the teachers caught some students with fringes over their eyebrows. However, what was unexpected was that the girls were sent to the principal office and had their hair cut by the principal leaving them with straight ugly fringes. The principal should instead give a one-day grace or at least a warning before doing so, and not making the girls cry like a river in the toilets (which has no lights!). This will make them unable to concentrate on their lessons for the day. If they want to continue with their disciplinary actions this way, Fuhua students would not be convinced by the school as this is an act of public humiliation to the victims. There were students with their fringes pinned up, however some teachers caught themÂ… According to our handbook; School Rules for Pupils (2007), Page 9, Part 5.4: Girls should pin up fringes covering their eyebrows and tie up the hair covering the shoulders. Long hair must be plaited and black hair accessories may be used. So, are we also being punished for doing the right thing?<br>This made me think that Fuhua has a number of contradicting teachers, as I have also encountered such problems in the past.<br><br>Thirdly, another case I found ridiculous is that Fuhua actually reprimanded the pupils for wearing jackets in the school compound. My friends were being told off by the discipline master for wearing jackets during these days. As we all know, we are still experiencing the monsoon season. They told us that the jacket is not part of Fuhua's attire and we should not be wearing one even if it's a rainy/cold day. We are to report to the office if we are sick and our parents would be phoned to acknowledge that weÂ’re not feeling well. Only then, weÂ’re allowed to wear our jackets. But Fuhua didn't even design a jacket for us and expect us to wear only our uniforms even if we are cold. So who is to blame for not having a school jacket? The weather is really heartless these days, arenÂ’t the teachers being heartless too?<br><br>Lastly, students were caught and asked to remove their non skin-coloured undergarments and wait till their parents come with a white/skin-coloured undergarment for them. IÂ’d like to note that there isnÂ’t any restriction for females under 16 to be banned from coloured-bras, so should we blame the manufacturer for the rainbow range of colors available? I don't see the reason why girls have to take their undergarments off with boys inside the school. If the school is worried that the guys will have nasty thoughts about girls wearing coloured-bras, being totally exposed right in front of them isnÂ’t that more absurd? The disciplinary actions of Fuhua are causing the students to lose their self-esteem (Particularly girls). This is not the first time that I have read on articles regarding coloured-bras, and I feel it should be dealt with. If the school thinks that by stripping someoneÂ’s esteem will wake the student up, IÂ’m sorry. This Â‘traditional methodÂ’ has to be given up as the modern day society doesnÂ’t practice this anymore. We believe in reasoning things out rather than solving things under an iron-fist method.<br><br>The school should give an explanation to the students. Hopefully, this saga ends benefiting both the school and the students making it a better learning condition.<br><br>Thanks for your attention.<br><br></div></blockquote>TS u're from fhs? come my forum make a copy about this thread to discuss also can. basically my forum is for everything under the sun abt fuhua sec.<br><br>Ong Kian Choon is so much more reasonable than Oen Siew Yock. walao eh... Students definitely deserve better liberties.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"> but definitely the teachers would still very much follow their own guidelines, even regarding homework.<br><br>take J***s Chia the maths teacher for example. even though he has been known to always shout and nag when his students are inefficient/not on time/delaying in handing up work, he still believes in reason after all. he doesnt give ppl demerit for not handing up work unless if it's like the 3rd/4th time and he feels that too much leeway is given, and before shouting or anything, he usually gives ample chances unless enough is enough. but his teaching is still very good and effective. if my class [under him during 03/04] dunno how to do some amaths hw on new topics[esp integration], then we feedback to him on the day of submission that we are really unable to pass up bcos we are unable to understand the topic. and he'll show us how to do it during the next class. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>on the toilet lights issue i rather sensors [very low power] be used. phor's reply of toilet lights swiched on during dark/rainy days sounds too vague.<br><br>for the hair cutting.... Oen is too much! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"> i mean, some gals should be given chances [asking them to get hairpins to settle the problem RIGHT AWAY] instead of having their fringe cut. that should only be the ULTIMATE LAST RESORT which should never be used. from the number of gals summoned, i believe many of them are 1st timers and should be given chances. Self esteem is never a joke ok?<br><br>jackets/sweater matter; the school can be more understanding and allow jackets in the early morning/before recess. i know many of the nicer/more rational teachers would understand why xxx is wearing a jacket given the weather.<br><br>abt the coloured bra; as long as gals know their bra colour still maskable by the uniform, it's ok. asking gals to take off bra too much liao IMO. but i definitely know no principal would ever try to be funny abt what gals wear under. [there's no rule on 'nothing extra' other than underwear.] bcos even though some ppl's uniform machiam like becoming thinner... teachers wont really bother u. [personally i even see someone's vpl really visibly at a point of time in sec2/3... then if stand behind her also can see what's clearly inside... lol. and on PE days still same thing.]<br><br>and btw, ankle socks allowed liao ma? just know HP allowed from last year but must not be used during class time.<br><br>anyone else from fuhua; feel free to voice out your views and come to my forum to talk! ^^<br><br></div>

When you see someone everyday for four years, its not that distracting if they wear coloured bras. And who are you to judge anyway? A boob expert? Or maybe a psychiatrist specializing in distractions issit?<br><br>Its up to the student to decide what her or she wears underneath. If you're distracted by that then good luck doing anything in your life cause there are advertisments of coloured undergarments EVERYWHERE. Proving the cause that what's under your clothes should be you're own business.<br><br>As in the case of schools, unless it is CLEARLY stipulated in the school rules that coloured undergarments are not allowed and that if found guilty a student should remove the garment immediately, NO person other than the legal gurdian or the individual can decide what to do with the students own undergarment.<br><br>So until the day we become either amish or communists i say ROCK ON! to those who wanna be different and wear coloured underwear.<br><br>P.S. most guys wear coloured underwear and its actually harder to find white undergarments in the market than coloured.</div>

My school near FHSS  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>About the jacket thingy, my school also said that jacket is not part of the school uniform, but my friends usually wear it when there is no DM around. There is even once my friend who only wear the jacket and a skirt to school. My DM ask her to take off the jacket <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> she at first is relectant but the principle(female) go and unzip <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> .<br><br>About the fringe issue, maybe you should reason with the principal with Concret prove. Unless the student is caught within their hair pin, I see no reason to cut away their hair. Maybe the school should give verbal warning to the students or impose detention or CWO.<br><br>About the colour of undergarment issue, I think the school did the wrong the thing. The school should give verbal warning to the students NOT by asking them to take off the bras. This issue involve human right which can create a hugh hoha. School should enforce this as near skin colour creates unifomity. It's just like the hair issue. If everyone has their hair dyied different, then where is the unifomity?<br><br>By the way, I really impressed by your determination to stop all this probelm.
