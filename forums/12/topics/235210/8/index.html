            <div class='col-md body'>This is getting more and more interesting...<br><br>I personally don't think the problem is about whether or not students refuse to follow the school rules and obey them. It's about whether or not they mindlessly follow them, or think through the logic behind these rules.<br><br>The arguments presented here are that coloured bras provide a distraction for the guys. Perhaps not for people like me who has 'gone out of the growing up stage' (I'm only 18, btw, and is still growing up), but for the young teenagers who get excited at every simple thing the girls are 'revealing'.<br><br>But trust me, I've been that stage before (and not too long ago). Yes, I do agree that at that immature age, young boys like us will tend to pay a bit more attention to the type of undergarment the girls wear (err...but I'm out of it, ya), and talk about it for hours. It's all part of growing up.<br><br>But still, that's all! It's not as if the guys took photos of the girls and spread it over the internet, neither did the girl got raped or something. Perhaps computer gaming provides more distraction for the guys, so does it mean that the school should ban students from playing computer games? (Perhaps some would say yes, I don't know)<br><br>Besides, I really don't find wearing coloured or fanciful undergarment 'indecent'. Yes, perhaps it attracts the attention of some young boys. Pretty girls with long hair also attracts the attention of some young teenagers with ragin homones...does it mean we should make all girls wear a mask?<br><br>Back to the part on following school rules again. Like I've mentioned, while some would say that it's all about discipline and learning how to obey orders, I personally think that as thinking individuals, we should never follow rules and regulations mindlessly. Rules are there for a reason, yes. But is the reason a valid reason? This is not about being rebellious.<br><br>Perhaps one may say that the student choose the school in the first place, thus he/her have to follow it's rule. But I think the student don't hate the school as a whole. It's just a very small part of the school rule that they are unsatisfied with. There's no need to ask them to leave the school if they don't like the school rules.<br><br>And please, this forum is a place for people to debate and share their opinion or ideas...not hurl insults at each other and start a flame war. Please do not simply accuse other people as a 'pampered child' to defend your stance, it's downright lame and childish! Provide a proper argument.

Neither will the girls get raped in school, however that does not includes outside of school. About the distraction, its not about guys who talk about it after schools or during break. The distraction is when guys talk about it in lesson, thus missing important knowledge taught by teachers during lesson.<br><br>Yes, it not indecent to wear coloured bra, I agree. However, in this case it is seen through the uniform and it happens in school. You can be as indecent as you want outside but not in school as it affects others. You have to take note that school is a place for young teen/children to learn and students at this age is easily influenced. You can do harm to yourself, but not in process of when you are harming yourself, you also harm others.<br><br>If one start to be pervetic and spread his thoughts around, imagine how other guys would behave. Like I have said school is a learning insituition, therefore the one in-charge have to stamp out all obstacles that might prevent the students from studying.<br><br>Rules are created for a reason, whether is it for safety reason or to save school's face value. Whether you like it or not, you are in the school and you jolly well follow it. Don't like it? Leave then and see if other schools accept you. I've been a through sec school without any serious problem, except being late for 3 times for the entire sec school life and resulted in getting detention. I don't see the reason why can't others do it, besides those rules aren't affecting me at all. I can still play and laugh with those 'stupid' rules around.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by discriminated:</div><div class="quote_body">Lastly, students were caught and asked to remove their non skin-coloured undergarments and wait till their parents come with a white/skin-coloured undergarment for them.<br><br></div></blockquote>Anyway, according to TS, students are caught and ask to remove their coloured bra and wait for their parents to come with white/skin-coloured bra for them. This shows that the girl will not be expose to students without their bra, neither will students be walking home with their bra. So why the heck are some saying it is humiliating for the girl to be expose to students and walking home without bra. Its only short term for the girl to be without their bra, isn't it?<br><br>TS also mentioned that this result in low self-esteem among the girls? I find this sentence rather interesting.<br><br>Firstly, the students are to wait for parents to come thus no exposing to students without bra.<br><br>Secondly, without bra is only short term. Serve well as a punishment, not too overboard.<br><br>Thirdly, students nowadays have a rather thick skin don't you think? Even after getting scolded in front of class, kicked out of class, calling parents, suspension and other form of punishments, which is also so called humiliating, students still repeat their mistakes and some even laugh about it.<br><br>Forthly, how will it cause a serious low of self-esteem if the students only commit the mistake once and not many times? If so, isn't she being rebellious?<br><br>Low self-esteem? Think again.</div>

The sch should not deprive them of their dignity and assume them to be incapable of making decisions on their own.

Seriously, School uniform is not thin at all. It is only after long time of washing will then the uniform be thin and if it happens, those with right mind will think it is time to change to a new set isn't it?</div>

You said school is not allowed to interfere with  students private decision, may I remind you that you said the word 'private'. Which part of bra being seen through the uniform to the public is private? Private means you to your own self, however now it clearly shows that people other then the student, herself, is involved.<br><br>Like I said brain have to be used here, school do not make whim rules like teeth have to be white and such. So quit using the impossible as examples.</div></blockquote>Again you missed the point, the question is where do we draw the line on the action of the schools? It will set a negative precedence if schs were to start interfering in the private decisions of students. What the sch is doing is not only inhumane, but wrong in principle as well.<br><br>When I say private decisions, it refers to decision you undertake without needing the authority to carry out. Do you ask the authorities for permission before you wear bra?<br><br>Like I mentioned before, even if there were "distraction" that involve other students, is the "distraction" so imperative that we see a reduction in the other students ability to score well in the O lvls?<br><br>Interefering in the students private decision is not the way to go and is counter productive. The school should be looking at other alternative means if they are really concerned about this small issue.</div>
