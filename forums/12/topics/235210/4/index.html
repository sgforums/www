The main purpose of school is to educate students with knowledge. Here comes a certain female student who wore coloured bra and can be seen through the uniform, this distracted the male students in class and thus bringing difficulties in teaching the male students. You see my point?</div></blockquote>Yes I agree that a school is a learning instituition, however, how does bannning coloured undergarment help improves the learning process? In fact,  not only is it counter productive to a student's learning it also causes great inconvenience and infringes a student's right to wear clothes that he prefers.<br><br>Can you prove to me that staring at a female student's coloured bra reduces the overall marks of the male students? What about male students who wear black underwear with white school uniform? Will the same also be true?<br><br>Like I mention, is the problem so bad that it causes a student to fail in his O lvls? Where is the pressing need to ban coloured undergarments?<br><br>The issue here is the sch has no right to interfere in the choice of undergarments each student prefers to wear.</div>

Not only are you humiliating the girl and insulting her dignity, you are opening the possibility of the girl being raped by some horny passerbys when she walks home from sch without wearing a bra!<br><br>Such punishment is downright inhumane.
