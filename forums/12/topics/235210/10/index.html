Actually, the Principal should have just suspended the pupil, and even banned the pupil from returning to school.<br><br>If I run a soccer team, and my player refuses to be with the team, and that may include the kind of hair style worn, then I don't want that player, no matter how good he is.<br><br>The teachers are setting a good example, by knowing how to dress at the right place, and at the right time.  I'm sure these teachers had no 'hair' problems when they were pupils, and now that they are teachers, they are NOT BOUND BY THE SCHOOL UNIFORM.  So unless these students want to replace the teachers, teach, mark, set exam papers, and get paid a salary, it is ridiculous that the pupils insist the teacher act, dress and behave as they.<br><br>It's just too bad that some of these pupils have parents who don't care about how their kids dress and act in public.  But I'm certain these parents would not want their kids to be labelled as RULE BREAKERS, MAVERICKS, and downright defiant children who will bring shame to alkl the good effort of upbringing the parents have invested in.<br><br>The school cares that the pupils understand that when they step out of the school uniform, they can wear whatever they want, however they want, and whenever they want.  But it is not fair that the school's reputation is dragged through mud, and the Principal's name is ripped apart when the pupils that walk out of Fuhua's gates are considered as having come from a fashion school.  There's already Nanyang Fine Arts for that, and I don't think all of Fuhua's students would want to be associated with that kind of reputation.  Some find nerds cute, and they have their own appeal, but they still follow uniform rules.  Do these kids?<br><br>Aunties and uncles, and people of other religion walking down the streets can wear whatever they wish, and have any kind of hair style, because they ARE NOT STUDENTS of a school WITH A UNIFORM DRESS CODE!!<br><br>ANd that argument about SIngapore needing to ban stuff before it is not used is absurd.  Singapore bans pornographic media, but it's even viewed in school when the teachers are not watching in the computer labs, and some even bring their grandfather's girlie magazines to school for loaning.  I hope these girls with colourful bras realise that they are just asking for unnecessary attention, from boys and lesbians alike.  Should anything untoward happen to their bodies, serves them right.  Their faces and bodies should be sent to STOMP, and put on the blogs so that they can get the publicity they so crave for, by vitue of the fact that they want to stick out like sore thumbs!!</div>
