This shows that the girl will not be expose to students without their bra, neither will students be walking home with their bra. So why the heck are some saying it is humiliating for the goirl to be expose to students and walking home without bra. Its only short term fr the girl to be without their bra, isn't it?<br><br>TS also mentioned that this result in low self-esteem among the girls? I find this sentence rather interesting.<br><br>Firstly, the students are to wait for parents to come thus no exposing to students without bra.<br><br>Secondly, without bra is only short term. Serve well as a punishment, not too overboard.<br><br>Thirdly, students nowadays have a rather thick skin don't you think? Even after getting scolded in front of class, kicked out of class, calling parents, suspension and other form of punishments, which is also so called humiliating, students still repeat their mistakes and some even laugh about it.<br><br>Forthly, how will it cause a serious low of self-esteem if the students only commit the mistake once and not many times? If so, isn't she being rebellious?<br><br>Low self-esteem? Think again.</div></blockquote>Pardon me:<br><br>I find that most families have parents who are both working,and don't you think that this is unfair on the parents too?Also,someone in this thread(apologies for not remembering your name) mentioned that the male classmates were interested in even the slightest outline of the undergarment?I don't think the colour,whether white/skin/other is going to affect their view.And yes,I do realise this is a neutral point to make which does not go in favour of either house.<br>Query is that since we are talking about the growth spurt stage,many won't buy bras in bulk as it is so very likely that the girl will outgrow it in less than half a year.Remember that the female chest is actually a deposit of fat,and so can fluctuate slightly,but fluctuation usually stabilises when the body weight does i.e when the girl gets older.And so,especially during this wet season,the few bras that girls buy may take time to try,and white/skin bras eventually run out.I'm sure that most of the girls would actually wear the appropriate bra if they had a never-ending supply.After all,very few would purposely get into so much trouble,even if it's for the sake of rebellion.Self-esteem is valued higher than the ability to do something just to show you can.<br><br>Secondly,eh..I find that even a short-term thing can damage your self-esteem.We're talking about students who are going through the "discovery of painful self-consciousness"phase where they start preening themselves and are more aware of the opposite gender.I cannot imagine their utter embarrassment,even if it's "only" for a day.During a day,many people are encountered,and the girl is going to be most most aware of male teachers/peers,the latter group of which are probably not going to help with their gawking.In fact,instead of trying unsuccessfully to make the girls obey this rule,how about educating the male students on this issue,and how a "visual following" is wrong and should not be attempted?<strong>Since making the girls strip isn't helping them to learn to follow the rules,and unintentionally supplying the boys with "visual feasts" to "admire",I propose we educate the males in behaving properly.From there,we can decide to ask the girls to strip minus the gaping or just scrap the rule,since then the colours won't be a distracting problem any more.No more debate,no more "hated" controversial rule,no more disrespect towards the school and best of all,a not so dirty-minded population.How about that.</strong><br><br>Repeating that short-termness does affect self-esteem.For example(and please don't try and say this isn't related to anything;it's related in the sense that it's short term),pornographic pop-ups that attack websurfers while they are browsing the Net.An instinctive and expected reaction would be to ALT+F4 or click the cross,but from personal experience and the results of a survey my group had to do for ISO,that moment where you find yourself looking at the image can scar you for a long time,maybe for life(like my uncle's wife).The severity of the above example may seem so much greater,but in the phase of puberty,many will say that self-esteem is almost the most important thing.<br><br>Thirdly,this punishment is probably what encourages rebellion in the first place,by sowing the seeds of resentment and loss of respect.See,many FuHua students feel that the school is not bothering about and taking into account their feelings/opinions,and therefore they don't feel valued by FuHua.I can sympathise with this view,and I can understand why the students then lose their respect for the school.I'm not condoning such disrespect;just wondering if the cause-effect relationship has been messed up.<br>Basically,what I'm trying to say in this paragraph is that this punishment will result in a vicious cycle<br>i.e Caught&gt;Humiliation&gt;Rebellion&gt;Caught&gt;Humiliation&gt;Rebellion<br><br>And I feel that there isn't a 'severe' or 'mild' low self-esteem..any level of drop in self-esteem,especially for those in this growing-up phase,should not be taken lightly.Recovery shouldn't be taken for granted either.Some,especially the more introverted ones,can suffer life-long scars and can be affected later on in life.<br><br>--<br><br>I'm not certain if this is really a joke..after all,the school has to maintain good public relations,correct?There is a practically non-existent chance that the school would actually admit that they were serious.In the first place,I don't think they would say it was a joke(who jokes about something so serious as a self-esteem-affecting matter) if they could find another more believable reason,or should I say excuse.<br><br>Anyway,this post was made because I don't think this is the first such case(there was another one last year,I think TNP Page 1..not sure if first such case),and it definitely won't be the last.Better to voice out early on.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by discriminated:</div><div class="quote_body">this is a letter adapted from http://poorfuhuanites.forum5.com<br><br>Okay. Here goes nothing:<br><br>I am a student currently studying in Fuhua Secondary School. I have tolerated the schoolÂ’s imbecile, inefficient and impractical way of running the school such that I am reduced to having to share my thoughts here.<br><br>Every school is bound to have students violating the school rules. Firstly, it's about the electricity problems in this school. Fuhua Secondary turns off the toilet lights 24/7 just to save electricity bills, but who doesnÂ’t know that air-conditioning consumes the most electricity? Are we trying to save that little bit of electricity just for the luxury of some, but yet the necessity of many? I find this case ridiculous as we can't possibly see even in the afternoon. The whole toilet will be left very dark and only when important guests step into Fuhua, will they then turn on the lights. So what kind of show is the school putting up in front of others? IsnÂ’t it indirectly inculcating negative values in the students?<br><br>The next thing is about grooming. Last Monday (29/01/07), when the school checked for the girlsÂ’ grooming, the teachers caught some students with fringes over their eyebrows. However, what was unexpected was that the girls were sent to the principal office and had their hair cut by the principal leaving them with straight ugly fringes. The principal should instead give a one-day grace or at least a warning before doing so, and not making the girls cry like a river in the toilets (which has no lights!). This will make them unable to concentrate on their lessons for the day. If they want to continue with their disciplinary actions this way, Fuhua students would not be convinced by the school as this is an act of public humiliation to the victims. There were students with their fringes pinned up, however some teachers caught themÂ… According to our handbook; School Rules for Pupils (2007), Page 9, Part 5.4: Girls should pin up fringes covering their eyebrows and tie up the hair covering the shoulders. Long hair must be plaited and black hair accessories may be used. So, are we also being punished for doing the right thing?<br>This made me think that Fuhua has a number of contradicting teachers, as I have also encountered such problems in the past.<br><br>Thirdly, another case I found ridiculous is that Fuhua actually reprimanded the pupils for wearing jackets in the school compound. My friends were being told off by the discipline master for wearing jackets during these days. As we all know, we are still experiencing the monsoon season. They told us that the jacket is not part of Fuhua's attire and we should not be wearing one even if it's a rainy/cold day. We are to report to the office if we are sick and our parents would be phoned to acknowledge that weÂ’re not feeling well. Only then, weÂ’re allowed to wear our jackets. But Fuhua didn't even design a jacket for us and expect us to wear only our uniforms even if we are cold. So who is to blame for not having a school jacket? The weather is really heartless these days, arenÂ’t the teachers being heartless too?<br><br>Lastly, students were caught and asked to remove their non skin-coloured undergarments and wait till their parents come with a white/skin-coloured undergarment for them. IÂ’d like to note that there isnÂ’t any restriction for females under 16 to be banned from coloured-bras, so should we blame the manufacturer for the rainbow range of colors available? I don't see the reason why girls have to take their undergarments off with boys inside the school. If the school is worried that the guys will have nasty thoughts about girls wearing coloured-bras, being totally exposed right in front of them isnÂ’t that more absurd? The disciplinary actions of Fuhua are causing the students to lose their self-esteem (Particularly girls). This is not the first time that I have read on articles regarding coloured-bras, and I feel it should be dealt with. If the school thinks that by stripping someoneÂ’s esteem will wake the student up, IÂ’m sorry. This Â‘traditional methodÂ’ has to be given up as the modern day society doesnÂ’t practice this anymore. We believe in reasoning things out rather than solving things under an iron-fist method.<br><br>The school should give an explanation to the students. Hopefully, this saga ends benefiting both the school and the students making it a better learning condition.<br><br>Thanks for your attention.<br><br></div></blockquote>It's a joke that anyone is against the idea of shaming pupils.  This is Singapore, where bond breakers and litterbugs are lumped together and given the same treatment - shame for misdemeanours.  It's in our culture to value face, so the more we value it, the more it will be an effective carrot to dangle in front of our budding young asians.  They are growing up in Singapore, and they should know that this is how our society functions, where the sense of moral righteousness will lead people to shame the wrong-doers, whether it will cause emotional damage or not.  If you don't teach them when they are in school, are you suggesting that you let them experience it when they are working, and could possibly lose their job, status and moral standing, like a former NMP of ours suffered?  Not just males, but females who do not intend to go into the Army, should be given the wake-up call of what Singapore society expects of them.<br><br>Since we believe that schools should go beyond just educating the mind, then I don't see how it is improper for schools to teach pupils that there are consequences for behaviours, be they reasonable, illogical, light, outrageous, blah, blah, blah. It's up to the pupils to decide whether to act in a manner they deem fit, but surely, with the awareness that a consequence will be attached to their action.  If they wish to test the waters, make sure they come well equipped and dressed for the occasion.<br><br>On the matter of the uniform, it's true that it may have nothing to do with the pupils academic studies, but it speaks a loadful of their social and emotional development.  Whether you like it or not, the way the uniform is worn speaks volumes of the wearer (look at the ongoing debate of the Singapore Girl iconic status being challenged.  It's all about the appearance and what the appearance symbolises).  Anyone who dares to say that they should not be judged by the way they dress is just being myopic and unrealistic about the nature of humans.  FIRST IMPRESSIONS COUNT, and we are always told not to JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS COVER.  But just as we are superficially motivated by looks, and spend tonnes of dollars on cosmetics, fashion and plastic surgery, I challenge the teens of today to say that they should not be judged by their appearance, even though they can spend hours in front of the mirror preening their Chicken Little hairstyles, spend large aounts of money at Glamorshot or Hollywood Makeover for their prom nights, and cry over the one little pimple that sprouts on their adolescent face.  Even adults are victims of the same kind of vanity, so please, let's not fool ourselves into believing that pupils should be judged ONLY by their academic grades in school, because it is not REAL.<br><br>To those who say that schools should modernise their rules, I then say - BY HOW MUCH?  Whose yardstick?  The Sec Ones, or the Sec Fours/Fives?  The Primary Ones, or the Primary Sixes?  The Principal's or the Teachers'?  The conservative father, or the ultra-chic mother who owns fashion salons?  The fashion trends set by Urban, or the ones dictated by the income of the majority going to the school?<br><br>Since it is a uniform for the rich and poor, and one that allows for all sectors of morally-upright members of Singapore society to be proud of, it is inevitable that pupils, who tend to follow fashion trends of pop icons (WHO ARE NOT STUDENTS LIKE THEM AND DON"T HAVE TO REPORT TO SCHOOL) will stick out like sore thumbs and be subject to the Discipline Master's rants and raves.  And please don't talk about creativity.  Unless a pupil comes to school dressed in bottle caps and wears shoes made of car metal plates and pandan leaves, any other attempt to be "Creative" is a mere copycat of something found on a TV / Sport personality, or taken from a teenage fashion magazine!!<br><br>Did the Principal have the right to snip off the fringe?  When in Rome, Do as Rome.  If they don't like it, they can always ask to be transferred to another school, and if you're the parent and you object to being transferred, then home school your child.  You ahve rights, and you can exercise your rights, but please don't insist that your rights be shoved in the face of the one who is running the organisation (aka the Principal), and insist that every child in the school be subject to the whims and fancies of your fashion dictates.  I'm certain that some will say that the school shoud do away with rules against hair.  Let's say that your child/you are made to sit beside a boy who has beyond shoulder-length hair as he is inspired to go back to his roots, and practises unhygienic habits of not washing his hair for at least two weeks, and has dandruff, smells offensively and may even house ticks. If the school were to adopt this ruling of having NO ruling on hair, then this child should be allowed to sit with you/yours, and share his tick-infested follicular party, and not be guilty of infecting your child/you with ticks / dandruff, or of blasting your olfactory senses with BO!!<br><br>And if these girls wish to wear coloured undergarment that is obvious, they should not get upset if they have people staring at them at those private regions, since they wish to draw attention to them.  Maybe STOMP should be swapmed with photos of these girls, their faces included with their colourful undergarments.  Free publicity which will turn any proud father popular with his male colleagues!<br><br>And to those who say that students have no rights, and are treated like shit, I say, quit whining, quit school, and go be an entrepreneur. You DON"T HAVE TO TAKE THE SHIT!!  Just don't go around lamenting that your bosses treat you worse than an amoeba when you go out to work, since you CHOSE TO LEAVE THE SHITHOUSE!!<br><br>Let's cut the whining and get real, people.  Otherwise, go find and island and live your own remote life.  You don't have to wear any stupid uniform (you don't even have to wear anything, for that matter), you don't have to deal with rules (except the laws of Nature), and there's no one to go after you (except the wild creatures of your island). The only one you will be blaming will be your god, and yourself.  Now wouldn't that be the best way to live.  There's still going to be shit, but at least it's yours.</div>
