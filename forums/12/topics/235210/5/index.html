There can be no justification for such a punishment.</div></blockquote>So, walking home without bra will open possibility of getting rape. What about walking home with bra colour seen through the uniform? Won't it be the same too?<br><br>Ok it might humiliate her and insult her dignity, but isn't the rules made known to the students beforehand? So why do the girl still break the rules even after knowing that its not allow? Isn't she asking for it?<br><br>Besides, there are bound to have some that break the rules more than once even after knowing what the punishment is. If that is the case, is the word humiliate and dignity even exist in that girl?<br><br>Like what babylynn had said, the students are too pampered by their parents.</div>

All things have a reason when u are being reprimanded. Don't tell me u ppl are going to attract attention just by wearing those fancy color or types of garments to school. You ppl understand very well that ur school uniform is white n when u r wet it can be seen thru. If u want be some famous SLUT then the school is not meant for you ppls.<br><br>STUDENTS NOWADAYZ JUST WASTING THIER PARENTS MONEY AND EXPECT ALL RIDICULOUS ATTENTION... ITS USELESS TO TELL U GUYS AGAIN N AGAIN COZ U R NOT EARNING FOR LIVING. WAIT TILL U EARN URSELF A LIVING THEN U WILL UNDERSTAND.</div></blockquote>When it rains , some people do feel cold. It is only reasonable to assume all individuals are not alike and some may be more sensitive to temperatures than others.<br><br>As for color undergarments - read carefully - they make them go braless.  Now I feel that is outrageous. That is not helping the matter. How would you like your male classmates to stare at u braless? Coercing them into removing their bras especially in a conservative culture is considered sexual harassment and any parent will be furious.<br><br>Girls with long fringes. . Yes no one told them to keep their hair unruly but it is only fair to issue a warning before proceeding with the punishment. If the warning is not heeded, you proceed with the punishment .<br><br>We are not talking about open student rebellion or rioting here. We are talking about senseless punishments. How are children to know that they are  in the wrong if it is not explained to them or if they are not warned? Alot of things are not stipulated in school rules and it is unfair to punish them suddenly when the school rules have an unwritten change.<br><br>One has to be reasonable with punishing teenagers or children.<br><br>You want conformity? Make the teachers conform - no long fringes for the teachers, no colored undergarments etc. I remembered a teacher of mine who like to wear see thru clothing and miniskirts almost like some hooker on geylang. That should be a bad example by your logic.<br><br>They are a model for these students and surely you cannot have a double standard.  If they can't conform , then these kids shouldn't be punished severely for trivial matters either. What the teachers do or wear out of school , I don't care.<br></div>
