From what you have written, you seem to assume that because you have done so much for her, that you have done your best, she should love you.<br><br>Well here's news for you... she might actually love someone that treats her badly, that is not suitable for her, that beats her up, and she loves him more than you. The reason is that the other guy that is "bad" for her, makes her heart beats faster whenever she sees him whereas when she sees you, nothing.<br><br>Let her go lah... find someone that makes your heart beat faster and as well as you make her heart beat faster.</div>

We talked of getting engaged once she graduate and getting married once she completes her masters. She always said she was very sure that IÂ’m the one for her.<br><br>I graduated and went back to complete the last 3 months of my NS as I was a disruptee. She had a part time job but we will still meet everyday either to go out for dinner or shopping (she loves shopping and we would go out everyday last time).. Before ord, I got a job and everything seemed so right and wonderful.. Then suddenly one month ago, I was at her house on Sunday as usual to accompany her for dinner (she usually skips her meals if she doesnÂ’t have anyone to accompany her as both her parents are working and her sis is also lazy). She said that she donno the feeling of being single as she had been in quite a lot of r/s before and she was too young to commit (she have a lot of male frens ard her). I asked her if she was thinking of breaking up but she said she still wanna to be with me. She even left an alarm in my phone saying that she will love me forever and ever..<br><br>The next day, she started to tell me not to look for her after work (I used to go find her in school after work everyday), saying that she is busy with her school stuffs, it is very tiring for me and we can always meet up during the weekend.. I was reluctant as I was not really used not seeing her but tot it would be good as she can concentrate on her school work and I can concentrate on my new job too. But we would still talk on the phone as usual (we talk every night before we sleep), saying that we missed each other and lets go for a movie as we had only watched one movie together Icoz she only wanted to shop whenever we went out). I went to find the timings but in the end she complained that she had too much work and postponed the event. Asked her out for a quick dinner but she said sheÂ’s tired. Wanted to takeaway dinner to her house like what I would do during exams last time but she refused too. Then came Friday and I went back sch to find her as I bought something from candy empire for her. I didnÂ’t tell her that I was going to look for her but I asked her fren where they were.<br><br>When I appeared, she looked shocked and turned to her fren saying Â‘F, why is he here? What happened to ******?Â’ I was quite shocked by her behavior and naturally I wasnÂ’t happy. The dinner was also weird as she behaved strangely. She explained later that nite that she was afraid that ****** (a fren who her fren intro to her and they were quite closed to each other now as she hate to study alone and ****** will accompany her as he stays in hall) will not have any seats as we were taking her frenÂ’s car out for dinner and there were quite a few of us. I tot its funny as we used to squeeze more ppl in the car before. Then I asked her about our plans to go out the next day but she said that sheÂ’s meeting her ex and she will be tired after that. I donÂ’t wanna force her but was very upset actually as I was looking forward to Sat and partly of what happened in school. Sat passed and came Sunday, she called me at 4pm saying that I donÂ’t need to buy her dinner, she can take care of herself.. so I went to take a nap.. she called me at 419 saying that she had no more feelings for me and she wanna break up. I was stunned and never said much. She said sheÂ’s sorry.<br></div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Indeed, a fairy tale relationship in the beginning will keep you drunk with Love's ale of happiness, but how would your relationship truly fare in the looming cosmic lessons of love?<br><br>And it actually shows: in your first report card, it was an utterly failure.
