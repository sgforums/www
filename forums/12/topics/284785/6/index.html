            <div class='col-md body'>Hi guys, this is another long post.. and hopefully it will be my last post.<br><br>Been trying to forget abt her these few days. She also din called me since that nite. The feelings on every morning and before bed time are the worst. Saw them together in my dreams on wed nite and the next morning when I woke up, my pillow was wet. Tried to absorb all the advice given by u guys.. Feeling confused and just now, I did something despicable.. I went to check her email. We knew each other passwords coz she would ask me to help her send stuffs last time and my passwords are all her name.<br><br>Browsed through and saw an email from that guy dated 1st Oct (last Mon). The previous night was the day she sms me saying that she missed me and she would like me to know it. ThatÂ’s why I bought her dinner, hugged and kissed on her bed even though we had already broken up the previous week. She asked me to sing ai hen jian dan by david tao and she slept at my arms. Even told me that thereÂ’s chance betw us except she donÂ’t wanna promise first.<br><br>Now after seeing that mail, I finally woke up. IÂ’m really just a convenience store. Just because someone isnÂ’t free and IÂ’m stupid enough to fill his shift for him, thinking that our r/s has a chance. IÂ’m just dumb, dumb and dumb. So i decided get her out of my mind. I swear I wun cry for her anymore. Changed all my passwords. Deleted her msn although she can still see me but at least I wun see her. Have to find a day to keep all her things away; the receipts of my gifts to her, our meals together. This gonna keep me busy for quite sometime.<br><br>Finally, I wanna thank all of u (Yunhaier, Smudgey, Guardx, Jojobeach, ordinaryguy32, digicharat and a lot more) who had given me advice. Really really thankful to all u guys for even bothering to read my threads and replied.<br><br>Thank you to all of u. God bless.</div>
