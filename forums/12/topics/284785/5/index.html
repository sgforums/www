Not all girls love you for your money, but if you have alot of money, you can do things that normal man wouldn't. E.g. fireworks with some messages on it, your video on every outdoor TV to show your affection to her. You can have the power and time to do and satisfy the girl needs. It can even make your weakness look much less of a weakness. Don't tell me no need money also can be happy or even happier than those got money. If you have the choice, I'm certain you wouldn't choose to be no money.</div>
