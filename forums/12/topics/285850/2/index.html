I am not sure whether she is really interested in me or does she treat all her friends the same way. Cos from her blog, I can see that there are a couple of close male friends in her life.<br><br>2. I am not sure whether I can juggle my sch work and r/s with her if I really get tgt with her.<br><br>3. I am really a shy guy like she said and when it comes to matters of the heart I dunno what to do. I nv had any female friends, not in contact with any over sms or msn.. not even sec sch frens. So i feel i am inexperience and I got no idea whether I really like her. I dunno whats the feeling of love. But everytime i would yearn to see her online and talk to her.<br><br>I do not understand myself and dunno if I really love her. How can i find the answer. I feel quite troubled over this.<br><br>What should I do now? My friends told me to talk to her more face to face and also ask her out.</div></blockquote>You don't have to do anything, you do not know if you like her or not... that is normal. That is what dating is for. To get to know each other.<br><br>So, date her out and if you like her and she rejects you, no problem, date another girl out and if you feel the need, come here to whine about how terrible it is.<br><br>If she likes you but you reject her after a few dates, introduce her to this forum to whine about how bad you are...<br><br>Life is like that, no more, no less.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Protollium,<br>I hope the KY is not the type of gel I am aware of... anyway jokes aside, seems like you are really confused and I guess you are attracted to girls who are pretty much the sociable type.<br><br>Actually, before you can immerse yourself in a relationship, consider if you can handle her being nice and friendly as before with other guys. If not, you might as well stop now. And by the way, I am getting the idea that you have never gone out with her before and basically chat on MSN??? duh...<br><br>If you really want to talk to her and discuss about you, her, everything, movies and cinemas are the lousiest place you can go. Why? How can you even talk to her in a cinema? In my humblest opinion, wine or beer garden will be nice... you know, a bit of alcohol can do wonders in opening up the heart to say what's not meant to be said. Of course, that could backfire on you as well.<br><br>And if you are worried about the "other guys" thing, a bit of observation while you are drinking with her can often pin down the type of guys she is eyeing at.<br><br>Do not cloud your mind by her "MSN" charm, it may not be the truth.</div>
