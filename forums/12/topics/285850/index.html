Maybe you are just yearning for some company. She is just what you want, company. Just leave it at that at the moment.<br><br>Thinking too much will only result in no tangible gains and intangible losses (eg emotional hurt). Unless the signs are very very obvious (like she get angry with you if you fail to chase away someone who is going after her), if not she is probably extroverted/outgoing/friendly.<br><br>My advice is to just keep it at the friend level unless something disturbs this equilibrium.</div>

Open up your social circle of female friends. Do not make her the center of your "love" existence since you have no idea whether you like her because you think she also perhaps has some liking for you. The more female friends you have, the more you would be able to tell what kind of traits you would want in your relationship. This is from my experience.<br><br>2. Since you are unsure whether a rs would work out, make studies your first priority. If it is meant to be, everything will fall into place later.<br><br>3. Having said all, experience is what make people grow. If you think you have some liking for her, perhaps take cue from your friends, ask to meet her up face to face as friends first.. like maybe innocently ask her whether she like to see a movie or have dinner together or something. At the same time, expand your social circle with other girls, meet other girls if possible too as friends to interract. You don't have to commit to a relationship. Like what KY has said:<br><br><blockquote>She told me before that she was not actively looking for a BF now </blockquote>so maybe it can work the same way for you. You're only trying to get to know more friends. If you feel that strongly for her that you think what you have is more than normal liking for her, then pursue her. Call me old fashion but I feel guys should be more on the initiative side if they think they really like a girl. All in all, experience counts but you'll have to go through it 1st hand. Even if you get rejected, at least you've tried your best and at least you know you have loved.<br><br>So, don't get troubled over what you haven't even tried. Don't worry about what will happen in future and don't even try to picture her as your future wife immediately! Just hang around and let the feelings flow, then you will know whether you truly like her or not. Also, make more new female friends. Take more initiative to know them. Then you will find out what you really want.</div>

But i still treat her nicely such like i treat other female friends. With this kind of action, any inexperienced guy will get con that the girl like him... lol <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> Therefore, i am very certain to tell TS, she doesn't like u.... don't believe go confess lor... get hurt dun find me <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

I only manged to talk to her on two occasions at the bus interchange.<br><br>Then sch starts and we return to our respective lives. One day i found out that someone added me on msn ans as always, i just added the contact. It was actually KY and I was quite surprised cos at that time I din really know her that well. I just quite curious and so asked our common friend about this and he told me not to imagine things cos he told me KY is that sort of gal.<br><br>Anyway, since then ky and I would chat on msn about sch work, internship matters etc. 50% of the time she would say hi to me first on msn. Slowly we talked about our views on BGR and this lasted for about 8 weeks till now. I guess we are flirting with each other. When she returns from afk, she would tell me that she is back.<br><br>She told me before that she was not actively looking for a BF now and she knows that I am single cos our common fren told her about it. Every now and then she would mention me in her blog and we would chat on msn till 2, 3 am.<br><br>I feel like she is dropping hints to me on msn and showed signs of interest or rather she has a good impression of me. Once I asked her how she thinks about me and she said that I am a shy guy. Ahe also mentioned that I am a special friend to her. I see her in the lecture theatre for one of my modules but we nv spoke b4 in sch.<br><br>Now comes the problem:<br>1. I am not sure whether she is really interested in me or does she treat all her friends the same way. Cos from her blog, I can see that there are a couple of close male friends in her life.<br><br>2. I am not sure whether I can juggle my sch work and r/s with her if I really get tgt with her.<br><br>3. I am really a shy guy like she said and when it comes to matters of the heart I dunno what to do. I nv had any female friends, not in contact with any over sms or msn.. not even sec sch frens. So i feel i am inexperience and I got no idea whether I really like her. I dunno whats the feeling of love. But everytime i would yearn to see her online and talk to her.<br><br>I do not understand myself and dunno if I really love her. How can i find the answer. I feel quite troubled over this.<br><br>What should I do now? My friends told me to talk to her more face to face and also ask her out.</div></blockquote>If she pop the magical question of "Do u like me?". WHat will u reply her?</div>

For me, I'd say yours is a case where the signs are more ambiguous and you really need to know the person well (try observing her body language when you're with her).<br><br>Take the above as an example - it can be interpreted in one of two ways and I'm not surprised different people have interpreted that differently. On one hand, she could regard you as a good friend and therefore lets you in on some details about her personal life. On the other, it could be her way of hinting (and this other guy wanting to ask her out might not even be remotely true) that you better act fast before you lose her. Unfortunately, what you've described leads you no closer to deciphering the essence of what she said and it'd probably be wise to trust your gut instinct here...</div>
