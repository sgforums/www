              Thanks Summer hill,
              
              I think it will work but it will make me look like a freak. I may well end up in IMH.

              I am returning some names to you as I find you more fitting for them.
              
              1) Manipulative - You have persistently twist, turn, cut and manipulate my words to your 
              advantage and used them against me. Who is being manipulative here ? It is you.
              
              2) strong arm his own neighbor into submission - Your constant names calling, making up wild guess, accusation and strong words trying to make me bow to your demand, deserved this name better.  
              
              Your obsessive behavior have make me come to think you are the one that is sick, perhaps you should seek some help.

              Thanks.
              
              But I have to clarify, I am not asking for sympathy or support. I am asking if anybody have such experience and can share about it.
              
              I have lived in HDB flats for over 40 years, my family moved into a flat when i was in primary school, upgrade to bigger unit as we grow, then we got married and moved out of parent house.
              
              Over the years, I have many neighbors, friendly neighbors, neighbor who don't talk to anybody unless necessary, a cats sanctuary, weird neighbors and neighbors associated with ah long.
              
              I had a neighbor that at any one time, more than 20 cats at home. if we keep our door open long enough, some cats will come in and want to play with us. And a family that cook and eat at the corridor. A couple chanting all day.  Karaoke family.  But we never have problem with each others.
              
              We never have any problem with any neighbor, until now.

              <p>Dear CHLIM,</p>
              <p>I read the whole thread. I understand what you shared.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Btw you ignore jojobich. I had a very bad experience with that bichy-bich. She basically here to bark at anyone who try to seek help in this forum. She is a psycho. I guess she is a housewife, and don't do anything else other than barking here. Look at this topic I started more than an year ago: http://sgforums.com/forums/12/topics/446221 . And see the disgusting offensive words used by this bich, which provoked me too to be abusive at her. I see her unreasonable claims againt you and your wife.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now let me come back to the issue you discuss. Unlike JOJObeach claimed, the camera is not installed in "public" place. That jojobich certainly will not like when someone put a video camera on her when she is standing in some genuine public place like a bus-stop, will she? Or, when some one stare at her, won't she complain?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Well, now Mr LIM, I will tell you how I will handle this issue. If the problem is to me, I will be patient. If it is to my family, I can't have that freedom, as I am the person to give my family the security they want. So I will have to deal with it. Since they don't seem to be understanding, and want to be hostile, I will exactly do what you do. And just do only that much. </p>
              <p>You write to HDB via email (email will help as you will have proof), whether you are allowed to put a camera on them without HDB permission, in retaliation to the installed cameras. This email will make them act fast. Either they will see to the extent the cameras are removed. If they (HDB) don't respond, spend S$1000, and put a camera camera on your troublesome neighbour. It can serve in two ways. It can be in retaliation, next it can be for your family's security as well.</p>

              Thanks Taj.deen.84,
              
              I am only asking if anyone have similar experience to share as this is the largest forum in SG.
              
              Looks like I have a bad start due to my rusty writing skill but that doesn't  discourage me.
              
              Lets just let this thread fade away but I may just hang around and do my bit as what you have did.

              jojobeach,
              
              I am returning some names to you as I find you more fitting for them.
              
              1) Manipulative â€“ You have persistently twist, turn, cut and manipulate my words to your
              advantage and used them against me. Who is being manipulative here ? It is you.
              
              2) strong arm his own neighbor into submission â€“ Your constant names calling, making up wild guess, accusation and strong words trying to make me bow to your demand, deserved this name better.
              
              Your obsessive behavior have make me come to think you are the one that is sick, perhaps you should seek some help.
              
              I am too tired to play more words game with you. This is my last reply to you and all your future posting in this thread.

              <p>To dear CHLIM,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I understand the trauma and disturbance that you may be going through right now. A house is where you belong, where your home is, and you have the right to live happily and free of worries. What your neighbour has decided to do, has affected your capacity and ability to live and feel at ease even in your home. I sympathize with your circumstances, as there is always a possibility that this manner of disturbance can cause worries and affect the health and well-being of a person. If one is unable to relax even in their home, where can they go, and what can they do? </p>
              <p>Please ignore users - jojobeach, because they are unable to comprehend what you are facing. I suggest reporting the user, or removing all of the offensive posts to you and your family. </p>
              <p>You have my support, and please do not allow unnecessary and negative comments affect your life any further. Neighbour disputes can result in dire consequences and should not be taken too lightly. Take care. </p>
