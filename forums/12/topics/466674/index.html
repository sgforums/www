              <li>Dear all,</li>
              </ul>
              <p><br>I need advice. My wife has gone hysterical and I am desperate.<br><br>My wife have been harassed and stalked by our neighbor with the help of the CCTV cameras outside their house. They have installed 3 cameras in 2011 after some loan shark harassment. One camera is in front of the lift, a second camera near the stair and a third on top of their door which is diagonally opposite of ours.</p>
              <p><br>The loan shark harassment did not last long and they still keep the cameras there but we did not really mind despite my wife's uneasiness. We were getting along fine with this neighbor, a couple in their 30's and 2 young children.</p>
              <p>Then sometime last year, the woman next door started to get unfriendly with us over some ridiculous accusation and we stopped talking to them. When thing got worst after continuous provocation from her to engage us in some verbal exchange, we got into some heated argument and her husband stepped in. We have managed to resolved the conflict and thing get quiet for a while.</p>
              <p>Recently, the woman next door started to harass my wife again. After each harassment, my wife was left shaken and have a stomach cram for hours.  Both me and my wife are over 50 years of age and my wife is not in the best of health.<br><br>We believed that, with the help of their CCTV, the woman next door have always timed her appearance at their doorstep precisely, when my wife is at the corridor, coming or leaving home, alone or with our 4 years old daughter. <br><br>We approached the husband next door, but this time, he also get hostile at us and challenge us to call the police or sue them in court.  All the while, we have not call in the police as we have known that this is a neighbour conflict, and the police could only advice us to settle it in a friendly manner.<br><br>My wife was very upset and called HDB to enquire about the cameras, she was directed to the Town Council office and was told that an officer will look into this matter. My wife saw somebody visited the neighbor the following day and later, the officer from Town Council called my wife and told her about his finding.<br><br>In his own words, the town council officer told my wife that the cameras will not be removed as the neighbor planned to extend their permit. She was told that only 2 of the cameras are real and the one pointing at our door is a dummy. He also told her that the neighbor offered to remove the dummy camera pointing at our door if she find it offending.<br><br>After receiving the call, my wife was feeling so bad I have to rush home from work to see to her.  Later that night, I went to the Police Center and file a report against my neighbor. It was last Friday night.<br><br><br>On the following Monday morning, I called the town council officer to enquire further on how long are they permitted to have those cameras installed and how many units are allowed.  I have insisted on knowing and told him that I have already lodged a police report.</p>
              <p>Reluctantly, he told me that our neighbor <span style="color: #ff0000;">DID NOT</span> have a permit to install those cameras at the corridor.  They are in the process of applying for a permit now and he has allowed then to leave the cameras as they are.<br><br>I was furious, I have insisted that the cameras should be taken down immediately and he agreed. I have also follow up with an email, attached a copy of the police report to the Town Council, copy to the HDB branch office and chairman of the Town council. I have plea with them for some immediate action and also not to grant any permit to have cameras installed at our corridor, should the neighbor apply for one.<br><br>That evening, when I got home from work, I stepped out of the lift and took few steps into the corridor, that woman started cursing at us loudly inside their house. Their door is always opened while we prefer to keep door shut. The Town Council officer must have notified them.  And they have has no direct view of the lift lobby. Its those cameras again.<br><br>Today, it has been 3 days now since I sent that email. I have received auto-reply from the town council and HDB but no formal acknowledgement that this issue have been looked into. So I called the town council officer again and was told that he have notified the neighbor to remove the cameras and they have agreed. He will also follow up with a written notification to them but have no date-line on when those cameras will be removed.  <br><br>Those cameras have been there illegally for more than a year now, I just wonder how long they will drag on ?  I took half a day of urgent leave yesterday afternoon and a whole day today as my wife is in a very bad emotional state.<br><br><br>My question:<br><br>Is there anyone here with similar experience to share on how you deal with them ?<br><br>It appear that the Town Council is taking a very lenient view to this offence and have no intention to take any action against them. In fact, have allow them take their time to remove those cameras.<br><br>Is there any cause of action I can take as my wife have suffered this mental torturing long enough. Legal action is too costly and lengthy,  and violent is not in our nature.<br><br>Any constructive advice will be much appreciated.</p>
              <p>Thanks for reading this long winded posting.</p>

              <p>Your wife is just being <strong>manipulative</strong>.</p>
              <p>Why is she being "harrassed" by the camera ? Is she afraid of getting caught on tape doing something bad ?</p>
              <p>Like stealing your neighbour shoes or bringing a man home ?</p>
              <p>There are many CCTV in our public places, is she going hysterical over those too ?</p>
              <p>Something is very wrong with the way your wife is reacting to the cameras.</p>
              <p>Mental torturing? More like your wife has mental problem and is taking it out on your neighbour.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A cctv outside your house adds security to your door.</p>
              <p>I suggest you maintain a harmonious relationship with your neighbout , just in case anyone invade your house, you can ask for the footage from your neighbour.</p>
              <p>I have security camera installed in my property, and our video footage helped our neighbour catch a vandal throwing eggs at their property.</p>

              <p>Your anger against your neighbour is related to the DISPUTE and ANIMOSITY you have against them.</p>
              <p>A lot of people install CCTV to DETER mischief and increase security.</p>
              <p>The fact that you and your neighbour are not on good terms bellies the hatred you have against them "surveiling" the public area outside your door.</p>
              <p>If anything, this has nothing to do with legal or illegal cameras.</p>
              <p>This has a lot to do with you wanting to PUNISH your neighbour and making them bow down to YOUR demand.</p>
              <p>If you can manage to get the authorities to bring down the camera, it will be a win for your EGO and a lose for your neighbour.</p>
              <p>I suggest you settle the dispute amicably instead of using authorities as <strong>tools</strong> to fight against your neighbour.</p>
              <p>Remember that your neighbour will be your closest ally living, so close to you for many years to come. The last thing you really want is make enemies out of them.</p>
              <p>The authorities are to serve everyone,<strong> including</strong> your neighbour. Not just you and your hysterical wife.</p>
              <p>If you continue harrassing your neighbour after they get their permit, they may have the right to sue you for harrassment.</p>
              <p>Given the current bad blood you have against them, they have the right to protect their family against YOU and your crazy wife.</p>

              <p>actually i dont understand the whole story.. stalked my cctv? and what was the misunderstanding that started this stalking?</p>
              <p>Frankly if your neighbour is mental with or without the cctv the issue wont solve.. and your insistant on the cctv will make matter worst...if he want to point the cctv directly at you, from what in know.. you cant do anythg also.. as is not illegal...</p>
              <p>My suggestion is seek RC help, if they cant... File a report with CMC (community mediation centre) <a href="http://www.cmc.gov.sg/">http://www.cmc.gov.sg/</a></p>

              <p>To Newbie,</p>
              <p>You are right, even with the cemeras gone, the problem will still remain. I have spoken to a RC member before but did not ask for their help.</p>
              <p>They have shut us out and only trying to win other neighbors over,  the RC maybe a neutral party we can talk to.</p>
              <p>Will go and see the RC later.</p>

              <p>Your anger against your neighbour is related to the DISPUTE and
                  ANIMOSITY you have against them.</p>
              <p>A lot of people install CCTV to DETER mischief and increase
                  security.</p>
              <p>The fact that you and your neighbour are not on good terms
                  bellies the hatred you have against them "surveiling" the public
                  area outside your door.</p>
              <p>If anything, this has nothing to do with legal or illegal
                  cameras.</p>
              <p>This has a lot to do with you wanting to PUNISH your neighbour
                  and making them bow down to YOUR demand.</p>
              <p>If you can manage to get the authorities to bring down the
                  camera, it will be a win for your EGO and a lose for your
                  neighbour.</p>
              <p>I suggest you settle the dispute amicably instead of using
                  authorities as <strong>tools</strong> to fight against your
                  neighbour.</p>
              <p>Remember that your neighbour will be your closest ally living,
                  so close to you for many years to come. The last thing you really
                  want is make enemies out of them.</p>
              <p>The authorities are to serve everyone,
                  <strong>including</strong> your neighbour. Not just you and your
                  hysterical wife.</p>
              <p>If you continue harrassing your neighbour after they get their
                  permit, they may have the right to sue you for harrassment.</p>
              <p>Given the current bad blood you have against them, they have the
                  right to protect their family against YOU and your crazy wife.</p>

              <p>There are always 3 sides to a story...  his story, their story and the truth.</p>
              <p>Don't believe a person to be innocent so soon, just because he comes to you to complain first.</p>
              <p>Read the whole text and look at the issue objectively.</p>
              <p>The two sides are at odds at each other.</p>
              <p>Don't be too quick to assume TS is not the BAD neighbour.</p>
              <p>His wife is obviously a little bit psycho and shown hostility towards that family with young children.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There is valid reason why that family is being defensive against TS and his wife.</p>
              <p>If my neighbour is hostile towards me, I'd do the same as what his neighbour did too.  And every time they call police , is every evidence I will use against him in a civil harrassment suit.</p>
              <p>If TS and his wife had been cordial , TS wouldn't need to resort to calling in police and seeking higher authorities to take down his own neighbour.</p>
              <p>Good neighbours talk things out with each other, without the need to call police, see MP, call up town council.. etc etc..</p>
              <p>Neighbours are suppose to look out for each other.</p>
              <p>TS and his wife are simply back stabbing neighbours who needed to strong arm his own neighbour into <strong>submission</strong>.</p>
              <p> Go to youtube and witness how many nasty neighbour fights are caught on CCTV.</p>

              <ul>
              <li>Dear all,</li>
              </ul>
              <p><br> I need advice. My wife has gone hysterical and I am
              desperate.<br> <br> My wife have been harassed and stalked by our neighbor with the
              help of the CCTV cameras outside their house. They have installed 3
              cameras in 2011 after some loan shark harassment. One camera is in
              front of the lift, a second camera near the stair and a third on
              top of their door which is diagonally opposite of ours.</p>
              <p><br> The loan shark harassment did not last long and they still keep the
              cameras there but we did not really mind despite my wife's
              uneasiness. We were getting along fine with this neighbor, a couple
              in their 30's and 2 young children.</p>
              <p>Then sometime last year, the woman next door started to get
              unfriendly with us over some ridiculous accusation and we stopped
              talking to them. When thing got worst after continuous provocation
              from her to engage us in some verbal exchange, we got into some
              heated argument and her husband stepped in. We have managed to
              resolved the conflict and thing get quiet for a while.</p>
              <p>Recently, the woman next door started to harass my wife again.
              After each harassment, my wife was left shaken and have a stomach
              cram for hours.  Both me and my wife are over 50 years of age
              and my wife is not in the best of health.<br> <br> We believed that, with the help of their CCTV, the woman next door
              have always timed her appearance at their doorstep precisely, when
              my wife is at the corridor, coming or leaving home, alone or with
              our 4 years old daughter.<br> <br> We approached the husband next door, but this time, he also get
              hostile at us and challenge us to call the police or sue them in
              court.  All the while, we have not call in the police as we
              have known that this is a neighbour conflict, and the police could
              only advice us to settle it in a friendly manner.<br> <br> My wife was very upset and called HDB to enquire about the cameras,
              she was directed to the Town Council office and was told that an
              officer will look into this matter. My wife saw somebody visited
              the neighbor the following day and later, the officer from Town
              Council called my wife and told her about his finding.<br> <br> In his own words, the town council officer told my wife that the
              cameras will not be removed as the neighbor planned to extend their
              permit. She was told that only 2 of the cameras are real and the
              one pointing at our door is a dummy. He also told her that the
              neighbor offered to remove the dummy camera pointing at our door if
              she find it offending.<br> <br> After receiving the call, my wife was feeling so bad I have to rush
              home from work to see to her.  Later that night, I went to the
              Police Center and file a report against my neighbor. It was last
              Friday night.<br> <br> <br> On the following Monday morning, I called the town council officer
              to enquire further on how long are they permitted to have those
              cameras installed and how many units are allowed.  I have
              insisted on knowing and told him that I have already lodged a
              police report.</p>
              <p>Reluctantly, he told me that our neighbor <span style="color: #ff0000;">DID NOT</span> have a permit to install those
              cameras at the corridor.  They are in the process of applying
              for a permit now and he has allowed then to leave the cameras as
              they are.<br> <br> I was furious, I have insisted that the cameras should be taken
              down immediately and he agreed. I have also follow up with an
              email, attached a copy of the police report to the Town Council,
              copy to the HDB branch office and chairman of the Town council. I
              have plea with them for some immediate action and also not to grant
              any permit to have cameras installed at our corridor, should the
              neighbor apply for one.<br> <br> That evening, when I got home from work, I stepped out of the lift
              and took few steps into the corridor, that woman started cursing at
              us loudly inside their house. Their door is always opened while we
              prefer to keep door shut. The Town Council officer must have
              notified them.  And they have has no direct view of the lift
              lobby. Its those cameras again.<br> <br> Today, it has been 3 days now since I sent that email. I have
              received auto-reply from the town council and HDB but no formal
              acknowledgement that this issue have been looked into. So I called
              the town council officer again and was told that he have notified
              the neighbor to remove the cameras and they have agreed. He will
              also follow up with a written notification to them but have no
              date-line on when those cameras will be removed. <br> <br> Those cameras have been there illegally for more than a year now, I
              just wonder how long they will drag on ?  I took half a day of
              urgent leave yesterday afternoon and a whole day today as my wife
              is in a very bad emotional state.<br> <br> <br> My question:<br> <br> Is there anyone here with similar experience to share on how you
              deal with them ?<br> <br> It appear that the Town Council is taking a very lenient view to
              this offence and have no intention to take any action against them.
              In fact, have allow them take their time to remove those
              cameras.<br> <br> Is there any cause of action I can take as my wife have suffered
              this mental torturing long enough. Legal action is too costly and
              lengthy,  and violent is not in our nature.<br> <br> Any constructive advice will be much appreciated.</p>
              <p>Thanks for reading this long winded posting.</p>

              <p>To jojobeach,</p>
              <p>Finally you have quoted a correct sentence from my posting. </p>
              <p>I am 52 years of age and my daughter is 4 yrs old. Yes, we are an old couple with a young child, go ahead and laugh if you want.</p>
              <p>Stop calling my wife names. She is perfectly normal. At times, she was upset becasued of the harassment and stalking she is receiving from our neighbor.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In the first place, our neighbor did not have a permit to install those camera. Even if they do have a permit, they are only allowed to have it for 3 to 6 months. </p>
              <p>We don' t own anything outside our door but we deserved to have our own privacy and space without being watched and record on video by any beighbor.</p>
              <p>Those cameras are invading our privacy and we have the rights to have them removed.  Hands up anybody, who likes to be watched and recorded by your neighbor at your own door step ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I hope I have answered your question.  Now can you answer mine ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>All your posting in this thread are very rude towards me and especially my wife.</p>
              <p>Those things that you have said are not true, where did you get them from ?</p>
              <p>Are you our neighbor ?  If you are maybe we can talk about it here since you have refused to talk to me and challenged me to call the police or sue you in court.</p>
              <p>If you are speaking for our neighbor, perhalps you have to get all the facts straight before posting it online.</p>
              <p> </p>

              Nick-picking again ?
              
              I stand by everything I said here.  They installed 3 cameras and we did not know until notified by the estate officer that the 1 at the top of their door is a dummy. 
              
              Now, can you answer my question ?

              <p>Mr CHLim, I am glad I am not your neighbour. </p>
              <p>To have a crazy neighbour like you is very unlucky.</p>
              <p>Why dont you go talk to your neighbour instead of being a coward hiding behind authorities ? </p>
              <p>I am merely copying and pasting from your original post.</p>
              <p>May I suggest you go and read your rant..and realise how insane you are.</p>
              <p>Your 50 year old wife is a drama queen, simple as that. Getting upset because she can't have her way. Over a dummy camera indeed. </p>
              <p>You need to stop enabling her manipulative behavior by first growing a pair of man balls .</p>
