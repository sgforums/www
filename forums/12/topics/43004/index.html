You've explained so dun confuse yourself again. You know it tt she has to be presentable n well, attractive &amp; charming. Even a whore who dressed with nothing does not deserve being raped, not to mention your mum who is dressing for her career.<br><br>Fren, I can be frank with you. Though I hate stares from men at the wrong area (breasts) but i can assure you (deep down in my heart) tt it is definitely a confident boost for me &amp; thankful for the asset tt I have. Im juz 22 but your mum's already 46. Who wldnt wanna attract stares from men at this age? Pls be more u/standing &amp; be able to analyze the situation carefully.<br><br>Your revenge for your mum isnt the right thing, she doesnt deserve all these. You shld be protecting her as a son now, instead of the one to hurt her. Stand up for her &amp; be like a man. To lust for your mum is perhaps another revenge when you recall the scene when you saw her sprawled on the floor like a helpless woman. Not the mum you know but another person. I dunno what Im typing too now but I do know 1 thing, your mum isnt wrong. Stop your revenge on her &amp; start to protect her from tt bastard man. If you need help, I can even lend a hand to deal with tt bastard colleague of ur mum's.</div>
