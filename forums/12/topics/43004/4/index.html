It is so easy to criticize you when your problems are like from a book.<br><br>Think back of those times when you were a little boy and how your mom looked after you.  I don't doubt that she's a bad mother.  I have a friend who's father died young and was look after by his mother.  I think she's wonderful.  Imagine working to bring up a kid.  It is not easy.<br><br>Question is - Do you care enough about your mother?  Would you want someone you care about to be used by his colleague, abused by someone as close as his son??<br><br>So STOP adding fuel to the fire and causing her more pain.  She had a traumatic experience already.  She needs support from you and NOT little pranks....<br><br>Deal with her colleague immediately.  She's a director and she's being abused by an underling?!?  Can't you see what's happening?  If I were you.... think of some way to teach him a lesson.  He disgusts me so much that I might want to CASTRATE him.  If you report him to the police, he will be tried and probably sent to jail to be FUXXED by the inmates.<br><br>The choice is up to you.  Do what you think is right ?  If you want someone to talk to - talk to Devil or maybe even me.</div>

But I did not expect so much reaction. I do not hate those doubters, and those who were so harsh with their criticism. Afterall this is a discussion forum, you're free to post, you're equally free to criticise.<br><br>Devil1976 said it well:<br>My personal advice is whoever thinks that this guy DON'T deserves any attention can simply IGNORE him.<br><br>But I'm grateful to those sympathisers and those with very kind words (like ReallieRaw, boy in blues, talk_cock). I'm grateful that despite all the doubters, they were willing to give me benefit of doubt and spent time typing such kind lengthy reply.<br><br>I am not about to spend time defending my posting, or proving that it is true. Simply because I don't see the need to convince anybody the authencity of it. And simply because either way, there will still be sceptics. It never ends.<br><br>I have been reading the thread. At one point, I was so disappointed and disheartened by the criticism that I felt it was pointless to reply at all. And I had wanted to leave it as it is. But it was the kind postings by chaps like talk_cock, that made me felt compelled to at least reply to show some gratitude, and to say thanks.<br><br>I know I'm sick in the mind. I can't help it. But at least, I am not a hypocrite and pretend I'm perfectly normal, as normal as all of you here.</span><br></div></blockquote>Really glad tt u r standing out to clarify this misu/standing coz the process tt u've gone thru to make sure pple know wat u mean is TRUE, it may not neccessarily mean tt u r 'trying' to convince them. We muz be at all times be tolerant to situations as such coz it's abt <strong>Awareness</strong> tt u r learning in the process. Being aware of wat u mean, how you feel &amp; wat pple muz correct abt their wrong accusation of you, too.<br><br>You've been a brave guy to speak ur mind. Many pple r chicken to speak of their 'fantasies' or some who cant control their thoughts may go do some unwell actions like flashing their bodies or peeping at pple bathing &amp; etc.<br><br>This is abt Awareness. you know tt it's not good to harbour such thoughts so try ur means to take control of them &amp; make them disappear. You can do it though not easy. Pls dun panick yet. I have a fren who has hallucination, really bad hallucination abt having sex with brother &amp; father. It's not what she wants but she cant help it but keep on indulging in these absurd pictures in her mind. Finally, she went to a psychiatrist &amp; now she is better.<br><br>The human's mind is one complex thing tt we are not able to figure out. All you need now is to fight these thoughts. Now tt you r aware of them for being unpleasant &amp; unwelcomed, chase them away, kill these thoughts.<br><br>Haha. Dunno if this can help but i enjoy the movie serials: Freddy's Nightmare. It's scary &amp; I enjoy tt the whole idea to killing Freddy is to know tt his presence is <strong>NOT REAL</strong>. It's your creation of him &amp; you can easily kill him if you want to. The mind is very powerful here. If you get me, you know the way already so try it <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Something to add, besides being aware tt your thoughts have been harmful, do find out why they exists thru the help of a psychiatrist. Regarding tt shameless colleague of you mum, you muz be aware tt he is doing the wrong thing, as well as scribbling ur mum's no. in  the toilets. Therefore, help yourself to fight off these thoughts 1st, you have much more impt things to handle.</div>

She is a Director in a company dealing in cosmetics and beauty products. Because of her job in the beauty line, she does know how to maintain her figure and dresses very well. She looks much younger than her age, in fact some thought she looks only 40.<br><br>Actually for a long time, my friends who saw her have been telling me that my mum is very chio for her age. [b]They kept telling me she's got a very voluptuous figure. </span></strong>I started to take notice but I was still quite indifferent, because I always saw her as a mother and never thought of her in that light. Afterall, how many of us really think lustfully of our mothers right?<br><br>However, this all changed some time Jan this year.<br><br>My mum is a workholic and often work very late into the night. Sometimes even come home only past 11p.m, several times even past midnight.<br><br>Some time in Jan this year, late at night about 2+ am. my mum called me and cried telling me she was raped and wanted me to bring some clothes to her office for her.<br>I don't know why, but i was immediately turned on by her crying.<br><br>I went to her office and saw her sprawled in her room crying and looking shocked.......naked but fronted her chest with her arms.<br>I've always seen the "strong career woman" side of my mum, but this sight of her looking so vulnerable was unusual to me.<br><br>She told me <strong>she was raped in the communcal ladies toilet at her office building. The man escaped with all her clothes, despite her begging not to leave her in this state.</strong><br><br>My mum didn't know what to do and didn't dare to alert her male colleague who was staying late with her, so she stayed in the toilet crying.<br><br>She stayed there until that colleague went to look for her and found her naked in the toilet. She said the colleague seemed a little shock but kept stealing looks at her as he helped her back into her room. My mum told him she didn't wish to report to police because she didn't want people to know and <strong>begged him not to tell anybody in the workplace what happened.</strong><br><br>But the bastard then started touching her and telling her obscene things. My mum said she resisted him but he tied her up with his tie and raped her. And even fish out a digital camera and started pictures of her. <strong>My mum kept telling me she just wanted to die.</strong><br><br>i know this sounds abnormal. Since that night and that sight of my mum naked, I started to have a crush on her and been thinking lustfully alot about her.<br><br><strong>Many times when she's at work, I would sniff at her nice smelling bra and masterbate.</strong><br><br>In fact, I've been secretly reading my mum's diary and know that that colleague has been harassing her and having sex with her 2-3 times a week. I've been thinking of her so much that i started doing crazy things. Last month, I went to several high traffic public toilets and scribbled in the cubicle words like <strong>"May, Big breasted and posh looking. Call her at xxxx for free blowjob".</strong><br><br>Somehow I got perversely pleased when I read in her diary that she has been receiving alot of obscene calls. From what she wrote, I gathered she <strong>received at least about 30 over such obscene calls a day. </strong>She thought it was that colleague who's been spreading her hp number.<br><br>Do you think I'm really going nuts.[/b]</blockquote>There will be retribution, just wait and see.

Only you yourself know whether you have changed some part of your story. But beware of your mind twisting the facts to rationalize your thinking.  Done long or intense enough, even the most ridiculous thought can seem rational to the person. Direct your attention to other better things.<br><br>It is always my belief that behind the abnormal behaviours one engages in, there is always a POSITIVE intention (whether one knows it consciously or not) to satisfy some very basic human need. (Do not think there are different personalities in you, they are just parts of the whole you) There are two things here: the intention and the behavior. The stalker wants to get closer to someone, the child fakes crying to get some affection. Look for the positive intention behind your actions. I am sure that there is at least one. Once you uncover them, find appropriate behaviors to express them.<br><br>A way to calm your mind is to simply regulate your breathing. Sit erect and take a full, deep breath (gently and silently without tension) that fills your mouth, lungs and belly (belly will expand). Hold for a while then breathe out every little air inside. Make the exhalation twice as long as the inhalation. With each inhalation, imagine GOODNESS filling you up, with each exhalation imagine BADNESS leaving you. Almost instantaneously, one can center oneÂ’s mind. DonÂ’t believe? Try it.<br><br>ThatÂ’s about all I can help. The rest is up to you.<br></div>

I agree with you that anyone dwelling on bad thoughts for too long become that thought.  "Cognito Ergo Sum" Descartes said that - translated it means "I think therefore I am".  The primary solution for this problem is always to switch our mental states as you have advised.  In frust's case, he should dwell on the positive motherly feelings of the past and NOT think of his mother as an object of sexual frustration.<strong><br><br>It is always my belief that behind the abnormal behaviours one engages in, there is always a POSITIVE intention (whether one knows it consciously or not) to satisfy some very basic human need.

The intentions may be positive but if expressed wrongly it becomes a negative with serious repercussions.  Let's say in Frust's case, the positive intention could be a need for his mother's attention; but if mother is too busy working and not giving enough attention.  There arises a need to punish naughty mother.  In which case, it gives rise to the pranks and the obvious JOY that poor mother is being punished for neglecting her son.  Obviously the POSITIVE intention cannot be exhibit in correct way<strong><br><br>There are two things here: the intention and the behavior.

            <div class='col-md body'>U know frust frust...we all have our probs...big or small...some less serious and some more serious...<br><br>I too, came froma  broken home and when I was born, I was sent to a nanny and grew up with her and the family...I found these two ppl (my parents) who came to look on me occasionally strange to me....I dun like em and I certainly dun want to spend anytime with them....gradually I started calling my nanny's eldest son Daddy...<br><br>When I was finally forced to move home, I hated everything...even my home was in such a mess...so much had happend to me and I was no longer the same...inside me was a frightened little girl though no one knew...everyone thought I am very confident of myself....<br><br>See, our growing up environment shapes and molds us to a certain extent...then as we grow up there are external factors changing us...sometimes for the better sometimes for the worst.<br><br>At times cos of what happened in the past, we are so affected that we end up having warp thoughts or imagination...things that ppl may think we're crazy or sick thinking about, things that when your frens hear, they may even shrivel in disbelief....but at the end of the day, watever home we came from, there is no excuse in the world to justify us to harm or hurt others...let alone ur mother. It may not mean anything to u that this woman carried to u to term, but she could have choose to not want u....for all u know...the prob with her and ur dad started before she's pregnant or when she's with u and she CHOSE U still....maybe she lost the man she could rely on &amp; she started to feel cynical...she felt bitter...and she felt that only she could rely on herself...since she lost her man, she felt she was in control to get whatever attention she wants to feel safe, to feel wanted and needed...u understand? Then it lies on your WILL POWER to move on and let go of your own bitterness...forgive her for neglecting you and love her cos she's your closest kin. Then forgive urself for doing all these things, for making your warp thought a reality cos  u had a choice not to. Why not not remind her of your dad but be a responsible son and a man? Let her know u're not only NOT a burden but you can be her asset, her son to rely on in time of need. Stop saying "but my fren made me see her..." "but she wear those clothes...", think WHO ARE YOU TO JUDGE HER and What are u? Yes, desires of the flesh is one of the hardest to curb, but hey, u will grow up and u will learn another kind of love. Let's not harm or hurt ppl u love. SEE your MUM hurting not focus at her body. Tell her to be strong and to stand by her. Let not her colleague threaten her anymore....when she finally looks at u in a clearer mind, won't u feel so good when she says. "Thank you son. U're the best thing that ever happened to me." Seek help or speak to anyone in the forum u feel comfortable like the rest suggested ya...take care!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

The next 13 years is largely depended on your external factor shaping your initial character, sexual development, identity and personality.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Looking at your case, what you mentioned above is pretty much what I had expected, and people he is different from you others which grown up from a broken family.
