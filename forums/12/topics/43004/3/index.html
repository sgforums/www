            <div class='col-md body'>Hi frustfrust,<br><br>I trust that you know what you are posting and I do think you are seriously troubled.<br>There are a few things I want you to recognize.<br><br>1)Your mum has been playing the role of Father and Mother through these years. You are her Son. There are only 2 members in your immediate family Â– one elder, one younger.<br><br>2) I think your Mum needs HELP even more than you. Rape and blackmail are criminal offences. The Law in Singapore offers far better protection for your mum than silent suffering. What is the use of submitting to blackmail? He will only become more brazen. She should, if she doesnÂ’t, then you MUST.  Report the case before it gets worse. The police have the resources to catch the offenders and direct your mum to professional help.<br><br>3) I wonder how old are you? Should be in your teens or young adult right? Have you ever seen a female naked before this incident? I want you to realise that the sight of a naked female will inevitably arouse sexual feelings. This is normal. But you do know that the person is inappropriate here, otherwise you will not be so disturbed. To say that your mum deserves to be raped because of how she dresses is but a rationalization by yourself, isnÂ’t it? If not, do you mean that all who dress sexily along Orchard deserved the same treatment? (if so, u really need help)<br><br>4) Are you close to your mum? Whatever the answer, you have to recognize that she worked hard to support you all these years. Now is the time for you to help her. How will she feel if she knows that her own son backstabbed her in her hour of need? You should neither add to her troubles in any way. Go and scrab off the writings, and respect her enough to stay away from her belongings where she is not around.<br><br>5) Hotline that you can seek help:<br>SOS		                          1800-221-4444<br>Do realize that there is no shame in seeking help. It is a sign that you know that you are seriously in trouble. Call the SOS hotline, they will counsel you and if you want, refer you to professional help.For your mum, the police will help direct her to specialized professional help --- she may be on the verge of a breakdown due to post-traumatic stress.<br><br>Take Care.<br></div>

There is only a certain stress threshold that your mum can take, once that is exceeded, she may do something stupid. If she goes, you will be alone. Do you want that? Be a MAN, just pick up the phone and dial 999 NOW. The police will do the rest. Or if your mum wants, she can report at CID at Police Cantonment Complex, next to Outram MRT.

She is a Director in a company dealing in cosmetics and beauty products. Because of her job in the beauty line, she does know how to maintain her figure and dresses very well. She looks much younger than her age, in fact some thought she looks only 40.<br><br>Actually for a long time, my friends who saw her have been telling me that my mum is very chio for her age. [b]They kept telling me she's got a very voluptuous figure. </span></strong>I started to take notice but I was still quite indifferent, because I always saw her as a mother and never thought of her in that light. Afterall, how many of us really think lustfully of our mothers right?<br><br>However, this all changed some time Jan this year.<br><br>My mum is a workholic and often work very late into the night. Sometimes even come home only past 11p.m, several times even past midnight.<br><br>Some time in Jan this year, late at night about 2+ am. my mum called me and cried telling me she was raped and wanted me to bring some clothes to her office for her.<br>I don't know why, but i was immediately turned on by her crying.<br><br>I went to her office and saw her sprawled in her room crying and looking shocked.......naked but fronted her chest with her arms.<br>I've always seen the "strong career woman" side of my mum, but this sight of her looking so vulnerable was unusual to me.<br><br>She told me <strong>she was raped in the communcal ladies toilet at her office building. The man escaped with all her clothes, despite her begging not to leave her in this state.</strong><br><br>My mum didn't know what to do and didn't dare to alert her male colleague who was staying late with her, so she stayed in the toilet crying.<br><br>She stayed there until that colleague went to look for her and found her naked in the toilet. She said the colleague seemed a little shock but kept stealing looks at her as he helped her back into her room. My mum told him she didn't wish to report to police because she didn't want people to know and <strong>begged him not to tell anybody in the workplace what happened.</strong><br><br>But the bastard then started touching her and telling her obscene things. My mum said she resisted him but he tied her up with his tie and raped her. And even fish out a digital camera and started pictures of her. <strong>My mum kept telling me she just wanted to die.</strong><br><br>i know this sounds abnormal. Since that night and that sight of my mum naked, I started to have a crush on her and been thinking lustfully alot about her.<br><br><strong>Many times when she's at work, I would sniff at her nice smelling bra and masterbate.</strong><br><br>In fact, I've been secretly reading my mum's diary and know that that colleague has been harassing her and having sex with her 2-3 times a week. I've been thinking of her so much that i started doing crazy things. Last month, I went to several high traffic public toilets and scribbled in the cubicle words like <strong>"May, Big breasted and posh looking. Call her at xxxx for free blowjob".</strong><br><br>Somehow I got perversely pleased when I read in her diary that she has been receiving alot of obscene calls. From what she wrote, I gathered she <strong>received at least about 30 over such obscene calls a day. </strong>She thought it was that colleague who's been spreading her hp number.<br><br>Do you think I'm really going nuts.[/b]</blockquote>I will post my reply <strong>only after you </strong>reply those who genuine try to assist you (RAW, etc). Well, by the look of it, if you seriously needed the help, you would have defended yourself instead of disappearing after the first post, in which people would doubt about the facts of your post.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Here is some advise for you.<br>Since you like it so much, go for it! Go and strip your mother and give her breast a bite! Go fark your mother upside down at orchard road where thereÂ’s crowd around to let her feel public nudity! Since you blamed her for wearing like a tight see-thru lacey blouse, punish her and make sure sheÂ’s afraid to look sexy! Since you think that she deserve to be raped because she enjoyed men staring at her breasts, show everyone her breasts and make her feel ashamed. Go take your fatherÂ’s ashes and drink it in a form of tea. Since he left you so early, donÂ’t he deserve to be punish for leaving you alone?<br><br>But let me ask you, do you like it when girls look at you. If you do, then I think you should kill yourself! Why? Because I think that itÂ’s a shameful thing to even show yourself to people! You are just a jealous, empty vessel with disgusting brains and a ugly thing hanging on your neck who think that people deserve to be punish, for being happy that people look at the beauty part of them!<br><br>Think about it, why do woman like to show? ItÂ’s because man like it. Do you not comb your hair, wear nice clothes and show a good image, a good side of you hoping that a pretty girl might take a glance at you. Use the thing that god give you in your head and think about it yourself.<br><br>By the way, are you thinking of using these craps hoping a kind-hearted girl might show you some sympathy, for havenÂ’t being able to have proper sex and becoming a despo and then gives you a good time, so that you will stop doing stupid things?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all,<br><br>Whether frustfrust is real or not, it does not really matter. To be able to post such things, it means that he is really frequently thinking about it. Whether true or imagined, it does appears that he is seriously diturbed. Mental health professionals have known worse fantasies such as this. The thing is, even if false, the intrusive thoughts can develop over a period of time to become what is known as obsseive-compulsive behaviors, and in this case, it overlaps with sexual-identity disorders. Over time, he can become a menance to society.<br><br>Yes, i m typing this out for you, frustfrust, you need help. If you can conquer it yourself, so be it. If you really find yourself doing 'weird' things, please seek help. Even though professionals see such things, some will still be shocked when you confess to them. But be assured that they will help you. If you are really out-of-control and you know it yourself, do not be afraid to seek help.</div>

You see, I have been in the forum for quite some while and occasionally, there will be posts like this and people just disappear after the initial post - well, naturally, people would just think it was nothing but a tale spin.
