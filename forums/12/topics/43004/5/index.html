            <div class='col-md body'>I think the whole story seems to come out straight from a hackney porn movie.<br><br>First scene mother got raped, second scene lustful colleague took nude photos and advantage of situation to blackmail mother into having sex. Then scene 3 colleague continues to degrade mother further and get more men to screw her, presented in VCDs. In between add in sexual fantasies of author to round up the whole thing.<br><br>I think frustfrust is just hallucinating about the whole thing and making it into a big story, even bigger and exagarrated than those soap opera served up by World Wrestling Entertainment.</div>

She looks much younger than her age, in fact some thought she looks only 40.<br><br>Actually for a long time, my friends who saw her have been telling me that my mum is very chio for her age. [b]They kept telling me she's got a very voluptuous figure. </span></strong>I started to take notice but I was still quite indifferent, because I always saw her as a mother and never thought of her in that light. Afterall, how many of us really think lustfully of our mothers right?<br><br>However, this all changed some time Jan this year.<br><br>My mum is a workholic and often work very late into the night. Sometimes even come home only past 11p.m, several times even past midnight.<br><br>Some time in Jan this year, late at night about 2+ am. my mum called me and cried telling me she was raped and wanted me to bring some clothes to her office for her.<br>I don't know why, but i was immediately turned on by her crying.<br><br>I went to her office and saw her sprawled in her room crying and looking shocked.......naked but fronted her chest with her arms.<br>I've always seen the "strong career woman" side of my mum, but this sight of her looking so vulnerable was unusual to me.<br><br>She told me <strong>she was raped in the communcal ladies toilet at her office building. The man escaped with all her clothes, despite her begging not to leave her in this state.</strong><br><br>My mum didn't know what to do and didn't dare to alert her male colleague who was staying late with her, so she stayed in the toilet crying.<br><br>She stayed there until that colleague went to look for her and found her naked in the toilet. She said the colleague seemed a little shock but kept stealing looks at her as he helped her back into her room. My mum told him she didn't wish to report to police because she didn't want people to know and <strong>begged him not to tell anybody in the workplace what happened.</strong><br><br>But the bastard then started touching her and telling her obscene things. My mum said she resisted him but he tied her up with his tie and raped her. And even fish out a digital camera and started pictures of her. <strong>My mum kept telling me she just wanted to die.</strong><br><br>i know this sounds abnormal. Since that night and that sight of my mum naked, I started to have a crush on her and been thinking lustfully alot about her.<br><br><strong>Many times when she's at work, I would sniff at her nice smelling bra and masterbate.</strong><br><br>In fact, I've been secretly reading my mum's diary and know that that colleague has been harassing her and having sex with her 2-3 times a week. I've been thinking of her so much that i started doing crazy things. Last month, I went to several high traffic public toilets and scribbled in the cubicle words like <strong>"May, Big breasted and posh looking. Call her at xxxx for free blowjob".</strong><br><br>Somehow I got perversely pleased when I read in her diary that she has been receiving alot of obscene calls. From what she wrote, I gathered she <strong>received at least about 30 over such obscene calls a day. </strong>She thought it was that colleague who's been spreading her hp number.<br><br>Do you think I'm really going nuts.[/b]</blockquote>U r suxx.... u faggot!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>How can you bear the thought of your mum's colleagues demanding sex from her 2-3times a week. And worse still you masturbate and fantasize about your mum. If i were u , i would have gone to her salon and bashed their colleagues up for good. I would seek counsellor first, then call police. Then get her bad colleagues's ass kicked and send them to jail for raping your mom. That's extortion and blackmailing her in the form of sex. She must be going through a very dark period of her life now.</div>
