            <div class='col-md body'>Man.. u talk just like ur problems. Dun ask so many questions. U do what is right.. if u dun like it u say it. Some ppl are just too stubborn.. n u have the right to nut out at them ESPECIALLY when u warned them n they still do it... n stil bitch n moan. If u do things to show that u are doing a good deed or helping others , you are basically not doing it for the sake of friendship but for face. Its 2 different thing.. like i  said..read my signature..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

However, if you do not donate, even if you have good/bad intentions, they still don't benefit, even if you have the purest heart.</div>
