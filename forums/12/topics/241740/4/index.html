And if those friendship ain't developed further, it's merely just causal friend ultimately. Of course, it would be great to have friends which you can count on and further those friendship - these are the kind of people worthy to keep and of course, you do what you can to maintain them. Even virtual friends have different 'worth' in one's opinion. Some virtual friends probably sit at some corner of your MSN list and the worst thing is that you don't even know who the hell are they because there isn't much exchange as far as you could remember.<br><br>Causal friend as people call it - see on the street would still talk cork and say hi. Nobody asked you to avoid them what - you are just not actively maintaining them because gradually, everybody will be busy with their work, life, love, marriage, kids and horde of other problems and that's understandable.<br><br>Our time and resource is limited and obviously we cannot upkeep all the friends as we would have like to. And because of that, we will lose quite a number to time, environment and changes. For me ar, I am already having issue to upkeep different cliques of friends in reality and wouldn't have that time/energy/resource to think so much man.<br><br>I rather focus more attention on people who is more important to me. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>
