No good ah....library has some self-help books which may be useful. Sometimes in life, it does not matter what others think of u lor. These people come and go. They dun matter in your life. What matters is that you know what you did was the best and most appropriate in that situation.<br><br>Maybe one way is to smile to them, say good morning.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> Look bright and sunny. Or try talking to them on common topics...(ya...is very hard I know). Or just smile lah. Sometime people dun want to interact with u coz you are temp. Last time I temp job, the superior dun bully me already happy, they dun eat with me happier. But when perm job, usually colleagues' attitude change one lor.<br><br>For the rest , thanks for all the other replies.
