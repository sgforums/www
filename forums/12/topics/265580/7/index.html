From her experiences in life, a restrictive relationship is still no-no.<br><br>From her point of view, a man that gives her freedom to roam like a pretty butterfly but yet gives her the security of being loved and cherished when the party is over is hard to come by.<br><br>A man who is good in character and is secure to not feel jealous/upset at her partying is really rare. Money, age and status aren't important here at all.<br><br>That explains her intensive efforts.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>For a smart girl, looks is a means to an end.. And at the end of the day, she needs an anchor someday with someone. And that person, she thinks, is you.<br><br>When your relationship is mature enough, maybe different challenges will manifest themselves. Maybe you would want her to show more commitment. But I suppose that's another futuristic scenario to discuss next time.<br><br>Good luck, mate! I'm glad for you.<br></div>
