            <div class='col-md body'>hmmm... 4428, can i ask u something? what's holding u back? izzit cos u're worried about age difference and the problems (parental objection, public opinion, being 'uncle', etc) it can bring? cos u never saw her as a potential gf/wife b4 n now u may have to see her in a different light? cos u still see ur ex as 'the one' and aren't ready to have some1 else take her place? cos u're afraid she'll eat ur money? (which i think the formers are more afraid of this than u. haha) or something else?<br><br>i'm just curious about what a guy ur age is thinking about/how a man would view a situation like this. no obligations to tell if u don't want to either k?<br><br>*lunch. brb*</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi fourfourtwo8 (car plate number?)<br><br>YouÂ’re fretting over the question prematurely at this stage though it helps to note the few boo boos that may influence how a May December romance develops when itÂ’s time to think about commitment.<br><br>DonÂ’t think itÂ’ll be too effective analyzing her character since youÂ’ve known her very well over the years. Coming from a female perspective, similar age group and backgroundÂ…<br><br>***<br><br>YouÂ’re babbling a lot about your feelings, so obviously, you like her quite a fair bit. It speaks for itself with your post at this forum. Have you had previous experience dating younger women? Socialized with her friends from the entertainment line?<br><br>If you are after a lover:<br><br>In this situation, dating a hot young babe 20 years your junior is acceptable because you are well to do and based on what youÂ’re saying, she seems to have chemistry with you. She is inviting you to start something, just go along for the ride. There is nothing wrong with couple spa in Europe, sex on the beach and all. Forget about public opinion here, parental objections, level of maturity and blah blah blah. You are both adults and when one starts, the other one dances.<br><br>***<br><br>If you are after a committed partner:<br><br>Avoid swiping credit cards and buying expensive presents at this stage. Diamonds and 15K items are meant for mothers, wives and fiancÃ©es. Paying for dates and dinner is fine. If sheÂ’s beautiful and between 18 and 22, never try to buy her. Especially if you are not ruling out possibilities of a relationship later on.<br><br>Alternatively if the agenda is clear; she is after your money, and you are fine with the trade off, then no problem. Just donÂ’t end up with a heavy love problem with this girl and miss the real deal down the road (IÂ’m saying this because it sounds like you want someone to settle down with).<br><br>SheÂ’s telling you about the rich uncles, but is she talking about how much she likes you? What about the hot models/producers/managers kissing at her doorstep? She is on fire and starting her run now. Unless you're on the same page with her, in due time there will be overwhelming hurdles.<br><br>She finds comfort and repose in your company/maturity given the nature of her job. Opposites attract.<br><br>***<br><br>My nagging suspicion: When bragging rights and ego trips fizzle out, you'll eventually be singing Scar Tissue by The Red Hot Chili Peppers<br></div>
