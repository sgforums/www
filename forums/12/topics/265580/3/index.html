But take good sense and care not to allow yourself the condition to substitute love subconsciously, just because you have yet to recover emotionally. IMHO, you may not have gotten over your previous relationship yet. Healing will resume automatically when the mind and soul returns back to clarify with wisdom, so do allow that time frame to manifest into effect.<br><br>Next is regarding individual needs - completely share the sentiment with Jojo; the chronological age gap conjures vast differences in expectation and needs. A man in late thirties certainly brandishes his love definition and needs differently from a young lady of early twenties. This is the generational phenomenon in Love astrology. Some women are naturally attracted to older man - this is due to certain qualities that draw them towards such mates (Saturn in 7th house - not considering aspects). It's not always the case of a women going all out to cheat a man of his money (In that sense, its likely Neptune influenced, affliction in 2nd/8th house)<br><br>But a positive aspect about this is that in love, it doesn't necessarily mean that we must have similarity to make it workable. In fact, the complementary aspect of personalities in a couple is far more crucial... though ironically giving rise to the most difficult of challenge people will ever face.<br><br>Of course there are reasonable reasons and possibilities why are not accepting her - which have been kindly contributed in posts by forumers before me. But in summary, the rationale of you hesitating is largely because, considering your current emotional state and age, you are averse to risk taking.<br><br>And she blatantly represents a high risk investment... an instrument you find it choking to swallow outrageously.<br><br>I cannot determine if you should go for it because from my angle, it's really a matter of choice. Rather, I would ask if you would like to take the plunge and try to reap something meaningful out of this. And yes, it doesn't mean that you must marry her eventually if things can't work out as you shouldn't let time fetter you in any ways.<br><br>I think a critical lesson to master in love is that no matter how many relationships you have been into, every newborn relationship starts from square one. You can't expect your next relationship to 'fill-in-the-blanks' from where the previous one has falter; therefore it isn't wise to plan/decide upon a marriage partner way before even you foster strong bonds from your BGR. Simply just because you are getting older and needs to settle down quickly is a bad excuse for haste.<br><br>And haste is one of the top failing factors in love.<br><br>An interesting question to note would be: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>does your aversion to risk comes from the fact that she is a high risk investment, or does it comes from your fear of failure?</strong></span><br><br>P.S: If the both of you are going overseas together or even having her to stay over your place for a few weeks - the sex conundrum will surely appear in this equation. I don't know how sexually disciplined you are, but trust me, you probably won't want to put yourself a situation where you are not confident at all - especially when it comes to sex.<br><br>Sure, it can be all good wild fun - but remember: once you begin in that 'brand positioning', it would be very arduous to 'reposition'. And a stable, proper relationship might not materialise very well from then onwards because of how you move your chess piece. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i think its quite unfair to say she's 'childish' and 'immature' just because she's 'only 21'.. i'm 21y/o too.. and its not that i think i'm very matured.. i know i'm not.. (in fact, i think i'm less matured than girls my age..) but considering the kind of environment this girl works in/hangs around at, i think she would have been forced to be matured beyond her years to survive in it. give her a chance!</div>
