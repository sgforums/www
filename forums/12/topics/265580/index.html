It is also possible to never even consider the issue of compatibility at all (never ever one day wake up and say: "That's it, we are not compatible.

Compatibility is <strong>never </strong>a yes/no state. Are we compatible? Yes or No? It should be, how compatible are we?

I don't know about you but if I were in your shoes, and she wants to play badminton (not bedminton, though) I will ask her to go with her friends.<br><br>It takes two hands to clap and clapping hurts when you clap too hard.

Its fair enough to feel the dread... the 'phobia' . Maybe just give it time.. the calm down period.. to cool off.
