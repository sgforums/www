            <div class='col-md body'>well..i am just your regular nus undergraduate who just so happens to be in a faculty where i am constantlly surrounded by babes.Every day i would see ugly guys with beautiful girls and instead of making me feel bad, it actually motivates me into thinking that there is still hope for me.For me i am average looking meaning that the food stall auntie can still bear to look me in the eye when i place my orders and physically speaking ,i am quite okay being able to do pullups with 40kg makes some justification hence the nickname but ermmm...my BMI is a bit screwed up with my weight being 85kg and height at 1.74m.ok so now u have a rough picture of me i shall tell my ermm problem.I met this girl on an outing organised by the module i am taking and she was amazing in my eyes.As she began talking to her frens,her voice uplifted me and made me feel shy.What really attracted me was that she actually called out my name and asked me whether i wanted to have lunch with her and her frens.We ate at burger king and i found out that she was really friendly and nice but ermm..as wat my fren said to me when a girl likes u she will look u in the eye often.I kept looking out for that but it did not happen.The only time she looked me in the eye was when she asked me questions about my module selection and even then it was a friendly kind of look not the i admire u kind of look.So i was the only guy in the whole group and i was only interested in her.After the meal we went off on our separate ways and while doing so, she asked the others for thier hp numbers.There are a few who asked for mine but she of all of them never did.At this point u may think i am a sissy for not asking for her hp number but like wat my fren always tells me, a girl will deem a guy who asks for her number a desperate pervert.So to protect my image, i did not ask for her number for fear of being mistaken as a pervert.Another thing is that she is a christian while i am a buddhist so in addition to the hp problem, i feel that my crush is impossile and even though we attend the same module, her lecture is on mondays while mine is on fridays.....haiz so near yet so far.......hope to have some help but would also welcome some scoldings if u think i am that useless<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yo pull-up addict.<br><br>Im here to offer u an alternative point of view.<br>First ask yourself, do u want to look for a r/ship tt can last or are u just out to have fun?<br><br>if u are just out to have fun, than just like the rest of the ppl, I would urge u to go for it and seize the opportunity if it arises.<br><br>But if u are looking for serious love with long term commitment, I urge u to think again. I do not have any particular issue about an average guy with a beautiful woman.. but i do feel something about her being a christian and you being a Buddhist.<br><br>Its not easy to maintain a relationship when a couple have different faith. It definitely takes more than just compromising each others. There are lots of sensitive issues involved.<br><br>So unless you are those outright confident guy who believes you are able to handle such a difficult situation well in your r/ship, if not, may i suggest that you dont sink into it first and end up struggling and giving yourself lots of heartache after you are into it.<br><br>To summarise.<br><br>Go for it only if you dont have any lingering doubt.<br>Stop now if you have any slight tinge of doubt.<br><br>The fact tt u posted this thread suggest that u do actually have quite abit of a doubt.<br><br>Im going to be honest with u. Yes you are right. Its an impossible crush.<br><br>Just move on....there are lots of wonderful girls out there who might be more compatible.<br><br>I am just speaking from experience. For your info, Me and my gf often goes praying together and it does help when a couple is in the same religion.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You think your crush is bad, think again. I am having feelings for a Malaysian Indian lady co-worker whose family is christian while I am a Singapore chinese whose parents are buddhist(I'm a freethinker). I think a positive outcome is really impossible for me but that does not stop me from liking her. Not sure how to woo her so now all I can do is being a friend with her and exchange sms greetings(still can't believe I pluck up the courage to ask her or hp no.). Thinking maybe once I have more free time(part time studies in NTU) I ask her out for a drink and chat. She admit she miss me now that we are working in different department, is that a good sign?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>1. Find another girl.<br>2. convert it to action. (get her)<br><br>If you choose option 1. then it's the-end of story.<br><br>option2. Well.... i do agree that it's very difficult for you especially when a girl is christian. Reason because some of them can be very very Christian. they wont want to have a BF who is from a different religion.<br><br>If she is fine with that then there is no problem at all. When it comes to girls, your looks isnt that important. Most importantly especially for girls your age would be your ability to express your feelings in a way where you dont put her off.<br><br>It has got to be subtle at the start... then slowly pick up positive hints and move on..... Sweet talk!!!! Come on..... your english is pretty decent i'm sure you can do it.<br><br>Start by saying... HI.. and the rest will come to you.</div>
