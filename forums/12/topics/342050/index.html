              <div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Ireallyloveher:</div>
              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>I used to have this very close female friend of mine, we chat on phone and sms each other a lot, I was her best guy friend and she was my closest female friend.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The problem is that one day she start asking awkward questions like "Are you in love with me?", "Who's that girl you're referring to you on your MSN nick?", I can't deny my feelings for her, I really do love her.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I refused to ler her know at the start, fearing the fact that our close friendship is at risk, she mentioned before that if a guy likes her and she were find out, she'll try to ignore him, to prevent any awkward situations, I don't want to be that guy...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But then she kept asking, and God know's why I had the feeling that she likes me, so I gave in, I told her the fact. Surprisingly, she did not ignore me and my feelings were true! She told me she do have feelings for me. It was so blissful at that moment, I can't help but praise myself for doing the right move; to tell her how I feel. But I was soooo wrong.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After she told me how she feel, we continued to chat, both sides asking personal questions and most of them were answered, but this is the freaking problem, I began to realize it when I went over to her workplace to visit her.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When she first saw me she was busy working, so we just stared politely back at each other and she continued with her work while I wait for her break-time. I finally met up with her and then I / we sensed something wrong, we can't chat like we used to, neither can we look at each other straight in the face. It was DAMN awkward.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I quickly left the scene and told her I need to buy something for my comp, she SMSed me while I was gone to tell me to continue tagging along with her for lunch. I went over and saw her eating with her colleagues. The awkwardness is like a directly proportionate ratio to the steps I take to walk towards her, eventually I told her I was busy and I rushed back home.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Things got worse after that, her sms for me dropped and eventually our relationship came to a halt. I asked her close female friend and she told me she (the girl I love) felt really awkward, and she needs some time.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It took a few weeks before she finally decided to reply my messages, we did go out after that, but it was a group outing. We acted like nothing happened but seriously I can still feel the distant between us. She told me she's feeling normal now, no more awkwardness but any person will know that's an outright lie.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I know most of you will be posting things like "err so.. what do you want us to do?" TBH, I don't know, I just need to say this out, I needed someone to talk to, my social circle is not small but my closest friend is the problem now, I got no one to fill my story to.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Should I continue to chat with her hoping that one day it will be back to where we started? As lovers? Or should I just forget about her and move on?</p>

              <p>Is your story incoherent or am I missing a point?</p>
              <p>If she did have feelings for you and actually met up with you thereafter, why did the awkwardness set in?</p>
              <p>So, were you actually lovers at any point in time after discovering your feelings were mutual?</p>

              <p>So after both of you express your feelings for each other, you guys just did the same things like when you are friends? Then of course it's awkward for her - she doesn't know whether to treat you as a friend or a boyfriend. Shouldn't you initiate a date with her or something? Or are you waiting for her to do so, huh?</p>
