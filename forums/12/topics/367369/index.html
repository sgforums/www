              <p>Confidential within the government organisations.</p>
              <p>Not confidential to the point where only SAF will know about it.</p>
              <p>You don't really have a choice, and it is a good thing that you admitted to seeing a shrink before, as they might find out the truth if you are really unlucky and have choosen to lie about it instead.</p>
              <p>And you need not worry about it, the local unis will not disclose your personal information and such things unnecessarily.</p>
              <p>And for job-wise, this kind of thing have to be declared most of the time, and to tell you the truth, most employers will not want you as one of their workers. Of course, you can choose to lie about it, as long as you are not applying to work for government organisations.</p>
