            <div class='col-md body'>I have a friend who must be the most handsome and assertives person on earth.. His name is Tom and his age modestly 29.. He is rather tall and well-built, walk with an air of confident and spots the trendiest side-burn.. Given his perfect vision, he will occasionally wear a non-degree sun-glass so as to look "cool" even when the sky looks gloom..<br><br>There is, however, one remarkable aspect to Tom: his behaviour as soon as he steps on a bus.. The back seat is for five passengers.. In spite of his moderate size, Tom sits so as to allow room for only four or even three people on the seat.. If four are already seated and Tom is standing up, he demands permission, in an indignant and reproachful tone, to sit down -- which he then does, managing to take up an excessive amount of space.. To this end, he puts his hands in his pockets so that his elbows will remain firmly embedded in his neighbours' ribs..<br><br>Tom's resources are plentiful and diverse.. When he has to travel standing up, he always keeps his jacket unbuttoned, carefully adjusting his posture so that the lower edge of his jacket hits the face or the eyes of those sitting down.. If anyone is reading, they are easy prey for Tom.. Watching him or her closely, Tom places his head near the light so as to throw a shadow on the victim's book..<br><br>On the MRT, If he manages to take the seat, he never gives it up to anyone, but the moment he sees a pretty lady climb on board he immediately stands up..<br><br>For all his inconsiderate and irritating behaviour, Tom surprisingly have his fair share of girls surrounding him.. Not that they mind though, as Tom is more than capable of amusing them with his trendy jokes and overwhelming personalities.. Compare him to Peter I finally understand why people always lament that "love is blind"..<br></div>
