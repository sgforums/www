              <p>I may be just speculating but it may be just one way for her to find closure. Sometimes, you may be at a lost of what to do during a passing of a relative so you may tend to do something to preserve some part of that relative for your memory keepsake be it may not be the correct way if others are trying to use time to forget.</p>
              <p>My dad still keep photos of his dad's pasing, although he doesn't show it but I can see that he misses him everytime he looks at the photos. So just give and take bah, I suppose.</p>

              <p>i agree. pls find out why she did it.</p>
              <p>a funeral doesn't always have to be a sad event. especially when the person who has passed on has led a good life and lived to a reasonably old age. sometimes, leaving this world can be seen as a release fr pain and suffering, if the person had been very ill. or, it can be seen as passing on to a higher realm, depending on ur religious beliefs.</p>
              <p>taking a video of the funeral, while not smth that is done at many funerals, cld simply be ur mum's way of helping everyone move on and find closure. by burning the video for everyone, it's a way to keep the memory of ur grandma alive. why shld relatives who have died be forgotten quickly? that would be unfilial right?</p>

              <p><br>It's not up to you to judge your mother. If your grandmother is upset with your mother, she will let her know....and I'm sure you don't want to know about it. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p>If what your mother is doing is indeed rude to your grandmother, then isn't it more rude to cremate her or bury her alone six feet under?</p>
              <p>And if you realised no matter what you do to a dead person is all going to be rude to some people one way or the other, why do you not question how come it's alright to burn/bury a dead person but it's not alright to distribute photos/videos/CDs of a dead person?</p>
              <p>It all comes down to the intentions behind those actions. People are able to recognise the intentions and mature enough to understand but not condemn their actions.</p>
              <p>HOWEVER</p>
              <p>IF your mother is selling those CDs/photos/videos in pasar malam/ebay/dvd video shops and making a huge untaxable profits out of your dead grandmother, then of course your mother is wrong and you need to phone police and arrest her at once.</p>
              <p>BUT....I'm just joking, and I'm sure nobody is going to do such a thing even during bad times at the present.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>to be fair to TS, it depend on how you look at it ..  one may take it that viewing the CD and pictures will bring sad memories and the grief will re-visit.  However, they are those who will treasure the memory , perhaps like her mum as she had walked the final journey with the deceased.  TS may not realised what she is missing or what she is talking ..  One thing we all agree is that she shouldn't had called her mother stupid ... hope you realised your mistake and make up with your mum ....</p></div>
