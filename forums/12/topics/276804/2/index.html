Most<br>of the time it doesn't work out despite what some people say.<br><br>You wanted to say happy anniversary and she don't sound so enthusiastic, obviously something is wrong right ?<br><br>But your mistake was quote "then i lost my temper and started hurlin vulgarities". Tell me, which person won't be dulan ? Even if you are inside, try to remain calm and not fight fire with fire. If so, you have lost your original purpose. It doesn't get you anywhere.<br><br>Being cold to you, offed her hp, etc are all signs of avoidance. Imagine a girl is calling you everyday asking you about your whereabouts, will you feel like changing your number ?<br><br>What Im saying is I think you yourself know where you stand in your girl's heart. Don't do anything yet. Don't assume anything. Make sure she is consistently cold towards you, then you know something is wrong. But at the same time, give her freedom to make friends. I can tell she is someone who values freedom.<br><br>One last thing: love is, at the end of the day, just a game, despite what some traditionalists say. Don't take it too seriously. Otherwise, you can start to dye your hair black cause of the stress it imposes on you.<br><br>Finally, get ready to eject out of this relationship. I can see it heading towards death but I don't want to assume anything yet because only you know the situation well enough.<br><br>Bottomline is, I don't think this girl is for you. Take care.<br><br>doko<br></div>
