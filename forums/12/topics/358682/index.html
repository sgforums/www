              <p>My brother took drugs before, and was caught and sentenced. This was like 6 years ago. Now, he is recently married and it was his wife who brought my attention to this matter. I did not believe her at first as I see my brother as being normal when i see him.</p>
              <p>But 2 nights ago, i woke up at aroun 2am(which i rarely do) to go to the toilet. I saw him sitting at the living room with his head down. I guess he was startled and looked at my direction. I was shocked when his eyes were red. And not just the eyeballs, it was like even below the eyes. It's as if there were blood right underneath his skin at that area like someone being possessed in the movies. And he looked at me and asked me where i was going in the most 'high' that i've ever seen a person.</p>
              <p>I wanted to tell my parents abt what i saw, but i just couldnt. I couldnt bear to tell them. When this happened the last time, my mum fainted and cried for 3 weeks and my dad just sat silently in one corner of the house. I couldnt bear to see them go through this again.</p>
              <p>I tried searching for actual evidence with his wife but we couldnt find anything. however, there is this bag that he carries around with it at ALL times. When he's not looking, i would check in it and found syringes. Those that were from my mum's. My mother's diabetic and she's realising that she is having shortages of syringes for her insuline shots.(she bought it on a 3 months basis).</p>
              <p>When i looked into his trash basket, i would see tissues that has blood on it. His wife told me it's the blood from his nose.</p>
              <p>When it's pay day, he would be in the toilet for at least 3 hrs. His usual bathing routine is 1 hr. When he get's out of the toilet, he would sit at the living room.</p>
              <p>This morning, when i was in the toilet, I saw a piece of plastic that was stuck at the toilet window. It was the plastic of my mum's syringe and inside it contains a small portion of blue coloured liquid and white powder.</p>
              <p>Can anyone advise me further on what i should do now?</p>

              <p>guys, i think he's using methamphetamine and it's not that easy for me to talk to him since he is 15 years older than me and i am living under his roof(with my parents). I want to approach my mum 1st, but i am certain that she'll be in denial mode and my dad would be in 'cover up' mode.</p>

              <p>Hi....</p>
              <p>I do not recommend that u report to police,</p>
              <p>That is the worst outcome.</p>
              <p>First u have to try to find more information about other groups, such as charity groups, counselling groups, drugs rehabilitation group, religious counselling group, etc.</p>
              <p>Find one suitable group.</p>
              <p>Then you can approach them and plan on how to kidnap your brother.</p>
              <p>Do u understand what I mean?</p>
              <p>You should do intervention with the help of that group.</p>
              <p>This process will take months, at a minimum, and can go for years.</p>
              <p>You have to be patient, but be optimistic as well. It is still possible to save ur brother.</p>
              <p>But remember dont report him to police, or any other government authority. It will just add to his record. Not so nice. Keep it hush hush within the family and the group.</p>
              <p>You have to search for a suitable group now.</p>
              <p>OK good luck.</p>

              <p>You have to talk to them about it.</p>
              <p>I think there must exist in Singapore such groups.</p>
              <p>Yes if you ask them not to report, I believe they will keep it quiet.</p>
              <p>Charity group, drug rehabilitation group, religious counselling group, and such kinds.</p>
              <p>But you have to be strong yourself.</p>
              <p>Some serious tribulation will come your way and your family's way.</p>

              <p><br>Don't you think you seems to have everything well-thought out already?</p>
              <p>If your brother is 15years older than you and you already know what kind of drugs he's administering to himself, then you must be a genius is it?</p>
              <p>What's the point of asking for help when you have already judged how your parents would respond before you even take the necessary actions to resolve this situation and help your brother?</p>
              <p>Just...WHAT KIND OF SON ARE YOU TO YOUR PARENTS ACTUALLY???</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have no idea what kind of "help" you are actually trying to seek around here. Do you really want to find an accomplice to implicate upon when the law finally catches up with your brother?</p>
              <p>Does any other BLIND forumers know what you are trying to do? DO YOU EVEN KNOW WHAT YOU ARE TRYING TO DO RIGHT NOW?</p>
              <p>You need to inform your parents and call the police because there is no way you can send your brother for drug rehabilitation without a police report. It can happen in Hollywood, but not in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Happy now? You can stop picking on our brains with your insane scenarios and also STOP PLACING OTHER IDIOTIC FORUMERS AT RISKS!!!</p>
