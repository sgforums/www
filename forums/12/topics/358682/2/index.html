            <div class='col-md body'><p>I used to work in an NGO providing services to inmates in DRCs and prisons. I remembered about 6 years ago, MHA legislated that all non-government halfway houses and drug rehabiliation facilities are compelled to report anyone who receives voluntary treatment at their services to CNB. I don't think things has changed. so don't be mistaken that the identity of your brother will be kept confidential if he goes to one of these services. On the other hand, reporting him to CNB and subsequently having him sent to a DRC is not beneficial in my opinion as DRCs do not provide any significant treatment. They only deal with the symptoms, by locking up the users. The only community treatment provider in Singapore I am aware of is CAMP at IMH, <a href="http://www.camp.org.sg">www.camp.org.sg</a>. You could try contacting them to get advice. You do not have to identify yourself.</p></div>

              <p><br>I agree with meat pao too. first, he must desire himself to kick the habit. going to the police would meant a "jail term" and they will hold him longer.</p>
              <p>It is important for him not to go back to his "old friends" if he really want to kick the habit but unfortunately our society are never forgiving to them. This may often lead him back to his old ways and old friends.</p>
              <p>There are some companies that will offer thm a job after their term but it will heavily depends on themselves to kick the habit. I know it is hard to kick the habit once you are in but there are "miracles" . And it is only themeselves who can make the miracles.</p>

              <p>My brother took drugs before, and was caught and sentenced. This
                  was like 6 years ago. Now, he is recently married and it was his
                  wife who brought my attention to this matter. I did not believe her
                  at first as I see my brother as being normal when i see him.</p>
              <p>But 2 nights ago, i woke up at aroun 2am(which i rarely do) to
                  go to the toilet. I saw him sitting at the living room with his
                  head down. I guess he was startled and looked at my direction. I
                  was shocked when his eyes were red. And not just the eyeballs, it
                  was like even below the eyes. It's as if there were blood right
                  underneath his skin at that area like someone being possessed in
                  the movies. And he looked at me and asked me where i was going in
                  the most 'high' that i've ever seen a person.</p>
              <p>I wanted to tell my parents abt what i saw, but i just couldnt.
                  I couldnt bear to tell them. When this happened the last time, my
                  mum fainted and cried for 3 weeks and my dad just sat silently in
                  one corner of the house. I couldnt bear to see them go through this
                  again.</p>
              <p>I tried searching for actual evidence with his wife but we
                  couldnt find anything. however, there is this bag that he carries
                  around with it at ALL times. When he's not looking, i would check
                  in it and found syringes. Those that were from my mum's. My
                  mother's diabetic and she's realising that she is having shortages
                  of syringes for her insuline shots.(she bought it on a 3 months
                  basis).</p>
              <p>When i looked into his trash basket, i would see tissues that
                  has blood on it. His wife told me it's the blood from his nose.</p>
              <p>When it's pay day, he would be in the toilet for at least 3
                  hrs. His usual bathing routine is 1 hr. When he get's out of the
                  toilet, he would sit at the living room.</p>
              <p>This morning, when i was in the toilet, I saw a piece of plastic
                  that was stuck at the toilet window. It was the plastic of my mum's
                  syringe and inside it contains a small portion of blue coloured
                  liquid and white powder.</p>
              <p>Can anyone advise me further on what i should do now?</p>

              <p>depends on people.</p>
              <p>first ask if he is having a lot of stress. be nice and show real concern.</p>
              <p>I was thinking, prehaps your brother is undergoing a lot of stress. Being someone like him, who is in jail before, wife needs money, mother is sick, job being low pay and other factors, might create overwhelming stress on him. Being human, he need to find ways to destress, and people have shown him the way that is to do drug abuse.</p>
              <p>Drug abuse do give people a high and fun feeling. And is really able to temporily realise his pain and escape from reality. However, the  withdrawn symptom is difficult to cope, but <strong>dose can reduce to decrease its independence. Taking 90%, 60%, 40% ... Codeine or smoking can be a good replacement to kick the habit. If he got balls, just stop 100% and take the full blown of the withdawn symptoms. He will be alright after a few days.  <br></strong></p>
              <p>He know that taking drug is wrong. But he cannot help himself.</p>
              <p>Try to show care and concern, rarer than reprimand, engage him to do positive activty like exercising or ... something. But can quite stubborn.</p>
