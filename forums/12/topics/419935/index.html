              <p>Hi guys, not sure if anyone remembers my old topic, but last time I took my O levels I got an F9 for maths, which meant that I was unable to apply for 95% of all the poly courses.</p>
              <p>Following advice, I decided to retake my Maths again. I also took up a course at MDIS, studying for a Diploma in Mass Communication (Which I obtained).</p>
              <p>Well, results are in (checked through SEAB's website) and I got an E8. The realization that I just wasted another year of my life hasn't really sunk in yet, so I figured I'd ask you guys for help before depression renders me unable to type coherently.</p>
              <p>Where exactly do I go from here? NS has called me up, I've gone for my medical checkup already, and I expect to enter somewhere around this year (June probably), and I was hoping that if I had managed to enter a polytechnic, I might be able to defer for the time being.</p>
              <p>I really want to enter poly, and I know that some courses need a D7 to enter, allowing you to retake Maths while you study, but E8 is out of the question.</p>
              <p>SEAB however, says on their website that Private candidates can appeal, although I do not know what this does. Can anyone clarify if by paying $100 I can possibly appeal to get my grade pushed up to a D7?</p>
              <p>The link is here: http://www.seab.gov.sg/notification/GCE_O_ExamResults.html</p>
              <p>These are my new results:</p>
              <p>E8 for Maths</p>
              <p>C6 for Literature</p>
              <p>C6 for Food and Nutrition</p>
              <p>B3 for Combined Science</p>
              <p>A2 for Combined Humanities</p>
              <p>A1 for English</p>
              <p>I truly need some guidance here. Should I try applying through the DAE? Thanks for any replies and help.</p>

              <p>You are clearly a Arts person, and Maths happen to be a killer for you.</p>
              <p>The appealing should be done only if you are very certain something is wrong with your grades. They will not up your grade out of sympathy.</p>
              <p>I will suggest you enter NS, and think about what you want to study next. You shouldn't just try your luck and squeeze into some random poly course - odds are you will not do well. I remember there was a guy here who told us he squeezed into some random course which he doesn't like, and scored a GPA of 0.88</p>
              <p>You can also consider taking a private degree with your dip after coming out of NS, anything is a possibility</p>
