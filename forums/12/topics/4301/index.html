It's really a terrible thing to happen especially when ur examz are round the corner... Can't understand how u feel.. How confuse u are at this moment...<br><br>Going straight to the point... I haf to admit that ur bf is actually double dating.. Coz no guy will ever hold the hands of another ger when walking, no matter how close they are... In fact in my point of view, whether a guy has gf or not he shld not be holding a fren's hands. Moreover, if u put urself in the ger's position, I dun think u will let a fren to hold ur hands too rite?? Hence it's natural that if u r holding hands that means both of u will haf some r/s. Even when a guy ask a girl out on a one-to-one basis, the 2 will not hold hands... The answer is pretty obvious.<br><br>Well abt the going out wif ur gf on a holiday part.. I think in ur bf's view, he is going out wif his gf on a holiday. Sadly his real gf is not u...<br><br>However, in another situation where both pple are true to each other, it does not mean holiday, u will be spending time with each other... Of coz sometimes it means that either one could be spending time with one's frens, be it male or female, even alone on a one-to-one basis.. coz I believe both shld haf their own personal time, for themselves or wif their frens.<br><br>If I'm caught in such a situation, I will explain to my gf with the other girl by my side immediately. It's the very least that I shld be doing in that kind of position. I mean it's a natural thing to do, in order not to haf my gf misunderstood me.<br><br>Sorry I will be very direct here, coz I think u need something to kick him out of ur mind. In ur case, I think it better for u to leave him. totally cut off from him, coz he is just making use of u.. either u as the spare or betraying ur feelings... Furthermore, from the fact that he did not even call u to explain or even turn round to give his statement shows how much he cares for u...<br><br>This kind of guy.. can throw him away... Com'on u deserve someone better... Someoen who treats u well... someone who respects u... Not him. I dun see any of such qualities in him... Show him that u can stand on ur feet without him. he's just another passing cloud in ur life... hua bei fen wei li liang, divert all ur attention now on ur studies... that's mroe important... show it to him that even when such a thing happen, it will not hinder ur studies. Prove it to him, he is nothing to u... That should be that way..<br><br>Well, if need someone to console, can always get me at 'beingfunny_1999@yahoo.com' or icq me at '19569168'. be willing to lend u from ear to shoulder.<br><br>All the best for ur 'O'... concentrate on it. And forget abt him. this sort of pple best if his other gf also leave him... teach him a lesson to be a nice gentleman...<br><br>Sorry if my words are too harsh.. but I just want to u froget abt him and the matetr.. coz hecan't get u anywhere to be a successful person in life...<br><br>take care...<br><br>------------------<br>Barely Bearing Berry Belly Bear</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks for teaching mi so much things.I really would want to get him off my mind...I am just too timid...I wanted someone that i luv to luv me...as i had him i dun dare to give him up...til tat day i saw with my own eyes that he's actually using mi as spare tyre...when he's bored he would just asked mi to accompany..i would go n care for him no matter wat time even if it's late at night.I would just rush down when i am half asleep.I guess now...i probably have to think abt my exams.Thanks again</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Now that's my good girl... Glad to hear that u are recovering rather quickly.. Maybe it's the harsh truth, that made u surface to reality again... But it's good to hear from u that u are on the track again.<br><br>I understand that we are always in search for someone to love us and to care for us, be it girls or guys. However, sometimes Things just always straight for us. We just have to encounter some experience to grow up in life... Take it as a lesson learnt.. But dun take it too seriously, to the extent of not having faith in guys anymore, though I understand too, that it will take quite sometime for u to recouperate. But look on the bright side, not all guys are like such.. Still got plenty of guys out there, who deserve of ur love and care... and will love u back as much or even more.<br><br>Let it past and forget it. Tomorrow is another fresh new day..

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>I think you should just forget about this guy. To think that he just told u that it is a close friend of his.  Holding hands is not so simple as close friends. To think he even ignore you. Concentrate on your 'O's because that is more important. The boy is just toying your feelings. Listen to my advice and there are tons of good, faithful guys outside a million times better than him. Don't ever think of giving him a chance even he comes back begging u to forgive him.<br><br>Take care and good luck to your 'O's.<br></div>
