            <div class='col-md body'><br>To make it simple, I had been with this girl for 6 years, and planning to get married. At that time, i always like to gamble soccer. So got 1 day, I lost alot, until I need to borrow money from loan shark...the amount...not to mention, it is near 42K.<br><br>In my first 2 months, i have no problem paying the installment, however my colleagues realized I often use the company computer for soccer betting, as a result, i lost my job. The loan shark was extremely harsh, and I cant pay. That point of time, i had a lot of arguement with my galfren. We are engaged, she still have the engagement diamond ring, so i asked her to sell it to pay my debt. Instead, it caused much of arguement, and 3 weeks of heated arguement, she left.<br><br>At that point of time, i hated her so much and I cursed her, leaving me when i am in such a trouble, when i needed somebody the most.<br><br>4 years past. much had changed. I am a new life. Stead job, quit smoking, not to mention gambling. I am now going happily steady with a gal, going to get marry soon. She was my source of inspiration these few years. I still hate my ex-gal fren until One day....<br><br>One day when i was walking down Raffles City, i saw her!!. I really wanted to go over to scold her, ( coz last time no chance, she changed her address and her mobile number, even her workplace). When i was about to open my mouth, i was shocked, she is still wearing my engagement ring. I sacarsitically<br>asked her, "wah, still wearing my ring". She didnt notice who i was until she turned her head behind. Tears when dripping her eyes. I turned serious, and began to talk to her.<br><br>I was shocked to that she<br>1) is still paying my loan shark money (left back 2000)<br>2) inform the loan shark not too look for me, if not she will not pay a single cent, becoz she knew i am guy who needs alot of face, from friend and family<br>3) she never wanted to sell away the engagement ring<br><br>She never ask for anything in return. She is turning 29 years old now, still single. She also dun wan to give me her mobile number, only a hotmail address, as she knows i am going to get married soon. ( She saw my ring)<br><br>Hate turn into luv and guilt. On that day she left, I luv her so much that it took me 1 year to forget her.<br><br>i thought it was my parents who called the police and settle the loan shark case, i didnt know........ Since no one bug me for money...still care meh that time!!!.<br><br>Suddenly i feel like going back with her, she had done so much for me and the reason i hate her and to forget about her in the past, is becoming the reason why i should luv her more.<br><br>But, BUT, my current galfren also did not do anything wrong to me, and had been supportive to me throughout all these 3 years. How...who should i choose.<br><br>I love both of them now,  but now i got an extra guilty feeling to my first love. HOW?? i am soo confused...<br><br>If u r me, who will u choose? i dun wan to hurt anyone  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i must say this is a very tough decision for u.<br><br>firstly, there wasn't a clean break.<br><br>in fact i would agree that there was a miscommunication between u and ur ex. well, and the reason u hated her brought about ur downfall. she's not in the fault. u were at fault. u gambled. u messed up ur life.<br><br>and the reason why u hated her is because u wanted to sell smth very precious away while it means alot to her. there are other ways i'm sure, but because u were desperate and desperation leads u to wrong decisions.<br><br>i admire the courage and the passion ur ex has for u. but because u messed up, u ended up having another gf and about to get married. are u going to mess this current r/s up as well?<br><br>i'm sure u wouldn't.<br><br>so, let the past be the past. just be grateful to ur ex for all she'd done. my advice... is to stick with ur current r/s.<br><br>i know it's cruel to ur ex and nothing u can do is going to replace the effort she managed to put in to pay ur loans. accept the reality that u've moved on and a close companion had paid the price for u. treat her like a sister, if u r willing to.<br><br>that said, i leave it to u to decide.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Why do women like jerks?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Right, seriously, I'd disagree with some things others have suggested here, but ultimately, you have to decide for yourself - and live with your decision for better or worse.<br><br>Without knowing who you love more(your ex when you were with her or your current girlfriend at this point in time), I'd say what your ex has done has surpassed what most reasonable girls <strong>would ever do</strong>. The fact she was reluctant to sell the engagement ring to raise money to repay your debt, in my view, does not so much represent the sentimental value of the ring to her as much as her love for you. Moreover, I think the fact she actually bothered to lend you a helping hand(and to even do so behind your back) despite you two already not being together("clean break" or not, it's quite clear both you and your ex have established a tacit and implicit understanding that your relationship is over) merely reinforces that point as far as I can see.<br><br>No disrespect to your current girlfriend, but I suppose there's some reservation about her which has prompted you to even consider getting back with your ex to begin with - <strong>quite simply, you do not know how much hardship your current girlfriend is, or will ever be, prepared to go through with you.</strong> Subconsciously, whether you would want to admit to it or not, you know this is playing on your mind somewhat and - I could be wrong here though - someday when things go wrong(be it a tiff or whatever) with your current girlfriend, you're bound to draw comparisons between her and your ex. Should this be the case, then I think you should quite readily acknowledge at the back of your mind that it's still your ex whom you love more and against whom all your other girlfriends(be it your current one or future ones if things don't work out with the current one  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> ) will be benchmarked against.<br><br>At the end of the day, my only advice is to make a decision with your heart - if it's your ex you truly love, but remain unsure simply because you wouldn't like to break up with your current girlfriend because she has done nothing wrong and has been nice to you over the 3 years you've been together, then go back to your ex. It might sound cruel and harsh to your girlfriend, but I suppose you know better than most that's for the best in the long run. However, if you are only pondering this issue out of gratitude for your ex, then you're obviously better off staying in your current relationship. <strong>In essence, you should make a decision based on what you feel is best for yourself and disregard the interests of both women in the process - this may sound cruel, but I suppose it's the only way for you to truly find an answer to your question.</strong><br><br>Nevertheless, just remember to bear in mind that whatever you decide to do, it's a decision you'll have to live with...<br><br>Good Luck!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>
