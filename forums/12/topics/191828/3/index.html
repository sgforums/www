It's just not fair for both your current and ex girlfriends if u can't love one whole-heartedly.</div>

(My opinion, it is his life so up to him)<br>My opinion is that the original poster should inform the current gf of his previous relationship, how they were so in love that his ex broke off and helped him pay for his debts. Ask to separate on the basis that he owes his ex too much.<br><br>Then he should go back to the ex, and ask for her forgiveness, and seek to reconcile to love her and take care of her forever.<br><br>If like you said, she does not want to be with him anymore (which I don't believe so, coz I think that silly (but adorable) gal took the burden of helping her loved one to pay off his debts IN SILENCE), then so be it. He loses both gals.<br><br>I think he deserves it for losing both, and being together with any one of them is more than a blessing for him.<br><br>Be responsible! Come out and be a man! You wasted a gal's youth, and had another gal and was in bliss for those few years, where there she was heartbroken and suffering in SILENCE. It was your ex that GAVE YOU the opportunity to become debt-free, then meet another gal and whom then proceeded to help you change. Whatever it is, I doubt anyone can match up to what she has done. Be responsible and seek to repay her for the rest of your life.</div>

The above statement shows how horrible you are. You ARE the one that owed the money, as a man, you should settle it yourself.<br><br>No one bug you for money, you just don't care.<br><br>Actually, you don't deserve both gals, based on your actions that time.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey marry is not play, play leh ... you know? I think you still love your ex. otherwise you won't hate her in the first place. Love and hate is just two side of the coin. But you also love your current girlfriend and going to marry. Better stop the marriage and think about your feeling first. Who you love most? Don't choose the one that's because you felt you own her.<br><br>By the way, you should return your ex-girlfriend the money that she paid to the loan shark. Is your mistake for gambling too much, not her. You shouldn't get her to pay even if you don't have the money. If you don't pay her back...then my advise to you is don't ever marry. This show that you are an irresponsible man and not suitable to marry. You will only hurt both women.<br><br>By the way first love is always the most special person. I still missed my first love even thou I am attached.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> It may not be love, it is just because this is first love.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Come on people, this is so lame. He is just making up a story for us to discuss. Imagine $42,000? Do you all know whats is the interest for that kind of amount in a month? Tho i am not sure but at 10 or 20% of that amount is enough to kill someone alrdy... Imagine $4000 to $8000 in interest alone in a month.  4 yrs... 48 x $8000 = $384, 000 and this doesn't include the load amound yet... who can pay! Even LS are not that stupid to lend this kind of money to 1 guy. Unless he plan not to get his money back.<br><br>After going out with her for 6 yrs suddenly she cannot be found? changed her contact number, address and workplace..? What about her relatives... you know her for 6 yrs, about to get married, dunno any of them? Or the entire family tree move also because of this? Grand Father, Grand Mother, Uncles, Aunts, Brothers, Sisters, cousins, Man... Hard to belief this sad story.<br><br>Whatever it is, stop the bull shit bro. There are alot of nice people who believed in your story &amp; giving you good &amp; kind advise here but you are taking them for a ride only. And IF its real as you claim.... JUST LEAVE BOTH OF THEM , FOR THEIR OWN GOOD! Cos with the World Cup &amp; Casino coming, you will probably bring them more troubles.<br><br>A leopard never changes it's spots &amp; a compulsive lier never change!</div>
