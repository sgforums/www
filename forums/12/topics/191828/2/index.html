            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by TrU PeAce (^0*)v:</div><div class="quote_body">To make it simple, I had been with this girl for 6 years, and planning to get married. At that time, i always like to gamble soccer. So got 1 day, I lost alot, until I need to borrow money from loan shark...the amount...not to mention, it is near 42K.<br><br>In my first 2 months, i have no problem paying the installment, however my colleagues realized I often use the company computer for soccer betting, as a result, i lost my job. The loan shark was extremely harsh, and I cant pay. That point of time, i had a lot of arguement with my galfren. We are engaged, she still have the engagement diamond ring, so i asked her to sell it to pay my debt. Instead, it caused much of arguement, and 3 weeks of heated arguement, she left.<br><br>At that point of time, i hated her so much and I cursed her, leaving me when i am in such a trouble, when i needed somebody the most.<br><br>4 years past. much had changed. I am a new life. Stead job, quit smoking, not to mention gambling. I am now going happily steady with a gal, going to get marry soon. She was my source of inspiration these few years. I still hate my ex-gal fren until One day....<br><br>One day when i was walking down Raffles City, i saw her!!. I really wanted to go over to scold her, ( coz last time no chance, she changed her address and her mobile number, even her workplace). When i was about to open my mouth, i was shocked, she is still wearing my engagement ring. I sacarsitically<br>asked her, "wah, still wearing my ring". She didnt notice who i was until she turned her head behind. Tears when dripping her eyes. I turned serious, and began to talk to her.<br><br>I was shocked to that she<br>1) is still paying my loan shark money (left back 2000)<br>2) inform the loan shark not too look for me, if not she will not pay a single cent, becoz she knew i am guy who needs alot of face, from friend and family<br>3) she never wanted to sell away the engagement ring<br><br>She never ask for anything in return. She is turning 29 years old now, still single. She also dun wan to give me her mobile number, only a hotmail address, as she knows i am going to get married soon. ( She saw my ring)<br><br>Hate turn into luv and guilt. On that day she left, I luv her so much that it took me 1 year to forget her.<br><br>i thought it was my parents who called the police and settle the loan shark case, i didnt know........ Since no one bug me for money...still care meh that time!!!.<br><br>Suddenly i feel like going back with her, she had done so much for me and the reason i hate her and to forget about her in the past, is becoming the reason why i should luv her more.<br><br>But, BUT, my current galfren also did not do anything wrong to me, and had been supportive to me throughout all these 3 years. How...who should i choose.<br><br>I love both of them now,  but now i got an extra guilty feeling to my first love. HOW?? i am soo confused...<br><br>If u r me, who will u choose? i dun wan to hurt anyone  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br></div></blockquote>Personal advice for you would be to choose one and explain the whole situation to the other...<br><br>If I'm in your shoes and only allow to choose one, I'll probably just carry on my life with my current gf... Though I would probably try to remind as friends with that ex.... And try to make up for things if I could...?<br><br>If you could handle it (and think that they can handle it), you might like to let them know the whole situation before you make your decision too...? (though might not really be advisable...)<br><br>If you would like to talk more about your situation with me, pls PM me....?</div>

If you have one name already, then more or less you already know the answer deep within yourself and you know what to do.<br><br>I believe he can be grateful to both (one in loving him so much she took his burden, the other for changing him), but there is only one which he will love more than the other.<br><br>Be fair to both gals, you cannot possibly love both and marry both, but u should choose the one that is deeper in your heart.</div>

At that time, i always like to gamble soccer. So got 1 day, I lost alot, until I need to borrow money from loan shark...the amount...not to mention, it is near 42K.<br><br>In my first 2 months, i have no problem paying the installment, however my colleagues realized I often use the company computer for soccer betting, as a result, i lost my job. The loan shark was extremely harsh, and I cant pay. That point of time, i had a lot of arguement with my galfren. We are engaged, she still have the engagement diamond ring, so i asked her to sell it to pay my debt. Instead, it caused much of arguement, and 3 weeks of heated arguement, she left.<br><br>At that point of time, i hated her so much and I cursed her, leaving me when i am in such a trouble, when i needed somebody the most.<br><br>4 years past. much had changed. I am a new life. Stead job, quit smoking, not to mention gambling. I am now going happily steady with a gal, going to get marry soon. She was my source of inspiration these few years. I still hate my ex-gal fren until One day....<br><br>One day when i was walking down Raffles City, i saw her!!. I really wanted to go over to scold her, ( coz last time no chance, she changed her address and her mobile number, even her workplace). When i was about to open my mouth, i was shocked, she is still wearing my engagement ring. I sacarsitically<br>asked her, "wah, still wearing my ring". She didnt notice who i was until she turned her head behind. Tears when dripping her eyes. I turned serious, and began to talk to her.<br><br>I was shocked to that she<br>1) is still paying my loan shark money (left back 2000)<br>2) inform the loan shark not too look for me, if not she will not pay a single cent, becoz she knew i am guy who needs alot of face, from friend and family<br>3) she never wanted to sell away the engagement ring<br><br>She never ask for anything in return. She is turning 29 years old now, still single. She also dun wan to give me her mobile number, only a hotmail address, as she knows i am going to get married soon. ( She saw my ring)<br><br>Hate turn into luv and guilt. On that day she left, I luv her so much that it took me 1 year to forget her.<br><br>i thought it was my parents who called the police and settle the loan shark case, i didnt know........ Since no one bug me for money...still care meh that time!!!.<br><br>Suddenly i feel like going back with her, she had done so much for me and the reason i hate her and to forget about her in the past, is becoming the reason why i should luv her more.<br><br>But, BUT, my current galfren also did not do anything wrong to me, and had been supportive to me throughout all these 3 years. How...who should i choose.<br><br>I love both of them now,  but now i got an extra guilty feeling to my first love. HOW?? i am soo confused...<br><br>If u r me, who will u choose? i dun wan to hurt anyone  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br></div></blockquote>6yrs of relationship and you treated her for granted whereas, she've been holding you in her 1st priority in her life...why? becoz of the engagement ring....by any means, do you know what's an engagment ring? And do you know how much of importance the engagement ring is to her?  Do you know the sigificance of the engagement ring to her? What's the significance of the engagement ting means to you? To you, it doesn't seem important as long as by selling that e.ring will be able to tide you away from your debts for a time being...<br><br>Enough of "lecturings"...Time for some analysis...<br><br>Till today, your ex-gf (to you, she's your Ex, but not to her, why? Coz she still hold you at her most important place), still helping you to settle the debt...<br><br>29yrs old...it seems that you've indirectly or rather, directly affected and wasted her youth for many years...whereas, you've continued your happy life since then...<br><br>Have a good talk with your "ex-gf" and "current gf"...be fair to both...under such circumstances, you're selfish coz you want either one of them but do not want any of them to be hurt..including you, yourself...<br><br>I believe your current gf shld be quite young..say, 25++ or &lt;29?..if so, let your current gf knows your feelings and thoughts..if i'll you, be it means of repaying back to your ex-gf, i sugguest, you shld end your ties with yoru current gf and re-build your relationship with your ex-gf, for she has done damn fcuking alot sacrifices for you....you've to slog your damn life to support her and take good care and love her...what she needs now most, is not your pitiful for her...what she needs now most is a guy whom she've always carrying with in her heart n mind...is it the current you? I don't know, but it's definetely the "7~9yrs ago you"....<br><br>Either one of them will be hurt.......no horse run....</div>
