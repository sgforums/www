There was once upon a time when I felt this way (that was also the time when I thought up the 'water-that-will-let-me-forget' idea) but I think this kinda thing is just not possible. We human beings will only learn something when we go through a rough patch. It is also what makes us stronger in the end <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>I do not think I would know the true meaning of happiness now had I not experienced the things I had gone through earlier this year. And just like I have come out of it safely, I believe you can get through the tough period in your life right now as well.<br><br>At that time, I find it very useful to talk to people about my problems...and they helped to make me feel better  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> So if you want to find someone to share your problems wif, we are always here  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
