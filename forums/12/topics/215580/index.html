            <div class='col-md body'>Just to clarify, rebelling is almost a last-resort action.<br><br>Parents neglecting their children are bad. But over-protection has its problems too. You shelter your kids for most of their childhood and they never learn to be street-smart. It's good to learn to be a little tough. It goes a long way.<br><br>Here's my opinion. At 18 years, he does not have an ATM card. Does he need one? Not really. Would it be useful if he does? Yes. If he happens to be out, and he's a little short on cash, he can go to an ATM and draw out some money. That's the basic premise. But if we think about why his parents refuse to give him an ATM, we can come surely come up with our own conclusions. ATM card -&gt; easy to withdraw money -&gt; spend money anyhow -&gt; spend on who? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>The question is not about ATM cards really. it's not a necessity, just a luxury.<br><br>Looking back at his post, what struck me most now is the fact that his parents only allowed him to carry his IC recently. (fyi, singapore law doesn't require its citizens to carry their ICs. it is not an offence. sure there might be some inconvenience if the police stops a person, but it's not an offence)<br><br>But think about it. Why only now? We know an IC is valuable. If lost, it's a lot of hassle. But it also proves who a person is. The fact that his parents didnt allow him to carry his own IC until recently goes to show, in my opinion, that they don't trust him enough.<br><br>So it seems to me, that the bottom line is "trust". I think the threadstarter has to either earn his parents' trust, or prove it in one way or another. Can be through discussions, or through actions.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by matchless:</div><div class="quote_body">Just to clarify, <span style="color: red;">rebelling is almost a last-resort action. </span><br>Parents neglecting their children are bad. But over-protection has its problems too. You shelter your kids for most of their childhood and they never learn to be street-smart. It's good to learn to be a little tough. It goes a long way.<br><br>Here's my opinion. At 18 years, he does not have an ATM card. Does he need one? Not really. Would it be useful if he does? Yes. If he happens to be out, and he's a little short on cash, he can go to an ATM and draw out some money. That's the basic premise. But if we think about why his parents refuse to give him an ATM, we can come surely come up with our own conclusions. ATM card -&gt; easy to withdraw money -&gt; spend money anyhow -&gt; spend on who? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>The question is not about ATM cards really. <span style="color: orange;">it's not a necessity, just a luxury.</span><br><br>Looking back at his post, what struck me most now is the fact that his parents only allowed him to carry his IC recently. (fyi, singapore law doesn't require its citizens to carry their ICs. it is not an offence. sure there might be some inconvenience if the police stops a person, but it's not an offence)<br><br>But think about it. Why only now? We know an IC is valuable. If lost, it's a lot of hassle. But it also proves who a person is. The fact that his parents didnt allow him to carry his own IC until recently goes to show, in my opinion, that they don't trust him enough.<br><br>So it seems to me, that the bottom line is "trust". I think the threadstarter has to either earn his parents' trust, or prove it in one way or another. Can be through discussions, or through actions.<br><br></div></blockquote>rebel is not only the last option to take, but you only use it when you are virtually being pushed to the last line of defence - the wall with nowhere to go to than you rebel.<br><br>i had mine quite young around primary sch, many yrs back already...there's acutally a price to pay if you want to gain freedom the fast way. I had my fair share of price to pay.<br><br>if you aren't ready to lose some of the things which you are enjoying now, den dun even think of getting freedom the fast way!<br><br>when there's gain, there's something which you ought to lose.<br>no one can have all the good things by themselves one.<br><br>if you want a normal route of freedom, just grow up and be more mature first, other things will come sooner when your parents see the mature (grown up change factor) in you than they will slowly learn to give you more freedom.<br><br>as for money, with the usage of ATM, you ought to have discipline yourself.<br><br>why most parents don't let kids have atm, worried that your savings over the years will be gone in no time. For me personally my elder brother and sister have this brother. So i know how it's like to be lacking in discipline yet have a card on hand. Imagine you have a card, but inisde bal is $0/-<br><br>how would you feel<br><br>or would you prefer to know that your bank has $xxxx/- for you when you are ready to take control of your own card with the necessary discipline needed.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If we say things like, "Its for your own good". You'll most probably say that we're ignorant, Perhaps you might not understand it. But in actual FACT, In time you'll understand why they're doing this.<br><br>You might think that they are overprotecting, Well than think about people whom you mentioned back then. Do you think they are better than you? Well the fact that your parents are actually setting rules and regulations for you even when your 18, It actually means something. Its just how you interpret it <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">. I'll leave you to that.</div>
