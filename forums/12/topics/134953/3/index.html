I dont want to miss this opportunity to care for someone i admire<br><br>Am I a bad person.... ?</div></blockquote>In our conservative society, guys who have feelings for attached girls are scorned as 3rd party trouble-makers.<br><br>Love is not binding until both sides find something they have both been searching for. Just because they are currently attached does not imply that the search is over. Sometimes, qualities you dun find in your current half can be readily found in another person. Break-ups are always hard just as change is always difficult.<br><br>Many couples get involved too early before maturity and common sense sets in. Call it puppy love if you will. This is a receipe for problems, especially if both sides are not open and understanding. Because the likelihood of meeting someone more suited to yourself is very high, breakups are ultimately inevitable.<br><br>What is important is you stay true to yourself. Be selfish if you have to because the person you end up with will stay with you and 'till death do we part'. Certainly no one wants to commit into such a matrimony only to regret it and divorce later.<br><br>I am not an avocator of 3rd parties. I abhore such people who openly and eagerly come between you and the one you love. As long as people know the unwritten rules: that an attached person is off-limits, then staying friends is fine. Let the other person make up their own minds. But do not coax the other into initiating a breakup. Should that happen,  the person must act on his/her own without interference.<br><br>In any case, people must come to terms with their relationship. If you have done enough, then trust is what holds it together. If the other side demands more everytime, then perhaps the breakup was imminent anyway.<br><br>No one should deceive themselves on such matters. Face the facts and accept the truth.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Don't ask her out for a date. Let her ask you out. From there you will know whether she loves\likes you or no.<br><br>Let her call you. Why should you call her when she's already attached since you liked her. Make her call you. You won't know how much she really likes you unless she starts asking all the questions.<br><br>Your dates are not romantic at all.<br><br>She loves you she will tell you everything.<br>I repeat<br><strong>Everything.</strong><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by IntenseFlame:</div><div class="quote_body">I have this problem ,<br><br>I fell in love with this wonderful girl but she got bf. The thing is i really do like her very much .<br><br>Ok...I spend time calling her every time. Every week i ask her out for date and she dun mind spending time with me. Most of our outings are very romantic and i know she loves it. I try hard to win her heart from the bf. Am i doing a wrong thing seeking for someone i love ?<br><br>i did hint her that i do like her  ? she is confuse as i am since she is attach. Each time i go out with her.... it is always romantic places such as... beach walking, movie , romantic restaurants , sun set watching.....<br><br>sigh.... why do i fall in love in such a complicated girl ? As much as  I love her...i am not going to confess since she has a bf. I am willing to loose everything waiting for her each but<br><br>Am i wrong waiting for her to break up ?<br>Can i still treat her nice and bring her to romantic places ?<br><br>I am just a normal guy..... I dont mind waiting long for her , i wonder she knows my intention.<br><br>All i know is she is very caring and i care for her very much too. I dont want to miss this opportunity to care for someone i admire<br><br>Am I a bad person.... ?</div></blockquote></div>
