            <div class='col-md body'>You are not a bad person...but you are pitiful...to fall in love with someone who is already attached always is...<br><br>I think you sound very young, so that is good. Emotions change more easily when you are young...there is a good chance you will change your mind about her or she might change her mind about her current bf. She is entitled to change her mind, so you don't have to feel guilty if she switched bf. But you should not try to break them up...continue to date her if she is happy to do so and play the gentleman. Never say anything bad about her bf but make clear that you are interested in her and still waiting.<br><br>One warning though....how long are you prepared to wait? Your waiting might be in vain and in the meantime, you are letting other girls pass you by. I speak from experience...I waited 7 years for a girl who never responded, then another 10 years for a second girl who did not reciprocate. Before you know it, you are close to being unmarriageable. You sure you are prepared to wait?</div>

And of cos you still can treat her nice and bring her to romantic places if she's also willing to do so. And you're supposed to treat everyone nicely...not just the girl that you like, even for the girl that you don't like...as long as she doesn't offends you. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Yes, you are a bad person for tackling other guy's gf. That's unforgivable and your deeds will catch up with you later in due time. Never cause breakups in other people's relationship or you'll face the dire retribution for meddling in others' destiny. IF they have to break up, let it happen naturally if that is their destiny...ok?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>But still, there's nothing wrong to like someone's gf. And you should let her know that you like her NOT for the sake of making her leave her bf for you or even hoping that she might does that. Anyway, if she does leave her bf...it can only means 2 things. Either her bf sucks or she's a girl with loose morals and she will leave you when she's found another guy who's better than you.<br><br>Good luck. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i would like to offer my 2-cents worth from the perspective of a female.<br><br>i feel that there is nothing wrong with u, going after someone u like, despite being a 3rd party to a r/s. i presume, from ur post, that u r both very young. so u r all still at a stage of experimentation.<br><br>the fact that the girl didnt reject ur dates outright means she probably enjoys going out with u or at least she likes the attention. i dunno whether u r driving a flashy car or brings her out to expensive and lavish dinners, ie. i dunno whether she is a material girl. in that case, then i don't respect her.<br><br>but assuming she is not, then i tink she is just a very normal girl but still unsure what she wants. so u shld confess to her how u feel... come on, no guy showers that kind of attention on a platonic friend, i am sure she is not stupid, can tell that u r interested in her...<br><br>i dun agree that if she chooses u, it would be bcos her bf sucks or she got loose morals. it could be bcos she really likes u and compared to her bf, u suit her better.  Of cos, beware that if she can do this to the bf, she can do it to u next time.<br><br>of cos, do be smart, dun be led on by her, while she makes u wait for 7-10 yrs for an answer. surely if she is serious abt u or at least appreciate ur friendship, she would be able to make a decision soon.<br><br></div>

You can play this game, but your risk is high.<br><br>But to chase someone unavailable needs alot of tact and planning. All is fair in love and war; but you have to make sure that you do not introduce new scenarios by chasing her (e.g trigger her desire to be loved by many, etc). This kinda of case is highly volatile and your position/stand often shift. Do not presume that just because you chase her, WITH your love on her and your DESIRE to be with her, create much intensity in her life that ultimately deliver stress or tears.<br><br>In the end, you would have realise that it could be your own selfish possession of love, not product of love itself.<br><br>P.S: Loving doesn't meant being together, thus being together doesn't mean loving. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>A completely satisfied woman cannot be seduced</strong></span>.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

Youth can blind one to do seemingly courageous things without much sober thoughts.<br><br>Although many may say that you can't gain any if you don't feel any pain, you still won't know how bad the pain is till  your heart is broken.<br><br>Morality and social consciousness to all parties involved aside, are you serious enough about her to take so many risks? Is she the one whom you know that you'll marry at the end of the long hard day?<br><br>When in doubt, wait. There's no hurry when you are finding a partner whom you want to be with for the next 40 yrs of your life.<br><br>If your beliefs are different ie love doesn't lead to marriage, of course, feel free to experiment with your body and soul in as many devastating ways as you deem fine.</div>

Dissatisfaction with a partner is never a good justification for infidelity -- that is where the moral strength of the person comes in.</div>

Some people just move on seeking new excitement when they get bored and start spinning coins when with their partners.

The thing is i really do like her very much .<br><br>Ok...I spend time calling her every time. Every week i ask her out for date and she dun mind spending time with me. Most of our outings are very romantic and i know she loves it. I try hard to win her heart from the bf. Am i doing a wrong thing seeking for someone i love ?<br><br>i did hint her that i do like her  ? she is confuse as i am since she is attach. Each time i go out with her.... it is always romantic places such as... beach walking, movie , romantic restaurants , sun set watching.....<br><br>sigh.... why do i fall in love in such a complicated girl ? As much as  I love her...i am not going to confess since she has a bf. I am willing to loose everything waiting for her each but<br><br>Am i wrong waiting for her to break up ?<br>Can i still treat her nice and bring her to romantic places ?<br><br>I am just a normal guy..... I dont mind waiting long for her , i wonder she knows my intention.<br><br>All i know is she is very caring and i care for her very much too. I dont want to miss this opportunity to care for someone i admire<br><br>Am I a bad person.... ?</div></blockquote>U r not a bad person.... and although no age is stated my guess is that u and the girl is very young...<br><br>right now there is a thin line or even no lines at all between:<br><br>keeping options open vs two timing<br>going out with frend vs dating<br>etc etc...<br><br>I will not be judgemental and say who is right or wrong... but from what u state here.. i don't think u r wrong in anyway.<br><br>But everyone have to protect themselves..... so the question is what u expect out of this and how the girl feel.<br><br>So girls like the attention and they do not mind attention from other guys. so even if she is not going to have any long term thot with u, she might just go along with your wooing and dating..... such girls could be as sweet as angels and u can't tell... and seriously if they don't hurt anyoen it is fine.<br><br>If that is acceptable to you and u enjoy her company.... then go ahead.<br><br>But my thot is that u want some level of "commitment" from her. in this case u should ask urself about the girl. Does her bf know that she is going on "romantic" dates with you. In that r/s for her and her bf, does that count as "cheating". Note that some couples have "open" r/s where they can go out with other people..... but does that apply here...<br><br>If it is cheating then u should ask urself whether this girl is really suitable for you.<br><br>if she cheat on her bf she might cheat on u too.....<br><br>Also u said u "hinted" to her. i think u should tell her straight out. and then see what she say..... maybe she is just waiting for u to tell her straight out...<br><br>since u r the man, be direct and tell her how u feel about her.... in no uncertain terms.... and then see what she say, maybe she is just waiting for u to say those key words for her to commit to you?<br><br></div>
