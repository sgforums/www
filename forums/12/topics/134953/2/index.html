            <div class='col-md body'>Wow it looks like so many of you hate me.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>ACtually... i like her and i have no idea how i like her , if you  can control your feelings for someone that is NOT LOVE . Love is pure and it is blind too. I tried not to call her or even sms her but i failed.<br><br>Yeap , i do think of her bf and my bad deeds. I am not trying to cause break ups between them or both of them. That is the last thing i will do. I will not confess my love to her but i am sure she knew i like her. I will not cause any harm on this girl  and also wish that the choose the right person in her life rather than a perfect person.<br><br>Going romantic places ..... hmmmm.... actually she suggested it and i just implement. When i first date her....she suggested beach walking. I have never involve in any physical / sexual activities with her since she is still attach.<br><br>I believe that love is not just commitment , Love is more than commitment , LOVE is Passion and Affection. If love is just a matter of commitment , break ups will happen even after our marriage. That is one of the social stigma these days. Love is about fireworks and romance and being passion  , caring and builing dreams together. THIS IS HOW I DEFINE LOVE.<br><br>YEAP... i met her like recently , two months. I believe in one thing...if a guy treats a girl nice , caring , passion , affection and bring her at the top of the world , it is impossible she will fall for another guy. But if a guy treats his gf just for social status and needs....then it is most likely he will loose her.<br><br>WHAT IF SHE TREATS ME AS SPARE TYRE ????? CAN I WAIT THAT LONG ??<br>The answer to that question is.... she might treat me as a spare tyre. It is me who loose everything in life but i belive she will loose more because girls speak through heart and emotions. If she dump me and go back to her bf I will not be angry with her because i prepared for the worst. I am sure she will be bored going for a relationship with the bf since  she spend so much time with me.<br><br>GUYS  and GIRLS are different in nature. Guys convey message by using logics while girls convey message through feelings and heart.<br><br>sorry for causing so much trouble in this forum but i do hope you guys learn something here and treat your gf with passion and affection. No matter what guys came into her life she will still be with you because girls dont choose the best guy , they choose the right guy in their life.<br><br>For me i am just tring to find the rifght person in my life . I will treat her the best and make her life a wonderful journey under the roof of fireworks.<br><br></div>

For wat? Going out with a girl who had already cheated on her bf ?  Hey she may even be sleeping around too rite?<br>Are you 100% sure she never cheat her bf at all or maybe IntenseFlame is only one of her play toy?<br><br>You  guys keep blaming him but hey is the THE GIRL who actually making all the moves by asking him out rite?<br><br>Come on people wake up!!!<br><br>He is not in a third party case but only a toy to the evil girl who plays with her bf.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For me, very simple, in this world, there is nothing is "RIGHT", and nothing is "WRONG". People see things from different angles, I don't have to agree with what people said, and people don't have to agree with what I said. "You just get the girl you love what, everyone also like that what"....blah blah blah....<br><br>What did I do after someone snatched away the one I love? I won't like some s.t.u.p.i.d-i.d.i.o.t that shows in the newspaper, cut the person into pieces?<br><br>Well, there are lots of better ways, so, I made a trip to Thailand, find a master, curse him, incant him with black magic incantation, with my blood, a pass away baby (3 days old), and a black dog's head...well, he is kind of s.t.u.p.i.d to let me find out his date of birth, and his real name.<br><br>Yes, that's what I did to the person, and he deserved that, and even more than that.<br><br>Who's "RIGHT", and who's "WRONG", not me, and not him either. He made his choice, so do I. But he deserved to "ENJOY" what he suffers now. You know how he is suffering now? Well, now, by looking at him, you can't even tell that he is a "human".<br><br>Well, you don't have to agree with what I did, same here, do I have to agree with what you said? It's a matter of choice, you hurting people, be prepared to be hurt by them, in whatever way.<br><br>Good luck, "what goes around, what come around", retribution will come, but might be in different way.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>haizz...beware dude, the gal might just want ur attention that's all. If she feels that there's no point in dragging her current relationship....she probably would have broke up ages ago.....i guess the reason she's still in the relationship...is to have the best of both worlds...haizz... one is always selfish..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Its nothing wrong , jus tat fate played a trick on u at the moment when u tot tat u finally can have some1 special all by urself , but tat wasnt the case .<br><br>U have given effort to stop this from happening but the feeling is unbearable , the same feeling i felt some yrs ago .<br><br>In fact i had tried going after some1's gf b4 , it wasnt intentional .It all started as normal frens n things jus sparked somehw. It takes 2 hands to clap , i would say for my experience , the gal was sorta interested.If she had given the stop sign , i would nt have gone further . I m sure of tat . Haix, ultimately i indirectly caused the their broke up , which remained gulity . But y i said indirectly , cos the gal didnt chose me , in fact she had chosen some 4th party.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> , lol , he jus hopped out from no where .<br><br>U koe the feeling of helplessness is unbearable n things jus go on its on beyond our control.Selfish as it may seemed ,but hw many of us can say n do the right thing when such incident happen to us. Bystanders will flame n curse , i would too in fact , but i have sinned n experienced it .<br><br>hmm , wat i wan to say is , u have given ur efforts to stop , but has the gal realised wat has she been doing ? she is giving u hope by going out with u , a sensible method of a responsible gf is nt to go out on dates with a interested guy . m i rite ? haix .. things arent within our control ..<br><br>the famous sayings .. fight for ur own happiness .. don build ur joy on ppl's misery ...<br><br>wtf .. sometimes life jus screw all of us</div>
