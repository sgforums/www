            <div class='col-md body'>hey guys n gals,<br><br>i've got this problem of excessive sweating (hyperhidrosis. is what they call it). i tried everything from clinics to pharmacies but could find no cure for this problem. it really bothers me to know that most ppl overlook this condition as something that isn't serious. they tell me that its in my head and then i could get over it. do you know what it feels like to explain to someone that you just saw a ghost? its impossible! i've lived with this condition 10 years in my life, every second of it to realise that i'm not hallucinating or delusional. i only know about this being a medical problem recently. i am brimming with sweat and its always my face and my handkerchief, while other ppl are bickering on their handphones and doing with their hair. it feels unfair! i'm not making the words look bigger, i am literally brimming with sweat! it follows me everywhere i go. it affects my social skills with people. a mosquito bite or two may bother you but it doesn't affect you that much. a pail of water over your forehead bothers you and sure it does affect you physically and emotionally. whats sad is that ppl who aren't like me, well, they won't see the problem cuz they dun have it. i'm sure most of us in singapore sweat ocassionally, hey this is singapore right? sweating is normal which is why i strongly emphasize the keyword HYPERHIDROSIS which is EXCESSIVE sweating, a silent killer which is driving me nuts. BTW, i tried em' all. drink less water and tried anti perspirants but they don't work. i'm definitely not obese cos i have a workout regiment. i'm a normal person i just wonder why there isn't a normal cure for cases like this. help me... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"></div>
