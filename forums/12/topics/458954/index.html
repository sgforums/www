I know parents are very attach to their children, but we were never close. since young, she either beat or nag and tell me old grandmother stories, I never confided in her anything. I know I am being unfilial, but I really dun respect her, as the messy she left in the kitchen, fridge pissed me off. once you clean the fridge, guarantee you a few days later the kitchen will be dirty and filled with food crumps lying all around.</p></div>

              <p>Ok. So your parents are uneducated, uncivilized, no class and perhaps border line mental.</p>
              <p>Now, who can like people like them ? I wonder if they even like themselves.</p>
              <p>Are u being unfiliial ? No. You haven't abandoned them yet.</p>
              <p>Now here's the thing, your uneducated parents puts u through school, so u may become educated, civilized , learn some class, but they certainly can't guarantee u are not as psycho.</p>
              <p>Its good that u are not like them, else all the efforts spent educating u are wasted.</p>
              <p>But heres the problem, Your parents hav lived like pigs BEFORE you are born. what makes u think they will change now? </p>
              <p>Now, since the reason they live like uncivilized barbarians is because they were never educated like you. Perhaps, the best solution is for them to go back to school, so they may learn to live like a civilized human being , yes?</p>
              <p>Ypur father pushed your friend ? Could it be that your friend did something to piss your dad off? </p>
              <p>Since your parents are barbarians, I really don't understand why you want to bring your friends home. Try playing at your friend's house instead.</p>
              <p>Your mother beat, nag and tell you old folks story, that's her futile attempt to teach,discipline and warn you about life. Of cors there's better and more effective way to do so, unfortunately, given how uneducated she is, she don't know how. </p>
              <p>So, she do what she knows to do, perhaps that was how her parents homeschooled her when she was young- Beat, nag and brainwash with grandmother stories. </p>
              <p>Now, you may wonder, why she thinks all those tactics works on you when they only repels you more. Because, she never considers herself to be a failure of a human being, so what works on her, surely will work on you too. Understand ?</p>
              <p>Now, of cors you don't have to respect them, in your mind, they have done nothing to earn your respect. Then may I ask , what must they do , in order to earn your respect ? And have you conveyed your requirements to them at all ?</p>
              <p>While you demand they understand you, have you ever try to understand them ? Relationship is never a one way street. </p>

              <p>Everybody also hate their parents, then, one day, they themselve become parents, they start to understand their own parent's unconditioned love to them, some regretted because they never had a chance to cherish it or repaid it, cos parents all up lorry already, those who became parents and their own parents are still around, would start to Love their parents</p>
              <p>For without hate, where got Love? It is good that you got mother and father to hate, people like me, want to hate my mother, also no mother</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>TS...I feel sorry for you. I don't blame you for hating them,I hate mine too because they never gave me any chance to speak up and they always wanted things their way. The only thing you can possibly do is just try to accept who they are and try to live through it. Try staying away from them...go out all day long and only come home at night where they have less time to nag...that's what I always do. Leave the mess in the kitchen until she realises that she really needs to clean up the mess. Draw a line between your room and the "territories" that your parents control in your house and reinforce your own rules. That's all I can say. It worked for me but not sure how it'll work for you.</p></div>
