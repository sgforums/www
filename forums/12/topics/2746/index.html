            <div class='col-md body'>A Fine Example<br><br>Why I Fired My Secretary<br><br>Two weeks ago was my 45th birthday, and I wasn't feeling too hot that morning anyway. I went down<br>to breakfast knowing my wife would be pleasant and say "Happy Birthday," and probably have a<br>present for me.<br><br>She didn't even say "Good Morning," let alone any "Happy Birthday."<br><br>I thought, "Well, that's wives for you. The children will remember."<br><br>The children came down to breakfast and didn't say a word.<br><br>When I started to the office I was feeling pretty low and despondent. As I walked into my office,<br>my secretary, Janet said, "Good Morning, Boss, Happy Birthday."<br>And I felt a little better; someone had remembered. I worked until noon.<br><br>Then, Janet knocked on my door and said, "You know, it's such a<br>beautiful day outside and it's your birthday, let's go to lunch,<br>just you and me." I said, "By George, that's the greatest thing I've<br>heard all day."<br><br>Let's go. We went to lunch. We didn't go where we normally go;<br>we went out into the country to a little private place. We had<br>two martinis and enjoyed lunch tremendously. On the way back to the office, she said, "You know,<br>it's such a beautiful day. We don't need to go back to the office, do we?" I said, "No, I guess<br>not."<br><br>She said, "Let's go to my apartment." After arriving at her apartment she said, "Boss, if you<br>don't mind, I think I'll go into the bedroom and slip into something more comfortable."<br><br>"Sure," I excitedly replied.<br><br>She went into the bedroom and, in about six minutes she came out carrying a big birthday cake,<br>followed by my wife, children, and dozens of our friends. They were all singing Happy<br>Birthday...<br><br>and there on the couch I sat..............................................................<br>..... N A K E D</div>
