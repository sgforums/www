            <div class='col-md body'>long time no see..!<br><br>u can take things slow, but dun forget that the fear that u might get hurt could well be the reason why the reln won't work. so i guess u can "fear prudently" in a way that i shouldn't affect ur reln.<br><br>i know people who refuse to hold hands or hug or kiss becos they dun feel the reln is at an appropriate "stage" yet, but deep inside they long for their partner's touch. i think such restraint is unhealthy.<br><br>of course, that's just an example. there are many things that pple restraint themselves from, when it's natural and harmless. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
