              <p>If readers can make sense of what I've shared, then I've done my part. It's up to people's choice on how to lead their lives. No real right or wrong. Just cause and effect. Actually, all the problems raised in AA forum can be solved, if people are willing to make some tough decisions, starting with truly honest self-assessment.</p>
              <p>If a person can feel joy in his/her life at least half the time, the positive effect on the people in his/her life would be very significant. Unfortunately, the opposite happens most of the time instead.</p>
              <p>Reason why it's important to start feeling joy in our lives now is that it'll get harder in future. Everyone needs time to practise to be adept at finding joy, no matter how difficult life may seem.</p>

              <h3>Defining Polarity</h3>
                      <h4>"Negativity" refers to emotions/characters that are : angry, bitter, fearful, suspicious, greedy, pessimistic, selfish, unforgiving, cruel, always complaining, closed-minded.</h4><br>
                      <h4>"Positivity" refers to emotions/characters that are: joyful, happy, loving, optimistic, trusting, compassionate, forgiving, open-minded.</h4><br>
                          
                          <p>"Negatively" or "Positively" is not something most people can see easily on the surface. People can appear all friendly and nice towards friends/colleagues/customers but react totally opposite towards family(parents/siblings/spouse).</p>
                          
                          <h4>A Negative Example:</h4>
                          
                          <p>I know of a young adult that is "quite negative". If I am to tell her directly that "You are a negative person.", she will flare up, deny it and even declare that "I am a positive person!". This is a common attitude problem that people with huge ego will have, and they do not see that having a huge ego is the problem.</p>
                          
                          <p>When she is in a angry/mad state, everything other people said about her is "wrong" and everything she said about others is "right". She is not aware or realise that being angry, bitter and unforgiving has caused herself and her love ones much pain and suffering, and will carry on to cause more suffering in future if she does not break out of "negativity".</p>
                          
                          <h4>On the Positive Side:</h4>
                          
                          <p>If someone is to tell me that "You are a negative person!", I will probably ask him/her which part of me is "negative" and analyse the problem with curiosity and with an open-mind. In this case, I am able to receive negative input, reverse it to produce a positive outcome. I do not need to return negativity with even more negativity. Thus, personally, I have freed myself from "negativity".</p>
                          
                          <h4>Breaking Free from Negativity:</h4>
                          
                          <p>To break free of negativity requires knowledge and wisdom. There are various ways to acquire knowledge and wisdom.</p>
                          
                          <p>The way "I get it" is the through the knowledge of my "personal experiences" and the "Four Noble Truths".</p> 
                          
                          <h4>Moving towards Positivity:</h4>
                          
                          <p>To move towards positivity requires love and compassion. All I can say, it can only come from the heart.</p>
