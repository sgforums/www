              <p>I personally feel that being positive may not be a total good thing. As much as I do not deny the benefits of being positive, I feel that being positive may sometimes lead to more disappointments. Life isn't at all smooth sailing. If you pin your hopes up for everything, you are bound to get disappointed for some things. On the contrary if you stay negative, life may just be full of surprises for you.  </p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p><br>Since you believe life can be full of surprises, it actually means you have that positive spark in you, and you're not really being negative, do you know that? Truly negative people tend to focus on all the bad things in their lives, and do not expect much good things to happen, now or in future. :)</p>
              <p>Being positive does not mean living in airy-fairy world of make-believe and fantasies. It's to <strong>free up</strong> space (often taken up by negative thoughts and emotions) in ourselves and our lives to <strong>allow</strong> good things and positive surprises to happen, <strong>at their own time</strong>, not at our constant demanding. </p>

              <p>It depends on the person, if he/she is able to use the chance to reflect on him/herself when he/she is with negative people and is able to uplift them, then its a good thing. Most importantly he/she must not be easily influenced.</p>

              <p>Exactly, being "easily influenced" is something that happens to many people subconsciously. Having friends who are roughly in the middle (neither very positive or very negative) is fine, but when we subconsciously only hear and take in the negative opinions and throw out all the positive ones, we are effectively throwing out more positivity in us, and growing more negativity.</p>
              <p>Would a depressed or suicidal person seek advice from a frustrated, pessimistic or depressed counsellor? But that happens very often, just that the "counsellor" is actually someone around us. A friend who has never experienced a lasting and happy relationship, or is very unhappy in his/her job, or has an unhappy family relationship, will subconsciously influence his/her friends that life sucks, and nothing good will happen in our lives.</p>

              <p><br>I wish life is so easy but there is no clear cut rules. Decisions differ depending on the individual and the environement he or she is facing. You're right about we having the right to choose but the choice itself can be devastating. Some people stick to their jobs even if they hate it because they have no where else to go. They could be lacking proper qualifications or working in the job they don't like while trying to gain or acquire skills by attending night school so that they can change their jobs in the future. I have known a friend who taken temp jobs and many other jobs for the past 5 years, she already changed 10 jobs but she is still not satisfied. Staying and taking the heat doesn't mean it is a stupid decision, not unless the person decides to stay for a while so that he or she can weigh a better decision instead of rushing from a hot pot of boiliing water to a frying pan.</p>
              <p>It is not as easy being POSITIVE all the time. What if we are married to a negative spouse, she is always demanding, negative and make rash decisions all the time? Sometimes, after marriage, a woman can change and the person we used to love suddenly turn into our biggest nightmare. We cannot just leave the family with kids like that. I known an uncle whose wife suddenly became demon possessed and she became crazy and paranoid, started blaming him for all her problems. The children was scred of their mom. She had to take her medication and go for shock therapy. Her negavitiy was taking the strain from my uncle's life. Sometimes my uncle feel discouraged and depressed as the children as lost their motherly figure as their mom descend into madness.</p>
              <p>Or what about my company plant manager, a British guy who newly transfer from UK 6 months ago. He said he was so positive and confident that he was going to turnaround the people in my company. He was successful in his homeland because fo the working culture there. But in Malaysia (by the way I am an expat from SG) the plant workers are known for their laziness, lack of initiative and always fighting against reforms. They gave him a lot of trouble like sabotaging the lines. He scolded them many times but yet the products delivered to customers kept on repeating its defects. Customers were angry. The plant manager tried all sorts of reforms, implementing new methods but nobody was supporting them because of the racial cohorting against him. He could not take any action because the Big Boss supported some influential players in the company. In the end, his power was limited and Big Boss (trying to play to the tune of the influential players in the company) overided him. In a span of a few months, I saw all his positive power flow down to negativity. He used to come into the office wishing everyone good morning and telling everyon he can do it. But now, he just keep quiet in his room and go about his time. People in the office just ignore him because they don;t like his policies. Positive Power is it as easy as ABC?</p>

              <p>The examples that you shared are mostly to do with relationships between people, which is complex, and requires more than our own personal power, which I agree. But to keep this posting non-spiritual in nature, this is not the place to comment on why things are the way they are. But to put it very simply, one of the reasons for having difficult human relationships in our lives is for the people involved to realise their true selves, and learn how to be better people. If they can reflect on themselves, and are willing to change, they can turn things around for the better, for themselves and the people around them.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, many people are in self-denial mode, so are completely blind to their own shortcomings. At the end of the day, it's still down to personal choice, whether we choose to stay on a negative path, or switch to a more positive one. :)</p>
              <p>As for the case of your friend who has "already changed 10 jobs but she is still not satisfied", has she taken time to ponder over what exactly does she want to do? A seed drifting in the wind will continue to fly with the wind directionless and endlessly, until it decides to land along the way and take root in the ground, and start to grow and blossom. As for whether we are a seed which allows the wind to control us, or a seed that has the power to land and take root, is our choice. Blaming society for all our job frustrations will not improve our situation, as we are all responsible for our own life journey.  </p>

              <p>Thinking Positive is good for starters, it gives us a good headstart in life. However, we need more than just thinking Positive to be successful. We need to have a religious or spiritual conviction and we need the power of Wisdom to add on to the Positive attribute. Positive thinking is also like Jet Fuel, gets burn out very fast. Once we go around and use that Positive thinking to make us run faster - like NOS that boost a sports car ability to speed, it also run out very fast. Soon with nothing to fuel it and no strategy or tactic to know how to use Postivism, we get tired and burned out very fast.</p>
              <p>Wisdom doesn't come overnight, it comes by experience, by goodupbringing and from us making past life mistakes. A person can be thinking positive about going after a girl. He thinks he is the king of the world and he will surely successfully court her. However, in the process of courtship he found out he isn't very compatible to the girl he like but yet he tries to think positively and go on with the relationship, without using Wisdom to help him make his decision. Just like the girl who change her job 10 times in 5 years. Is she using any wisdom in her decision to change jobs? Nope.</p>
              <p>Backing the power of positivism, we also need a spiritual or religious conviction (Or you can call it FAITH). For those who are atheist, to sum it up, its called HOPE. We need to HOPE that what we wish will come true. Sometimes we are beaten down, we are worn out and we lose some self esteem. We felt cornered. What should we do? Positivism without a strong spiritual power underlying it will not take us far. Positivism without petrol to fuel it will have us BURN OUT. We need to go back to our religion, read the religious books, gain wisdom and seek a more power being through the power of PRAYER and MEDITATION or FASTING to make us more spiritually disciplined and fuel the power of HOPE. Just like the 33 Chilean miners who are stuck 700m underground. They cannot be positive all the time, they are in the darkness with little food, hot and humid and away from their love ones. What is there to fuel their Positivism? The immense hope that religion bring to them, the belief and the faith that they will eventually be rescued !</p>

              <p>moderated optimism lah. </p>
              <p>because the gist of it all is, extreme positivity may lead to risky/idiotic and overly idealistic behaviours. </p>
              <p>so your recipe for success and happiness is... positive thinking + wisdom + religious conviction? what about luck and random chance? preparation? hardwork?</p>
              <p>If the 33 chilean miners trapped underground did not actually receive Human Help in the form of food rations and If they're unaware of the rescue work happening before their very eyes, you think the love and the conviction is going to sustain them psychologically and take them home to mama?</p>

              <p>Capacity of the human mind? What is that suppose to be? Magneto who can manipulate metal objects using magnetism? Look the mind can only go so far. When I say faith I am not meaning Blind Faith, I am saying here faith with action. You read too much comics. Our mind may be strong and creative but sorry we don't have phychic mutant powers to move objects with our minds.</p>
              <p>What about the story of Nando and his Uruguayan rugby team mates that survived 72 days in the Snowy Andean peaks after their plane crashed ? They survived through faith and conviction through their belief that they will be rescued but through the action of faith, they planned how they should survive this ordeal by eating the flesh and meat of their dead comrades. Through faith during an expedition to find a way out, Nando's colleagues were about to give up when Nando out of a religious conviction that drrive him to go on, found a route out of the mountains and to the nearest village where he contacted a rescue chopper to rescue the rest at the crash site.</p>
              <p>You haven't read properly what I say didn't you? I also said for the Atheist, it is the power of HOPE. One should also hope for good things to come to encourage oneself.</p>
              <p>Every one of us have a religion. Catholics, Christians, Muslims, Buddhists, Hindu, even Atheist is sometimes considered a religion, so why not bring in religion? Why not place trust in our religions? Are you saying that you go to temple, church or mosque and you don't ascribes to what you were taught? Faith is also by action putting what you learn or your hopes or your religious convictions into practice.</p>
              <p>Friend, if the 33 Chilean miners given up, they would have just committed suicide. It was their religious conviction, their hope for survival and positive attitude that got them to plan ahead and ration out the limited food they had and survived for a further 3 weeks until they were found. Now their faith is put to the test as they need another 4 months to be lifted out of the surface.</p>

              <p>People, try to keep religion out of this thread, ok? It's not necessary for a person to have a religion to be positive. Conversely, not everyone with a religion (no matter what religion it is) is positive. :)</p>
              <p>Anyway, back to the main topic:</p>
              <p>There's nothing wrong for a person to choose to live his/her life feeling negative and behaving negatively most/all the time, as he/she has the freedom of choice. However, the people around this person also have the freedom of choice to decide how to interact with him/her. People who like to be around negative people will flock to him/her. People who prefer to be around positive people will keep a distance.</p>
              <p>As forumers have shared, many life problems result from human relationships (all forms). The dynamics of people that occur will differ, depending on the level of positivity and negativity generated within the people involved. For people who are having endless problems with people around them, why not step back, and find out if you're more positive or more negative, as well as figure out the people you're having problems with. Then exercise your freedom of choice, about yourself and the problematic relationships in your life, to be happy! It's your every right to lead a happy and fulfilling life! :)</p>

              <p>What you shared is a very common obstacle that people face. :)</p>
              <p>Emotions is a very powerful force - it can make or break a person, in more ways than commonly known. A person with no control over positive emotions won't face danger, assuming it's not the result of drugs. But a person with no control over negative emotions can turn suicidal, in extreme cases.</p>
              <p>Managing emotions and suppressing emotions are 2 totally different things. Suppressing one's emotions causes more long-term harm to a person, like an active volcano being plugged with a huge boulder, that will eventually explode with much greater impact.</p>
              <p>Managing one's emotions is to recognise what we're feeling at the moment, and releasing it, if it's a negative emotion that has the potential to knock us off-balance. Eg. if we're feeling very angry with someone at the moment, if we suppress it, the anger is still there, but we'll blow up at the person (or another unfortunate target) on another occasion, when enough frustrations have been built up.</p>
              <p>If we can manage our emotions, then we're able to resolve the conflict/tension at the point of occurrence, then that negative emotion is released with no long-term effect. For people with better control, that negative emotion can even be transformed to a positive one!</p>

              <p>What is considered "capable" to you? Getting best grades in uni?
              Earning the most money? Owning the most expensive car/house?
              Hearing your friends and family calling you "capable"? :)</p>
              <p>We often live our lives to please others, to live up to others'
              expectations, at the expense of our own happiness and real dreams.
              We may dream of being an artist, which we know we'll do well in,
              and be very happy doing. But because others say it's a "lousy job
              with no prospects", according to their definitions of being
              "capable", we give up our desired path, and do what others expect
              us to do. And that's why many people end up so frustrated in
              their current paths, because they're walking paths not of their
              choice, but of others' expectations.</p>
              <p>Since you're in uni, just try your best at getting the degree.
              But also consider what will you do best in, and happiest in, after
              you graduate. Having an engineering degree doesn't mean one has to
              be an engineer all his life. :)</p>

              <p><br>Everyone has different life phases to go through, and you're currently very focused on your school phase. Perhaps it'll help you, for you to find ways to enjoy your uni life, eg. join fun activities and events that you like, while you work hard at your degree. You'll feel happier, and it will also open up chances for you to find people whom you'll feel happy being around with.</p>
              <p>When you're able to get yourself in a positive mood, your inner mind will naturally be able to tune in to what's the best path or solution for you. When you're in a negative mood, forget about thinking about your life issues, as you won't find good long-term solutions or answers. Seriously. :)</p>
              <p>Having strength of mind will also help you protect your mind from 'negative attacks' in the form of negative words. When you've trained yourself to be mentally strong, you'll be able to feel peace even if everyone around you is screaming or shouting in anger. Harsh words won't have a lasting impact on you then. You'll feel like you're protected in a bubble, whenever you need that energy protection.</p>

              <p>Can tell you're a pretty balanced guy. hehe...</p>
              <p>Another forumer also mentioned that the downside of being too positive is facing potential setback. I'll just share something on this, but feel free to disagree:</p>
              <p>Having such a thought is partly to do with fear of disappointment, and partly to do with lack of trust that we can experience miracles and great positive things.</p>
              <p>If we are able to have a wish or intention in our mind of positive outcomes, <strong>allow</strong> them <strong>freedom</strong> to happen at <strong>their own time</strong>, but don't keep thinking about whether they will really materialise. Just enjoy the Flow of Life!</p>
              <p>Also, don't define too specific outcomes, but allow <strong>flexibility</strong> to have equivalent positive outcomes. Eg. instead of manifesting/thinking of getting a particular 'Marketing Manager job in ABC Pte Ltd' , try manifesting/thinking of getting a 'management position in marketing in an established company'. The world does not revolve around us, and there are often more good options available than what we're aware of.</p>
              <p>Whenever we have the thought of being disappointed, we're effectively worrying that it will not happen, and that negates the possibility of it materialising. This is not the appropriate thread to explain in greater detail about this, but this is really how people can make or break their life journeys.</p>
              <p>Have faith that we're all worthy of fantastically positive things happening in our lives! Don't tie anchors to our feet to keep us from soaring in the skies, just because others are walking painfully while dragging anchors on the ground. :) </p>

              <p>Regarding your questions: I'm a spiritual free-thinker, with no associations to any group/organisation or anyone in this world, so I've the freedom to live the life that is most fulfilling for me. :) I'm just doing my part to help balance the energy that affects people's lives, in general. Though positivity and negativity are not what people normally think much of, but they affect everyone's life journeys and daily lives, all the time.</p>
              <p>Everyone is connected. A negative person not only lowers his own quality of life over the long-term, but also that of the closest people in his life. Similarly, a positive person is able to improve his own life, as well as those close to him.</p>
              <p>What you shared about the person who had to return to his home country is a common issue during times of economic downturn. It's also an opportunity for him to learn how to handle setbacks. Depending on how he's able to manage his mindset, his future back in his home country could be far more fulfilling than getting a highly paid job in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Actually, what I was sharing is that "fear of disappointment" and "lack of trust of good outcomes" are common hurdles that prevent people from living their lives to the fullest, not necessarily in material sense, but in life fulfillment. There's no real right or wrong path, just what is the path that we truly want for ourselves.</p>
              <p>If we want to live our life to the fullest, we have to first overcome all negative thoughts within us that restrict all positive options from entering our lives. However, if we are satisfied with a middle-of-the-road path, such negative thoughts will do their job of drawing the upper boundaries of joy and fulfillment. It's really about how Universal energy works.</p>
