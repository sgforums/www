              <p>I really hate her... for alot of reasons...</p>
              <ol>
              <li>she f***ed
               my life upside down when i was in p4. I was having high fever one the 
              PSLE exam day and she f****ing forced me to take the streaming exam 
              while i was still drowsy from the medicine... She insisted on me taking 
              the exam even though my teacher (and me) said that i could sit for it 
              another day since i have valid reasons... Her mistake changed my life 
              forever... When i got my grades back... all my subjects are like 
              48,49,47 points... ALL!!! from thereon, i was being kicked to EM3 and 
              Normal technical stream soon follows... After that, it was 4 tourtureous
               years in ITE which i was constantly being rediculed and looked down 
              upon...</li>
              <li>After this, i went on to Polytechnic which i did alot 
              better than my peers (GPA &gt;3.8)... But that was pointless... I am now
               23 and in the final year of my poly education.. And i have not yet 
              served my 2 years jailtime... ever since the start of my poly education,
               she claimed that i am only wasting her money to study and can't give 
              her any money (btw, it is not HER money... she is living off the 
              insurance payout after my dad passed away when i was in sec 3... She 
              have stopped working since i was born (1991)). She compared me to my 
              brother which is one year older than me... He works as a house-moving 
              guy and gave her $300 monthly... She brings it up in every single 
              arguement... I was really dammed pissed and said that i am 23 and still 
              schooling in poly is all thanks to her stupid decision back then... 
              Hereon, she claimed that it is my 'life' or 'ming' in chinese... She 
              blamed every single shit (even gods) except for herself... How selfish 
              can she be? She even said that 'study so much also no use, we might die 
              any time.. so quick go earn money and give me money'... The reason why I
               studied so hard is because of my future, career and family.. why can't 
              she see the full picture???  <br></li>
              <li>She is also dammed evil 
              towards me... She steals money from my wallet on alot of occasions... 
              but when i confronted her, she gets pissed off and start another 
              arguement with me...She also have a fetish of rummaging through my 
              stuffs and take things without my permissions... </li>
              <li>when i come 
              home around 8-10pm at night (only once in a blue moon)... She is always 
              sulking and refused to talk to me for the entire day because i come home
               late (why is she behaving like some little girl?).. She even screamed 
              at me through the phone everytime and embarassed my on countless 
              occasions when i called to let her know that i am coming home late... 
              But when my brother comes home around 11pm every night, she refused to 
              say anything or voice her discontentment and always serve my brother 
              like he is the king of the house and she is the lackey (my brother 
              throws $10 at her every time)... </li>
              <li>Another thing is politics.. 
              when i tell her about how i feel about the future of singapore and how 
              should we correct it, she always jump to the defence of Pay And Pay and 
              claimed that if i ever voted for oppersition, she would disown me.. 
              (WTF???)</li>
              <li>she also ask me not to think so far and be ambitious.. 
              she told me to just get a job and live my life paycheque to paycheque...
               When i said anything about wanting to own a business or investment, she
               argued against it as though i would die if i am ambitious...</li>
              <li>My
               brother smokes, drinks and gamble... My mum keep quiet and don't say 
              anything because he gives her $10 everyday... I tell my mum that i am 
              going out with my friends for awhile, hell breaks loose.<br></li>
              </ol>
              <p>I
               am really upset at her.. I felt that i have achieved nothing in life 
              and hate myself for it... I also hate her for ruining and wasting 4 
              years my life... I hate her for making me feel like a dog in the house 
              rather than a human... I really envy the parents of my friends.. they 
              are so supportive of their child's ambitions and dreams... I am always 
              putting on a smiling face that hides my anger really well... I really 
              don't know what to do in singpore anymore...</p>

              <p>Yup, life sucks. The question is, what are you going to do about it? </p>
              <p>Do you want to wallow in self pity the rest of your life , or are you going to make the best of it from now on?</p>
              <p>Whining about your mom is not going to change what she is. Yes, she is stupid, yes she don't know how to make good decisions. Yes she fucked up your life. But she cannot dictate your future. </p>
              <p>You hate life now because you feel helpless, out of control, victimized. But all these shall change when you gain financial independence. You have your brain and two hands and hopefully your health.</p>
              <p>Do not envy the life of others, envying only cause more resentment inside you. Just remember that everything happened for a reason. </p>

              <p>Unrealistic expectations of her will only lead to disappointments.</p>

              <p>For crying out loud, you're behaving like a cry baby. At 23, you're mature enough to stand up and be counted or else get yourself counted out. Whinging all day and all night until the cows come home won't change your situations, instead it turns you into a sad sack.</p>
              <p>Find out why your mother is behaving such a way that claw on your nerves. Is it because of your father passing that made her what she is not use to be. Losing a loved one takes time to heal.  If you knew she stole your money then keep it in a safe place or get a lock. Avoid topics that both of you can't agreed with. </p>
