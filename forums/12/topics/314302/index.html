              <p> </p>
              <p>I am starting to like a classmate in university here in US. both of us are from singapore, while she is starting her first year here and a few more to go, I am only here on exchange for 1.5years.</p>
              <p>right now, I feel I am starting to get jealous and disturbed when mutual friends join us when we(me, her and her "gf") are doing stuffs in the library and they join in and take up space.  I know 1 of the mutual friends is trying to get to know her but he does not know of my stand.</p>
              <p>our backgrounds are quite different, her family is far more significantly well off than mine. Some of her social habits are distinctly different from mine, she's a party animal and smokes but I am neither.  Yet instead of maintaining the distance between us, I seem to be wanting to encourage or back her habits like buying her cigs. Something extremely not possible with other friends.</p>
              <p>if you ask how close are we, I say not that close as of now. Though she does ask me things that you ask close friends and not casual friends like whether is she cavalier in her love attitude.  Normally that starts setting off alarms in me, I mean there is no smoke without a fire.</p>
              <p>She also does tell me how much she dislikes her gf sticking to her like glue, though she openly behaves close to that gf. she once told me her 'benchmark' for a close friend and apparently, I haven't reached that stage yet, not entirely surprising since I only know her for 1 month.</p>
              <p>Despite several alarm bells ringing inside me, such as knowing that some people remarked that she is cavalier in love, her recent breakup(assume amicable) with her sg BF, difference in social habits and that I have my studies to be concerned with, I still can't put her down.</p>
              <p>I am uncertain whether she knows about my affections towards her but I don't rule out the possibility towards it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To me this is like approaching the red lights at the junction, to chiong or not to chiong.</p>

              <p>hmm... maybe u can start by reaching the "close friends" level first? anyway its gonna be tough even if u two get together since u will be there for 1.5yrs only and she's got much longer..</p>
              <p>try to be really good friends and stuff.. see how it goes from there..</p>

              <p>you having a crush on her, definitely. Most imptly, you are alone overseas. And when a decent-looking gal comes along, sparks fly(could be one sided)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>think of the insecurity/jealousy you have when other guys joined in your "outing", and you are not even her bf yet......so if you really so lucky to get her as yr stead now, what will you do when you come back singapore while she is all alone there? Are you going to check on her everyday to see if whichever guy is with her? OMG...that is so taxing on her and you..</p>
              <p>to be truthful to you, it will not work out..but if just wana board the bus without paying the ticket, probably still can consider..<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/embarrassed.png" alt="embarrassed.png"></p>

              You're thinking too far, since you've only known her for 1 month.

              <p>Another thing is, I know that she goes out alot with her friends, often I feel abit "concerned". Although I decided that I am not going after her and it's her call to do what she wants, sometimes I simply feel concerned, a little too concerned. I get a little upset or down when she turns down my invitation over for a dinner or walking out of hostel to get some food.</p>
              <p>No doubt I still hold a torch for her despite knowing our relationship would be unstable.</p>
              <p>Note that I did not mention whether she will reciprocrate my feelings, this is because it is something I cannot change so I base my decisions on what I can control.  I am not assuming that she will or will not reciprocrate or not. It is not the focus as yet.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Think I should further widen my social circle to know ppl and forget about her. haha.</p>
