            <div class='col-md body'>i'm not in my twenties, but i'll answer the question u posted as ur topic.<br><br>YES He does...........sometimes we think, the recent incident has claimed the lives of many many innocent lives...but maybe if u try to look at it from another point of view, u'd realise tt mebbe those pple were freed from wat's going to happen next?? i mean, if there were really going to be a 3rd world war, then how massive will be the scale of the war?? and more pple will be suffering under the war.........tink of it as that those who are gone, are now with God, and are no longer suffering.......they are in safe hands.............=) continue praying and have faith in Him. He is n will be there for those who have survived, and even for the deceased.....do not be disapponted n lose faith in Him....perservere till the end as God's children......dun doubt the fact that He is there. Thou' u may not always be able to feel his presence there with u pple, but by acting and obeying in faith, u will know tt He is there, and has always been there thru'out the whole ordeal.....<br><br>"Happy are those who wash their robes clean and so have the right to eat the fruit from the tree of life and to go through the gates into the city" -- Rev 22:14</div>
