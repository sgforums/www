              <p>Ok so I see what is your problem now. You have been chasing this girl for like 4 years already. But you must understand, she probably already have a bf now and ya, it's already too late. I understand despite not being in a bgr, it's hard to confess in case it may backfire. </p>
              <p>So anyways you should have taken step-by-step and not just go all out without even entering the ''best friends'' zone. Because when you confessed and unfortunately got rejected, the friendship between you two already drop. </p>
              <p>In contrast, if you still like her, do the step-by-step method and TML. Remember, never just ''chiong'' unless you very sure can get accepted.</p>

              <p>are u hoping she will change her mind and take up your offer next time ?</p>
              <p>if she wasn't interested before, why would she be interested in you now ?</p>
              <p>have u grown taller ? Smarter or wealthier ? If nothing about u hav changed... Why should she change her mind about u ?</p>
              <p>Of cors, I am not saying you shouldn't try again... You should try and see if she did change her mind about u...but if she rejects you again... Don't cry like a baby .just accept it , thank her for being honest and Move On !</p>
              <p>After you've done what u needed to do to convince yourself she is really not interested.., you won't regret not trying. That's the best thing u have done for yourself.</p>

              <p>just ask her out on a date la... one-to-one date or group outing
                      is also ok... just ask her out first, and then see how your
                      friendship develop or don't develop...</p>
              <p>it is only when you guys have gone out together, spend sometime
                      together, then you gauge your own chances and you can confess...

              <p>She rejected you before, so unless some gamma ray spider bit you, and you start developing super human strengith, leaping around and screaming for Mary Jane Mary Jane, very doubt that this girl is going to re-evaluate her rejection of you.</p>
              <p>There are a lot of fishes in the sea, why you still got to stick with the likes of her? Are there any other girls at your school you can try to develop a liking to?</p>
              <p>The world works like this,, am very sure somebody out tehre doesn't match you, vice versa but there are other girls who match you to. So you cannot just focus on this one girl, you are wasting your time.</p>
              <p>Just like a job interview, you send out 20 resumes. Only 8 companies respond for interview,a nd then out of that 8 interviews, you only succeed in getting 3 solid offers. It is highly unlikely that the company that you dearly want to work for, already rejected your application, will accept it after you sent it a second time. So move on to other applications. Same goes for finding relationships.</p>
              <p>Having said this, you can still be a friend to her but don't put so much hope into it.</p>
