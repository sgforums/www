            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>...<strong>haix...why tt moment is taken away from me... </strong></blockquote>No it is not taken from you... it was never yours in the first place.  So please do not be sad over not being able to have or possess what you "want"  That is just silly and wrong.  If you are sad, you should only be sad about a young promising life gone astray and you have compassion for her on that basis and that is it!  No romantic emotions please and worse still no romantised notion about how your "love" can rescue her etc.. If she ever need any help, she need it from a person who is objective and fair and will tell her the truth and one who will give practical help and not another "lover".<br>And NO I will not therefore say that its fate this or that that broke you guys up etc.  It has nothing to do with that.<br><br>When a person stop loving herself and stop respecting and valuing herself, she can become very destructive.  YOu have witnessed first hand what happens to people who are so called troubled ... they have basically lost the ability to value and appreciate themselves.<br><br>It is good that you have seen this and realised that both of you are worlds apart.  <strong>Again, just bec you feel for someone or someone feels for you does not make that person SUITABLE!  </strong><br><br>I admire you that you can care for a person the way you do.  This says that you are a passionate person at heart.  This can be a strength in your future relationship but it can also be a problem.  When you allow your passion to blind you of your sound judgement, you will run into relationship problems even with that perfect girl.<br><br>Growing up is not about making money or doing all the "grown up" things, its about learning to balance your idealism and your passion with reality and your ability or lack there of and yet still remain a sound compassionate human being.<br><br>So in this instance, please do not make the mistake of carrying the "flame" for her and trying to rescue her in your heart.<br><br>You have just ran into one of life's wonderful lessons... you may have noticed and realised this wonderful powerful and yet potentially dangerous thing called Free Will or put it another way Self Determination... you determine your own destiny, for freedom and goodness or for perversion and bondage.  little little choices adds up and yes rotten apples do spoil the barrel! And in her instance, she has over the years, not over night made choices that led her down this path.  The only way for her to get out of this is for God to helps her out of it or she tires of her running around living like this come to a point in her life when she says enough is enough.  It is only at that point in time that change will come.  until then, there is not much you can do other than to live well and make good decisions yourself.<br><br>Take care fren.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Friend, listen to RagingWhirlWind, A Beautiful Mind and Magnus. She said sorry to you doesn't mean that she repented liao or willing to change. She knows your weakness - soft-hearted and want to control you. She treats you as an idiot and you are not aware of this (she might play mind game).<br><br>Frankly speaking, I knew this type of girl very well as I have been gone through such thing... eg. she did hug me and cried, saying that "I m sorry, I know I m not good, aledi hurt you. I promise that I will change and love you forever, please forgive me.... blah..blah..". I know that normally a guy will be soft-hearted and promise her that he will love her more and protect her.<br><br>BUT LET ME TELL YOU THE TRUTH - Dun trust her unless she aledi totally changed (it must be feedbacks from somebody else, not from herself, and not in a short of time, it takes months or years for someone to chang). Otherwise she will lead you to painful depression and you have nothing left, even worse is that she might tell "You fool, I juz played you like an idiot!!! Actually my heart died liao that time I said sorry and love you... Now if you want to die, please go far away from me!" It really happened to me.<br><br>So... only ONE conclusion - DUN TRUST HER, live in your own life without her.</div>
