However, I have already let go - what you're holding on to are memories; just like I did. Because it was so sudden and unexpected, you're just holding on to the last immediate impression of your partner - memories.<br><br>I am still sad you know, when I think about all the memories - but I have let go completely; I don't harbour any more feelings for her because I have come to terms with the fact she has changed, and she is no longer the person I knew or loved, and most importantly, she will never go back to being that way. Of course I came to these conclusions not blindly, but after finding out alot of hidden things from her friends. Even if she does want to come back to me, I doubt I could get over my insecurity of her just abandoning me like that - I'm human too you know.<br><br>Also, I definitely do not blame myself anymore; after talking with alot of mutual friends (that is friends of my ex), I realise I was not at fault although I initially thought it was (and especially the way she played it out - that it was my fault). Just like starting a relationship, the demise of one takes two hands to clap - regardless what your ex said or did, it's not JUST your fault. In any case, no point playing the blame game when the past cannot be brought back. What is important is that you move on too.<br><br>To be honest, the best way to move on is to let yourself know how in demand you are. I've been hitting on girl after girl - I mean, not leading anywhere but the favourable responses makes me feel much better in that I realise that my ex is not the only good girl out there, and I can definitely find better.<br><br>Again, no doubt the memories will come back to haunt you as it still does me - that's only because the break up was so fast, sudden and unexpected - it's only natural you cling on to your last impression of your ex; or at least the lasting one.<br><br>The best that I can do, as many of the other forumers have done for me, as a stranger hiding behind a moniker, is to offer you comfort whenever you feel down or when the memories come back. You will feel alot better just typing and seeking reassurance from others. I know what it's like not being able to turn to anyone else; so don't be ashamed to turn to us - there's nothing to be embarassed about because we're all strangers hiding behind a nickname.<br><br>All the best </div></blockquote>Well, SGX dude<br><br>the only way to get your ex back is to make sure you are as rich as Warren Buffet. Then it may be very possible to get her back. Whether or not she really loves you because of you wealth is another thing though.<br><br>doko</div>
