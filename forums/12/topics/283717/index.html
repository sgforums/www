            <div class='col-md body'>My first post. Have always been reading around the forums..<br><br>Well just feel the need to let this out..<br><br>Been with this guy for 1 year 5 months.. He liked me before I like him.. After asking four times, I finally accepted him.. He was everything I could want at that time.. We had the same interests, we can talk about anything.. Basically we were on the same frequency..<br><br>About three months into the relationship, I moved in with him. Because, while staying with my parents, they didn't really let me go out late.. But since he finished work pretty late at about 11pm most times, I'm forced to make a choice.. So I guess that pushed me to move in with him.. Previously I stayed in hall in uni..<br><br>Most of my time were spend with him since we live together.. He used to manage a tuition centre near the place where we live, so I'll always be in the office with him while he taught.. as time goes by, because he needed tutors and the financial situation wasn't very good.. I took up tuition classes for him.. The money I earned will go into paying for the car loan, for our room rental, office rental and so on.. Of course he's paying too..<br><br>Things were supposedly well.. We spent all our times together, working hard, going out sometimes. But as the financial situation got worse, he became busier and although we were together most of the time, it was me studying or teaching and him doing his teaching as well.. It wasn't what I would call 'quality time' I guess. But at that time, I thought that if I love him, all these were just nothing much..<br><br>In around july/august this year, we were pretty close with this other couple.. And the four of us decided to go into a new line of business.. Things got started.. In September however, I was pissed with him for an incident and I kinda showed my 'black face' to the other guy (one of the partners). He was telling my ex how angry he was that I showed him my bad mood even if he wasn't the one that I was angry with..<br><br>It was a huge incident that my ex and I argued a lot about.. I felt that although it was my fault for not being sensitive enough, my only argument was that I thought that guy was like a close friend so I don't really have to hide my feelings that much.. I was just keeping quiet that day and not like I was throwing my temper on the other guy.. The other guy's argument was that if I could do this to him, I could do this to clients next time and it would be bad..<br><br>My ex wanted me to apologise to that guy, but I thought it was a small matter and I didn't see my mistake at that time so I refused.. My ex didn't explained why I was wrong as well..<br><br>So I was cut out of the new business.. And mostly because of this incident, my ex suddenly told me he wanted to break up.. I guess because he felt that I could no longer help him in the new business, and money was important to him at this point in time.. Before he broke up with me, he already moved to another girl which was a friend introduced by that guy..<br><br>I guess I can't let it go.. because he was so perfect before this incident.. Because I've put in so much emotions, effort into this relationship.. We were planning to get married next year.. So much plans, goals.. The future.. It's just gone like that.. It's hard to accept that a guy who could love you so much could just suddenly do this cruel thing to you..<br><br>Because all my times have been spent with him, so the empty voids now are quite unbearable and lots of memories in lots of places..<br></div>

You want your business to prosper, you have to be rational, hard headed and uncompromising when you cannot compromise (of course you have to compromise in the sense that you have to take into account the fact that people are not perfect).<br><br>Yet if people are in the wrong you have to be brutal with them and point out their errors and your unhappiness with their performance.<br><br>You cannot do that with your spouse. If you do that, it will affect your "romantic" relationship. In a romantic relationship, you are expected to pamper each other, gloss over each other's faults and be positive when everyone else has given up on you.<br><br>With parents and siblings, it might still work out because relatives, unlike spouses, do not expect you to be romantic.<br><br>You need to face reality and that is, people need romantic relationships. Once the two of you are in business together or working closely together, romance will suffer and the relationship will suffer (it might survive) and your quality of life (for both) suffers.<br><br>I am not talking about survival here although there is a high chance that the relationship cannot survive. I am talking about the quality of the relationship.</div>
