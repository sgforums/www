Have always been reading around the forums..<br><br>Well just feel the need to let this out..<br><br>Been with this guy for 1 year 5 months.. He liked me before I like him.. After asking four times, I finally accepted him.. He was everything I could want at that time.. We had the same interests, we can talk about anything.. Basically we were on the same frequency..<br><br>About three months into the relationship, I moved in with him. Because, while staying with my parents, they didn't really let me go out late.. But since he finished work pretty late at about 11pm most times, I'm forced to make a choice.. So I guess that pushed me to move in with him.. Previously I stayed in hall in uni..<br><br>Most of my time were spend with him since we live together.. He used to manage a tuition centre near the place where we live, so I'll always be in the office with him while he taught.. as time goes by, because he needed tutors and the financial situation wasn't very good.. I took up tuition classes for him.. The money I earned will go into paying for the car loan, for our room rental, office rental and so on.. Of course he's paying too..<br><br>Things were supposedly well.. We spent all our times together, working hard, going out sometimes. But as the financial situation got worse, he became busier and although we were together most of the time, it was me studying or teaching and him doing his teaching as well.. It wasn't what I would call 'quality time' I guess. But at that time, I thought that if I love him, all these were just nothing much..<br><br>In around july/august this year, we were pretty close with this other couple.. And the four of us decided to go into a new line of business.. Things got started.. In September however, I was pissed with him for an incident and I kinda showed my 'black face' to the other guy (one of the partners). He was telling my ex how angry he was that I showed him my bad mood even if he wasn't the one that I was angry with..<br><br>It was a huge incident that my ex and I argued a lot about.. I felt that although it was my fault for not being sensitive enough, my only argument was that I thought that guy was like a close friend so I don't really have to hide my feelings that much.. I was just keeping quiet that day and not like I was throwing my temper on the other guy.. The other guy's argument was that if I could do this to him, I could do this to clients next time and it would be bad..<br><br>My ex wanted me to apologise to that guy, but I thought it was a small matter and I didn't see my mistake at that time so I refused.. My ex didn't explained why I was wrong as well..<br><br>So I was cut out of the new business.. And mostly because of this incident, my ex suddenly told me he wanted to break up.. I guess because he felt that I could no longer help him in the new business, and money was important to him at this point in time.. Before he broke up with me, he already moved to another girl which was a friend introduced by that guy..<br><br>I guess I can't let it go.. because he was so perfect before this incident.. Because I've put in so much emotions, effort into this relationship.. We were planning to get married next year.. So much plans, goals.. The future.. It's just gone like that.. It's hard to accept that a guy who could love you so much could just suddenly do this cruel thing to you..<br><br>Because all my times have been spent with him, so the empty voids now are quite unbearable and lots of memories in lots of places..<br></div></blockquote>Your situation was quite similar to my last rs.<br><br>My ex also left me becoz of so-called "want to concentrate on career" , "money is more impt now than anything".

Secondly, think and ponder as you shall be but do not end up in depression. Look at what to be learn and be smart, if you will to fall into another breakup in love, then you have totally failed to heel your lessons of love.<br><br>On the other hands, most gals or even guys tend to seek comfort and love immediately after certain breakup, that lead to another breakup sooner than expected. This is because humans need love and in a rash to seek it, they fell inotto trap after trap of fail relationship. We must therefore not be led by love, love is not blind, it is you who are blind to see the real function of love that is mend to be good. It is suppose to be a win win situation where both should win, live, cherish and treasure it.<br><br>Angel<br>For my lord, without love, we might as well perish.<br></div>
