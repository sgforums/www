            <div class='col-md body'>TzM...<br><br>You'll be surprise that there are more girls who have something wrong and WANTS an Ah BEng for a bf.  Hahahaha...  :p<br><br>As for apple, ignoring her is not of much use because you will still become angry when you see her face.  Making your blood boil is not good for your health.  Think of ways to diffuse her irritation and that Hao Lian look.  I used to be stressed out looking at someone's face before, it's best to do something about it.<br><br>Either diao her back or do that  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> or even better keep on smiling at her as if she's some idiot like that you know.  Anything to make you more settle cause the problem will never go away if one's ignore this as an orstrich sticks its head into a hole.  Geddit?<br><br>My best suggestion is still to imagine a big black mole on her nose and see it grow bigger and bigger or imagine that her bf is using her for ahem "unspeakable" purpose like scrubbing his toilet, kissing his feet etc etc... you know.  Make it ridiculous and relief your stress.  Stay cool   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
