U want , u save for it and tell me(b4 hand).  it's almost standard protocol for me to pay for whatever i want. movies,filters,etc. it has become a time where if he pays for something, i get super uneasy. i just want him to be at least not disapproving of my purchase.<br><br>Trying not to go too far off topic here, but is it a case of both of you not really hearing what the other is saying?

Hell, I've got a friend who makes a couple of hundred thousand a year, and when I told him about the 717 (which Bear bought), even he blanched at the price tag.<br><br>~for the 10k, i mean, the cam costs 2100. it does not cost 10k, no cam costs 10k. i very well know my current finacial status, or rather the lack of it. so my game plan is buy the cam and master it for a few years before getting more lenses/filters whatever, whilst saving up and carefully deciding which to get.  i clearly know the value or something of money, anyway i am not going to elaborate my budget for the year here.<br>for the blanching of prices, i hope this isnt going to anger everyone,it depends on who u look at. while i am preparing to spend 2100 on a cam, i am unwilling to spend 10dollars on a cup of coke even i can drown myself in that amt of coke with 2100. ok maybe this isnt a good example but...<br><br>I understand your enthusiasm, but as a father, I can see why your dad would bring up reservations or objections about your choice.  Maybe trying to take his perspective will help you discuss the topic in a manner that is meaningful to him.<br><br>~ he does own an SLR, just a manual film version of the one i am buying. it's also a system of lense if u like. just a technological difference.<br>there is 1 deadlock we have encountered. maybe u can suggest to me how i can break it and frm here maybe i can get some ideas on who to discuss to him nicely.<br><br>the picture quality of an DSLR is way better than my current cam and a number of cams in the market. he says i can use software to get the effects i want. i feel if everything use photoshop to get the effects, then there is only a need for 1 cam brand and model. what effects u want, use PS lah.<br><br>i am not giving the thumbs down on use of PS here but PS is image editing, not image creation.</div>
