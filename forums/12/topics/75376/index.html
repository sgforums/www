            <div class='col-md body'>actually whenever i wanna post a topic here, i feel like an idiot..as if this place isnt sad enuf with everyone pouring out their sad memories and i am here adding to the pain...<br><br>oops<br><br>anyway my dad is staunchly aganist my idea of buying a DSLR,which is not just a cam but a system of lenses,filters,flashlights,etc. he wants me to buy HP or kodak's prosumer cams because he is those highly resistant to technology. yet he is using a manual SLR from his days.<br><br>we have gone into many discussions and some heated. on a few occasions, it was on the brink of becoming an argument and stopped progressing that way because i kept quiet to some of this points which i felt were fundamentally wrong. it would have been better if we discussed different aspects but we go in circles because though he physically listens to me he doesnt take my points into account. and he challenges me based on concepts, technologies and whatever not from his years.<br><br>i am planning to buy a DSLR this july or later but he has been pushing for me to buy those prosumer cams as mentioned earlier. nothing wrong with those cams but i feel i wanna push the technological limits that are barriers to me.<br><br>i do want to take a peaceful approach to this though.</div>
