            <div class='col-md body'>well, sad to hear what had been going on between you and your bf..<br><br>I'm not sure which part of the story you wanted us to look at, but I think much of the passion of this 7 year r/s has died down. It's does not mean you have to end the r/s.. It's just the interest in each other is not that novel anymore. One thing you can do, esp if both can share can do it together, is to pick up some new hobbies, like photography, etc etc... it will help develop your interest as well as his to be doing things together. Even if you're working on it alone, don't worry just go ahead.<br><br>In a relationship, it's both to stimulate each other's interest to keep the other party aroused. Remember at the beginning, you are just curious to find out more about each other?? So it basically a relationship need to both partners entertained by doing and sharing experience, so that the curiosity level is always maintained.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yo, sad to hear that. Things fade as time pass. Try to add some spices to your relationship, it may help. But your bf is a little too much. Maybe try sitting down together and discuss your thoughts with him. Find out whats wrong early rather to a stage of no return.

The way you talk and stuff determines whether is this childish OR a highly mature way of handling your own relationship.<br><br>You caught them red-handed with all this little things - you should have confront him. The reason why you didn't because you fear - you fear that this conflict could inflict millions of damage into your already shaky love: I have a very good suggestion for you: do is the Law way. This talk is a must and during the talk, keep you tone calm, facts strong and all that little things in mind, listen to what he has to say but causally tell him something before the conversation begans:<br><br>"We are having problems in our relationship and its tiring to move on without discussing the issues concerning the both of us. This is not a quarreling session, rather this is an important talk. If you feel that this is totally unneccessary OR you hate to explain yourself, at the end of the day, we are finished. I will make claims to things and I want to hear what you have to say: keeping quiet or having nothing to say indirectly means that you are admitting. There is a difference here in the talk however: Unless you prove yourself without deception and all-but-the-`fringing-truth and if you did wrong, just `fringing admit AND STATE WHAT YOU PLAN TO DO ABOUT IT. You can defend yourself if you are innocent, but beware because you are being watched and your lies can't escape your gf of 7 years. The minute you employ lies to cover up other lies and were exposed, we are finished as well."<br><br>Then begin your main talk. Keep your <strong>body language firm and serious</strong> and he will know that you ain't joking and will take it serious.<br><br>This method always work (that is to get an answer you wish to seek or forget about this whole thing) - but its just you whether you will be able to execute this whole thingy without changing plans at the last minute.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>P.S: Quit telling me that you are soft hearted and wouldn't be able to do it because all your previous method fails - The fear of losing your relationship is there. This is a gamble because trust me, the more you drag it, the more I can confirm this relationship is doom to failure. <strong>Without communication and exploring possibility to a win-win solution as a couple</strong>, its difficult to function. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>
