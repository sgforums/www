Many foreigners think that life in Singapore is a bed of roses because of the "outward" appearances. She started with a wrong impression.<br><br>She is not willing to continue with the Singaporean life-style. Having lived overseas, I can empathise with her.<br><br>Whether she "must" force you and whether it is right for her to do that is immaterial.<br><br>You must face facts right now. You will get through this. There is not much that you can do. If she comes back with your son, then she comes back and if not, there is not much you can do about it.<br><br>Don't try to force anything or change anything or wish for anything. Just do what is necessary. Be like a zombie for now and know that you will need time to heal but you will heal. There will be scars but you will heal. Life is like that, accept it.<br><br>Concentrate on your work and put all your time and effort into it. That will give you some normality and take your mind off your problems. Focus your mind on your work.<br><br>Almost everyone in the USA comes from a broken family and so your son will also do well. It is never as bad as we imagine. Life looks really bad for you right now but in reality it is not as bad as you think it is. Keep in touch here.</div>

You get fu<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>cked straight out of your son's life.<br><br>Find a way to land your son in Singapore now. Play along with her and then figure out a way to get him back on Singaporean soil. If you have relatives , let them look after your son without her knowledge when she is persistent on separation and divorce . The custody battle will get ugly but you need support on that aspect from your relatives.<br><br>Remember Singapore will hang on to any male Singaporean for the sole purpose of NS , therefore your wife will not be able to get him out easily once custody comes into play.<br><br>Delay until the age where she needs to set a bond for him to go out and usually Singapore won't let high risk sons go out.  So it is up to you on this part.<br><br>I know it sounds callous but it has to be your call.</div>

I be patient, and react upon situation.<br>Anymore opinions and comments is welcome.<br></div></blockquote>No money, then she provides money.<br><br>You think, with her and son in HK, and you in Singapore? You should maybe hope for the best that your wife will eventually find means to bring up your sons and your excuse for not being in HongKong providing?<br><br>or are you planning to stop contributing financially since you guys are spilt apart at the moment?<br><br>if so....yes, I still think you are thinking far,  and there is lots of such males around. You arent the only one to have calculated to that step.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually Hmmm, I think the issue with ur wife is more that she does not want to leave HK than anything else.<br><br>It is very difficult to be 'uprooted' from family and a culture you are familiar with.  Ultimately her actions show that it is not that she doesn't want to work. You say it is hard for you to 'settle' in HK find a new job etc, but for her it would have been the same thing. To come to Singapore, suddenly get a pay cut, work in a strange new environment.<br><br>Ultimately both of you are alike. Both refuse to get used to strange surroundings, adapt to new challenges, take risks. But at the very least, she HAS joined you in Singapore for a short while, even though she gave up. Perhaps you should at least return the favour, and TRY to do what she could not.<br><br>Ask her, if you keep your promise, join her in HK but due to different environment etc, will need time to settle financially again - how would she feel? She may have said nasty things in quarrel - about herself being richer, etc  - but who doesn't say angry hurtful things in an argument? Give each other a time frame - how many years did she stay with you in Singapore? 2? 3? Stay with her 2 years in HK and start to build a life together there. Like you said, the child is the biggest victim in a divorce. Don't think about that so fast because you havent tried EVERY solution yet.<br><br>Also, as vicious kitty says, how come your topic talk about remarry? Havent even divorce u think about remarry liao. Already have someone in mind?<br><br></div>

It's hardly even remotely true to suggest that "<strong>almost everyone</strong> in the USA comes from a broken family". Even for those that come from broken families and thrive, a lot has to be attributed to the environment over there which encourages independence from young - it's the culture and environment that helps to nurture the survival instincts in them.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think your wife feel financially insecure about your $2.5K having to feed 3 mouths. $2.5k is quite a big amount of money in Spore. But in hk, maybe thats not enough. Can consider moving to live in places like Shenzhen in China where your salary is considered very high, as the cost of living there is very low.</div>

My son is singaporean, already 2.5 years old. She dont like the life in SG, as it boring and lesser money to spend.  She is a PR and not working, and as far as i know she is unwilling to work in SG reason to unacceptable low wages.<br>It seems that i have been giving in to her for the past 3 years. I have been working hard, and trying my best to bring in more money; changing higher paid job and requesting for more increment from employer. Financially, i would say making ends meet, take home pay of about 2.5k per mth. With theses, every mths spending is tight, with little saving for buying tickets to HK every year.<br>I have done my parts as a husband and father. Trying to help my wife, I have actually promised her to go HK to find settle a living and work. And my wife is in HK now, with my son. I have been doing it slowly and openly to what my intention and plan.<br>Somehow, i started to realise that my family will not be financially stable and secure if i going to settle in HK. Its almost like starting all over again. And too many uncertainties that lies ahead.<br>I did mention to my wife that I am not able to financially support you and son a living while im working in SG. I have to secure my job, while she is trying to settle down based on her account. Requirement is to rent a flat, provide son's education and her stable job for 2 mths.  In return, she said that im not responsible of taking care of the family and Im leaving problems for her to solved in HK.<br>I guess, 2.5K per mth is not a lot, if i incluede air ticket to visit my son per mth, housing and insurrance liabilities, allowances and if i were to go HK, i need some saving to secure an empty house for at least 6 mths.<br>Im in despair, as she has ask for a divorce, and will not return to SG forever, including my son. I dont see that i have done anything wrong, yet she stated me as a failure, useless and selfish person.<br>Till now, the only mistake that i have made is that i have promise her to go HK to find liviing and work. But that doesnt mean that she has force me to surrender, as if i have owe her the entire life. She has to contribute, sensible, and mindful what she is doing now. In all, I just want to say, I cant affort to follow the blind and gullible, due to my concern of family and my son.<br>Before i would proceed to say more.. I would need some opinions and comments in my married life.   And a question of how can i bring my son back to SG without a passport. Im thinking of a 'emergency exit'.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> </div></blockquote>The only mistake you've made in this whole episode is not your promise to go to HK; rather, it's you committing yourself to a woman whom you barely know(of course, your wife is not blameless in this too) - and that, in essence, is your entire problem.<br><br>That said, your issues are certainly more complicated than what they seem on the surface. I suggest you consider your divorce and your child's custody as seperate matters if it helps you sort out your thoughts somewhat.<br><br>Addressing a potential divorce (should things come to that), where exactly was your marriage registered - HK, Singapore or both? That alone would go a long way towards dictating which course (and where) of legal action to pursue.<br><br>As for the custody of your child, while you mentioned he's a Singapore citizen, is he <strong>also a HK SAR resident</strong>? Whether your child is a HK SAR resident would also dictate how the fight for your child's custody could eventually pan out. Needless to say, should your child be a HK SAR resident (whether he was registered as a resident by birth or your wife did so for him without your knowledge), then this might not be an issue that could be addressed by the Singapore judicial system (which would be further complicated if your marriage was registered in HK) alone.<br><br>Without answers to the above questions, it's almost impossible for anyone to dispense any sound advice as to how to address the legal aspects of this issue. I suggest you then consult a lawyer in Singapore and/or HK on the above, depending on what your answers to the above questions are.<br><br>As for the emotional issues surrounding this problem of yours, you might want to seriously consider speaking to your wife about what the future holds for your family. In particular, to avoid a repeat of this scenario in future, you two might want to iron out the issues ranging from your immediate relocation conundrum to what exactly each party's role and contribution(do address issues including meeting her demands unreasonable housing and travelling demands if you find that to be unreasonable) to the marriage/family should entail. The fact that your wife has gone off to HK with your son clearly demonstrates she isn't that selfish afterall - at least, she bothered to bring your son back to HK with her instead of just packing up and returning to your in-laws' place on her own while carrying out her divorce proceedings. Besides, the fact she's still "threatening" you with a divorce could perhaps serve as an indication she's still in the "considering-all-options" phase(rather than having made an irrevocable decision where a divorce is inevitable) and that things may not yet be as dire as you imagine them to be? (While I wouldn't know what your wife is like, I think - from my experience at least - it's generally fair to say more often than not, women, in the heat of things, do tend to make threats which they may not be really intending to carry out.)<br><br>In essence, all hope's not lost and you should perhaps work on the emotional issues before considering the legal alternatives...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
