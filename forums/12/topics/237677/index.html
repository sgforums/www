            <div class='col-md body'>I have married to a HK wife, and relationship has been 3.5 years. My son is singaporean, already 2.5 years old. She dont like the life in SG, as it boring and lesser money to spend.  She is a PR and not working, and as far as i know she is unwilling to work in SG reason to unacceptable low wages.<br>It seems that i have been giving in to her for the past 3 years. I have been working hard, and trying my best to bring in more money; changing higher paid job and requesting for more increment from employer. Financially, i would say making ends meet, take home pay of about 2.5k per mth. With theses, every mths spending is tight, with little saving for buying tickets to HK every year.<br>I have done my parts as a husband and father. Trying to help my wife, I have actually promised her to go HK to find settle a living and work. And my wife is in HK now, with my son. I have been doing it slowly and openly to what my intention and plan.<br>Somehow, i started to realise that my family will not be financially stable and secure if i going to settle in HK. Its almost like starting all over again. And too many uncertainties that lies ahead.<br>I did mention to my wife that I am not able to financially support you and son a living while im working in SG. I have to secure my job, while she is trying to settle down based on her account. Requirement is to rent a flat, provide son's education and her stable job for 2 mths.  In return, she said that im not responsible of taking care of the family and Im leaving problems for her to solved in HK.<br>I guess, 2.5K per mth is not a lot, if i incluede air ticket to visit my son per mth, housing and insurrance liabilities, allowances and if i were to go HK, i need some saving to secure an empty house for at least 6 mths.<br>Im in despair, as she has ask for a divorce, and will not return to SG forever, including my son. I dont see that i have done anything wrong, yet she stated me as a failure, useless and selfish person.<br>Till now, the only mistake that i have made is that i have promise her to go HK to find liviing and work. But that doesnt mean that she has force me to surrender, as if i have owe her the entire life. She has to contribute, sensible, and mindful what she is doing now. In all, I just want to say, I cant affort to follow the blind and gullible, due to my concern of family and my son.<br>Before i would proceed to say more.. I would need some opinions and comments in my married life.   And a question of how can i bring my son back to SG without a passport. Im thinking of a 'emergency exit'.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I really thanks all for the quick response.. I just finish drying my clothes in hanger..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br>Would like to answer every questions at a time.<br>1) udontknowme<br>-- I travel to HK with SG passport, and now my wife has successfully applied for mwe and my son the dependant visa for 12 mths.<br>--My wife at current is looking for job, But I think she will only start work earliest after CNY period, like say in March 07.<br>--  my best knowledge, no one has file for divorce, though she said she initiated will find a lawyer. But based on ground rules of divorce, I have not commited any wrong doings  or desertion to family. So i doubt she can successfully file for one. Secondly, Im not interested, I i know and mentioned to her that our son is the victim in parent's divorce.<br>-- "..might have a higher chance of getting the child.."<span style="font-style: italic;"> does that mean i have to issue this in court? I doubt we can settle this on our own, as both is not willing , though she show more temper towards my son.<br><br>2) mhcampboy<br>--Yes, she admit that she was wrong to see that her life can be that dreadful living in SG. But i do see that its partially up to her to decide and liven up to her current enviroment.<br>-- my wife is a PR. Not SG citizen.<br>-- Seem to be the winning side to keep my son, but not if he is in HK now. So i think no matter how the battle goes, custody of child could still be losing, and ended up follow mother instead. Unless my son is in SG.<br>-- My son at current is hollding dependant Visa for 12 mths.<br><br>3) T.Ryousuke<br>-- Im trying to be patience and let her to cool down 1st.<br><br>4) mhcampboy<br>-- Speaking of court, if the judge is a female. I think the chance may be slim.<br><br>Hi All,<br>I be patience and giving this situation to last till june. And i really hope that she will one day understand and feel remorseful. Fly back to SG on her own without my knowing. Am i thinking too simple? </span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I totally understand your pain, but in court, almost all court rule in favor of woman, there are cases in japan that even the man won the case against the woman, the woman ran away with the child, and you can't do anything about it, if you truly want to, go to hong kong with your parents on the pretext of visiting your wife relative, and ninja your son away, its not worthwhile to fight the cases in court, you may be in the losing end.</div>

REalli.  it is easy to break the deal, but, make it up?  it is so much harder.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by father_and_son:</div><div class="quote_body"> I have married to a HK wife, and relationship has been 3.5 years. My son is singaporean, already 2.5 years old. She dont like the life in SG, as it boring and lesser money to spend.  She is a PR and not working, and as far as i know she is unwilling to work in SG reason to unacceptable low wages.<br>It seems that i have been giving in to her for the past 3 years. I have been working hard, and trying my best to bring in more money; changing higher paid job and requesting for more increment from employer. Financially, i would say making ends meet, take home pay of about 2.5k per mth. With theses, every mths spending is tight, with little saving for buying tickets to HK every year.<br>I have done my parts as a husband and father. Trying to help my wife, I have actually promised her to go HK to find settle a living and work. And my wife is in HK now, with my son. I have been doing it slowly and openly to what my intention and plan.<br>Somehow, i started to realise that my family will not be financially stable and secure if i going to settle in HK. Its almost like starting all over again. And too many uncertainties that lies ahead.<br>I did mention to my wife that I am not able to financially support you and son a living while im working in SG. I have to secure my job, while she is trying to settle down based on her account. Requirement is to rent a flat, provide son's education and her stable job for 2 mths.  In return, she said that im not responsible of taking care of the family and Im leaving problems for her to solved in HK.<br>I guess, 2.5K per mth is not a lot, if i incluede air ticket to visit my son per mth, housing and insurrance liabilities, allowances and if i were to go HK, i need some saving to secure an empty house for at least 6 mths.<br>Im in despair, as she has ask for a divorce, and will not return to SG forever, including my son. I dont see that i have done anything wrong, yet she stated me as a failure, useless and selfish person.<br>Till now, the only mistake that i have made is that i have promise her to go HK to find liviing and work. But that doesnt mean that she has force me to surrender, as if i have owe her the entire life. She has to contribute, sensible, and mindful what she is doing now. In all, I just want to say, I cant affort to follow the blind and gullible, due to my concern of family and my son.<br>Before i would proceed to say more.. I would need some opinions and comments in my married life.   And a question of how can i bring my son back to SG without a passport. Im thinking of a 'emergency exit'.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> </div></blockquote>may i ask do u still love your wife? it seemed like.. now both parties are putting the blame on each other due to financial problem. i think both of u should calm down n think.. if there is still love, i think the above problems may or can be compromise....<br><br>the ticket to visit ur son can it be postphone? using webcam will be a cheaper idea... Rent out room in ur house to earn some income? just some ideas.. not sure if is workable..</div>
