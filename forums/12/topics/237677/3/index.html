Don't sweat the little things in life or you will have a hard time going through life.<br><br>My experience is that since she is willing to meet you in HK and your marriage seems to be going on, continue like this and see what happens next. One day at a time. You do your best and if she gives you divorce papers than you know it is the end. She threatens to divorce you but you don't threaten back than things will turn out well in the end.<br><br>Maybe you will have a long distance relationship for the time being and wait for something to turn up, like you get retrenched in Singapore (hahaha, I am so bad) and find a better job in HK.<br><br>Personally, if I were you I will stay in Hong Kong. I like countries where, when the people protest, the government do not raise the GST even if they feel that it is right to raise it. They respect people's views.<br><br>I like Singapore better now than Singapore 5 years ago (after the changes these few years) but still HK or Bangkok is better anytime...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Here's advise for you.<br><br>Dont grow attached and think your world revolve around Singapore, Does it revolve around yourself &amp; your family?<br><br>Now on holiday with wife for CNY rite.<br><br>Talk to her, see what kind of finances she need.  Discuss with her the future of your son, afterall, he would still need to serve NS when it comes.<br><br>Sons education, is it better for him to be educated in SG or HK?  Both of you has to come to terms with his future.<br><br>even if divorce, he is still your son, and he needs your finances to eat, study &amp; play. (Or you were planning to give that up to your wife?)<br><br>Goes back to Singapore to work.<br><br>But if truly you misses your family and wishes to at least work your marriage out.<br><br>rent out your current home and goes over for 2 years.  use that 2 years to also pick up skills in HK.  Treat it as a sabbatical.<br><br></div>

Is your son worth the humiliation (of your wife having an affair).

The most commonly used reason is unreasonable behaviour, which encompass behaviour such as violence, gambling, intimate association with third parties, insufficient payment of maintenance, the use of vulgarities or abusive language, or even reluctance to engage in sexual intercourse without valid reason. For adultery, the burden of proof appears to be higher, and invariably requires a private investigator's report, even if the hearing is uncontested. The other reasons are desertion and separation.

Based on her reason is<br>1) I dont love her anymore. This is based on her intuitive, which dont makes any logic sense.<br>2) She cannot accept any longer for life in SG is boring and unable to communicate with SG ppl well. She love shopping, spending money, tour, etc. I meant.. as family, all this leisure should be come second, as we already have a son to support his daily needs and education.  Well,,, for leisure, cant she work and we plan for a tour? Till today, she still say that she will NOT return to SG.<br><br>For that,, i sense that there should be a third party involved. Else why she insist divorce, yet on the other hand, look appreciative towards me? Is she just genuine or simply cunning?<br><br>For the Japan tour with her ex-.,, I MUST pretend nothing happen,, cos if i confront her, she can actually shoot me back by saying i having been digging her privacy, and no mutual respect.<br><br>Be whatever reasons,  I guess no married man in modern society can tolerate wife to be with another guy, WITHOUT my knowings? Am i a puppet? or just a chess set?<br><br>Seriously ,, Im consolidating facts, ideally source from a P.I.  With no common interest and understanding in couple,, what worth is there to live on in a marriage? There are many more years to go, pal...<br>I would rather change the fate of my son.<br><br>arr....  this issue really bothers me so much.<br><br>BTW,, noting is fake here. Im trying to get more opinions and listen to more ppl .<br><br></div>
