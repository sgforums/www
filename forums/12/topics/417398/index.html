              <p>If I were you, I wouldn't attend that wedding at all cost. Coz frankly, even if she didn't tell any relative, at least one close friend would have got word of it from her, and it is a sure bet that friend won't keep her mouth shut, and sure to attend the wedding. If you want to save your reputation, don't attend it.</p>

              <p>go for th wedding and offer your best wishes....all the best romantic secrets have always been buried with the fondest memories and if u like ....turn it into a humour...life is filled with ironic humours....life is full of love's labour lost....</p>

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Historical background</span></strong></p>
              <p>I join this co 8 mth ago. I start out project with this lady, she is 25. We did a lot of project together and we spoke a lot, went out dinner as a group, when we werk late. Then I got interested in her and sometime I call her phone to discuss project. I thought she is single. So I decided to ask her out. I text her once. Ask her to eat dinner with me. She answer one day later, she say no with excuse. Then I try again, also same result. Third try, this time I confess I like her. This time she tell me to forget her. fail.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Surprise no.1</span></strong></p>
              <p>Turn out that the girl is going to get married but she never say anything like that to me. For 8 month we work in projects, I thought she was single. Only yesterday I found out she was going to get marry. So how?</p>
              <p>Surprise no.2: She is going to marry my cousin. So embarassing. My cousin mother is my mother's younger sister. So how? So how?</p>
              <p>I did not know at 1st but when I saw my mother pass me the wedding card and saw her name and picture.</p>
              <p>What should I do? Should I ponteng wedding? Should I face the wedding? Will she say bad thing to my relative about me?</p>
              <p>I am so headahe now.</p>

              <p><br>Don't talk about it to anyone, she also won't mention it to anyone.</p>
              <p>She might get a shock during the wedding but that's about all.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just forget about the AWKWARD FEELING and MOVE ON.</p>
              <p>And this incident will become nothing more than just a whisper in the wind.</p>

              <p>And I have no wish to babysit your own self-created worries because I know they are unnecessary.</p>

              <p>She sounds like she has enough tact not to tell anyone about it, not even to her would-be husband, so don't worry too much.</p>
              <p>Regarding to attend the wedding or not, ask your other family members to proceed onwards while you excuse yourself claiming to attend your "close friend's wedding" on that day.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Breaking news</span></strong></p>
              <p>Yesterday night my parents went to my cousin parents apmt to help them with wedding preparation and to talk. Since we live nearby. I also tumpang.</p>
              <p>I found courage to overcome my paisehness and told everything to my cousin. He did not give any reaction, he just keep quiet and went back to his chores. The girl was not there. When I try to talk to him, he pretended to be busy and give me one word answer. So inconvenient to talk because all the relative around. I could not get chance to isolate him alone and talk to him. I scared relatives will hear.</p>
              <p>I am now so worry. What to do now? My cousin is giving me silent treatment.</p>
