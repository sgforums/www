              <p>You just a colleague - you never close to her enough for her to tell you, and you never ask.  So what  even if everyone know - just laugh it off as a man, and say my cousin more lucky manage to success when you failed.

              get marry. So how?</p>
              <p>Surprise no.2: She is going to marry my cousin. So embarassing.
              My cousin mother is my mother's younger sister. So how? So how?</p>
              <p>I did not know at 1st but when I saw my mother pass me the
              wedding card and saw her name and picture.</p>
              <p>What should I do? Should I ponteng wedding? Should I face the
              wedding? Will she say bad thing to my relative about me?</p>

              <p>if u are single, it is not wrong that u wanted to court the gal. she did not even give u clear hints she was attached or anything otherwise you would have backed off faster.just go to the wedding and say 'oh my! i always thought u were single! but great to know my cousin and u are together! my cousin is a great guy! '....whatever ...</p>
              <p>to your cousin, just tell him you didn't know she was attached to him until recently but congrats him and wish him well.</p>
              <p>time will heal all embarrassment.sooner or later u will also find your dream gal and all will shut up. dun worry!</p>

              <p>Yesterday night my parents went to my cousin parents apmt to help them with wedding preparation and to talk. Since we live nearby. I also tumpang.</p>
              <p>I found courage to overcome my paisehness and told everything to my cousin. He did not give any reaction, he just keep quiet and went back to his chores. The girl was not there. When I try to talk to him, he pretended to be busy and give me one word answer. So inconvenient to talk because all the relative around. I could not get chance to isolate him alone and talk to him. I scared relatives will hear.</p>
              <p>I am now so worry. What to do now? My cousin is giving me silent treatment.</p>
