            <div class='col-md body'>If you find it stress for such issue, just tell her you prefer her as a friend. It is easier to know a person via friendship. Stop talking about 'I love her..., she loves me', that sort of childish thinking when you don't even know what is love. You do not have to commit yourself that fast, give yourself air to breathe. Try not to get addicted into contacting her via webcam, take a few days of break by not contacting her.<br><br></div>

She's not local. As times goes by, we find ourselves love each other alot. She used webcam chat with me so I get to see how her reaction are and knew she is not faking anything. We even communicate through long distance call and she is the one who made the call. She has been planning to come to SG to visit me and I'm very happy about it. I can really feel that she really love me very much and so am I for her. By the way, we both are matured. She is 23 and I'm 21.<br><br>Thing goes well until she decided to tell me a news. I know that she had a bf before and had intimacy relationship with him. I can understand that and dont mind her past. However, she told me that she made a very big mistake before and really regretted. That is the abortion. She told me that the guy want to have baby but dont bear the responsibility. He cheated on her and she is really really sad about it. With the encouragment from her family members, she decided to make a painful decision of abortion. As she told me all these stuff, she had been crying really hard. Though her parents told her that it's better not to tell the guy she like about this cos it's a sensetives issue. She decided to tell me the truth and wont want to hurt me in future when I found out anything. I agree that she took alot of courage and I really appreciated her telling me. She was already mentally-prepared before she decided to tell me this.<br><br>I really feel sorry for her... she had gone through alot of hardship. She study and work at the same time to support herself though. She was really happy about coming to Singapore to meet me as she had some of her saving left. I was seriously very touched. But.. this are different things... what made me really sad was until now,  she and her ex had been contacting each other!! OMG.. how can someone still contacting  with the one who hurt and harm you so much?? This is the fact I cant accept. I knew cos we were having webcam and her ex call.. telling her not to believe relationship through the net and told her not to come SG as she will get cheated again!! (Seriously, I duno what to say) Her reply to him was not really harsh and thanking him with sarcasm. She explained to me that she thank him for breaking up with her as she now found someone she really loved. (Oh man.. that was just great..) She added that she never forgive him... but i cant accept this anymore.... that is just sad... really sad...<br><br>She told me that she know how I feel now and she might not the one for me. She's still keen about coming to SG and wanted me to treat her as normal friend instead. Seriously I duno what to do... Suddenly my heart ache alot. i told her that we need more time to think and she told me not to force myself. There's no happiness in relationship in forcing. I agreed. However, she message me that she still loved me very much..<br><br>I know some of you might think that "Aiyah, if you turly love her, you can dont mind her everything." , "The power of love can make you forget one's past", "Everyone make mistake, why cant you just forgive her?" etc... I guess you wont be saying this to yourself when this thing happen to you. Imagine your current gf having an abortion before and still contacting the guy that made her pregnant though when she talk to him with sacrasm. Well.. of course there's some guys out there which is really nice and open-hearted. These are some of the good guys.. too bad I think I'm not. I know I'm immatured at this so it's really hard for me to accept.<br><br>So can any kind souls out there to give me some advices? I'm really confused now... </div></blockquote>ahahah I so agree on your 2nd last paragraph. the  "I guess you wont be saying this to yourself when this thing happen to you. " hahah<br><br>thats so very true.. well if you love her and dont mind about the cons... go for it!</div>

At first, before she told me she got the abortion, her ex call her and told her stuff to forget about me.

Abortion is an issue which I think it's wrong for me.. or guys to discriminate girls because of that...<br><br>For example, if the girl got raped.. it's not what they wanted. I can udnerstand. However... to contact with someone who did something bad to you.. that's just unbearable.. I love her... but tell me... how do I love her this way? </div></blockquote>They can be just friends or just wanna ask "How are you?" wat... contact only... not patch lohx. You trust her or trust her ex? Already say is the ex keep psychoing her to beware of you. This is not her fault wat...it's the ex's fault lohx... u cannot accept wat? ... heck care the ex lahx. If u truely love her then go ahead! The ex is trying sow discord... will u fall to the trap?<br><br>If the girl really listens to him...then forget about her... she's not for u.</div>
