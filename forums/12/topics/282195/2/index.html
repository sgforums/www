With my thinking this way, we will get more hurt later on if we progress further. I dont know.. everything have limit.. I know I'm not perfect... what can be let go, can be let go... At first, before she told me she got the abortion, her ex call her and told her stuff to forget about me. At that time, I can understand that she might not able to forget about him and yeah I dont want to mess her life causing her to lost some people in her life as in her friends maybe. However... I would never thought that she went through a hardship of abortion because of him! Abortion is an issue which I think it's wrong for me.. or guys to discriminate girls because of that...<br><br>For example, if the girl got raped.. it's not what they wanted. I can udnerstand. However... to contact with someone who did something bad to you.. that's just unbearable.. I love her... but tell me... how do I love her this way? </div></blockquote>I have some friends who had to abort.<br>All of them regretted it their whole life.<br>Teenage stupidity, 100%.<br>Many has since moved on, and have a family with other worthy men.<br><br>So far, it has been her ex contacting her right ?<br>You did not mention her taking the initiative to keep contact with him.<br>Besides, she wasn't friendly towards her ex, correct?<br><br>Now, why would she go and tell her ex about you?<br><br>Many men, use pregnancy as a way to trap a woman. Thinking she won't run away if she is carrying his child.  Stupid but they still did.<br><br>There are too many unknown in this relationship.<br>Before you jump to any conclusion, you should find out more about her.<br><br></div>

I must admit that she's having a tough life there and I really wanted her to live with comfortable life. I may have nothing now but for her, I would work very hard. This is not love at first sight... as least I think not through webcam or photo. It's about the communication when we actually talks for hrs in long distance call.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Nothing wrong about liking people through chats in msn.

            <div class='col-md body'>u are only 21... and i highly doubt if you know the meaning of true love. Give yourself (and her) time, space and opportunities to learn more about one another in person before u declare your undying love for her.<br><br>Love is almost never a bed of roses. There are present and future financial and practical considerations that I fear you have not considered, and am not equipped for.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by aicuole:</div><div class="quote_body">Alright.. I just know this girl not long ago over the net. She's not local. As times goes by, we find ourselves love each other alot. She used webcam chat with me so I get to see how her reaction are and knew she is not faking anything. We even communicate through long distance call and she is the one who made the call. She has been planning to come to SG to visit me and I'm very happy about it. I can really feel that she really love me very much and so am I for her. By the way, we both are matured. She is 23 and I'm 21.<br><br>Thing goes well until she decided to tell me a news. I know that she had a bf before and had intimacy relationship with him. I can understand that and dont mind her past. However, she told me that she made a very big mistake before and really regretted. That is the abortion. She told me that the guy want to have baby but dont bear the responsibility. He cheated on her and she is really really sad about it. With the encouragment from her family members, she decided to make a painful decision of abortion. As she told me all these stuff, she had been crying really hard. Though her parents told her that it's better not to tell the guy she like about this cos it's a sensetives issue. She decided to tell me the truth and wont want to hurt me in future when I found out anything. I agree that she took alot of courage and I really appreciated her telling me. She was already mentally-prepared before she decided to tell me this.<br><br>I really feel sorry for her... she had gone through alot of hardship. She study and work at the same time to support herself though. She was really happy about coming to Singapore to meet me as she had some of her saving left. I was seriously very touched. But.. this are different things... what made me really sad was until now,  she and her ex had been contacting each other!! OMG.. how can someone still contacting  with the one who hurt and harm you so much?? This is the fact I cant accept. I knew cos we were having webcam and her ex call.. telling her not to believe relationship through the net and told her not to come SG as she will get cheated again!! (Seriously, I duno what to say) Her reply to him was not really harsh and thanking him with sarcasm. She explained to me that she thank him for breaking up with her as she now found someone she really loved. (Oh man.. that was just great..) She added that she never forgive him... but i cant accept this anymore.... that is just sad... really sad...<br><br>She told me that she know how I feel now and she might not the one for me. She's still keen about coming to SG and wanted me to treat her as normal friend instead. Seriously I duno what to do... Suddenly my heart ache alot. i told her that we need more time to think and she told me not to force myself. There's no happiness in relationship in forcing. I agreed. However, she message me that she still loved me very much..<br><br>I know some of you might think that "Aiyah, if you turly love her, you can dont mind her everything." , "The power of love can make you forget one's past", "Everyone make mistake, why cant you just forgive her?" etc... I guess you wont be saying this to yourself when this thing happen to you. Imagine your current gf having an abortion before and still contacting the guy that made her pregnant though when she talk to him with sacrasm. Well.. of course there's some guys out there which is really nice and open-hearted. These are some of the good guys.. too bad I think I'm not. I know I'm immatured at this so it's really hard for me to accept.<br><br>So can any kind souls out there to give me some advices? I'm really confused now... </div></blockquote>Which part do u mind, really? The part that she has an abortion or the fact that she didn't lose her virginity to u? Because the latter part is something a lot of guys mind. But look at it this way. Love makes people crazy, stupid and blind. She had sex with someone she loved and whom she thought loved her, but in the end, they are no longer together and she had an abortion. That's too bad.<br><br>Look, she risked everything by telling u the truth. She could have just kept everything quiet by not saying it, but she treasured u, and she told u this thing because she wanted to be open to it. By not accepting it, it may suggest that you are really not really to go through "thick and thin" with her, something that all couples should do. And also, what's wrong with contacting the ex? Should it really even matter to you? There's no such law that 2 people who have broken up should remain cold and distant and not contact each other. Once again, it shows that you are a little narrow-minded.<br><br>Let the ex say what he want. Its up to u to prove that u love her mroe than that guy. Yet, u minding so many things about her and her past suggest that u are not ready and not willing to go into this relationship. If that's e case, then its best to nip the relationship in the bud before it even blossoms further. That would be the best for u and her.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>TS,<br>what the girl did before is the past. I dunno whether u can accept it but if u cant, if its against your morals or u just dun feel comfortable about it, let her know.<br><br>You shouldn't allow something like that to bother u. I had an ex who has had an abortion before and i didn't mind it one bit. What's done cannot be undone, there's no use crying over spilt milk.<br><br>And i agree with angel7030 regarding the gender discrimination thing. If a guy had sex with many girls, does that make him unworthy in any way?<br><br>It's the guy's fault if he inpregnated her, not hers. just my thoughts.</div>

With my thinking this way, we will get more hurt later on if we progress further. I dont know.. everything have limit.. I know I'm not perfect... what can be let go, can be let go... At first, before she told me she got the abortion, her ex call her and told her stuff to forget about me. At that time, I can understand that she might not able to forget about him and yeah I dont want to mess her life causing her to lost some people in her life as in her friends maybe. However... I would never thought that she went through a hardship of abortion because of him! Abortion is an issue which I think it's wrong for me.. or guys to discriminate girls because of that...<br><br>For example, if the girl got raped.. it's not what they wanted. I can udnerstand. However... to contact with someone who did something bad to you.. that's just unbearable.. I love her... but tell me... how do I love her this way? </div></blockquote>I also agree with jojobeach that you should be a man and go over and take a look at her.<br><br>She did not need to tell you this. Perhaps jot down the questions you have in your head, and talk to her about it when you meet her. Its easier that way.<br><br></div>
