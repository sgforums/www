He never confessed to me, until late last year around this time. He hijacked my hp number, I don't really blame him for that though, cause there's really no chance for us to meet up at all.<br><br>Okay, so on and off the entire year, he been asking me out... few months once but I keep rejecting him... starting that time I totally didn't replied, but he kept coming back, then I started replying gave all kinds of excusing... he's very scare of me... he's very afraid of making me angry he keeps apologizing to me for nothing...<br><br>Then this few weeks, after my exams, he kept asking me out more often, I guess he couldn't take it anymore... Then he confessed everything to me... all the stupid things he did just to be able to see me more... I told him not to waste his time but he said its okay for him to be hurt, he just wants to wait for me his whole life... he promised everything to me... even his future...<br><br>Then yesterday, he told me tomorrow he'll waited for me at a place till I come because he knows if he asked I'll always be busy and said if I didn't turn up he'll wait again another day, I didn't reply... But he's kinda right I am cruel, I never did gave him any chance not even once... I haven't really seen him for 2 whole years...<br><br>I don't know... we never talked much b4 in sch... and I have neutral impression of him only... but he's able to make such promises to me... and I do know he'll really wait.... after all its been a decade... he said he'll never go away even if I am attached... I don't know what I am feeling right now...<br><br>What should I do? Should I go? </div></blockquote>If you don't like him stay away from him. He is just a nut case trying to frighten you or force you to be with him.  If he like to wait let him wait. If you go there is high chance he will take it as a yes or even do stupid things to you.</div>
