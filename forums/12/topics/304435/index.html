            <div class='col-md body'>well all i can say is that your gf has to understand your plight.<br><br>no money already one problem. she makes it worse by asking you to bring her to places like swensens to dine in.<br><br>if this problem persists, you gotta let go i'm honest. if she wants to be a taitai, you're not the right person to look for (i'm sorry for being so direct here)<br><br>anyway i myself live off from my parents and am rather shameful to say this. i pay for my gf meals and all. my gf isn't really getting alot weekly so basically we try to save up. spend less. eat at foodcourt, market, whatever you name it. we cook at home too.<br><br>is your r/s underground btw? as in your parents or her parents or both parents dunno abt the r/s of the both of you?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>No money? Then don't pak tor loh <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Seems to me like your gf don't really want to understand your wallet is empty. If she is really understanding she will eat anything and who say foodcourt nothing to eat. So many stalls and can't even pick one? Anyway foodcourt where got cheap one. Chicken rice is at least $3.50. Should go kopitiam. Cheaperer <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  Chicken rice can still get at $2.00, and home made barley is $1.00. If she really understand your situation a plate of $2.00 chicken rice will be sufficient for her. She might like you but she resent the fact you are poor. Let's see how long she can take it before she call it quit with you. Can't blame her ditching you if she does cos' no matter how a man must have a bit of money don't need a lot but at least working and able to support yourself and spend a bit more than eating chicken rice at every outing <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

She can say she understands but if her ACTION shows otherwise, she doesn't really mean what she said in the first place. Sorry to say, but I think most probably she is taking you as a carrot head for her to chop chop  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>One way to see through this is to take all the money out from your bank account, then next time if she asks you to pay for meals again, tell her you don't have anymore money. Show her that your wallet only has enough to pay for your own meal and show her your empty bank account. Explain to her what has been happening so far, that you have drained out your own account to pay for her extravagance.<br><br>If she reallyyy understands, she will offer to pay and share the expenses from now on, but if she chooses to break up with you, you know what kind of girl she is. Sincerely hope she is the former but if she turns out to be the latter, you know you ain't got nothing much to lose anyway <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
