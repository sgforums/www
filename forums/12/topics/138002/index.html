She did not do anything at all to deserve all these.<br><br>If u really love a person, u will wan to spend the rest of ur life with her (not just 1 mth and then say lose interest). Even if u duno her well but u really love her, u will get and try to know her better when u are tog. Seems to me that u are missing all these.<br><br>Do u know how lucky u are to have somone who u love and love u by ur side?<br><br>I think u dun treasure her and is not serious abt love at all. The fact that u are 17 shows me that u cant handle this thing called relationship. Ur way is : U love, U chase, be tog, thats it. Nth more to that for u.<br><br>True love shld be: U love, U chase and u wan to spend a long time together.<br><br>I can say that u plainly are not serious abt relationships and not sincere abt love at all. I feel sad for the girl but if u dun love her, pls let her go and instead of treating her coldly in future.</div>

It's only a month old relationship, so it's better for you to end it now than dragging it for over a year when the relationship is much stronger than now. At least the pain will be greatly minimised in the pain department.<br><br>Sometimes it's better to let go than holding on to it when you have already lost your feelings for her. In this case, I feel that it's appropriate for you to break up with her as soon as possible so that she's still able to get back to her normal single life without much difficulties.<br><br>But I've to say one thing to you, don't jump onto the relationship bandwagon whenever there's a chance. You'll be just wasting away your time and opportunities to meet the right one for you. Treat this as a crush/infatuation and grow out from it.<br><br>Best of luck to both of you and both of you will find a better partner in the future than now, someone who is more compatible.<br><br>Good luck. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>
