He is going away from the country for a year for work and he wants to get married before he leaves. What should I do? </p>
              <p>There are other guys who likes me but I'm starting to think twice about marriage. I don't seem to know if the guy truly loves me if we are having frequent sex.

A woman, under no circumstances, should be coearced into a decision if she herself is unsure. Women pride themselves as having that six sense: use that as a pointer and reassess.

              <p>He needed to secure his place with your family thus he acted the nice guy to impress your family even tho he is not impressing you much with his controlling and unreasonable behavior.</p>
              <p>He practice double standard. What applies to you don't apply to him.</p>
              <p>He justifies his behavior towards other women and ignore your feelings.</p>
              <p>He keeps you by his side because you're the kind of gal who actually tolerate his bull crap.</p>

              <p>You need to understand that your bf has narcissistic tendencies. The relationship is not about the two of u. Its ALL about him.</p>
              <p>In this kind of relationship you exist only to serve his needs. There will hardly be two way nurturing.  What you can offer is not the most essential in his eyes. Rather it will be about what he can take from you to feed his ego.</p>

              boyfriend wants to cultivate and be nice spend his time and
              resources on other ladies... And making the women shower praises
              and loves him. Is he cultivating towards the day when he will be
              needed for them to feel good about sexually? I feel he is trapping
              me. If I marry him, I will always be so insecure if he is going to
              make out with other women. There are a few female friends close to
              him and he says that she likes to be touched by other men. To that,
              I feel is he being her friend because of the possibilities of
              sexual activity that is going to happen...or already happen? I
              don't know.</span></p>
              <p>At end day, I feel he doesn't loves me and eventually he will
              cheat on me. I really don't think I'm being sensitive or overly
              suspicious her. All the red lights are there and I'm just attached
              to him emotionally at heart that it's very hurting to let go. Can
              someone support me on making the right decision? He is going away
              from the country for a year for work and he wants to get married
              before he leaves. What should I do? </p>
              <p>There are other guys who likes me but I'm starting to think
              twice about marriage. I don't seem to know if the guy truly loves
              me if we are having frequent sex. Or if the guy really loves me he
              will marry And take care of me without having sex as he doesn't
              want to hurt me. Does this exist? </p>

              <p>I'm seeing this guy for awhile and he has made sacrifices for me
                      significantly and have me involved in his future life plans. He
                      scrutinises my contacts list of guy friends who likes me and block
                      them out sometimes calling to scold them. He keeps in close contact
                      with my parents and sister selling himself to be someone who loves
                      and will take care of me.</p>
              <p>However, I start to hesitate when it comes to settling with him
                      as his honey words become excessive. He is always praising and
                      saying how beautiful, intelligent.. Kind  I am etc ... When
                      actually I have not even be working out even gaining weight or
                      doing any grooming.</p>
              <p><span>There was a time when we were chatting he said "
                      if it's a pretty and kind girl I will love her" so I fumed and
                      replied go to them you have plenty of choices! To that, he replied
                      they will not love him.</span></p>
              <p><span>At that moment I feel he's just using me for
                      physical pleasure and all those excessive praises are to cultivate
                      me to be close to him. He likes to be very generous to his female
                      peers and be a chauffeur to them. Most of them already have
                      boyfriends or husbands. One of them frequently borrow money from
                      him and he lends it to her. It's in the thousands and it's really
                      very hard to think the relationship is pure and no sexual activity
                      is involved. Many times I broke down, I feel insecure why does my
                      boyfriend wants to cultivate and be nice spend his time and
                      resources on other ladies... And making the women shower praises

              <p><img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"> You spoke about the possibility of your boyfriend choosing you because of the lack of mutual feelings and availability with other female counterparts. Frankly, it is meaningless to discern the truthfulness of this statement when I reckon that there is deep-seated resentment towards his insidious attempt to construct an unequal power play in the relationship. </p>
              <p>It seemed that he has the rights to be ‘generous’ and has regular contacts to his female friends, while he consciously attempts to ‘block out’ your guy friends. It is likely that he is as (or even much more) insecure as you – hence there is a deliberate intention to craft out a system where he wants to gain power through strategic social isolation. </p>
              <p>There are a couple of important factors that would have contributed to your confusion:</p>
              <p>i) When you shared about your bf affirming you, your inner self reacted violently and concluded that he must been lying. My sense is that your low innate self-worth might likely be more of a culprit; never mind about the fact on why he says what he says, but the point about feeling that you are an unlovable person, capable only of 'retaining' relationship because you exchanged flesh for affection is not something common.</p>
              <p>You are what you what because of what you believe yourself to be. And I am really worried what you are feeding your mind with.   </p>
              <p>ii) I wonder how the circumstances of he 'cheating' on you makes any difference here; what I am hearing right now is how much you don't like about him and not so much about you catching him having an affair. Specifically, he does not appear to fulfill your needs or respect you presently; somehow you see yourself as mere component of his sexual gratification, which has not translated to joint pleasure. Perhaps subconsciously, you reluctantly seek to fulfil his sexual needs because it has become a 'way' for you to keep him near you.  </p>
              <p>***</p>

              <p>I am not saying that you should or should not leave the relationship; but what I am saying is that we have the power to decide what we want to do with our relationship. And this power does not belong to him, your sister or your mother.</p>
