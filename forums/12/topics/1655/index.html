            <div class='col-md body'>Jian Wen,<br><br>Wat I did was just to reply her directly, and maybe an answer that she might be looking for. If I dun give scientific evidence then u think anyone will believe such things?? U still living in a world where saliva can make a ger pregnant is it? If pple is to listen to things which are hearsay then wouldn't this world be complex. Scientists researched into all areas to solve all our myths, and here u say that pple shld listen things which are just old-wife tales.<br><br>Anyway, it's alright that pple have to worry about little things. It's all part of growing up. It's all in us to see how we perceive whether such a problem are small or big. For instance, having some ants on a cake is a small issue to many of us, but for pple who are poor in health will avoid coming into contact with such food. U can't judge a person from wat he/she worries, becoz it could be due to former experiences that made him/her worry abt it. These are something which pple do not reveal openly.<br><br>Moreover, gender equility is in this society. so gers need not just worry about vice and this kind of stuff...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well my dear girl, the myth of men getting their rocks off but having their sperms deposited inside your mouth is just that, myth. Most likely your boyfriend was fed on a diet of pornography and thus likes the idea of ejaculating into your mouth.<br>The reason why porn films love to have this scene is because it show's the masculine side of man, the ability to ejaculate as you please...especially into an "opening" beside the girl's vagina. And we can also see a submissive tone being projected by female star, another visual "turn on" for guys.<br><br>if you really find the idea of swallowing his sperm disgusting, do tell him so. I believe there's more to love making than blindly following what's showing in "Deep Throat" And lastly, nope...as far as i know, there's no side effects from swallowing sperm, in moderation that is  :p<br><br>------------------<br>The Far East Pilgrim</div>

It simply means inserting solution/liquid that is not meant for the mouth or stuff like that. There "SHOULD" be no side effects, but many other factors come in hand.<br><br>Eg. Sensitive lips, sensitive tongue surface etc. Issues like your body cannot accept such solution can also result to vomiting and diet disorder. There are too many factors to think about.<br><br>Should you feel that you have been feeling uncomfortable bout this actiovity, tell your bf to give you a litl' respect. If you feel sick, consult a doc and let him noe that you had juz consumed some food which your body rejects (to save your embarrassment).

            <div class='col-md body'>One very important reason to worry about is if there is any cause for INFECTION. If your mouth is not cleaned well after the swallowing, the throat might develop a certain type of FUNGUS or SORES, and they are very dangerous to your health, THE RISKS ARE INCREDIBLY GREAT even though THE ENJOYMENT IS INCREDIBLY GREAT, but I fear that having did this oral sex act for your boyfriend, there might be incredible damage to your psyche, a very harmful thorn in your psyche that could past on to your children.<br><br>If your boyfriend asks you to swallow his penis sperm then set him the condition to drink your own urine. If he dares to do that, YOU ARE IN CONTROL.<br><br>Sorry for being crude. Your boyfriend started it first.<br><br>Regards<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yup I agree with some of u.. It's not unhealthy to swallow sperm, but it sure is disgusting. The stench stinks, can't even believe anyone to taste it. Furthermore, it's from a tool where guys urine from.. Yucks.<br><br>------------------<br>Barely Bearing Berry Belly Bear</div>
