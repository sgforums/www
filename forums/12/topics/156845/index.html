            <div class='col-md body'>Experience comes from poor judgement and well, poor judgement comes from experience. The greatest mistake that one has made is learn nothing out of his mistake. Well, since u ve learn something out of ur situation, stay clear and away from them... to protect urself from getting hurt once again.<br><br>1)Firstly, what makes u feel tat the lady will believe u?<br><br>She may tot tat u r seeking revenge, trying to break them up or exposing him out of jealousy?<br><br>Love is blind at times. She may know u meant well, but may or may not heed ur advice is another thing. Cuz we all ve different point of views.<br><br>2)Secondly, u may tink tat wat u r trying to do is merely to warn her out of concern; cuz u do not want to see another victim following ur footsteps...<br><br>However, the victim might not share the same view as u.<br>She may think 'who r u to interfere in my biz?' Some pple are juz arrogant and it's hard for them to accept the cruel facts.<br><br>3)Lastly, it's always better to learn from our mistakes... if the lady does not learn a lesson from him, she will nv be able to differentiate btw BLACK &amp; WHITE....<br><br>4)Does it make u feel better if u let the lady knows more abt the jerk u have previously? If your ans is YES, u r soughting for revenge...out of anger...i can say, cuz i feel it too!!<br><br>Sometimes, i really felt like calling my HUBBY's married colleague to expose her doings to her MIL.<br><br>Cuz she always calls my HUBBY's at her MIL house.<br><br>How i wish i ve the 'Balls' to expose them and her other flings in office....<br><br>but to recollect, if i have ever done so, i wud ve being the Greatest fool...<br><br>Wat do i gain from that?? If her husband ever finds out... his reactions and emotions has got nothing to do wif me... in the end.. i do not benefit anything out of it.. So i rather swallow my anger and not create more trouble... to protect myself from getting hurt by others.<br><br>Live ur own life now and forget all abt him. U ve to let go........ such guys are juz not our piece of cake, if someone else wants it, let her enjoy it then.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Why Lawyers should never ask a witness a question if they aren't prepared for the worst answer.<br><br>In a trial, a Southern small town prosecuting attorney called his first witness to the stand. The witness was a grand motherly, elderly woman.<br><br>He approached her and asked, "Mrs.Jones, do you know me?"<br><br>She responded, "Why, yes I do know you, Mr. Williams. I've known you since you were a young boy, and frankly, you've been a big disappointment to me. You lie, you cheat on your wife, you manipulate people and talk about them behind their backs. You think you're a big shot when you haven't the brains to realize you never will amount to anything more than a two-bit paper pusher. Yes, I know you."<br><br>The Lawyer was stunned.<br><br>Not knowing what else to do, he pointed across the room and asked, "Mrs. Jones, do you know the defense attorney?"<br><br>She again replied, "Why yes, I do. I've known Mr. Bradley since he was a youngster too. He's lazy, bigoted and he has a drinking problem.  He can't build a normal relationship with anyone and his law practice is one of the worst in the entire state. Not to mention he cheated on his wife with three different women, one of them was your wife. Yes, I know him."<br><br>The defense attorney almost died.<br><br>The judge asked both counsellors to approach the bench and in a very quiet voice, said, "If either of you bastards asks her if she knows me, I'll throw you in jail for contempt."</div>

The witness was a grand motherly, elderly woman.<br><br>He approached her and asked, "Mrs.Jones, do you know me?"<br><br>She responded, "Why, yes I do know you, Mr. Williams. I've known you since you were a young boy, and frankly, you've been a big disappointment to me. You lie, you cheat on your wife, you manipulate people and talk about them behind their backs. You think you're a big shot when you haven't the brains to realize you never will amount to anything more than a two-bit paper pusher. Yes, I know you."<br><br>The Lawyer was stunned.<br><br>Not knowing what else to do, he pointed across the room and asked, "Mrs. Jones, do you know the defense attorney?"<br><br>She again replied, "Why yes, I do. I've known Mr. Bradley since he was a youngster too. He's lazy, bigoted and he has a drinking problem.  He can't build a normal relationship with anyone and his law practice is one of the worst in the entire state. Not to mention he cheated on his wife with three different women, one of them was your wife. Yes, I know him."<br><br>The defense attorney almost died.<br><br>The judge asked both counsellors to approach the bench and in a very quiet voice, said, "If either of you bastards asks her if she knows me, I'll throw you in jail for contempt."</div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It depends how close you are to the female colleague.  If you warned her, you would have to reveal your past relationship with him . Is this a smart move , telling private matters about yourself to a stranger?  If she isn't close to you, she might not believe you anyway and may turn on you.</div>
