You must understand one thing. You're left alone to lick your wound now. She's enjoying the best of both world. That shouldn't be the way in a r'ship, ain't it?<br><br>Move on, without her.</div>

Met her on thursday night at her block downstairs. i waited for ard 1 hr b4 she came home on the bike the guy was riding. we sat down and talked. i ask her wat are  her options. she say she has feelings for both of us and can only make a decision after her exams in march. the best part is she din tell the guy she is attached. as i didn't want it to drag on... we agreed upon being friends.but she did say that she enjoys being with the guy. as for me she din say anything. She goes out with the guy and she smses me to let me noe when she reach hme. I seriously donno wat i shld do? i kinda agreed to withdraw and gave my blessings to both of them. I seriously loved her and had talk about settling down with her. izzit because i am studying and the guy has a stable job? i really don't know but if its over, is she still considering starting over with me or just  treating me as a friend. i don mind being friends. as love cannot be forced... been feeling kinda weird this few days. my friends and parents are kinda shocked to see me in this state. But for me life goes on... haizx<br><br>Pls Advice<br>Thanks</div></blockquote>well,if she can do this to you now meaning that she might do something behind your back in future..so i think its better to let go and bless the both of them~ im sure you can someone else more worth than her thou~</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi icepole,<br><br>I felt much better than last time, I am sure of that, time past fast, reaching 4 months after breakup with my ex. Its definite that she has drifted away from me day by day. Still think abt her at times,nothing much I can do but to encourage myself that the day wil come when I fell in love with another better girl. As what I have mention, this is fate that creates so many events in the r/s that make us part.<br><br>To ninestar, this couple of weeks, you will definitely feel hurt andyou will keep thinking ofthe sweet memories with her, thinking what have you done wrong that make you suffer like hell. Remember, a understanding girl wil never do things like this to you unles you have done something terribly wrong to her.<br><br></div>
