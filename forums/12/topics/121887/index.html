Maybe she does'nt know what she wants, Maybe she is'nt ready for the long time commitment you were hoping for.<br><br>Life has to go on. Try looking at it in a different angle.

All I can say is to move on with your life. It's heartening to see that you are indeed taking the initiative to do so by keeping yourself busy.<br><br>Seriously speaking, she isn't worth all your effort and attention. If in spite of all that you've done for her she runs off with another guy, my advice to you is to say goodbye and good riddance to her and go on with your life. If she can't decide between either you or that guy then that goes to show that she doesn't love you at all.<br><br>Walk away from her and don't look back. Even if she calls out to you, don't look back.... just run as fast as you can. There are many other girls out there more deserving of a fine young man such as you.<br><br>And indeed, you deserve someone far better than that poor-excuse-for-a-girlfriend.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi ninestar,<br><br>what you need is time to gather yourself together and decide whether is she worth it. Sorry, may be offensive to you but your scenario is almost the same as mine but at least she is willing to talk things out with you.<br><br>Unlike me, ganna stabbed multiple times by her new bf.<br><br>What I can advise you is that you need to stable yourself first, think it throughly before making the correct move. I can tell you that at your current situation, emotion may affect your decision.<br><br>I would say that by talking things out with her, since there is an opportunity, you can clarify things out with her throughly. As for me, I dont even have a single chance to talk things out with my ex before ending the r/s.<br><br>Endure this period of pain and soon enough, you will realise that its just another nightmare.</div>

Met her on thursday night at her block downstairs. i waited for ard 1 hr b4 she came home on the bike the guy was riding. we sat down and talked. i ask her wat are  her options. she say she has feelings for both of us and can only make a decision after her exams in march. the best part is she din tell the guy she is attached. as i didn't want it to drag on... we agreed upon being friends.but she did say that she enjoys being with the guy. as for me she din say anything. She goes out with the guy and she smses me to let me noe when she reach hme. I seriously donno wat i shld do? i kinda agreed to withdraw and gave my blessings to both of them. I seriously loved her and had talk about settling down with her. <span style="color: darkred;">izzit because i am studying and the guy has a stable job?</span> i really don't know but if its over, is she still considering starting over with me or just  treating me as a friend. i don mind being friends. as love cannot be forced... been feeling kinda weird this few days. my friends and parents are kinda shocked to see me in this state. But for me life goes on... haizx<br><br>Pls Advice<br>Thanks</div></blockquote>Well, girls will always prefers a guy with a stable career over the one who doesn't have a stable career. The sense of feeling insecure is probably what all girls dreaded the most. Insecurities and Uncertaincies are different. Which girl doesn't want a guy with a stable job/career and income and is also entertaining to her at the same time? Looks in a guy of course counts...must not be disgusting-looking or third-world ugly. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Hmm...do you love her? If yes, why are you giving her up? Don't assumed that you have already lost the war before you actually fought it. If you are going to be such a gentlemen in love, chances are you are going to have this kind of situations repeating itself on you over and over again until you've learnt your lesson. If you seriously love her, what makes you think that the other guy is able to love her more than you?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>In fact, you should be the one having the upper hand in this fight. The reason? Well, she's still your girlfriend right? Make a lot of plans with your girlfriend and spend a lot of time with her so that she won't have time to be swayed by the other guy. Singapore has a lot of a lot of girlfriend stealers...and all of them deserved to be rewarded by being shot/pierced/stabbed/beaten/castrated/decapitated/mutilated/skewed/minced/sodomised/skinned to death.

Lie to her if you have to do so to turn her back, you must not give up...cos if you give up, the other guy is probably planning to cheat her of all her money, rape her and make her his whore and make porn home movies with her and sell it to the entire world online..and after doing all those deeds, he is going to hack away her arms and legs and force her to beg in some outskirt streets of some third-world borderline fourth-world countries for the rest of her remaining life.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>Are you going to allow this to happen?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>So turn her around back to you again if you still love her, be a dirty little man if you have to do so to save her. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Cos once she's back with you, you can always do plenty of community services or good deeds to redeem your soul. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Good luck. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> (Forgive my imagination, not in a good mood today...had an irritating dream last night. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> )<br></div>
