              <p>Hi isaboutme,</p>
              <p>Since you have decided to enter the Business field, there is no harm in trying to apply for a place in the three local universities. Even though the 10th percentile cut-off GPA is higher than your GPA, you can always try to appeal for a place.</p>
              <p>I believe SAF will have introduced you to the e-prep courses. Do have a look at them and take up those related to Business and which interest you.</p>
              <p>Cheers. </p>
