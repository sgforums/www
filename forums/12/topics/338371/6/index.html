              <p><br>Boring part abt this job is : There's basically nothing much to do..I am kinda used to a hectic work schedule from my previous job..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The reason I changed job is cuz of monetary factors (which I regretted)..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>That's why I started this thread to rant on..is like..i can't get any job satisfaction from this current job..nothing for me to look forward to..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>anyway, the problem now is not related to "black face" shown by boss or colleagues or whatsoever..more like..the job is so boring that i am at a loss to how to pass time..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>can save on comments such as "why don't u ask for more work?" or "why don't u try &amp; find more stuff to do?"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>there's simply no more work to do..those old birds can even tell me "actually u can try to do slower..no rush for these stuff" &gt;&gt;&gt; VERY simple terms of telling u that they've got nth much to pass to u if u finished fast..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>anyway..enough rumblings for today again..same thing again..finished my stuff long before lunch time again..being counting down since aft lunch..1 more hr to go =)</p>
