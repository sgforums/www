            <div class='col-md body'>i got a good friend who is 30+ and her bf 20+. she is a divorcee, not very attractive not rich not slim. her bf is handsome, owns a shop, popular with girls. ( wow, Like a dream come true? ) anyway, i learned from other sources that the bf has gone out with another girl ( friend of my friend, pretty ) a few times when he was stilling dating my friend and he confessed that they only kissed and petted during these meetings (under the influence of alcohol, u believe?) my friend believe him and stood by him. For the past one year, he has a few dates from the opp sex who have hinted ( even said in front of my friend when they know she is his gf) that they are interested in him and he has gone for these dates. She is obviously sad when he does that and he always confess what they do, go when he returns, so she usually believes him. Then recently she got to know another girl is interested in him and she dun mind he is attached, pestering him a lot. the girl called him out one night to "settle" their problem and he went out. Next day my friend found a hotel 81 receipt in his wallet... she was stunned but when ask him he say thats where he girl met him at to "settle" the matter, nothing happened... anybody believe? after all these things she still with him cos he loves her and she loves him... case of true love... * clap clap*<br><br>do u think she's stupid?</div>

Love is always mistaken for suffering; in her case, it is likely karmic in nature. Your latter post revealed reason why she didn't want to leave him - no money, no looks, etc and in fact, this is the very fact that speaks much about her current outlook of herself.<br><br>To allow one self to be taken advantage by your partner consciously is <strong>a quality outside love</strong>. Law of love revealed love as our mirror; it reflects exactly the elements that affect us in an mirror image. Like in this case - when she practices selective preception (chose the words her mind accepts and not the whole truth and analysis them) and chose to stick to such rubbish jerk because she knows she will never find someone good looking, rich, etc guy like him. This behavior reflects her inner soul - someone who felt that she could never deserve someone better and even if he had an affair with other woman - it's a 'birthright' and that guy knows her vulnerability and exploit them.<br><br>She stay because she is in love with her fantasy and deeply rooted by her poor love definition. There is no such thing as no time to find another lover - her mind refuse to accept that this man isn't a marriagable man and her past marriage history is likely be similiar. Merely Old lesson returning.<br><br>There is no point having a relationship with this man - She can't marry him because he will NEVER settle and mature anywhere this stage. More suffering if she were to remain and the most important - her torment will be in vain. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nothing will change</span></strong>. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

This is her psychological defense against reality; similar to the way ostrich hides their head in the sand, thinking that its pursuer is gone. Her mind is deluded by selective preception and to prevent psychological reinforement to tell her otherwise, she speaks very little about her relationship.<br><br>This trait also explains much about her inferior structure. <strong>A good relationship flares with pride with you speaks about them.</strong> Those that hush-hush are in fact the ones who have dark problems that they never want to see through.<br><br>She is the perfect victim for such man. Unless she gain wisdom, she will be a terrible victim of karmic love. Trust me, its more than words - to warn her and you probably have your words flowing in-and-out of her ears as quickly. You can try though, if you are her good friend. But seriously, I seen too much of such case.<br><br>P.S: To desire for true love - the very first law depends on who you chose as a partner. Under 9 Nine of Love - It is we, who choses our partner, not the other way around. To chose a partner that cannot bring us to greater heights spiritually, is destructive relationship. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>
