( wow, Like a dream come true? ) anyway, i learned from other sources that the bf has gone out with another girl ( friend of my friend, pretty ) a few times when he was stilling dating my friend and he confessed that they only kissed and petted during these meetings (under the influence of alcohol, u believe?) my friend believe him and stood by him. For the past one year, he has a few dates from the opp sex who have hinted ( even said in front of my friend when they know she is his gf) that they are interested in him and he has gone for these dates. She is obviously sad when he does that and he always confess what they do, go when he returns, so she usually believes him. Then recently she got to know another girl is interested in him and she dun mind he is attached, pestering him a lot. the girl called him out one night to "settle" their problem and he went out. Next day my friend found a hotel 81 receipt in his wallet... she was stunned but when ask him he say thats where he girl met him at to "settle" the matter, nothing happened... anybody believe? after all these things she still with him cos he loves her and she loves him... case of true love... * clap clap*<br><br>do u think she's stupid?</div></blockquote><strong>CHOICE.</strong></div>
