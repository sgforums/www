Why eh, becuase this fella he think he trying to be funny, scold students 'bloody stupid" "dun try to be funny with me" when they do something wrong.

              <p>ya superior that time was clearing in the wrong, by asking you to accept èŽ«é¡»æœ‰ sentence. Apologising to him will send him the signal that he's right and you're wrong, and his being following of orders being justified.</p>
