              <p>well. personally, i won't be willing to take in those crap and instead i will try fighting back. If i can do nothing about it then i quit. That's personal thoughts.</p>
              <p>but on the other hand, most working environment sure got this kind of retarded ppl. to kp you for nth. Therefore might have to adapt with it and let them know you have a limit. either you learn how to "protect" yourself or change job.</p>

              <p>I had this experience too. Once this supervisor accused me of not doing this particular thing when i did it already. It happened again when i was working at another place. Both of them were female supervisor. One was a chao ah lian with multiple knife scars on her wrists. The other was a typically nothing to do pick on you ask you do this do that kind of character. Other then accusing me of stuff i did not do or stuff i did already but said i did not do. The verbal abuse range from my hair which they said was spikey like porcupine or pineapple. Asking why i'm so fair, i never go out in the sun ah.. You look handsome la but you also look like a girl.</p>
              <p>I mean all this personal comments i don't really give a damn. But when they repeat it almost everyday it gets on my nerves. The thing i can't stand is being accused of something i did not do. And i defended myself but later she kept on insisting i didn't do it. Now i look back on those days spent working there. I feel kinda unhappy with myself that i didn't become angry and kick up a big fuss. I hate to make a big scene but sometimes when you don't stand up for yourself you lose something inside of you. It called pride. As a person, how do you feel good about yourself if you let people trample on your pride. And who will respect you when you let people step all over you.</p>
              <p>Decide for yourself if you want to continue or quit the job. Just don't put up with this shit from anyone.</p>

              <p>You have to learn how to stand up to these people. You have to use your judgment, sometimes you can use direct confrontation or speak behind their backs so that they know you are a lobbyist and you are not a pushover. But be careful about direct confrontation, make sure it doesn't go excessive because you must remember you r not in cowboy town.</p>
              <p>The majority malaysian race (which I will not mention), they like to use snubbing politics against the minority to push you around. Like purposely greeting others except you, speak to you sarcastically when you need to request information, inviting others but not you or offer to switch off something to other people but don't ask you when they know you need to use it. So I always am direct and I will not hesitate to scold those who use snubbing politics or rude to me.</p>

              <p>In most cases, it's always good to keep your cool. Retort back in a logical and almost unemotional manner. If you think you don't deserve this shit, then speak to your superior's superior and highlight the problem. If good, ask for transfer. If no good, then just look for greener pastures. No big deal cos every human being deserves better.</p>

              <p>msian malays are the reasons for their own downfall. Even their own leaders deem it fit to spend billions on extravagance like the petronas towers and space tourist project, what more their people.</p>
              <p>In most cases, it's always good to keep your cool. Retort back in a logical and almost unemotional manner. If you think you don't deserve this shit, then speak to your superior's superior and highlight the problem. If good, ask for transfer. If no good, then just look for greener pastures. No big deal cos every human being deserves better.</p>

              <p><br>Actually not all the majority race is enjoying the perks. Many are still at the border of poverty. From the papers it is estimated 40% of them earn below SGD600 a month. However they still stubbornly hold on to their "perks" or what little of it while the elite of the majority who have political connections are super duper rich from their economic policy. That day I drove pass one of their house, a mansion, many acres wide, he even have his own horse stable.</p>
              <p>Sometimes it is timing. I am sorry to say that greenier pastures don't come so easily. We need to hold on for a while until it is the right time. If we quit now, the abuser wins. If the supervisor is cruel then we need to lobby, go and talk behind them to others. When you go out with your friends for yam cha, you can even speak badly and spread bad reputation about the supervisor. The world is small, one day somebody who heard you will come across your supervisor.</p>

              <p>I had this experience too. Once this supervisor accused me of not doing this particular thing when i did it already. It happened again when i was working at another place. Both of them were female supervisor. One was a chao ah lian with multiple knife scars on her wrists. The other was a typically nothing to do pick on you ask you do this do that kind of character. Other then accusing me of stuff i did not do or stuff i did already but said i did not do. The verbal abuse range from my hair which they said was spikey like porcupine or pineapple. Asking why i'm so fair, i never go out in the sun ah.. You look handsome la but you also look like a girl.</p>
              <p>I mean all this personal comments i don't really give a damn. But when they repeat it almost everyday it gets on my nerves. The thing i can't stand is being accused of something i did not do. And i defended myself but later she kept on insisting i didn't do it. Now i look back on those days spent working there. I feel kinda unhappy with myself that i didn't become angry and kick up a big fuss. I hate to make a big scene but sometimes when you don't stand up for yourself you lose something inside of you. It called pride. As a person, how do you feel good about yourself if you let people trample on your pride. And who will respect you when you let people step all over you.</p>
              <p>Decide for yourself if you want to continue or quit the job. Just don't put up with this shit from anyone.</p>

              <p>in the short term you earn some money, but in the long term it is not good to live under verbal abuse constantly.  you feel bad about yourself because of stupid selfish cruel folks like these and gradually you form a poor self-image.   </p>

              <p>Yeah that right. Well you see, their hair was normal pony tail for girls or short hair. And for guys it those slope or short hair. I was the odd one out ma with spikey hair. Can say all the people there old fashion that why not used to a young punk like me. I don't have a poor self image because i know where i stand. I know what kind of people they are therefore i don't bother myself with their comments. Anyway the supervisor that is not the chao ah lian is a malaysian. Maybe the ah lian supervisor might be also. I have nothing again malaysian. I kinda like them sometimes cuz they are more friendly. But sometimes they are just so petty minded when they are working. Selfish like they only care about themselves. Maybe that why people hate to work with them. </p>
