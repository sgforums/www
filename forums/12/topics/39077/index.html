            <div class='col-md body'>frankly speaking, i think that she is not interested in going out alone with you but she rather prefer to go out in a group. why not organise group outings instead of 1 to 1 outing with her? Maybe she don't feel really comfortable going out alone with guys? And how many times had she rejected you? she could be really busy with her stuff and she might not be avoiding you..</div>
