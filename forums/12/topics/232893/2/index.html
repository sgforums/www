If it's just one of fling, it's no big deal, still can be friends. But if it was serious, and losing that person can be very painful. Some people are meant to be friends, others bf/gf.<br><br>Even till today, 6 yrs later, I haven't been able to get involved in a relationship with a girl again. I'm wary of committment issues, and haven't been able to find a girl I can really relate to.</div></blockquote>ya.. at least u can understand.. it like if i didn;t do such extreme, drop all connections with him, i will nv forget him.. and i cun go on life like that..that is my way of doing things. fres say i heartless. but i really have no choice cos i really nid to move on..</div>
