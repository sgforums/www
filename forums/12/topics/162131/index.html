Not after a few years of time. The term "friends" is just at the tip of the tongue, as if to provide comfort, and presumely make the impact of the breakup abit lighter to take?

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear OhYeah,<br><br>Perhaps you may want to ask yourself why you are so intent on returning the things to him.  If it hurts you to keep them, how do you think it'll make him feel if they're returned to him?  Wouldn't it be selfish to hurt him?  You could always keep them in a place you won't see them, or throw them away, right?  Unless, of course, he asked for those things back, which you didn't state whether he did or Not.<br><br>Moreover, both of you have just broken off for 2 months.  My guess is that he wants to give you time to get over him, &amp; get over the breakup.  From the way you've posted in previous threads, you can't seem to get over him yet.  He's being considerate towards your feelings by Not wanting to bring you further pain.  In this aspect, I can't blame him for acting the way he does.<br><br>He may be busy, or he may be avoiding you intentionally.  Rather than trying to guess his actions, perhaps you could ask him directly, since you're still in contact with him?  Either way, he isn't to blame.  Give yourself time to get over the hurt, the pain is obviously still very raw &amp; recent to you.  When you've moved on from this hurtful chapter, perhaps he'll be more prepared to see you.<br><br>FeowFeow<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by -ohyeah-:</div><div class="quote_body">ask him for a movie, wan to return his personal thing - he said he was busy<br>told him wan to give his birthday present and met him at a place at a specified time - he said he couldnt make it as he was buying for his army stuff.<br><br>he didnt want to see me or plain busy?<br><br>i just wan to see him one more time... y is it so difficult?</div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Another possibility is this: She wants to see whether returning the things would hurt him.  If it hurts him, then she can take it that he still has feelings for her, i.e. "Why would he bother to feel hurt unless he still had some feelings for me?  There's still hope!"<br><br>But of course, the above can denied even if the person acknowledges the truth deep down.<br><br>Either way, there should be time given for both parties to get over the split  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>FeowFeow<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by alfagal:<br><strong>[b]he was ur ex, u shld know him better</strong>..if tis type of response is wat u get still after awhile, then u know his intention<br><br>y do u wanna return e things to him? did he asked for it? if not, i dun see e point in returning to him unless he asks for it..(or u are taking tis as an excuse to see him?)<br><br>seems like u cant let go of him..well, time will heal....<br><br>if he really doesnt mind being friends w u, he wld still ask u out for a movie etc...u wont needa initiate all e time...<br>[/b]</blockquote></div>
