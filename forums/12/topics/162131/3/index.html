The funny thing was, everybody thinks he's a great guy, so nice, so sincere, so gentlemanly, yadda yadda yadda.  I used to think that about him when we were just friends too.  Then we got involved  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>Anyway, that's water under the bridge now that I've found someone who makes me waaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyy happier <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  And I enjoyed my single days too!

            <div class='col-md body'>hey, iam kinda in the same boat as u too man, i guess if u still love him, show him tht u love him enuff by letting him go, be happy as long as he is, its hard but u gotta move on, u cant really sae tht u guys wanna b frens if u trully feel tht wen u mt him, u still have feelings for him and wanna be more than tht. ask urself whether u guys meeting is jus an excuse to see him. hang in there, the cliche is true, time heal all wounds.<br><br>take cre, god bless<br><br></div>
