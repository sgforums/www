            <div class='col-md body'>can i ask you guys a question?? if you hated somebody as in really hated the person, would you use his religious conviction as a factor if you wanted to express your feelings towardd either him/her?? i want to hear your views on that. But before that, I would like to highlight a certain blog which was forwarded to me by a friend recently which shows you just how far someone would go in order to criticize someone else. this person branded and labeled the person as satan and called others his disciples...i for one thought that this was unjust and i want to hear your views on it. This is the link and this is the post.<br><br>http://ericxxz.livejournal.com/<br><br>[Jun. 13th, 2007|09:01 pm]<br><br>It's fun today!!<br>Let's hang out soon!!~<br>*It's alwayas good to hang out with my besties because we can forget about our image~<br>Remember, we are the cam-whore group! Hahas!~ =D<br><br>Now......<br>Who is the most faithful of all when going to church and listen to sermon?<br><br>Well....<br>Not the pastor.<br>Not the church workers.<br>Not the Cell Group Leaders.<br>Not the ministries workers.<br>Not the members.<br>Not the friends...<br><br>It is the Satan!~ =D<br>Because satan trying every mean to hear the gospel and to break it which is why the satan went for service to listen the sermon faifthfully. Even more faithful than the rest mentioned above. Hahas. Apart from my friends, I'm glad to have satan's disciples reading my blog because it goes to show that my entry did have some impact on it which is whch why they are so desperately making comments the moment I post an entry. Hahas! I'm honoured by that. Please continue to read and enjoy your stay here. =D<br><br>Life is great when you have the right friends and family!!<br>My life is simply great!~ =D<br>Link	Something to say?<br><br>[Jun. 13th, 2007|08:52 am]<br>It's always fun to see people writing about someone saying things which are not true at all. Really brighten my day especially after a long tiring day from study and work. Hahas~ Which is why until now I didn't really take any action to stop that moron from writing his fairy tales. Lols! I can't wait to see the next post from the moron. Meanwhile, if you have any doubts to clear from me; Instead of hearing from some moron's story claiming to have evidence of me boycotting the rest about some incidents, why don't you come forward and ask me? I won't eat you up at all. You should know my characters. Just drop me an email or call up my hp and ask. That would be much better rather than to hear one side of the story. Deeply appreciated. =D<br><br>*No name posted because I don't wanna hurt anyone in public. You clearly know who you are*<br><br>To think the person is disciple of Christ. Hahas! Just by saying how much you love God will not make a path for you to go heaven. Actions pretty much deteremined whether you can able to account to Him the next time you see God. Imagine when you dies and meet the Lord.<br><br>God: "Hi, my son. What have you done?"<br>Soul: "Oh God. I love you so much. More than anyone else and anything on earth!"<br>Soul: "But before that, can I pray to you to curse that person whom I hate alot!"<br>Soul: "May he die in a horrible death!"<br>Soul: "Let him not able to meet you oh Lord"<br>Soul: "Oh Lord, all my life I'm trying to harm him but I failed Lord"<br>Soul: "So now can you help me to curse him?"<br>God: "Well son.. Before you could even think of going into the kingdom of Heaven"<br>God: "I'm afriad you won't be seeing me any longer."<br>Soul: "Oh why Lord? I love you alot! Why forsaken me?!"<br>God: "Because your heart goes for Satan and not me"<br>God: "Words alone don't determine much. It's all about the actions you had done on earth"<br>God: "Since you choose to act like satan, you go like satan and burn in hell for the rest of your life"<br><br>I'm afriad I can't pull you up. Because we are so way apart. You are so way deep down and on going.

            <div class='col-md body'>There is a certain truth in "that person's" saying that Satan attends church. In fact  Satan always tries to infiltrates all religions all the time. This is the eons-old battle of the good vs evil. I think the Christians recognised this a long time ago and have done a good job in countering Satan's influence. So have other religions who have remained steadfast to their doctrine of peace and love, except one which seemed to be failing in the battle against evil.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i do agree with u to some extent. however, lets face it, using religious virtues as a means of criticizing someone else isnt a means through which any desirable outcome can be attained. it only breeds more hatred towards this persons religion from others who view this for let me point out that this person is neither god nor the pope to decree others as satans. while christians around the world might abhor this act, this one person is contradicting them. no human from any religion is perfect and as such i believe that what this person said was indeed wrong and in fact dangerous too...</div>
