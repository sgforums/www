              <p>I am a victim of BGR betrayal. This is what happened:</p>
              <p>I liked a girl since I was in Secondary 2 (Now going Secondary 4). She is someone who will fall in love easily as long as her admirer treated her well. {However, no matter how well I treated her, she doesn't like me! =( } This happened just recently and she became someone who I hated the most. I had another best friend, name her as Girl B, who had secretly admiring a boy, who was my best friend, in my class for about a year. This girl, let me name her as Girl A, tried to help Girl B to make them from acquaintance to become couple. But then instead Girl A fell in love with my best friend. At first I was not angry as I thought that it was a joke or something to disturb Girl B. But it was true. Plus Girl A is the best friend of Girl B. I talked to Girl A about it, using some kind of coarse language [I know my mistake...&gt;&lt;] and her reply was to discuss with my best friend. Girl B wanted to just let the matter rest but I couldn't see her suffer just like that as I am her best friend too. I was exasperated and told Girl A that I hated her. How can this kind of thing be done? It is very, what I normally call as, 'Bas*ard'. Hmmm...should I forget about the matter and forgive them??? Can someone tell me an answer? I blocked them in MSN too.</p>

              <p>You hate A ish because she choose someone else over you.</p>
              <p>You should feel berri lucky A is not with you. This kind of flaky gal , is trouble.</p>
              <p>Girl B also unlucky lah.. she trusted the wrong friend. But since B  wants to move on, give her the support lor. I'm sure there's better guys out there worth her love.</p>
              <p>No need to show your hostility on FB or MSN lah.. when you do that.. it just makes you a petty person ...simply wish them LASTING happiness, they truly deserve each other.</p>

              I was exasperated and told Girl A that I hated her. How can this
              kind of thing be done? It is very, what I normally call as,
              'Bas*ard'. Hmmm...should I forget about the matter and forgive
              them??? Can someone tell me an answer? I blocked them in MSN
              too.</p>

              <p>Hi Drakonaut,</p>
              <p>Please do pardon me for saying so, but you don't seem like a very nice person. To use coarse language along with hurtful words speak a lot of your character. Even though you are unhappy about Girl A's actions and the fact that she is not interested in you no matter what you do, you shouldn't have gone to such an extent.  </p>
              <p>Even if you can forgive Girl A, it is unlikely that either of the girls can forgive you. Your words and actions towards Girl A, despite the pleadings of Girl B to just leave things be, will probably have resulted in some frictions between the two of them. This will in turn only cause the two of them to dislike you.</p>
              <p>It is no surprise that the two of them are treating you only as an acquaintance now. As Acid has suggested, the only thing left for you to do is to move on. </p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

              <p>Hi Drakonaut,</p>
              <p>In the past, you feel awkward talking to her because you harbour feelings for her, and is shy about it. Your uneasiness stems from the worry that she may distance herself from you if you were to say something wrong.</p>
              <p>In the present, you feel awkward talking to her because of your own actions, and you feel guilty about it. Your uneasiness has its roots in your worry that she may turn against you any time and label you as an "enemy".</p>
