In this case, duties and responsibilites with matters of the heart.<br><br>I guess it is clear enough after the rejection that she has no interest in you. You said you would only want to be her best friend and you woud learn to let go when the somebody else better for her comes along. I respect that a lot, but you have to understand that - relationships are two-way. Be it a friendship or a love affair.<br><br>Take a step back; your aggression only serve to annoy her. If she feels unwilling to even text you, you can't really do anything about it.<br><br>Focus on the tasks that require your immediate attention.

            <div class='col-md body'>Welcome to AA! Indeed, I like reading this forum because it does teach us about the different perspectives of life. Glad to hear you've enjoyed the same.<br>-----<br><br>I've gone through the same thing as you. Feeling tired, yet unable to let go. Just when you're about to let go, suddenly she does something, that gives you hope again.<br><br>This is a classic example of a passive lover. Just contented staying by her side. But why do so, when it torments you? And maybe her as well?<br><br>She made her stance clear. She doesn't consider you her type.<br><br>Why desperately try to hold on? What are you holding on to?<br><br>The closure you're seeking, the closure to this whole affair, can only be found in yourself. Waiting for her to conclude the whole thing, will only bring you even more pain than it already did.<br><br>She is but a temporary actor in your life stage.

You said you are tired, but you can't stop - that's an oxymoron.<br><br>Truth is that you reject the impossible notion and clung on like a furtive shadow, praying that somehow, miracles may happen and transform that lurking shadow into a man of flesh and blood one day.<br><br>Will that day ever happen? That's pretty much idealistic.<br><br>This woman may view you as a good friend, but romantically, it's way out of question. Being nice and all that stuff are great, but sometimes, it's more than just being a doormat in love. Of course, it may be noble to make claims as such in your last paragraph, but only time can tell if this will carry through. So many 'good guys' grew disillusioned, once believed in similar mindset, only to realized that they being 'good' is but a facade.<br><br>An aimless wait is probably one of the most depressing thingy ever. I say strike out and forge your own destiny in love. You are probably better off with someone who can and knows how to appreciate you as a whole - find her.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>
