It's natural for people to feel pain when they lose a good friend or lover. Stay strong now and soon time will wash off everythings.<br><br>Probably she feel that you are pressing onto her. Perhaps it is time to let go of her. When i say let go of her meaning letting go of the pre-concepts that she can be urs when she wasn't urs in the first place.<br><br>I think you should back off abit and respect her right, perhaps two of u can still be best friend if not...<br><br></div>
