But need paycheck to pay for school fees and other expense so need to consider b4 take the plunge. ( no sponsership frm parents and also need to suppement household expense)<br><br>Plan to procede to either car sales, biomedical related field( which is wat i am studying now) or open a own business. So how's the prospectus of the various field?<br><br>Had seen that biomedical is very limited and mostly are looking for reseacher and things like that. was also thinking was this degree going to really worth it?<br><br>Any advise for above situation?<br>thanks.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If you are still studying, I would advise you not to change your job.<br><br>Firstly, you need the paycheck.<br>Secondly, sometimes, a new job may be overwhelming that you will find it hard to get used to it, and thus, your studies will suffer as a result of it.<br><br>However, if you can find another job with a higher pay and less responsibilities than your current job, by all means and change it.<br><br>I guess the last thing that you would want to happen to you is that your new paycheck cant compared to your current one and you have additional responsibilities which will make your studies suffer.<br><br>Cheers.</div>
