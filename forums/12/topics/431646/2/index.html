              <p>When guy go steady with gf or get married, please dun go, for single is of course no problem. For me, I alway encourage those married uncles to go home be with wife or ask them to drink at the counter with no gals, only pools and darts and some soft music. Most local pubs and disco got option for different guest, unfortunately for thai disco, no option, once go in, is hip hop, thai dancing stage, drinks, money and lots of gals prowling after your second drink.</p>

              <p>Similarly on that you can't resist your temptation of feeling uncomfortable.
