              <p>Not good to go to those places.....</p>
              <p>If your boyfriend says he is just accompanying his friends........to me that is a lame excuse .....he can just say he doesnt wanna go (honestly and openly) or if he wanna be more indirect, there are dozens of excuses he can use (he is tired, he wanna do other things, he wanna accompany you, etc)..nobody force him.....</p>
              <p>By the way I think you need to pay attention to his "friends" because they can be a negative influence to him.</p>
              <p>Well I think you need to have a talk with him and convey to him your concerns......but I understand your ambivalence.....some young guys just dont see the bigger picture and they get angry if they think they are being restricted or controlled.....I dont know how to do it but you need to keep this in mind.</p>

              <p>In thai disco, as a warning, do not call for jug of beer, they go by, if you order two jugs, one jug will be free, and mostly will be thai brand singha. For a few guys, 3 jugs is not problem, but somehow, in thai disco, you get drunk pretty fast and feel very happy with gals and splash your money here and there, the beers are spiked.</p>
              <p>ensure you call bottles open in front of you, go tell yr bf. And please dun listen to yr bf silly accuses about the need to follow frens, if he really do not want to go, he can do so, he has the option and choice, and it will be good choice if he do not follow them, Good frens dun ask ask a guy who got gf to go thai disco, basically, you are stupid and fooled by yr bf, it is he himself that love to go.</p>
