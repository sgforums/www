            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all,<br><br>I've been having a crush on a girl in my office for about 3 months. She's around my age and she's a gentle and pretty girl with no apparent boyfriend. I've been a bit shy and have kept to being her friend.<br><br>However, in these few weeks, I've been more pro-active and trying to get close to her by talking to her more often and taking every chance to hang out with her. When I try to ask her out recently, she says she's busy with something important for these few days. When I tell her I'll ask again next time, she just smiles. Recently, we are both busy at work and I'm having less and less chance to see her and talk to her.<br><br>I have her handphone number but I'm afraid to call her as I don't want her to think that I'm some weird fellow or something. I really like this girl and I think she could be the one for me.<br><br>So what should I do next? Do I ask her out again? Do I tell her what I feel? I'm afraid that she's not interested in me and she's just too nice to say it to me.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think it's not advisable to approach her.<br><br>She is just working there.<br><br>She is just being nice to you, and I believe she might feel harassed/ disturbed if you try to approach her.<br><br>If you really want to approach her, you have to do it really slowly. 3 months is too short, not enough time.<br><br>Also you must not read wrongly. Sometimes politeness or niceties are easily misinterpreted as sign of being interested.<br><br>Dont get overly friendly with her. Just be moderately friendly, and wait and see if she is showing any improvement on her friendliness level. If she does not show any improvement for a few months, that means she likes to keep her work professional, or that she does not like you in a special way.<br><br>It is important that you do not make any mistakes and do not look stupid. Remember what uncle say. Do not listen to others opinion who are gung-ho. You can be gung-ho on many things but not on approaching a female co-worker.<br><br>Remember.<br><br>Uncle Meat Pao.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by opto:</div><div class="quote_body">Hi all,<br><br>I've been having a crush on a girl in my office for about 3 months. She's around my age and she's a gentle and pretty girl with no apparent boyfriend. I've been a bit shy and have kept to being her friend.<br><br>However, in these few weeks, I've been more pro-active and trying to get close to her by talking to her more often and taking every chance to hang out with her. When I try to ask her out recently, she says she's busy with something important for these few days. When I tell her I'll ask again next time, she just smiles. Recently, we are both busy at work and I'm having less and less chance to see her and talk to her.<br><br>I have her handphone number but I'm afraid to call her as I don't want her to think that I'm some weird fellow or something. I really like this girl and I think she could be the one for me.<br><br>So what should I do next? Do I ask her out again? Do I tell her what I feel? I'm afraid that she's not interested in me and she's just too nice to say it to me.</div></blockquote>In my experience.. if a gal likes you... you will be able to sense it... there is a chance she might be interested but find going out with a colleague awkward...<br><br>but from what you describe, i think you should just give up. there are many gals out there.....<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What does it mean when you ask a girl out... and she replies with a smile?<br><br>1)  She's too shy to say "yes"<br><br>2)  She thinks you're funny and don't want to say an out right "no"<br><br>3)  She's up for the game, but your programme is just not her cup of tea<br><br>Of the three, I'd think she doesn't know how to say "No"... afraid that it will affect the working relationship...<br><br>I'd suggest you sniff out her actual status... are you absolutely sure she's single?  For all you know, she might be engaged and her boyfriend is overseas right now...<br><br>BTW... are you very sure you want to get involve with someone in the same company?
