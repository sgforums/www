            <div class='col-md body'>A little long, but worth reading.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>10th Grade<br><br>As I sat there in English class, I stared at the girl next to me.<br>She was my so-called "best friend". I stared at her long, silky<br>hair. I wished she were mine, but she didn't notice me like that.<br>And I knew it. After class she walked up to me and asked me for<br>the notes she had missed the day before, and I handed them to her.<br><br>She said "thanks" and gave me a kiss on the cheek. I wanted to<br>tell her. I wanted her to know that I don't want to be just<br>friends. I love her, but I'm just too shy. And I don't know why.<br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>11th Grade<br><br>The phone rang. It was her on the other end. She was in tears,<br>mumbling on and on about how her love had broke her heart.<br>She asked me to come over because she didn't want to be alone,so I did.<br><br>As I sat next to her on the sofa, I stared at her soft eyes,<br>wishing she was mine. After 2 hours, a Drew Barrymore movie,<br>and three bags of chips, she decided to go to sleep. She looked at me,<br>said "thanks," and gave me a kiss on the cheek.  I want to tell<br>her. I want her to know that I don't want to be just friends.  I<br>love her, but I'm just too shy. And I don't know why.<br><br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>12th Grade<br><br>The day before prom she walked to my locker. "My date is sick,"<br>she said. He's not going to go. Well, I didn't have a date and in<br>7th grade we made a promise that if neither of us had dates we<br>would go together  just as "best friends," so we did.<br><br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Prom night<br><br>after everything was over I was standing at her front door<br>step. I stared at her. She smiled at me and stared at me with her crystal<br>eyes. I want her to be mine, but she doesn't think of me like<br>that, and I know it. Then she said, "I had the best time, thanks!"<br>and gave me a kiss on the cheek. I want to tell her. I want her to<br>know that I don't want to be just friends. I love her, but I'm<br>just too shy. And I don't know why...<br><br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Graduation Day<br><br>A day passed. A week passed. A month passed. Before I<br>could blink, it was graduation day. I watched as her<br>perfect body floated like an angel up on stage to get her diploma.<br>I wanted her to be mine,<br>but she didn't notice me like that, and I knew it. Before everyone<br>went home, she came to me in her smock and hat, and she cried<br>as I hugged her. Then, she lifted her head from my shoulder and<br>said, "You're my best friend, thanks!" and gave me a kiss on the<br>cheek. I want to tell her. I want her to know that I don't want to be<br>just friends. I love her, but I'm just too shy. And I don't know why.<br><br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>A Few Years Later<br><br>Now, I sit in the pews of the church. She is getting married, now.<br>I watched her say, "I do" and drive off to her new life, married<br>to another man. I wanted her to be mine but she didn't see me<br>like that, and I knew it. But before she drove away, she came to<br>me and said, "You came!" She said, "thanks!" and kissed me on the<br>cheek. I want to tell her. I want her to know that I don't want to<br>be just friends. I love her, but I'm just too shy. And I don't know why...<br><br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Funeral<br><br>Years passed, and I looked down at the coffin of the girl who<br>used to be my best friend." At the service they read a diary entry<br>she had wrote in her high school years. This is what<br>it read: I stare at him wishing he were mine. But he doesn't notice me<br>like that, and I know it. I want to tell him. I want him to know that<br>I don't want to be just friends. I love him, but I'm just too shy,<br>and I don't know why. I wish he would tell me he loved me.<br><br>what if this happened to you?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by opto:</div><div class="quote_body">Hi all,<br><br>I've been having a crush on a girl in my office for about 3 months. She's around my age and she's a gentle and pretty girl with no apparent boyfriend. I've been a bit shy and have kept to being her friend.<br><br>However, in these few weeks, I've been more pro-active and trying to get close to her by talking to her more often and taking every chance to hang out with her. When I try to ask her out recently, she says she's busy with something important for these few days. When I tell her I'll ask again next time, she just smiles. Recently, we are both busy at work and I'm having less and less chance to see her and talk to her.<br><br>I have her handphone number but I'm afraid to call her as I don't want her to think that I'm some weird fellow or something. I really like this girl and I think she could be the one for me.<br><br>So what should I do next? Do I ask her out again? Do I tell her what I feel? I'm afraid that she's not interested in me and she's just too nice to say it to me.</div></blockquote>office romance can be very touchy...<br>think about all the criticisms you're going to face from your colleagues etc.<br>how is your boss going to react? can you assure them that its not going to affect the overall productivity?<br>this is nooo good....</div>
