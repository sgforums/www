He is not bothering you now, so that's good. However, if your friend is being annoyed by him, then it is up to his own discretion to avoid him. If you see properly, it's two separate issues. The 'bothering on you' is gone, it has shifted to else-where. And the truth is, it's easier for your friend to avoid, get annoyed or even scold the hell out of him because he is not exactly involved in this one-sided affair.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>
