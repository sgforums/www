            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by VivId CrItiQuE:</div><div class="quote_body">thank u for agreeing that disparity exists in the pte sector, regardless to wad extent, disparity is still present, i can save my effort from further argument den.<br><br>grades aren't the most impt factor, but they are one of the most impt factors, otherwise y even haf grades? a pass/fail will do.<br><br></div></blockquote>Disparity exists in all walks of life to begin with. The truth is (just ask any HR manager if you need any confirmation) oftentimes there're many "intangible" (things not as clearly defined as "first class" being the best honours classification) factors considered in the selection process which cannot be quantified in a definite manner (some of these issues would be things like your performance during an interview or comparing two candidates with degrees from different institutions or even the referees you have - of course, the importance attached to the various aspect varies from firm to firm and interviewer to interviewer).<br><br>If everything were as simple as you made it out to be, why do firms even bother with interviews? We could well do without them and simply pick on the basis of whatever information we've from your resume, couldn't we?<br><br>At the end of the day, it probably explains why you don't get a rigid payscale (at least, not one known to everyone) for firms in the private sector that pegs your pay directly to your degree the way you have for the civil service (and some statutory boards) where they tell you explicitly how much your starting pay is depending on your qualifications. Like I've said all along, the recruitment process for the private sector and the civil service is worlds apart and your mindset certainly prepares you <strong>very well</strong> towards getting a headstart in the civil service.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by VivId CrItiQuE:</div><div class="quote_body">since u haf conducted several interviews, haf u done sifting of resumes as well? can u kindly enlighten us, when 1000 resumes come in, how do u select those given a chance for interview?</div></blockquote>You may wish to know there're quite a number of MNC's whose employment process would extend to include you filling up a questionaire-like form that basically asks for information on why you want a career with the particular firm in question.<br><br>For the record, many firms deploying this method regards this as an important process to ensure those applying are really keen to pursue a career with them and are not viewing it as just another job. In truth, I've seen countless cases where people you'd regard as having inferior academic qualifications actually being shortlisted for interviews instead of the better qualified ones.<br><br>If you're attending a local tertiary institution(I know this for a fact because I've been involved in a few seminars myself), you might want to attend some recruitment seminars/talks conducted by some of the MNC's at your school and try to quiz their HR representatives (do make full use of the time you have with them after the talk to interact if you have an interest in the company!) at these talks for more details(provided they're willing to divluge) on the selection process.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Having seen how peers with 2nd upper and 2nd lower, even 3rd class honours, land prestigious jobs with MNCs, I am certain that the emphasis on grades is overrated.<br><br>I have friends who, despite graduating with 1st class honours, cannot hold conversations decently with strangers to save their lives. Needless to say, they ended up with lower-paying graduate jobs.<br><br>However, I would point out that your honours grade is to a certain extent, indicative of your work ethic. If you are a sloth who skips lectures and ends up with a third class, you are going to get fired even if you get recruited by established firms.<br><br>Hopefully, you will find a job that interests you.

            <div class='col-md body'>Good results are in no way a fair indicator of a person's working capabilities. Nonetheless, without good results, people are likely to be denied opportunities before they are able to prove their worth.<br><br>A 1st class honour degree is a key to the first door, but beyond, you're on your own.<br><br>A pass degree won't unlock that first door. While you may eventually find a way to get around it, you will be lagging behind the honour degree holder who's not beneath you in capabilities. And time, is a very important asset.<br><br>While an honour degree is hardly an all-powerful piece of paper, it certainly has its merits. I scoff at people (and such people are normally those who fail to excel academically) who criticize our government's emphasis in education. When one starts to blame everything else but oneself when things aren't smooth, one's en route to failure.</div>
