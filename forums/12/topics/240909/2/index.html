            <div class='col-md body'>i dun believe that grades matters a lot in ur career planning. yes, it do give u an edge if u have a 2nd upper degree rather than a lower. but it will not get u anywhere if u show no interest in the job u do. comparatively, if a 2nd lower work hard, shown enthusiaism in his/her work, his/hers promotion is on the way. this is the fact of life. there are few 1st class honours out there wondering why after so many years they cant get promotoed.<br><br>u have to study smart, forcing urself to study and study will head u no where. understand the concept and apply it on the right stuff. jus simply based on memory will jus give u a few hour energy, after that, u wun be able to remember whatever u have learnt.<br><br>biz admin is not a dead subj. unlike engineering, unless u are in research area, then u may find new stuff while u r working on a project. however, mainly the formulae are dead. for example, speed = distant over time. can u change this formulae? but biz ad is a very live subj, it depends on how u perceive and turn the topics. of course u must be giving a relevant answer. u may see this in one way while another person in another way. but if both of ur statements make sense, then both of u can be correct.<br><br>so.... try to study the main concept wisely. read up a lot and see how different corporation handle their business. once u found the key to the topic, then u will be able to diversify from there, without even the need to remember from your text. this is activity based learning. i believe u will be able to absorb more than the conventional memorisation.<br><br>so dun put urself into too much stress. be relax and plan ur time management properly. i m very sure u will be able to do well and push up ur grades. but remember class of honours isnt anything. ur work attitude is the one determine how far u will go.....<br><br>=p</div>

Their motto is "Moulding the future".<br><br>Moulding, means that u use raw materials ( ppl in this case) and create them into a specific shape ( wad the mainstream ppl wants), thereby, discaring the excess( the lousy and not up to standard).<br>Our society (Sillypore) has drilled in the thinking that grades are impt. Of coz, i would like to go against this but when 98% of the ppl arnd u are striving for good grades, u'll conform to it sooner or later.<br><br>That's why, i can always only admire from afar ppl who choose to pursue their dreams ( my dance teacher) coz they haf the courage to step outta society norms.<br><br>US culture is different from us. They onli study during weekdays and party hard during weekends. If we do tt over here, our parents will nag.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by VivId CrItiQuE:</div><div class="quote_body">firstly, ur were wrong, i said that grades isn't everything. hope u read properly before replying.<br><br>may i ask wad gave u the opportunity to study in a top college in US? either u r a scholar (which contradicts ur point that grades ain't impt), or u grew up wif a silver spoon and do not realli noe the realities of life.<br><br>if a first class honours isn't impt, y would so many universities around the world use such a ranking system? if it wasn't impt, y would so many companies set their minimum requirement for application as gd honours? for ur info, not onli the GLCs demands gd honours, most of the established banks require the same.<br><br></div></blockquote>It's obviously you who haven't read my point before replying. Firstly, do go over what you've quoted from me to begin with - I <strong>agreed</strong> with you as far as the civil service(and its statutory boards which extend to include your GLC's) goes, but that's hardly what the corporate world(on a global scale) is like! Of course, if you see your long term future with the civil service (or a statutory board) in Singapore, mug hard for your first class honours then - I'm sure it'll come in very handy for folks like you.<br><br>And what has the system adopted by varsities worldwide got to do with attaching the degree of importance to a particular degree? By the same token, an honours is a step above bachelor's; a masters is a step above honours(whatever class it may be) and a PhD is a step above masters. It's just a rank in an overall scheme of things - if you regard that "status" to be so important, why stop at first class honours? Why don't you aim for a PhD or even a post-doctorate?<br><br>More importantly, what gives you the impression only scholars and people born into an incredibly privileged background will get a chance to attend the top colleges in the US?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> If you genuinely believe that to be the case, then curse your luck for not being born smart/rich enough to attend one.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by VivId CrItiQuE:</div><div class="quote_body">its true that there r some 1st class honours grads who do worse than those without a 1st class, but y don't u say those r the minorities? its a fact that 1st class grads r earning more, u can't deny tt fact.<br><br>its true tt alot of CEOs r not 1st class grads, but may i ask u, among those grads who did not obtain a gd honours and did not become a CEO, r they more successful than their 1st class peers?<br><br>lets face it, if a 1000 resumes were sent in for job application, onli the gd honours will be given a chance for interview. the rest will end up in the shredder machine.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> </div></blockquote>It's a fact that first class honours (compared to their peers from the same institution)  graduates earn more in the civil service (and statutory boards) on the basis of a higher starting pay and also a career path with more promising prospects (which, by extension, would pave the way for quicker promotions and pay raises) - to a lesser extent, this policy also holds for many firms in the private sector although the disparity between first class honours graduates and the rest may not be as acute as that in the civil service. That is just about the only fact you can't deny. Then again, that's just a reality of how life in Singapore is - it is by no means remotely representative of the hiring culture on a global basis.<br><br>As a matter of fact, grades aren't everything in the sense that it isn't necessarily the single most important factor in determining whether you get a job interview as you claim - I'm speaking from experience in working for an established firm (belonging to the private sector) in both the US and Singapore (among a few countries) and have conducted my fair share of job interviews. In essence, your mindset and approach will serve you <strong>very well</strong> if you plan to pursue a career in the civil service, its statutory boards and some private firms, but it isn't going to get you very far for a career (especially for senior positions) with most established MNC's...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by walesa:<br><br>It's a fact that first class honours (compared to their peers from the same institution)  graduates earn more in the civil service (and statutory boards) on the basis of a higher starting pay and also a career path with more promising prospects (which, by extension, would pave the way for quicker promotions and pay raises) -<strong> to a lesser extent, this policy also holds for many firms in the private sector although the disparity between first class honours graduates and the rest may not be as acute as that in the civil service.</strong> That is just about the only fact you can't deny. Then again, that's just a reality of how life in Singapore is - it is by no means remotely representative of the hiring culture on a global basis.<br><br>As a matter of fact, <strong>grades aren't everything in the sense that it isn't necessarily the single most important factor in determining whether you get a job interview as you claim</strong> - I'm speaking from experience in working for an established firm (belonging to the private sector) in both the US and Singapore (among a few countries) and have conducted my fair share of job interviews. In essence, your mindset and approach will serve you <strong>very well</strong> if you plan to pursue a career in the civil service, its statutory boards and some private firms, but it isn't going to get you very far for a career (especially for senior positions) with most established MNC's...</blockquote>thank u for agreeing that disparity exists in the pte sector, regardless to wad extent, disparity is still present, i can save my effort from further argument den.<br><br>grades aren't the most impt factor, but they are one of the most impt factors, otherwise y even haf grades? a pass/fail will do.<br><br>since u haf conducted several interviews, haf u done sifting of resumes as well? can u kindly enlighten us, when 1000 resumes come in, how do u select those given a chance for interview?</div>
