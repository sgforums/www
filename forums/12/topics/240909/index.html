Then be happy and accept with whatever results you get........<br><br>Even if you do end up with, say, a 3rd Class, you are still so much better than all the others with only PSLE, Os and As and Bachelor's but who are still living  pretty satisfying and happy lives.......<br><br>You can always pick up your studies to upgrade later when you've oredi started working.

So what exactly is your concern? Simply a matter of your results or is there more to it? Is your real concern stemming from what you perceive might be a derisory paycheck should you get 2nd Class (lower) or worse?<br><br>Ironically - and I've seen many such examples in my working experience - the problem with many Asian students(as in those schooled in an Asian education system, not referring to Asians by ethnicity/nationality) stem from the fact that they're overly preoccupied with their academic results without actually knowing what they want in life/work and more importantly, how to go about realising their goals. While I was studying in the US, many of my peers would take the initiative on their own accord to source for their own internships in the summer and at times convenient for them to help them lay the foundations for the careers they have in mind. Needless to say, I've also seen tonnes of people with various priorities and attitudes towards academics - while some would do their darndest to cram in a Masters in 4 years, there're others who would quite happily settle for a Bachelor's. Being quite honest, I don't think many of my friends whom I attended college with are doing badly now (even those with just a Bachelor's), the fact our college being a reputable one notwithstanding.<br><br>So really, at the end of the day, if it's your job prospects you're concerned with, you should try to do something about it beyond your curriculum (I'm not saying academics ain't important, but it just isn't everything) like seeking an internship during your holidays, for instance.<br><br>Good luck in your pursuit.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Read this topic, and seemed like something i've always wanted to tell ppl.<br><br>When u r in uni, all u think is aceing the exams and getting the highest grade as possible. But in truth, what u learn in uni is just a fraction of what is needed in the working life. Sure, a good grade gives u a good start, but its not the absolute thing.<br><br>Maybe im not the best person to comment, as I've only been working for 7 years. Hopefully ppl with more experience can comment. But for the past few years, i've been conducting many interviews etc, so i wish to share out some experience in it.<br><br>When i interview ppl, i dont really look for the absolute best. Instead, i tend to look for those that can fit into the current working team culture and environment. Being the smartest candidate with the best grade doesnt guarantee u a job - instead, u need to appeal to the interviewers' needs. I also look for candidates with a good attitude, pleasant personality, and able to handle pressure well - i usually grill them with tough questions, just to see how they respond, and not really to listen to the answers. Many candidates tend to answer rudely or fumble or be angry - big no no. Dun be rude to the interviewer! ... Once i had a candidate asking me to give him a cup of water before the interview. Hahaha! I should hv just kicked him out of the room immediately.<br><br>Another thing i wish to share is that once i got out from my uni (a very very long time ago), i immediately discovered that watever i learned in uni was completely insufficient. Everything was much more advanced, and i had to learn it on the job. Tat's when i realised that the knowledge is not as important as the other soft skills u learn during ur uni days, things like doing extensive research, writing well, problem solving and analysis, etc. ... In fact, the module that contributed the most to me was something totally unrelated to my field of studies, but thought me how to debate issues with others, and form my own viewpoints and defend them.<br><br>In other words, dont worry too much abt the grades, and most definately dont concentrate on it until there's nothing else to show off the employer except ur grades!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>those pple who tink that its harder to score in engine as compared to biz is so terribly wrong.. it might b true that engine has more modules to clear, u haf 20+ hours of lessons each week.. but EVERYONE in engine goes through the same thing.. in biz, although we haf less than 20hrs of lessons a week and we haf more free time, it means EVERYONE is using the free time to study, and if u do not put in the equal amount of effort, ur gonna lose out. ultimately grades are decided by a bell curve, so no matter which course ur in, it boils down to effort..<br><br>also, those who said tt grades ain't everything, i agree, but they are still extremely impt.. look the the banks and GLCs, the minimum requirement is 2nd upper class honours. if u do not achieve that, u r not even given a chance for the interview. so tell me, how r u gonna show these companies that u r gd when u r not even granted an interview? these are facts of life, we just haf to face them. no point deluding and consoling urself that grades ain't impt. in my point of view, just study hard.</div>
