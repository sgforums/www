              <p>It was first love, so innocent and pure.

              <p>Unknowing the her, i was totally devestated by this. My whole world from everything i knew, did and believed in was suddenly taken away. The life in me was drained, and there was this hugh "love" vacuum to be filled. I got attached again but this relationship had to be ended by me, as i finally realized that it was unfair of me to love somebody for the wrong reasons. I didn't know how to love again, the sameway i had always knew.I lived my life, more careful of my feelings, more reserved. Never being able to commit myself.</p>
              <p>Time passes by and i live my life . Now and then the memories do resurface and haunt me. Sometimes, out of the blue, i dream of her, and it totally destabilizes the day for me. One such day happened 5 years ago, out of curiosity, i went to search ROM and to my "surprise" i found that she had registered about 2  years ago. I felt there was no point in  waiting  anymore. Deep inside i was  hoping for something to happen despite not having contact for ~8 years. Within a month, i proposed to my current girlfriend and we got married the subsequent year.</p>
              <p>Just yesterday (~15 years since), i stumbled upon her facebook entry. Being a private one, i could see her together with her daugher. Something deep inside starts to rekindle, some emotions that makes me feel uneasy. I've been off center for the last 24 hrs. I'm really happy for her and bear no grudges as i should have matured through all this time. But there is something deep inside me that has made me feel uneasy. Something i think i should have said on that fateful breakup day or sometime sooner. I know it sounds ridiculous to be hoping for anything now, and i'm not. I myself have a daughter and she means the world to me and i would never do anything to hurt her.</p>
              <p>But there is something in my soul that needs addressing, something that i have to address before i depart from this planet. I just need to tell her (without any hope or agenda) that "I really loved you. I lied then about you not being the one not to marry, cos it was the exact opposite, you were my life and that was always in my mind for that to happen. Cos not letting you know for all this time has been killing me".</p>
              <p>I feel that i have to seal this chapter in my life, which was never really closed for 15 years. But then again it sounds crazy to contact someone who you've not contacted for 15 years and say this. Now that our lives have moved on.</p>
              <p>What should i do??</p>
              <p>P.S.    If any of you had watch "Love actually", i can truely relate to the character Mark that is secretly in love with Kiera knightley's character, but didn't have the courage to tell her, because as he says "its a self preservation thing". Not allowing himself to succumb to the despair of knowing that they can never be together. Kiera married his best friend.</p>

              <p>So what if you blurt out the truth when the truth does not matter anymore? The courage that you can finally muster after 15 years are abit too late. If you were with her 15 years ago, you might not be as xin fu as u are now.</p>
              <p>Open your heart and treasure what you have had now. </p>

              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"> <span style="font-size: 10pt;">I find it extremely disturbing to hear
                          stories of how an individual would so absurdly delude their ideology of a
                          perfect love by equating it to a proposed fantasy figure, just simply because
                          the feelings were the most intensive and the 'I-know-she-is-the-one.' false
                          prophesy. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">This karmic relationship is nothing but
                          fatuous love.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">All this emotional misery is caused by the <em>seemingly</em> unbreakable attachment and bondage to this karmic relationship that is
                          wholesomely one sided and narcissistic. In tarot, the Devil best represents the
                          condition of such relationship.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">There is so much self conjuration of
                          melodrama - filled with narcissism and disillusionment. </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;" lang="EN-GB">I think it's doleful
                          to see people with perfectly nice marriages saying that their greatest failure
                          in love is never having to marry or continue a relationship with ‘That One'
                          till the very end. That loose equivalent of a soul mate, first love, best love,
                          or whatever you termed it, gets <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">mistaken</span></strong> for everything from
                          infatuation to lust to an excuse for stalking, obsession, domestic violence and
                          the what's not. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">And the incredible thing is that people seek
                          to find strength in corroborating this afflicted mindset through media, movies,
                          music, books or simply taking selective perspective and biased conclusion whenever
                          they listened to people’s stories and reaffirmed this one-sided view on their
                          take of their own relationship.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I have seen first hand, people grouping
                          together as they howled in pain by reminiscing and negatively strengthening
                          their false love identity with their fantasy figure/s - even fate has blatantly
                          revealed that he/she has no more greater plans in their lives.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">This is crazy! How depressing would it be for
                          your wife, who have given her heart to you through love and marriage, only to
                          discover that she is but a second class citizen to another person, which time
                          should have disintegrate her presence into the pages of history in your lifespan
                          and shrine of memory. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">This is not merely a commentary point of view
                          because I walked through similar path and ate the same shit, albeit now it
                          still affects me occasionally. The only difference between you and I is that I
                          transformed this regret into perfecting my soul and cultivate deeper
                          understanding in Love. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I took the spiritual path towards
                          enlightenment in Love and pen down my discovery in my own book and gradually see
                          myself grow from my own encounters.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I recalled writing this phenomenon in
                          CloUdiSm under Ritual Closure – people who are unable to seal certain chapter
                          in love, despite the passing of time, and seek to attempt some form of ‘ritual-like’
                          action or behavior to conclude episode/s. You reckoned that there is this need
                          for you to go up to her and tell her that you really loved her back then and
                          what you said fifteen years ago is nothing but a lie and all that stuff – this is
                          your attempt at weaving the ‘ritual’ to process a closure for that chapter.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">But what you are blinded to see is that her
                          presence in your life has absolutely nothing to do with or without knowing that
                          you truly loved her back then. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The real gist of that entire scenario
                          functions as an expedient means to reveal that one should treasure our love
                          ones every single moment in life and that one must never fetter the purest form
                          of self expression in love!</span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Fifteen years and that foolishness carried on
                          without any attempt at clarification or enlightenment. True as I have wrote
                          about seven years ago, ‘Love has absolutely nothing to do with our chronological
                          age.’ In fact, our judgment in Love is often clouded, not by reasoning, but by
                          the lack of wisdom to perceive our situation holistically in love and
                          relationship, which fuels our misery and suffering. </span></p>

              <p>actually what do you hope to achieve by just telling her that you really loved her back then? Would it have changed anything now?</p>
              <p>It is all in the past. Both of you have a family now and you should be focusing on how to cherish your current wife and daughter better otherwise you will just end up regretting it one day later.</p>

              u have already left regret in one woman, dont do it for the second.
              
              i believe u have been trying all these years to let go, and now seeing her on facebook again just reminds u of the good old times. 
              
              ur wife's love for you will not be any less, so dont let her down.
