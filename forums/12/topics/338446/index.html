              <p>i have been working under my friend cum boss for 2 years</p>
              <p>sometimes u shouldnt have work for some1 u know for years cause each other will really take each other for grantded........</p>
              <p>Job scope is around 2.5 to 3k job but i was paid $1200 starting . he tell me because his was a small company and couldnt paid me much .</p>
              <p>using this attitude that im helping a friends with his starting company i accept it.</p>
              <p>ok 1st year increase paid to $1400 work OT 30h claim about 10h every month........</p>
              <p>then things start to get worst as i work</p>
              <p>2nd year increase paid to $1650 but no OT to claim. My friend/boss started to ask me to work more OT every month 8.30am to 8pm and sometimes to 10pm. became a multi-tasker. everything i do. when i was with client outside and they came to know about my job scope also asking "wow u do so much things yr paid must be like $5k $6k???" i was always embrassed to answer. most of my working friends always tell me im underpaid but i always tell them' its ok im working for friend, help him ma"</p>
              <p>recently my friend/boss start to take me for granted and really start to piss me off</p>
              <p>1st incident - MY mum pass away</p>
              <p>its was the last day of my mum furneral and i was really upset and crying at the last day of my mum SongKa. switch off the handphone because last day of Songka got band and chating for my mum. early in the morning. normally this is the saddest period of the time because the person dearest to u is leaving u for those that have some1 dearest to u leaving u i believe how u would feel at that last monent.</p>
              <p>so when around 10am my mum was getting ready to be carry on to the van to departed to her world i switch on my HP and guess wat my Friend cum Boss called</p>
              <p>he started questing Y i didnt on my HP and wat happened in case he need to call me URGENTLY ON SOMETHING ABOUT WORK??? i couldnt believe wat he was telling me at that point because i thought that he my best friend and he would understand that im preparing my mum furneral and yet he questing Y i off my HP ........</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2nd. he dont accept MC</p>
              <p>i was on MC and he actually ask me to come back and hand in the MC. i stay at AMK and Office is at Jurong. when i reach the office and hand in the MC he actually gave me a scolding saying that " Are u feelign so sick that u cannot walk !!!???? "</p>
              <p>"Are u about to faint!!???" if not even though u have MC u still can work 1 wat!!!???</p>
              <p>wat the hell~!!! ppl feel sick get MC he also threaten this kind of things.... i was foce to work 5h that day and go back home after 4pm</p>
              <p>3rd.  at site huge rain and he expect me to be in the rain</p>
              <p>i was at a construction site and was suppost to bring a client to look at the site for further job scope but as its was raining heavily and all work was stopped due to the rain. i decided to bring the client to have lunch 1st at 11.45am (our meal time was 12.30pm) as usual i have to report to him for everything and i decided to call him and tell him that we decided to have early lunch.</p>
              <p>guess wat he tell me in the phone ???</p>
              <p>" ARE U MADE OF PAPER ???!!! LITTLE BIT OF RAIN WILL KILL U IS IT ???!!!!!<br>ITS ONLY !2PM NOW !!!!! Y ARE U HAVING EARLY LUNCH ?????!!!!!!!!"</p>
              <p>zzzzzz im really at lose of words working for this kind of boss..............</p>
              <p>yes im admited im not a good worker that he expected me to be. but i been doing my job and been working tons of unclaim OT and producing the work that he expected me to do. treating client to meal without informing him also tio KAN...........</p>
              <p>i have enough of him and finally i decided to tell him i have enough "IM QUITTING"</p>
              <p>he assure me that its hard to find a job right now and wat problem i have in company ??? i should stay and work for him because he taking care of me......</p>
              <p>i have decided i have enough is enough . his attitude toward me is really rubbish</p>
              <p>we can be best friend but not workers and boss relationship</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>sorry for posting a long and boreding post but i need to release some stress from all the work things happening to me.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>I think you can just leave. With your exprience of workling long hours, you can easily find another job.</p>

              <p>i don't think, after all that he has done, that you should still consider him a friend anymore. my advice is</p>
              <p>1) quit your job, work for MacDelivery $1.6k a month or some other better company</p>
              <p>2) invest in Clubfitt gym membership $90 a year (offpeak only) and start training hard to lose weight. although it is his fault to be demanding at times, especially in the 2 incidents, there is something you can do about it.</p>
              <p>do something in life that gives you a sense of achievemtn, pursue your dreams and do not be motivated by the pay.</p>

              <p>   I agree with the majority asking you to quit but i also acknowledge that currently times r hard . So you better do your own " homework " before quitting . I personally have seen good friends who break off , i mean really cannot even be friends at all after working together . But at the same time i must say that there can be friends whom work for years without any big problem , my dad is a good example , true he did some things that his friend cum boss was very mad abt but  being friends for so many years , he visited my house , talked to my mum and my dad , after that everything was resolved .</p>
              <p>   Actually i believed in if the person really regard you as a friend , he should care for you instead of making use of you to provide cheap labour which your friend is obviously doing . I also do used have some such friend whom think that just becos i'm fat , i must be stupid , so they treat me like an idiot making use of me agn n agn . Theres even a ger whom already had a bf but yet tried to trick me into buying a car to share with her . Needless to say i cut off all contact with her , and some of my friend whom treated me like an idiot i also sever all contact with them . I am the type that i rather have no friends then have some egoistic pple whom think they r smart just becos they r slim or fit so that they can treat pple like an idiot . Even now when i occasionally see them on the streets i just ignore them n walk pass by without even smiling or even looking at them .</p>
              <p>Its good to be sentimental or soft hearted but you have to know the limit . If pple dun treat you as friend what for you still treat them as one ?</p>

              <p>since u've quit, dun go back again. even if he asks u. this kind of boss, better not work for him... even as a friend, he sounds quite insensitive... i tink the less u contact him, the better.</p>
              <p>maybe u can take the time slowly build up ur confidence. since ur weight is a problem, go exercise more, eat more healthy meals and slim down. you must feel good abt yourself so tt you can be confident when u apply for another job.</p>
              <p>if u dun mind temp job, or average pay, it's not so hard to find a job one.</p>
              <p>(my cousin who's in her early fifties wif o levels quit her job and managed to find temp job very fast.)</p>
              <p>but u must remember tt jobs go to pple tt bosses feel they can trust. tt's why u must have confidence in urself, so tt others will have confidence in u.</p>
