                  <p><strong>(u keep saying 5k to 6k job) -</strong> i only say once
                  didnt keep saying</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p><strong>(1600 starting pay is quite reasonable for a diploma
                  holder.)</strong> job pay actually depend on the job scope that u
                  work at.  if every job required education to be the base of
                  income then those with lower education sure die. its
                  actually depend on whether u are able to work on tuff jobs. how
                  many diploma holder are willing to be work under the scorching hot
                  sun  ?? or perfer to be working in the comfortable air-con
                  area??? i work in construction line and i can tell u most
                  singaporean only wan to enjoy air-con while Malaysian / banganish
                  are the tough ppl that can endure the hardship in this line.</p>
                  <p>do u know that there are many  Banganish / chinaman
                  that can earn up to $2k+ per month ??? that is even more than me.
                  but do u know how much hardship/ OT they have to go through to
                  earn it ???? they have 0 education but they are willing to put
                  their body for $$$ that Y i respect them.</p>
                  <p>of couse there are also some singaporean that is willing to take
                  hardship (inculding me but im not that tuff after all) basically
                  there very few singaporean that i can see willing to go through
                  this.</p>
                  <p>its the toughness and hardship of the job that is important to
                  me when consent about $$$ that Y even if u are low educated . as
                  long as you are willing to take hardship , u still can earn better
                  compare to those that have higher education but only wan
                  comfort.</p>
                  <p>im a "O: level failure with 1 credit only. but my paid use to be
                  avg $2.8k per annual.</p>
                  <p>anyway my matter is over. i have sit down and have a good talk
                  and we both agreed that its both person fault that lead to this
                  outcome . we almost lose our friendship.</p>
                  <p>i believe he will still talk to me again be4 my last days as he
                  actually told me he have plan for me ( he wan to sent me to oversea
                  to handle job, he intented to increase my paid. ) however all this
                  is not confirm yet because i have tendered.</p>
                  <p>im waiting for the good talk when my friend/cum boss come back
                  from oversea .right now i wan to settle this between us. the good
                  thing between us right now is we have started to talk to each other
                  again and now we are even more open to each other.</p>
                  <p>any thanks for been concent ^^ i appreciated it.</p>
                  <p>i dont post to flame my boss or whoever. sometimes i just wan to
                  post to listen to wat other ppl think and can advices me .</p>
                  <p>i just wan to post to release stress and ask for comfort words
                  from others</p>
                  <p>sometimes i post to gain pity from other so that i can comfort
                  myself that there are ppl that still stand by me ^^</p>

                  glad that u and him have decided to settle ur differences openly. 
              And that is a good way of handling things like this rather than avoid it.
                  Hmm i mean the pay of a diploma holder is a benchmark set by the market out there.
               Without experience 1600 is ok le. my fren only 1500 (no ot pay also) he still very happy.
                  But from ur discription of ur job environment I agree wif u ya younger generation wouldnt want this kind of job. 
                  besides, if u can work in this type of environment, I believe u can survive in any other job.
