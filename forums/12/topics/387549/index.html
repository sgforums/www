              <p>I am very disturbed by the law.  From me problem, I was told that the man had rights to continue to cause me 'pain'. </p>

              <p>He will be given a longer access to the children and not under supervision.  He will be able to bring them out overnight.  The thing is he had an affair and we had to divorce.  But the law will give him equal rights. Huh??? Is law really fair? I had to see doc because of his infidelity, I had depression because of his infidelity.  And now, I am told that he can take my children away from me. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Is the law trying to tell people that it is ok to have extra marital affair and they can get away with it no matter how much hurts and pains they had caused?  If so, then what is the purpose of standing in front of a witness and vowed your marriage?  If he can get away with this so easily, then what can stop him from doing it again?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Can someone enlighten me?  I am quite disheartened by the 'fairness' of our law.</p>

              <p>i'm assuming this is regarding the custody of your children after a divorce from your spouse. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>for this, you would have to prove that your spouse is incapable of providing proper care for your children or is dangerous around your children, or he does have the rights to view them, seeing how they are his children as well. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and regarding your question if "<span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px; color: #333333;">law trying to tell people that it is ok to have extra marital affair and they can get away with it no matter how much hurts and pains they had caused", basically, yeah. while an affair may be "morally" wrong, it isn't lawfully wrong to have an affair. at least, seeing how your spouse is the one who had the affair, you can have a bigger cut of the house?</span></p>

              <p>The court see fairness from the point of the father and also the children, and of course also you.</p>
              <p>Fairness doesn't mean you have to be happy, or even satisfied.</p>
              <p>I am sure all the facts have been presented in court, and the judge made his decision according to the facts presented. Relevant facts, like your ex-spouse is the father of the children, and that he is a normal person, and is capable of looking after the children just as well as you. There is no record of his abusing or mis-treating the children. As well as details on your side.</p>
              <p>And the judge made the best possible arrangements <span style="text-decoration: underline;">beneficial to the children.</span></p>

                  told that the man had rights to continue to cause me
                  'pain'. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He will be given a longer access to the children and not under
                  supervision.  He will be able to bring them out
                  overnight.  The thing is he had an affair and we had to
                  divorce.  But the law will give him equal rights. Huh???
                  Is law really fair? I had to see doc because of his
                  infidelity, I had depression because of his infidelity.  And
                  now, I am told that he can take my children away from me. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Is the law trying to tell people that it is ok to have extra
                  marital affair and they can get away with it no matter how much
                  hurts and pains they had caused?  If so, then what is the
                  purpose of standing in front of a witness and vowed your
                  marriage?  If he can get away with this so easily, then what
                  can stop him from doing it again?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Can someone enlighten me?  I am quite disheartened by the
                  'fairness' of our law.</p>

              <p>Do not expect the law to punish your children because the marriage between you and your husband failed.</p>
              <p>while you think you wants to take  the children away from him, you are also taking  the father away from the children.</p>
              <p>Fidelity must come from the heart. Not from a whip nor a chain and ball.</p>
              <p>If you believe in using your children to punish his wrongs. Then morally, you are not fit to have custody of the young, for it is expected you will corrupt their innocent heart with anger and hatred.</p>

              <p>Take his money every month alimony, still don't want to let him see his children? YOUR kids are living off HIS money. I laugh at the irony of the situation.</p>
              <p>You have depression and yet you still want to take custody of the children? Are you even fit to be a parent?</p>
              <p>Jojobeach allow me to reinforce what you've said to TS - "you are not fit to have custody of the young, for it is
