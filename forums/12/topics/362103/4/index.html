              <p>I guess when a girl gives up her chasity to a certain someone it could pretty much mean that she believes firmly and blindly that this guy loves her or she could be just exploring her own sexuality. Sex is somewhat mixed up with love most of the time. Untill the day where we can agree in unison on why someone would have sex with another we can only explain a few reasons in differences.</p>
              <p>humans are made to be one of a kind. And that leads to us having our own perception and own way of life. If i were to ask someone to explain the meaning of being happy i believe our answers will be similar to asking the question to whay is to love.</p>
              <p>we live in a world where humans were given a gift. Called will or soul AKA FREEDOM. Yet its such Freedom that lead to what makes the other known as contradictory. We tend most of the time to say something that our hearts tell us to.. but yet we do it another way. Correct me if im wrong but thats how most of us are in life. Because when there is freedom there will be rules.</p>
              <p>So who are we to judge people with our own perception. Till the day we see in the same glasses, we can never understand one another throughly.</p>
              <p>"Why" is infinite. "How" is our answer =)</p>

              <p>Maybe you do not. But maybe you will when someone really close to you passed away. To yearn for someone its not wrong neither it is a lie. When you have good times like with your own family.. you own wife and kids, you will tend to be nostalgic about the times your parents are with you.Yes supposed that they passed on.</p>
              <p>Nostalgia is not a lie. You just remember things from the past. How could it be a lie when memories of times you spend is existant? Do you not yearn? Do you not desire?</p>
              <p>At the end of the day you are still human.</p>
