              <p>A while ago my gf was having problems with her supervisor at work, which meant she would dreed going to work and come home upset...</p>
              <p>In the end she had to report everyday to her boss, telling him her every move...</p>
              <p>She seeked advice from her friends, in which their reaction to this problem was for her to quit her job, as she never needed the stress... Which is easy to say for them but there is another stress of not having money coming in each month, and with bills each month it would be hard and more stress...</p>
              <p>In the end she stayed there until she found another job...</p>
              <p>A few months after this, some of her friends was having problems with their work and in turn was stressed...</p>
              <p>I told my gf, why are they stressed??? Why dont they fellow their own advice and just quit like they told her too???  In which they never did, i lost repect for them giving advice to others but not backing up their own advice...</p>
              <p>My point is they never seen the hole pic, they just seen her upset and give bad advice... They never seen the bigger pic untill they was in the same position!!!</p>
              <p>To give out advice, you must fully understand the other person and there position...   </p>

              <p>I would say, not many people could fully understand someone's situation and thereby, give good advice. I've seen many situations like these. The sad truth is, it's not happening to those people giving advice anyway, why would they bother to think through the big picture and the consequences.</p>
              <p>Moreover, I understand that some of them will even say it in a tone like there's a simple solution to it, why make a big fuss? When in fact that simple solution is totally rubbish.</p>
              <p>Well brother, if telling them the big picture issn't helping, then its ok, thank them for their advice, and just find other advices or find a solution yourself. :)</p>

              <p>I just thought being her closer friends, they would give it more thought and try and understand more of her situation... Not just say the first thing that comes into their head !!!</p>
              <p>Just that it was a hard time for both of us, and this kinda advice did not help us...  </p>

              <p>Well you got to think,</p>
              <p>Which will be less stressfull??? Going to a job you really do not like and having money to pay bills each month, or out of work with no money to pay the bills getting into more debt???</p>
