(READ: This person must be in your life first.)<br><br>Admire is when you are attracted to a person because of a certain personality/trait that he/she displays, and not really because of the person.

I admire her coz she has a kind soul, she actually listens whenever u speak and she's got a good sense of humour and appreciative of me making her laugh. I admire her coz she has many friends from many walks of life and she is not discriminatory, i also admire her coz she is so full of faith and content. So is that sounding like admiration or blind infetuation?<br><br>While at the same time, i also think she's pretty, although she's short and not entirely that sexy compared to super models and stuff.
