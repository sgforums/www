              <p>yeah, those tubes are just horrible and when i see them, i just feel like using my hand to pull them off cos' it's very uncomfortable for people (i last time have 1 tube down my throat and it's already very crappy).</p>
              <p>btw, the feeding tube and ventilator forever cannot be removed? maybe your parents got seek other opinion? like maybe some sort of portable and a lot more modern version of the tube or something? like last time, hearing aid is very big, must attached to the ear, but now, hearing aid devices are only less than 0.5 cm and can be fit inside the ear.</p>

                      and etc...doc wun allow my bro to fully sit up anymore oso because
                      of his spine condition, at most juz lean up abit... feel so pain
                      for my bro and breaks our hearts.. my bro can just onli lie down
                      there and unable to do anyting and even his speech oso abit
                      affected</p>

              <p>don't worry lah.....maybe like 1 - 2 years later, can sit up?</p>
              <p>also, i thought there's those spine attachments or devices to support the spine so that he can sit up. maybe you can ask doctor for those. Not sure if your current doc is a well-versed specialist, but a lot of docs in NUH, SGH, TTS and mostly just interns and freshies who came out of university.</p>
              <p>In future, when you can afford it, you can probably find those old professor types who can very possibly provide better solutions. It's not end of the road yet.</p>
              <p>also, for all we know, your bro may be able to eventually lean up more and more.</p>
              <p>as for speech slurred, it's quite common for patients whose spinal cord get damaged.</p>
              <p>even those whose brain, or nose or inner ear got operations also will have risk of slurred speech due to the nerves all connect to brain.</p>
              <p>all the best and see him soon on SGF! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="icon_surprised.gif"></p>

              <p>oh those spine attachment... doc got mentioned b4... his doc right now is 1 of the top doc in the hosp due to my bro condition... they wun let a junior to be in charge... just that currently my bro condition is not in a veri stable state yet and alot of fractures, so doc say best is to let my bro lie down more... anyway he wun be able to sit up and stay by himself, he will req something to hold him there.</p>
              <p>hope the next few yrs will get beta.. his speech is smth that we still not sure whether can improve... because of the injury to his c2 area, it affected almost everything, even facial expression he also cant control much so we just have to cope ba i guess..</p>

              <p>ha, good to hear that the doc is one of the best, otherwise really we will beat the sh** out of him if he screws up. at least, from my personal experience, i've no patience for junior docs.</p>
              <p>hope he get better soon! a lot of times, have to let time slowly heal the wounds and the heart! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="icon_surprised.gif"></p>
