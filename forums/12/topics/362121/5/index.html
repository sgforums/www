              <p>Try not to think about the past. What has happen has happened already and nothing will change it. It might have been a terrible experience but you still have to face it.</p>
              <p>Depending on your condition, if you need visit the hospital then do so. Being able to continue living is still still a fortune as any deaths will really affect your loved 1s.</p>

              <p>Oh, you are back at home already, I thought you were still in the hospital (Touchwood).</p>
              <p>If it really gets out of hand, please do not wait till tonight before going back to the hospital to have a check-up.</p>
              <p>Anyway I am going off to fetch one of my students over to my house for tuition already, so I will talk to you next time.</p>

              <p>don't worry lah, bro.....do what u think is best for you. Hospital is never a good place and it sarks big time. some of my most painful and heart-wrecking memories in my life were in hospital and i dread that place. however, if necessary, u should still go hospital to seek treatment and tell yourself, "once i'm done, i'm out of this farking place".</p>
              <p>u'll feel slightly better that way.</p>

              <p>we also need to know him better first via this thread here
              otherwise in future, if we really go visit him, we also dunno what
              to talk about!!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>btw, u not schooling tomorrow? i think better not stay too late
              lah, otherwise if need to worry about your brother + school, will
              be quite bad for health in long term.</p>

              <p>don't worry lah......we won't be visiting any time soon. More like when he gets better due to reasons mentioned previously.</p>
              <p>and unlike his current friends, we (strangers) won't have that much of the shock expression cos' this is the 1st time we see him, so our outlook and opinion is all fresh.</p>
              <p>i believe i've seen all kinds of such cases.........there was one guy in tanjong pagar MRT some months back, who's a beggar. His limbs are very tiny and skinny but head is very big (1/2 times larger than normal size). His long hair was all strewn around messily and face look distorted. Worse is that there's boils and lumps all over one of his hands. U see liao really cannot stop thinking that type.</p>
              <p>btw, his current friends still visiting him often? not sure if he has a gf too.</p>
              <p>also, are your parents busy at work? cos' u seem to be the only one taking care of your bro.</p>
              <p>see ya!</p>
