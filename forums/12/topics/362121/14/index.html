              <p>Are you able to use those medication that prevent blood clots? Know there are some but 4got names. They are dangerous in a way cos if you have any cuts etc, they will bleed continously but for your case since you can't move, there should be low chances of any cuts etc unless it might affect all the machinery or stuff connected to you and complicate matters.</p>

              <p>btw, has it been 100% confirmed it's blood clot? anyway, at this point, amputation is not 100% confirmed either. we should start to worry only after that tang-ki says he'll amputate Jem's arms.</p>

              <p>When you cannot move your limbs, there is no movement of them and the bloodflow gets really low and risk of clotting. Medication has been used and its not really helping much.</p>
              <p>Medical science is advanced but not to the stage where everything can be cured.</p>
              <p>Bloodclot is confirmed since thats the only thing that will cause blue black colouration to occur.</p>
