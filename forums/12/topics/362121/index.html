              <p>u've been through a lot. And u have lost a lot and it must be v. painful. U will need time to rest and come to terms with things, but i hope you will remember that u haven't lost everything even if it might feel tat way right now.</p>
              <p>U still have yr mind and yr sight and yr hands, and who knows what wonders you might be able to work with those?</p>
              <p>your plans for your life will have to change, u will have to adjust, but u can still dream new dreams.</p>
              <p>u don't noe what talents u might have undiscovered. U could very well become a great writer or artist or sculptor or musician. maybe even the greatest Singapore has seen. U could become a brilliant computer programmer, maybe even the next Bill Gates. <strong>dont</strong> let the accident take away yr ability to dream new dreams or the heart to chase those dreams.</p>
              <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_hawking#Illness">one of the greatest minds of our time is Professor Stephen Hawking</a>, who is almost completely paralysed.</p>

              <p><br>There can be no words expressed here or anywhere else that will comfort you, for in your own despair, you have constructed and fabricated a wall around yourself, in the belief that you are a lesser mortal compared to anyone else, as evident by your fear to face outsiders.</p>
              <p>However, do remember you owe no one a living and no one owes you too. You are your own person and the only one who can call you ugly, worthless or look down on you is yourself.</p>
              <p>If you condemn yourself, then there will be no hope for you and you will live a wasted life.</p>
              <p>I plead that you come to terms with yourself and face up to reality. The loss or whatever that happened had already happened. It is what you must do for your future that is more critical. You are still alive, with prothestics that can make you as normal to anyone else as you wish and believe.</p>
              <p>Do more excercises and get accostom to your new life. You are still breathing and alive, living the gift of life bestowed upon you, to know pain but to experience joys as well. It is within your power of choice, no matter how physically challenge you become, to choose - to face the day with courage or stare at the slow ticking of clocks in despair.</p>
              <p>Remember always - no one can look down on you, but only yourself. You are precious to our society and fully capable of contributing to it within your means for our growth, just as we as a society will contribute to yours willingly.</p>

              <p>Oscar Pistorius: This was a man who never gave up, and became an inspiration to all and gave faith on the power of mankind to excel if we persevere. You too, can be like him, and perhaps even better than him if you try and give yourself a chance.</p>
              <p>(Oscar was good at running and clock good timings so much so that he was better than most athletes heading for the Beijing Olympics 2008. He too wanted to compete there against other competitors, but was controversially turned down because the Olympic council felt he had an <span style="text-decoration: underline;">unfair</span> advantage to the other able-bodied athletes!</p>
              <p>The Olympic council later reversed the ruling, but unfortunately, his time was still short of the Olympic qualifying rounds, of which I am sure he will improve in following years}</p>
