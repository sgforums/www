              <p>thanks a lot, dkcx and forbiddensinner.</p>
              <p>anyway, 86jl.......from your ID, i assume you're 23 years old (borned in 19<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>86</strong></span>?)</p>
              <p>seriously, isn't there any way to cure your condition or at least make it better?</p>
              <p>sorry if i sound irritating, but have you tried getting 2nd opinion? and how are your parents now? still actively seeking solutions? in case you're relying on NUS / General hospital doctors, it's better to try Mt Elizabeth as there are lots of world-renowed specialists there in every field.</p>
              <p>i seriously will not trust NUS / SGH doctors in such a critical condition like yours.</p>
              <p>also, did the doctor say anything such as there's a chance u might get better? as in, at least recover usage of your hands?</p>
              <p>technology is quite advance now (even though cancer and AIDs are still un-curable), and i think there was mention of some spinal cord attachment that u can fix to your back to let you move your limbs.</p>
              <p>maybe u should make it a point to come here every day or every 2 - 3 days if you can.</p>
              <p>we can talk to you and cheer you up. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></p>
              <p>and u can also ask us anything and we can update you, in case you can't access news or the outside world.</p>

              <p>I know that no amount of encouragement or good words will lighten your already dense mood. Just bear in mind that there are less fortunate people than you and you should treasure what you have in life.</p>
              <p>Throwing away everything you have is just making the world around you collapse. Be the inspiration for the people around you and not the wet blanket.</p>
              <p>Of course, things are easier said than to be done. Best wishes.</p>
