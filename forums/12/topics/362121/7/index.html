              <p>that settles it liao.</p>
              <p>since one party want to take care of the other forever and the other, in his heart, dun want to break up, then they should just be together forever.</p>
              <p>although your bro may have her interest at heart, by breaking up with her, he's actually making her sad. after all, we have seen many newspaper reports of nobles wives taking care of severely paralyzed husbands and also one husband who took care of his mentally retarded wife. Just some examples. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></p>

              <p>now your bro really getting a bit better, even if it's just a little bit.</p>
              <p>lose a lot of weight can recover one, but at least no need to use breathing machine now.</p>
              <p>btw, the next step is to remove the neck breathing pipe so that he can breathe without any equipment?</p>

              <p>Haha, if u dun mind volunteery work, do come and hear more from us or feel free to tell me what sort of ppl you would like to volunteer with and i can give my recommendations. WSC fair is 12th-14th and CCA fair is the following week so both times u should be able to find us and learn more about what you can do.</p>
              <p>NIE side stuff i can't help so good luck. I would assume u are slow in registration? Module registration is fastest finger 1st and everyone will be ready the moment registration starts and not wait.</p>
              <p>Whats over is over so i don't think theres much need to worry over things you can't change.</p>
