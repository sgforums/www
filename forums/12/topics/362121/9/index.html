              <p>hi, glad to see you post! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif"></p>
              <p>i assume your sister use the computer to surf the net for you and you direct her to which webpage you wanna see etc.? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif"></p>
              <p>maybe you can check out the Chit Chat forum if you haven't already. Lots of things and replies to see. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif"></p>
              <p>btw, what kind of food do you eat now? porridge? marcoroni u can eat?</p>
              <p>maybe if got time, i help u think of things for you to do so that life will become more meaningful. I'm sure there's something u can do once you get better.</p>
              <p>btw, u shouldn't give up, though. If you've the time, you could try searching on the web to find possible cures and devices. Although your doctor is helpless, well, you never know. Maybe some guy or indie company in the US has come up with devices etc to help your case and your doctor isn't aware. Searching on the web for such stuff could even let you get to know people in other countries who are in the same situation as you.</p>

              <p>good day!</p>
              <p>u don't happen to know the name of your condition? not sure if there's any name for such paralysis from the neck down, but if yes, maybe u can post the name here and we all can help you search and ask around.</p>
              <p>Many hands doing the same job is often better than none.</p>
              <p>Also, pls don't get angry, but I personally feel the doctor's idea of putting a tube down your throat forever in order to eat food is atrocious and must be fixed.<br>I understand it's a very uncomfortable feeling.</p>
              <p>Maybe not the doctor's fault, but it's technology and science's fault.</p>
              <p>since feeding tube is inserted through the nose and not the mouth, i assume u can't taste sweet stuff due to not using tongue?</p>
              <p>i was thinking of making marcoroni salad sometime for you in future, but i need to understand better first. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif"></p>

              <p>erm i am unable to eat any solid food so i tink marcoroni salad
              is hard as i assume is nt liquid and nt smashed up to veri tiny
              bits and with the sauces i tink quite hard for me to eat... it wun

              <p>i see.......then in this case, i think the salad will be too big for you to go down the nose.</p>

              <p>---------------------------------------------</p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Scientists are investigating many promising avenues of treatment for
              spinal cord injury. Thousands of articles in the medical literature
              describe work, mostly in animal models, aimed at reducing the
              paralyzing effect of injury to the spinal cord and promoting regrowth
              of functional nerve fibers. Despite the devastating effects of the
              condition, commercial funding for spinal cord cure research is limited,
              owing primarily to the small size of the population of potential
              beneficiaries. Despite this, a number of experimental treatments have
              reached controlled human trials. This research adds considerable new information relevant to spinal cord injury treatment.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Advances in the science of spinal cord injury treatment are
              newsworthy, and considerable media attention is drawn towards new
              developments. Aside from the use of methylprednisolone, none of these
              developments have reached even limited use in the clinical care of
              human spinal cord injury. Around the world, proprietary centers
              offering <a title="Stem cell" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell">stem cell</a> transplants and treatment with neuroregenerative substances are fueled
              by glowing testimonial reports of neurological improvement. Independent
              validation of the results of these treatments is lacking.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord_injuries#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> However, in January 2009, the <a title="Geron Corporation" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geron_Corporation">Geron Corporation</a> received <a class="mw-redirect" title="U.S. Food and Drug Administration" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Food_and_Drug_Administration">FDA</a> clearance to begin human safety testing of its stem cell treatment
              candidate, GRNOPC1, on newly injured patients with complete thoracic
              injury.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord_injuries#cite_note-6"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> A diverse array of other treatments are being researched, including biomaterial solutions,<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord_injuries#cite_note-7"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> cell replacement therapies, and electronic stimulative devices.</span></p>

              <p>like that 8:30 PM show today hosted by Chew Chor Meng who traces the history of pig organ soup, and he interviews the hawker vendors in Singapore and then he went to Teochew province in china to talk with the chefs and vendors there to find out the origins.</p>
