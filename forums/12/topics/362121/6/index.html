              <p>From an outsider's view, one might think that it is a bad thing for your brother's gf to remain by his side, but for your brother's gf herself, it is the direct opposite.</p>
              <p>She might be saddened by the fact that your brother might never be able to make use of his body parts below his neck again ( Touchwood ), but she is definitely happy that your brother is still alive, and that she could remain by his side.</p>
              <p>Let her decide for herself, for if her feelings for your brother are truly that strong, no matter what happens to your brother, she would choose to remain by his side.</p>
              <p>And tell your brother, he is lucky to have such a gf. Tell him not to chase her away, as he will regret it later.</p>

              <p>for yr bro's gf to think that way shows tt theirs was a strong relationship. ya like u said let her decide for herself. even if they r no longer in a relationship, she can still b a gd fren esp when she understands him..</p>
              <p>with her ard i think it can also help him emotionally. he will need all e concern he can get from ppl he loves.</p>

              <p>no problem lah......nobody here is rushing you for updates.</p>
              <p>take your time. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"> your main concern now is the condition of your bro, not this forum. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></p>
              <p>since the doctor says the infection is clearing, then on the positive side, it may be that he is gradually going to be healthy enough to leave hospital soon; we never know!</p>
              <p>as the saying goes, "slowly but surely". <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></p>
              <p>as for your bro's gf, we as outsides can't really say much.</p>
              <p>this thing must be handled by your bro when he gets better and if his gf feels that she doesn't wanna break up with him, let her be. as long as she's happy, can liao.</p>
              <p>and for your bro, he may not like the fact that his gf wants to stick with him, but seriously, in his heart, he will be happy on a sub-conscious level.</p>
              <p>The fact that he spares a thought for the gf is another separate matter.</p>
              <p>for all you know, maybe 5 years down the road, he'll be healthy enough to sit in wheelchair and propel himself around. This kind of medical thing nobody, including doctors, can predict. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>
