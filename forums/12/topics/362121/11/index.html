              try to correct my tone and pronunciation and i will keep sayin the
              word until i get it correct.. but cos of my ventilator to my neck,

              <p>lol, don't worry lah, i reply every 2 - 3 days, just right for me. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>
              <p>as for looks and stares from other people, it's natural lah. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></p>
              <p>take it as a part of life, because if people don't look or stare, then they're not humans.</p>
              <p>Maybe ghosts?! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="icon_confused.gif"></p>
              <p>even for me, when i see a beggar in office area, i will look.</p>
              <p>when i see ang-mohs giving out flyers for some kung-fu club, i also look and stare at them.</p>
              <p>when i see chio girls, i also stare (a lot, in fact).</p>
              <p>when i see the color of the sky during sunset is very different from usual, i also stare a lot. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></p>
              <p>some people like me, when i see physically disabled folks, my brain just ignore the physically disabled part and treat him like normal, because i know how it feels to be seen differently (btw, in the past when i was a kid, i had operations on my right ear and had to go to school with a huge boxy bandage on the ear and imagine how the other kids saw me).</p>
              <p>however, if people stare AND ALSO make nasty remarks, then obviously that's un-acceptable, but very few humans are like that.</p>
              <p>if there are, it just shows they're animals with bad upbringing. And I believe any one of your friends, your family members or gfs or even the folks here will stand up for you in such cases and make that animal eat back his own words. Period. End of matter. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></p>
              <p>you gotta get used to people looking at you. Once you accept that, you'll feel a lot more free and liberated, and a lot less fearful.</p>
              <p>Maybe you can try this in future: if they look at you, look back at them and make eye contact with them. Smile a bit in a friendly manner at them. Look at them and do not break eye contact until they're the 1st one to look away. This can greatly help you to overcome the uncomfortable aspect of people staring at you. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></p>
              <p>so, nurse coming tomorrow (31 Aug)? Good for you! do tell us how she is like. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>
              <p>as for the speech therapy, i believe it can be improved with time, although the process will be slow and require lots of patience, and cannot be rushed (maybe u can practice at home too).</p>
              <p>i used to go to speech therapy lessons during my toddler years due to cleft palate (hole in the throat) and couldn't pronouce words properly. It took like 1 - 2 years to overcome it, so i'm sure u can too. If you give up or don't have faith in it, then you won't have the heart to accept the lessons, and if you don't accept the lessons, u can never improve your speech. Cheer up, dude. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>
              <p>and btw, sorry to trouble your sis. i know my posts are long but u can take 5 days to read them and then your sis can take another 1 week to type replies bit by bit.</p>
              <p>Nobody is rushing. Pace of life is fast in Singapore but we can choose to slow it down if it makes us happy. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></p>
              <p>see ye! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>

              <p>go hospital, u can see people of all sort of conditions and stuff.....helps to widen your view of the world. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"> i realized that everytime i go hospital, i learn something new in life.</p>
              <p>so, your nurse come already? how she's like? foreigner or local? chiling lin look-alike? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>
              <p>speech therapy, relax lah! for all u know, you already making progress but u may not know it. even if the therapist says you didn't make progress, so be it. Just try your best, and if after many years still cannot, what does it mean? It simply means that the therapist is not up to standard and you should find a better one. Not your fault.</p>
              <p>as for burden, aiyah, you think so much wor.......that's the REAL purpose of family and friends. If "friends" are those people who play with you on Facebook and go makan with you, but suddenly go missing when you're in need, then obviously those are not friends. In fact, real friends won't feel bothered or irritated when taking of another friend, not to mention burden. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></p>

              <p>go hospital, u can see people of all sort of conditions and stuff.....helps to widen your view of the world. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"> i realized that everytime i go hospital, i learn something new in life.</p>
              <p>so, your nurse come already? how she's like? foreigner or local? chiling lin look-alike? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>
              <p>speech therapy, relax lah! for all u know, you already making progress but u may not know it. even if the therapist says you didn't make progress, so be it. Just try your best, and if after many years still cannot, what does it mean? It simply means that the therapist is not up to standard and you should find a better one. Not your fault.</p>
              <p>as for burden, aiyah, you think so much wor.......that's the REAL purpose of family and friends. If "friends" are those people who play with you on Facebook and go makan with you, but suddenly go missing when you're in need, then obviously those are not friends. In fact, real friends won't feel bothered or irritated when taking of another friend, not to mention burden. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></p>
              <p>some people like ForbiddenSinner and dkcx very busy wor, so cannot blame them.</p>
              <p>their work and studies already tying them down to the floor and they can't even breathe.</p>

              <p>That is what you need to do but speech therapy is not 24/7 and rather than ever let yourself have time to think or feel bad/sorry for yourself, try and see whether you can spent your time more meaningfully doing something :)</p>
              <p>Being a psy minor student, i believe in the power of the mind and its ability to sometimes even overcome physical limits so don't let your mind be constraint by your physical limits but get your mind to overcome them instead.</p>
