              <p>to be honest, of course i won't want to be in your condition, but the thing is, you're able to have peace, something which most of us won't have, for a long time. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></p>
              <p>so, what did the doctor says? able to sit up in the next few months? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></p>
              <p>sometimes i want to give this doctor a good shaking so that once he's pressured, he can think of something instead of being in "maintenance mode".</p>
              <p>btw, you need to rest more lah, don't think so much. Think too much will only harm your mental and physical health. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></p>
              <p>oh yeah, that story is about 8 sec school kids last year.</p>
              <p>one of them is a Thai-Chinese who is a medium also, and i think the 8 of them all played too much of this online game called "Slayers", and got obsessed, always thinking that this world will be coming to an end, and that WW III is coming too, and that demons will destroy this world. They also think they'll become the heroes who will eventually save this world.</p>
              <p>that Thai-Chinese guy is the big brother of the group lah, the others all obey and respect him. So, one day, after a birthday party with lots of other friends, the 8 of them stayed behind and the Thai-Chinese guy told them they've to sacrifice themselves by jumping down from the HDB flat, so that WW III will come and demons will descend from the heavens, and they'll become Slayers and will be able to save the world. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p>the reporters also went to their house and found some notebooks, and on the notebooks, were stuff like weird diagrams and the names of some gods, like "Freezing king", "Fire king" etc......(though what kind of gods these are, I dunno and never heard before).</p>
              <p>kinda crazy and sad case lah.....hope people don't follow their examples.</p>
              <p>save what world? even if need to save the world, it's Nikar's job, not these clowns. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p>as quoted from Devil May Cry 4 (xBox 360 game):</p>
              <p><strong><em>"Humans. They are stupid and foolish. It takes a journey to hell for them to accept and praise their god".</em></strong></p>
              <p>oh yeah, 8 of these boys are supposed to commit suicide, but in the end, only the Thai-Chinese guy himself and another friend jumped. The other 6 of them back-out after hearing the 2 guys smashed onto the ground and one of them groaning and withering in pain. 1 of them also fainted. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p>also, i think the chinese paper also report that the Thai-Chinese guy is a medium of the Tua Ya Pek (minor rank Netherworld taoist god) and has been a dancing at rituals for years.</p>
              <p>with regards to these mediums, iI read from one geomancy / supernatural book once that only very minor deities and those ghosts / spirits will possess human body to make the human do their bidding. No self-respecting god or deity will do such despicable acts, according to the author, a geomancy master who travelled the world witnessing all kinds of cases.</p>
              <p>btw, even if a thread is hijacked, won't be banned or closed one lah, unless go out of control, like too much flaming and trolling etc. Besides, 99.9% of threads in SGF tend to stray away from their original topic. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>
              <p>anyway, take care in the meantime! will talk to you soon. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></p>

              <p>shaking your doctor = grabbing him up by collar and shake him to and fro</p>
              <p>maintenance mode = not doing anything but just maintaining the current state of condition due to already satisfied with the current results</p>
              <p>i tend to exaggerate a bit and be over-drama sometimes, don't mind me. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>
              <p>so, it's been 3 days since i last post.....how u now? feeling better? hope the blue black patches on your arms gone already? don't worry lah, most likely (from my deduction) is due to not enough blood or blood flow quite weak.</p>
              <p>the mod won't close this thread lah, don't worry.</p>
              <p>if they close, then we can shake them also. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>
              <p>be sure to take care of yourself these few days; the haze is quite bad yesterday and today, and will remain so in the next few days.</p>
              <p>got watch Buzzing cashier this Monday? the stall owner (the mother) got both legs scalded very badly from the top of the thighs downward (very red and gross to look at), and the father got diabetes, and the son, on the day of the casting, got admitted to hospital due to viral infection of the brain, but in the end, the mother passed the show lah.</p>
              <p>usually, these stalls will sell anywhere from 300 - 780 bowls of dish per day after they attend Buzzing cashier show. cool huh?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>then yesterday i also watch that "Wo yao chang sia qui" (that Tue 8 PM show hosted by Taiwanese host Zhen Guo Chen).</p>
              <p>that guy in the beginning, wearing the white jacket, is irritating as fark, though.</p>
              <p>feel like slapping him. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="icon_twisted.gif"></p>
              <p>pretty arrogant and jumpy for his age (27 yrs old), keep moving and twitching non-stop and i can see he's just trying to be enthu, but over-done and trying too hard liao! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>

              <p>Blue-black will be worrying for jeremy as that is a sign of blood clots and if that starts to appear on his arms and the condition is not retified, he could loss his arms as well so its a rather serious condition should it occur.</p>
              <p>The guy is irritating but that is an entertainment show la. If anyone behaves proper then there is alot less entertainment value liao.</p>
