              <p>ha ha, glad to hear that. All we can hope now is for you to recover gradually and gain some use of the spine to at least sit up. your ultimate goal should be to be able to sit in a wheelchair. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></p>
              <p>maybe not now, but 10 yrs, 20 yrs later, who knows? maybe there'll be breakthrough in science in 5 years due to stem cell research etc.</p>
              <p>also, from what u say, i assume you amputated both your legs? is it due to accident hitting the legs too badly and they broke etc.?</p>

              <p>one thing at a time! now you need to get used to it first, then after get used to this state liao, then focus on feeling happy and getting better, and the ultimate goal is the wheelchair and ability to move the wheelchair around! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></p>
              <p>besides, you're not alone! i think there's some support forums for people with C-2 and C-1 paralysis, and they're from all over the world going thru the same thing as you, and some have it worst. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="icon_neutral.gif"></p>
              <p>there's this teen in the US with C-1 who had to stay in some public home cos' he had no parents and had an abusive guardian, which is sad for him.</p>

              <p>good to hear that you can at least sit in wheelchair.</p>
              <p>although spine gave problem after a short while, at least it's do-able with time. that's what i'm sure of. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>
              <p>btw, u keep pets? pets (especially dogs) have been known and proven to lift the spirits of people and have made them way happier. not just extending human lifespans, but also relieve them of their stress and unhappiness and let them feel even more complete than ever. How about a small puppy? Or dwarf hamsters? cute and easy to maintain. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>
              <p>for the visit, we will have to organize first and let you know if we're coming. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>
              <p>btw, roughly where do u stay? (no need give full address, something like "tampines" or "yishun") will do.</p>

              <p>whoa, i'm so happy to hear that! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"> at least it shows you've hope.</p>
              <p>it's a good thing that doctor can make such suggestions, otherwise it will just prove that he's a fresh grad who just came out from NUS.</p>
              <p>within 3 months, if you can sit up, that's a very big achievement.</p>
              <p>even if 3 months cannot, wait for 6 months, or even 1 year (btw, 6 months in medical world is a very short time). then when your body get used to sitting up, you can move around in wheelchair or can get people to push you around to sight-see, which is awesome. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></p>
              <p>that machine which "enables" you to stand is the ultimate achievement but it's good that at least your doctor mentions that, so you got hope.</p>
              <p>but for now, let's not look so far and just be strong and focus on regaining mental strength and willpower so that you'll get good stuff coming in 3 months time. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></p>
              <p>as they say, the courage to live is more powerful than anything in the world. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></p>
              <p>tampines no problem lah.....my cousins and grandma all living there....which part of tampines? near interchange? or around the East View primary school area? or is it near the SOKA centre / community center there (St Hilda sec school).</p>
              <p>IMO, tampines is a very serene and peaceful area in SG to live in, unlike other parts like Jurong. if i could, i would buy flat in Tampines.</p>

              <p>i assume then, that your family members occasionally move your arms and massage it for you etc., to prevent blood clotting? (sometimes when body stays still for a very long time, the blood can "clot" and harden).</p>
              <p>anyway, no need to worry......who needs you to entertain us? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>
              <p>if we need to be entertained, then we might as well stay at home and play games or watch porn. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>
              <p>it should be us who entertain you, although i must say people like me can't do magic tricks or sing or juggling acts. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>
              <p>anyway, visit won't be so soon lah....now i'm gathering some people and discuss first. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"> tampines polyclinic i have never seen it before, as i only go there 1 - 2 times per year. i always feel the pace of life there is a lot slower than other parts of Singapore (in jurong, the pace is quite frentic).</p>
              <p>btw, now 7-moth festival, your family got pray to the "good brothers"? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>

              <p>Don't think so much. Need to keep your mind and spirit positive since some research in psychology has shown that a strong and positive mind can help the body heal. There was a story in my psy text that talked about how a person managed to use his willpower and recover from paralysis and moved on his own with abit of help when his doctors thought it was impossible.</p>
              <p>Some interesting articles and books i came across<br>http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2005/08/050805101335.htm<br>http://www.thescizone.com/news/9010/avon-lake-grad-fights-through-spinal-cord-injury<br>http://www.travisroyfoundation.org/pages/resources-books-bios.htm</p>

              <p>don't think so much leh, bro! this is what family members are supposed to do for each other, to stick through thick and thin. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></p>
              <p>like i always say, this is very likely not going to be permanent (i.e: you won't forever need people to help you turn in bed). once your body and gradually gets stronger a bit like the doc says, everything will be way easier, or even slightly easier, than it is now. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>
              <p>anyway, employ nurse is a good idea, maybe your family can look for cheaper alternatives? what about maids? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>
              <p>i personally believe in the power of the mind, though. Scientists are now doing research on the brain, but one article I read in the past was this:</p>
              <p>If a child has cancer, and instead of feeling sad and cry, he daydreams every now and then about battleships "entering" his brain and shooting lasers to kill the cancer cells.</p>
              <p>Another same child with cancer as well, on the other hand, just refuse to do anything and cry and sob the whole day.</p>
              <p>the child in the 1st example would have a far higher chance of getting well and that's how miracles, and things, once thought to be impossible, happen! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>
              <p>since you can't walk or sit-up now, the least you can do is to be happy and stay positive. Lie in bed, but enjoy the peace and watch TV shows. Day dreams and fantasize. Think about what you're gonna do in the future. <strong>No, you're not going to lie in the bed forever. You want to sit up at least in a wheelchair and get people, or even yourself, to wheel yourself around. Once you can sit-up in a wheelchair, the possibilities starts to unlock.</strong></p>
              <p>although you're lying in bed now, think about those 2 Republic poly students who got killed in the train accident some weeks back. Both the corpses have broken bones and broken limbs. And the guy's skull was CRUSHED and his brain juice all splattered out.</p>
              <p>Now, <strong>THAT'S SAD</strong>. They don't even have any more chance to live. You might think, "<em>Oh, they're dead, that's better, unlike me, want to die cannot die, want to live cannot live</em>".</p>
              <p>well, at least you've another chance at life. You're not gone forever, unlike them.</p>
              <p>so be positive and think on the bright side. Think of freaking beautiful rainbows, of the gentle Northern Lights, on the sun rays that shine in your bedroom everyday, of the moonlight that shines on certain nights.  Do not think of hell, or think of despair, or think of lying in bed forever. That's bad for you and for everyone who are concerned about you.</p>
              <p>i've been thinking ever since I read this thread, that I would feel pretty lost and helpless if I were in your shoes. However, after the initial shock, I would start to feel very angry that my fate is like this and no way in hell am I gonna accept it. If there's really nothing i can do, the least i can do for myself is to stay positive and bright. That's an achievement in it's own right.</p>
              <p>and plus......you've people who still care for you. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>btw, you got watch Buzzing Cashier 2 today? That 8 PM show on channel 8 with Quan Yifeng and Kym Ng as the hosts, and their goal is to help hawker stalls and coffee shop stalls who have no business.</p>
              <p>Today, the stall vendor is an auntie and her son is a 25-yrs old gangster with tattoos all over his body, and when it's time for him to report and learn the cooking skills to cook prawn mee, he don't even bother to get up and the hosts and TV crew have to visit his house and found him still sleeping in bed. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>
              <p>his sister is quite cute and chio, though. U got watch? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>
              <p>Quite interesting show that helps hawker vendors. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>
              <p>take care!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>*<strong>To everyone here</strong> : pls don't say things like "i feel sad for you, TS" or "sorry to hear this". We should all help TS by being positive and not keep dwelling on the accident or the sad things. That's the very least we can do for him. Too bad we're not doctors.</p>

              <p>ha ha, no problem! it's a pity i'm quite busy and lack of time nowadays due to need to learn art etc., otherwise i will reply to your posts many times per day. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></p>
              <p>yeah, on a realistic point of view, you *very likely* won't be able to move again by yourself, but as i said before, as long as can sit in wheelchair, then that's great liao.</p>
              <p>that said, don't dismiss the very possibility of a wheelchair that can be controlled by brainwaves and thus no need to use hands. i think there's some devices which already have this function liao. just a matter of time for your case. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></p>
              <p>as for your state of mind, only you yourself and Time can heal it slowly. Others like your family or your friends or me can only help you speed it up but won't be able to fully help your clear your mind. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>

              <p>get them to hire a chio nurse (North Korea President Kim Jong IL has a bevy of personal nurses and all of them are specially selected based on looks and are as pretty as models / supermodels). better still, select the nurse or the maid from catalogue to see which one you "kan de guo yan".</p>
              <p>u can talk to the nurse and the nurse can talk to you, share experiences, life stories, discuss TV programs together etc? now you won't be so bored! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>

              <p>ha ha, work to do?! very stress sometimes lah......see the computer screen until the head become dizzy and have the sinking feeling if stare too long (like vertigo like that).</p>
              <p>don't think too much lah.....seems that you've many activities to keep you busy too, like counselling and speech therapy. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></p>
              <p>in many ways, you're already a winner. I mean, come on.</p>
              <p>You may have only 2 limbs, but you've got a wonderful family, friends and a great girlfriend (gfs like this where to find nowadays??!!).</p>
              <p>Some of us here like me, got 4 limbs, but never had a gf and no friends even, and don't seem to be having a gf anywhere in the future soon. i dunno about others, but i would gladly say you're way above me in many areas, and i'm not kidding.</p>
              <p>actually, nurse chio or not is not really important lah, like you say.......but if can be chio, then better lah. imagine the nurse is like 1.78m tall, look like Chiling Lin or Zhang Ziyi like that.....<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif">.....seriously, you should fantasize and day-dream about crazy things like thus. It really lifts your spirits. Bits of fantasizing and escapism is very healthy in reality, and it's been proven by psychologists. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>
              <p>btw, how's the speech therapy like? i assume the therapist talks to you and get you to speak, then she corrects your tone / words to make them accurate?</p>
              <p>have a nice day! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></p>
