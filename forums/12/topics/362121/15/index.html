              <p>thanks a lot for the update! umm....i do think it's a pity the arms got amputated, but well, this is the only option.</p>
              <p>did the doc says roughly how long the induced coma will last? 2 weeks? 1 month?</p>
              <p>i hope he doesn't feel shocked or traumatised when he wakes up.</p>
              <p>also, i hope when he wakes up, his spine will have gotten stronger so that he is able to seat up in a wheelchair.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #008000;">PARIS (AFP) - – Paralysed rats whose spinal cords had been severed from their brains were made to run again using a technique that scientists say can work for people, according to a study released Sunday.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008000;">Consistent electrical stimulation and drugs enabled the rats to walk on their hind legs on a treadmill -- bearing the full weight of the body -- within a week of being paralysed.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008000;">With the addition of physical therapy, the rodents were able after several weeks to walk and run without stumbling for up to 30 minutes, reported the study, published in the journal Nature Neuroscience.......................</span></p>

              <p>Hi nikar.. the doc says it will take at least a mth... it all
              depends.. my bro condition still have not stabilise and his body
              still veri weak... both arms in thick bandages oso..</p>
              <p>we also hope my bro dun get too traumatised when he woke up.. he
              still duNO tt his arms are amputated.. tt's y the doc suggest
              induce coma so that when he wakes up, if he get shocked, it wun
              affect too much on his body.. doc say when his body and spine get
              stronger after tis period of induced coma, will let my bro try
              sit up again..</p>

              <p>i see......tell him don't give up hope yet! just look at the post above by xtreiyer.</p>
              <p>a few years and he might be able to sit up straight and twist turn his body, assuming above technology gets released to mainstream.</p>
              <p>btw, i'm a bit surprised how come your bro didn't know his arms got amputated?</p>
              <p>is it delibrately kept from him so that he won't resist the amputation?</p>
              <p>i think your family has to think of reasons, ways and ideas during this time while he's asleep, to figure out how to console him when he wakes up.......i pray that he'll take it easy.</p>

              <p>hi! good to hear from you again. hope you've been fine, and also good to hear the doc fixed fake hands for your bro. although he won't be able to move them, at least it's better than nothing. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></p>
              <p>btw, your bro lie on the bed for so long, do u guys like trim his hair and shave his moustache for him? because for many guys, the hair and moustache area grows long very fast. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></p>

              <p>I know it sounds hard to believe but there are actually people out there who are in worse situation than you. People who might be in coma, people who lost all their limbs, people who might not even be able to get around even with a wheelchair. Yes I know, why would you need to know about people who are in a more miserable situation but my point is, be grateful for what you have.</p>
              <p>You are unsure of coping in the future but what about others who does not even have a future to cope with? Don't be sad, do cheer up and find your meaning in life again. Everybody have their happy place on earth, so.. I'm sure and hope you will find yours someday though it might not be anywhere soon. Don't be discouraged, your self-worth is more than what you think it is.</p>
