              <p>ya goin hosp can see alot of tings and learn quite a few tings..
              most of the nurses and docs in hosp oso noes me cos of my age in
              this condition.. they will always greet me and cheer me up whenever
              they see me... actually smtimes i love goin to hosp..</p>
              <p>the nurse is a local in her late 30s.. married le and still
              quite pretty.. quite an experienced nurse.. knows what she needs to
              do for my case.. takin gd care of me.. she also helpin me type this
              reply cos my sis not around..</p>
              <p>yup speech therapy will need time i guess... ya i noe everyone
              is bz around here and my family too.. i will be the onli 1 tt is
              not bz and veri peaceful 24/7.</p>
              <p>nov or dec shldnt be a prob unless smth happen to me again... i
              oso hope by then i can sit up abit and talk abit more
              properly..</p>

              <p>hosp people know you good mah! now you become a mini celebrity of sorts! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></p>
              <p>the gardens in those hosps are especially serene.</p>
              <p>so, how have you been these few days and how's your nurse so far? since she also types for you, then i think better not talk or bad-mouth her. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>being busy is not as good as you think.......50% of the time at work have to deal with a lot of stress and misunderstandings, like getting scolded by boss in front of everyone for no good reason (sometimes is boss's bad temper or mood not good), and worse yet, have to play politics and stuff with colleagues.</p>
              <p>the other poster is right, though. maybe since you're free, perhaps you can use your mind to think of something to do. Like ideas. Then, you can roughly post them here and get us to work out a plan for you. In other words, you think of ideas, like something you want to create etc., and we do the work etc. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></p>
              <p>i hope ForbiddenSinner will organize the outing in late Nov - Dec, though! usually that period everyone will be more free. One thing is: don't curse yourself!</p>
              <p>why should something happen to you? think of good things and happy stuff, not negative stuff and bad things. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></p>

              <p>why should we mind? even if your house is a shabby 1-room flat in toa payoh crawling with cockroaches, we'll still go. The only thing is that we gotta bring some insecticide, that's all! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>
              <p>also, i suggest that if unable to go together, we can break the visit into 2 or 3 groups, meaning 1st group go on this day, 2nd group go on that day etc.</p>

              <p>hey bro! how have you been these few days?! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>
              <p>getting even better than before? btw, if you really bored, how about getting the entire DVD of the Taiwanese drama "Love"? (shown every Sat and Sun, 7 - 10 PM).</p>
              <p>that show has 700++ freaking episodes.......should be enough for you watch. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>
              <p>the show is quite good too.</p>
              <p>anyway, you won't be lonely lah.......got your nurse, your family, friends, gf, hospital people and us! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>
              <p>anyway, i think if we go as one big group is not very good, since the chances of contaiminating your health is higher and it will be terrible if any one of us has H1N1.</p>
              <p>heck, i cannot think of the consequences if any one of us has it. so, we are going to come in smaller groups to reduce the chances.</p>
              <p>sorry to hear that you've flu. The weather recently is quite cool....and every night here in Jurong has thunderstorms and showers.</p>
              <p>this morning at 5 AM suddendly sky turn red and the thunder roar like crazy and woke me up, then my imagination started to run wild and i was thinking what will happen if suddendly got hurricane hit singapore (the thunder was one of the loudest i ever heard my whole life).</p>
              <p>but then i assured myself not possible lah, cos' if there is, then the meteorological station would have warned us liao, esp Singapore is well known for their efficiency.</p>
              <p>but still very scary, like armaggedon like that. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>
              <p>i heard tampines has much fewer rainfall than jurong area, though.</p>
              <p>everytime i go tampines to visit my grandma, never rain much (if at all) and that's one of the reason why i like there so much. The smell and sense there is also nicer than other parts of SG. maybe i got special connection to tampines. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>
              <p>i think tampines girls also cuter too. LOL! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>
              <p>anyway, take care wor! will talk to you again maybe this coming wed or thu.</p>
