              <p>but yest i juz received a bad news frm the doc again.. doc say with the serious spine and nerve damage that i suffered, i might not recover any strength back in upper body but instead there is a 95% chance that i may be fully paralysed frm neck down in the next half a yr... cry :'(</p>

              <p>Sorry that you had to bear such news.</p>
              <p>But hey, it aint the end yet. Everyday, science and technology is advancing at phenomenal speeds. While it may not be tomorrow that mankind will make a breakthrough, but one day soon, that breakthrough will eventually come.</p>
              <p>Have a little more faith in humanity. There is hope. In the meantime, take good care of yourself, and keep yourself motivated with things that can make you happy or bring a cheer. Dwelling on what had happened will only make one suffer more.</p>
              <p>Take courage, buddy, mankind aint gonna let you down. Billions of dollars are spent on research for breakthroughs. You, with your educated mind, can also assist in it. Get well soon! <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/ccmathteam.com/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>

              <p>Dont give up on therapies. Of course, do the things you want. Have you asked for a second opinion or seek international specialists for help? I am sure the doctors can recommend.</p>

              <p>I guess most of us here have not much experience or advice to offer at this stage including myself.</p>
              <p>Do not give up on therapy, the docts said a 95% chance of paralysis but theres still that 5% chance of hope. Even though the chance is low, do not give up on yourself. Miracles do happen and if you have a strong willpower, you might just be that 5%. Give up now and nothing can be done so don't give up fighting.</p>
              <p>The brain is still the most powerful part of the body and as long as its still working, you can still do things. There are people who use their head to type on the keyboard and can still do things so don't give up on life, it is precious and being alive is a fortune.</p>

              <p>Don't think too much. Rest your mind. There is nothing that you can resolve now. Things had gotten beyond your control. When in such a situation, best sit back and be a passenger, relax.</p>
              <p>Just don't give up hope yet. As Dkcx has said, there is still a 5% chance. Coupled with our science advances, one day soon illness such as yours can be remedied.

              <p>It is up to you, but if you give now, any chances of recovery will immediately fall to zero.</p>
              <p>If it is because of money concerns, then I cannot blame you.</p>
              <p>But if that is not the case, why are you giving up when those around you are not? If someone is willing to type all these out for you, that means he/she wants you to read the encouragements which the people here will give you, in hope that you will change your mind.</p>
              <p>Do think about it. If you were to not give yourself a chance now, you would regret it later having to burden your parents, because you did not try all you could when you have the chance.</p>

              <p>Persevere. Life is a test. It's not a fair test for everyone, but it's still something your bro can conquer.</p>

              <p>Hi, don't give up on the treatment.</p>
              <p>The  rehabilitation and physiotherapy will help to maximise their potential, or help them get used to life in a wheelchair, and to help teach techniques which make everyday life easier.</p>
              <p>There are forums like this: <a href="http://www.apparelyzed.com/forums/">http://www.apparelyzed.com/forums/</a>. Hope it might help to provide some support. I also read that it is still possible to get involved in some sports.</p>
              <p>I believe the bodies and mind have amazing abilities to heal. :)</p>
