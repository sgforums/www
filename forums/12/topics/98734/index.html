I also feel the same as u do. Even though I have been thru it a few times and I know the hurt, now I am stil doing it! So I guess that makes me worse than u??<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>Its kinda strange but thats me. Thats my character. I tend to do things quietly for the person I love and hope that she will take note of it. But often, it wasnt to be that way. Even when others start to notice it, the person involved just refused to reciprocrate it. So mayb i am unlucky in love??<br><br>Or mayb its retribution for me that I hurt a girl when I was stil very very young??? Matters of the heart are hard to say. But I do hope that U will stand up fine and one day u will see that ur prince is rite there waiting for u.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

In a r/s.. time is not a matter.. doens't mean you went wif him for 4 yrs.. you know him absolutely from head to toe.. 4yrs.. long not say long.. short not say short.. it depends on how your 4yrs are when you both are together??? good or bad?? Are you happy??<br><br>You may feel that you wasted your 4yrs with him.. then make sure you learn your lesson.. and never waste your 4 yrs again.. Woman don't have many many 4yrs.. You see through him.. thne move on.. He already move on.. and proudly tell you that "hey.. i'm moving on good with my new life with a new girl.. SO what about you?" You proved to him.. that without him.. you live even a better life!!<br><br>Concentrate on what you supoose to do.. and move up and forward.. ahkico you are a brave girl.. Face the reality and don't dwell into this anymore!<br><br>Cheers..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></div></blockquote>Thank!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  Gettin over it is hard..
