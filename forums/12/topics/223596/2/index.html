I take it back, OK? I take it back.<br>Sally: You can't take it back.<br>Harry: Why not?<br>Sally: Because it's already out there.<br>Harry: Oh jeez. What are we supposed to do? Call the cops? It's already out there!<br>Sally: Just let it lie, OK?<br>Harry: Great! Let it lie. That's my policy. (They get into the car.) That's what I always say. Let it lie.
