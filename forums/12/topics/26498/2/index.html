            <div class='col-md body'>You can try to put on a smile when u see yr friends,( i mean natural smile), try to engage a conversation with them and tok about someting that will interest everyone but do not be an attention seeker cos some ppl dun like those who jus want to catch their attention.. Lastly looks dun matter so much,wat matters is how you present yourself in front of your friends and make them feel fun wif u..

You will get the attention if you're being yourself, if you're able to stand out from the crowd. But till then, there will be wanted and unwanted, positive and negative attention. Can you handle it? There's always pros and cons.</div>
