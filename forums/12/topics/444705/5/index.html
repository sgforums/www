              <p><br> Since she got mental illness, you should show more care and love on
              her, take all the scolding and comment from her as secondary.
              Without any conditioning, you must make the move to serve her well,
              it will take an uphill task from you, a very stressful one, and a
              need for control and understanding one. But then, to think that she
              is your mother and you are doing it for your mother, deep inside
              you, take the pride and joy of it. Read the below.....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After their first three dates, his girlfriend told him an
              astonishing piece of news that changed his life forever.</p>
              <p>It was a "dark secret", 61-year old <span>Raymond
              Anthony Fernando</span> remembered of what his then-girlfriend
              <span>Doris Lau Siew Lang</span> told him almost three
              decades back.</p>
              <p>I am schizophrenic, she had told him.</p>
              <p>If that was not surprising enough, she also told him that she
              was a patient at the Institute of Mental Health, otherwise known as
              Woodbridge Hospital in the 60s.</p>
              <p>Yet, the secret she guarded so carefully — one that scared away
              all her previous boyfriends upon hearing — finally stood the test
              of one man's faith and love for her.</p>
              <p>Raymond, a Singaporean whose heritage is part Eurasian and part
              Sri Lankan, listened as Doris poured her heart out about her past
              and her condition.</p>
              <p>Schizophrenia is a group of psychotic disorders characterised by
              disturbances in thought, perception, affectation, behaviour and
              communication lasting longer than six months.</p>
              <p>At the onset, because there was little public awareness on
              <span>schizophrenia</span>, Doris' symptoms of headaches,
              insomnia, a loss of appetite and even being delusional sometimes
              worried her family.</p>
              <p>They believed she was charmed, and brought her to a medium
              instead. The delay worsened her condition. It had escalated to a
              point when she harboured suicidal thoughts. Back then in the 60s, a
              relative who worked in the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) heard
              of her unexplainable illness and recommended Doris be warded. Her
              condition finally stabilised.</p>
              <p>Instead of breaking up with her after hearing what she said, the
              freelance television actor and motivational speaker asked her,
              "Will you marry me?"</p>
              <p>"I was deeply moved by her sincerity and her caring nature. I
              had dated many girls, but Doris was very down to earth… Doris is a
              very timid person and I decided I wanted to give her a better life,
              so I asked for her hand in marriage," Raymond told this writer.</p>
              <p>The couple tied the knot in 1974.</p>
              <p>This year, the couple celebrate their 37-year anniversary.</p>
              <p>Doris is still battling with schizophrenia and as of five years
              ago, arthritis as well. As for Raymond, he too has diabetes, high
              cholesterol and cataract.</p>
              <p><strong>Challenges of caring</strong></p>
              <p>Medical costs aside, Raymond revealed that the road is tough to
              say the least. He used to struggle between juggling work and caring
              for his wife.</p>
              <p>In 1995, under tremendous amount of stress, he attempted
              suicide.</p>
              <p>In retrospect, he said, "I deeply regret taking that route —
              imagine what would happen to Doris if I had not survived."</p>
              <p>"It's still very tough," Raymond admitted. "But I have to stay
              and remain strong for Doris. She needs me badly."</p>
              <p>The couple had unfortunately lost their only two children — one
              through a miscarriage and the other through an abortion. In the
              latter case, the couple made that decision as Doris would have to
              get off the drugs that would affect the foetus.</p>
              <p>The devout Catholic relies on his faith to get by. He left his
              31-year job as a public relations officer in October and is now
              working from home as a <a rel="nofollow" href="http://us.lrd.yahoo.com/SIG=11gg5e7sq/EXP=1326699474/**http%3A//www.rayofhope.per.sg/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">writer</span></span></a> to earn income to pay
              their bills.</p>
              <p>Caring for his wife turned him into an advocate for the mentally
              ill.</p>
              <p>"It's been extremely tough for her as Doris' sole caregiver,
              especially when the support structure for caregivers of the
              mentally ill is clearly lacking — something which I have been
              fighting for, for decades."</p>
              <p>But Raymond never regretted taking her as his wife.</p>
              <p>"No, I will not ever walk away from taking care of Doris because
              of one simple reason — I love her deeply," he said</p>
              <p>Raymond handles all the household chores and finances while
              maintaining his writing jobs and caring for his wife. The last job
              entails taking her to numerous medical appointments at Tan Tock
              Seng Hospital, IMH and polyclinics monthly, and ensuring she
              religiously takes her medication — 52 tablets a daily. He visits
              the same hospital for his eye treatment.</p>
              <p>Although her schizophrenia is now stabilised, Raymond reveals
              that it may relapse anytime. "The symptoms of her arthritis
              condition caused her to be in tremendous physical pain in all her
              joints that left her mobility severely impaired. In severe pain, it
              can trigger a relapse of her mental illness," he said.</p>
              <p>Doris had suffered a relapse before so he and the doctors are
              carefully monitoring her condition.</p>
              <p><strong>Symptoms</strong></p>
              <p>Raymond reveals how the symptoms first develop. He usually first
              notices physical tell-tale signs such as the white of her eyes
              turning slightly blue, and much dandruff appearing on her
              scalp.</p>
              <p>At the beginning, Doris would become uncannily quiet and
              fearful. "The slightest noise will affect her," Raymond said. Over
              time, she tends to become increasingly anxious and begins
              hallucinating. While she is not violent, her husband said, Doris
              cries when she hears buzzing in her ears and voices telling her to
              do "strange" things.</p>
              <p>"There were occasions when I had to sleep with the house keys
              under my pillow as she would wake up in the middle of the night and
              attempt to go downstairs to the void deck. She believed that her
              mother was waiting for her downstairs. But her mother had already
              passed away," Raymond said sadly.</p>
              <p>Traumatic experiences such as the loss of their children and the
              loss of her mother haunt her as well.</p>
              <p>The breaking point is when Doris begins talking about suicide.
              That is when Raymond is left with no choice but to admit her into
              hospital.</p>
              <p>"On most occasions, she would have to undergo ECT ( electro
              convulsive therapy). This is where mild current is applied to the
              brain every four seconds to stabilise her.  Most of the time,
              she requires at least six shots of ECT.  It is an extremely
              painful period for me," he said.<br> <br> She may require another knee operation should her medications fail,
              he adds.</p>
              <p>Despite all these, while he acknowledges that it is an uphill
              task to care for her as her arthritis condition worsens, he is
              prepared to fight this battle for he and his beloved wife.</p>
              <p>"If there's one thing you can say to your wife now, what would
              you say?" this reporter asked.</p>
              <p>"If schizophrenia is part of your life, then it must certainly
              be part of my life. I don't necessarily like what the illness does
              to you, but it is you who I love. And that will always be the
              guiding, motivating force of my life, Doris."</p>
