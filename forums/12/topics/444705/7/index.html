              <p>Ts I know it's tough.But we all couldn't choose our parents can we? Now all I propose to u see stop hating ur mother.I know it's fucking hard after all that she has done or will do to ur father.But let it go,focus on the situation at hand,to help your father.After u have done that.It would prove to ur mother that no matter what she throws and u and ur family.U can always take it.
               
              P.S I believe now just ignore her the best.That's my opinion luh.All the best ts,I will try pray for u.</p>

              <p>I do not really know you but here is my advice:</p>
              <p>Hating your parents is not a solution. I know how you feel about your mother. But, please save your emotions. Save your emotions for someone who deserve.</p>
              <p>If she keep coming back to "disturb" you and your family. Change the lock. Do not talk to her even when she talks to you. Just starring at her if you feel that she disturb you. Starring until she look away or go away. Some people messed up with their own minds that they are actually doing the right thing...</p>
              <p>The final solution. Avoid her. This is not a good solution but this is a good way to show her that you know about her mistake. Further, if you are a cruel person as I am (in some way I can be cruel), send her money or any thing that related to money on her birthdays, to remind her about her mistake.</p>

              <p>Yeah mancha is right.</p>
              <p>Please understand and support your father...</p>
              <p>Please understand your mother. She suffered much than you think... She could live poorly when she was small and she thought that MONEY can solve "every" problems. I think that is not totally true.</p>

              Don't lower down the standard of yours argue with this kind of people wait others said your dad never teach. It will make things worst. Divorce should be the parents issue not the child. Don't pull yourself into the picture and feel bad about it.
              
              You need to concentrate and do whatever you need to do. She will regret one day.
              Please so blame it on the woman charter, it is the greed of human make it worst. I am also a divorcee but mine went through very well. No custody fight no maintenance fight however not everyone is that luckily that wife's maintence only asked for a dollar.
              
              My mum left me when I was young and I follwed my dad. 3 yrs back my dad passed away due to cancer. My mum and siblings go through lawyer and court just to get my dad's business, asset and money. I was in the grief of losing my dad and I had to go to court like my second home. I decided to give up everything and get myself out of shit.
              
              I always told my son whatever what adults do and decide, don't interfer and do what he suspposed to do. You choose the kind of day you want to spend. Full of hatred or smiling

                      I agreed empty talk is cheap not only that even talk is also cheap. It is truth that no point spending too much time on someone that not worthwhile. Time wait for no man if continue to "entertain" this kind of people is simply waste of time but of cos it doesn't mean that it given chance to show disrespect.

                          Children are not susposed to interfer in adult things as they may not understand what is going on and easy being mislead by either party. In this case Father should jump in and explain but not adding fuel to fire. How much è‹¦ä¸­è‹¦ is up to Individual how you manage it? Successful doesn't come over night if this bit of issue can make you shity then what's next for you. You can't choose your parents but you choose the life you want.
              How much the children being affected is depends on upbring. Now may feel that life is è‹¦ but if know how to è‹¦ä¸­å�šä¹� then anything will be easier to handle than self pity.
