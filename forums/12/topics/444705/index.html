              <p>Summer, I'm not a legal expert, but let me put my opinion down.</p>
              <p>If the grounds for divorce is due to your mum's unreasonable behavior (e.g adultery, neglect kids, gamble and needs family to keep paying her debts), then your dad may be able to pay less or even nothing to your mum. You and your siblings can be witness to your mum's bad behavior, and your dad's sacrifices to keep the family going.</p>
              <p>If the insurance is paid by your dad, check if he can prove it (e.g payment is by GIRO from your dad's bank account). Then check with his lawyer, if it is possible to contest for ownership transfer of policy to his name without any transfer fee paid to your mum (other than the amts paid by your mum+interest).</p>
              <p>Write down your feelings and reasons in a letter about why you think your mum should not get any money from your dad's assets (e.g neglected the family, dad has been paying off your mum's debts, payment of exhorbitant sums of money to your mum will cause your family financial difficulties...etc). Do not lie, be honest and factual about the reasons. That way, even if you cannot appear in court, the letter will express your views.</p>
              <p>Sign the letter, and give it to your dad's lawyer. Btw, the letter may or may not be useful legally as you are below legal age, but children's views can provide strong evidence to sway the judge's opinion in a family court.</p>

              <p>Kilfer give some very good advice.</p>
              <p>:/ idk how it works liao lei..really hope that your mum doesn't have the full ability to sell off your insurance :S</p>
              <p>And about the letters, you can use that as proof!!! Only show that to your dad (and his lawyer if he has one), don't let your mum know you have that as proof. Den you can use those letters in court to show why your mum needs so much money.</p>
              <p>When in court, get ur dad's lawyer to force your mum to document exactly why she deserves so and so much money. And after she documents everything, show the judge the letters.</p>
              <p>Sorry I think I watch too many lawyer shows liao. But really hope your case will work out.</p>

              <p>You need to start searching and collecting all kinds of bills, invoices etc spent by your father for the last few years, esp on the part of maintenance for the family.</p>
              <p>Bills such as utilities, housing daily uses, insurances, and all the lot to show to the Court who is the one looking after the whole family. All if u can furnish the differences between the salaries between your parents to justify that eventhough Mum is satying alone in future her current wages is enough to provide for her.  You and dad (providing he is still healthy for a good fight) have to support each other emotionally throughout these period as it will be draining and long fight.</p>
              <p>As one of the forummer mentioned, write a comprehensive and concise letter to support your dad in this fight and show to the judges where your mum goes wrong.</p>
              <p>Frankly speaking, in every divorce case, thanks to Women Charter, men will alway be disadvantaged in the fight so be prepared mentally for the worst outcome.</p>
