            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Few months ago, I've post on AA about the problem with my current gf now. This is the thread http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=282195 .<br><br>Now, after knowing each other for few months, and she came to singapore and spent 10 days with me. I can sense that she is really serious about this relationship and I wont want to it be ended up. A few example like, after she went back to the country to continue her study, she sent me stuff which is essential for me. Of course I told her not to but she insist.<br><br>We were really happy even though she was oversea and I'm here. She even agreed to come to singapore to live with me after getting her degree. Things were going really well except that her ex keep calling her. Well, she was being honest and told me that her ex called and she didnt reply or anything. She also wanted to change her number after her subscription end. Now the problem start... whenever her ex called, we will be engaging into a conversation about him... and i really mind! Alright, I may not be the super nice and open-hearted gentleman but I was able to accept her even though she had an abortion before.<br><br>But even so, what the f* that her ex keep calling her? Ok, i know.. he wanted to find her for sex! How I know it? I asked my gf to be frank with me, and she really did.. guess what? after her ex broke up with her for another girl, sometimes he still call her up for sex and she agreed!! OMG!!!  I was really sad when she told me all these.. and what's the worst? They were having unprotected sex!!!! for fu*k sake!!! She even told me she did that 2 times!! I really duno what to say, how can a girl be like that?? She is really a nice girl.. i can feel it..  She told me she was really stupid and ignorancem she really regretted it and even wont blame me if i wanted a break up after hearing this. However, in my heart, im angry and sad at the same time. If i saw that guy, I wanted to kill him.. My words were really harsh when talking to her after knowing the truth, i told her this, 'that guy cause you so much pain, cause you to have abortion, and after the break, you still find him for sex?? an unprotected one?? what are you thinking?? Oh, so you got an abortion once, you think it's ok for the next abortion??" I said that in front of her face in webcam. She cried and said no... She told me that the reason why she had abortion was because she dunno anything in the first place, she had kept her virginity till 22 year old and gave it to that f*cker! And nobody had teach her about sex education... no even her parents.. (Her parent was country-side folk and duno much about this things too) In her school last time, they didnt teach as well... and I'm the one who tell her what's right and what's wrong, what can do and what cannot do. She told me that that's the past and she really devoted to me. since then, she really listen to what i say. She is not the type who go clubbing, drinking, smoking and such.<br><br>I really very sad after hearing her past.. even a normal girl who have the sense of diginty wont allow herself to be like that. But strangely, I know she suffered alot in the past, she is really a nice girl and it's the guy lost if he dont treasure her. In my heart, it's like thousand needle poking it... very painful.. Somemore, she used some of her saving and will be coming to singapore again before christmas, as she wanted to spend christmas with me. It's silly that she went to book the flight without telling me first because it is really waste of money... the money she would use to pay her school fees and give her family. You must know what taking flight during these time (Special occasion) cost a boom.. I was touched though...<br><br>Now the thing is... Im trying very hard to forgive her stupid past... and it's all started because of the stupid ex keep calling her. I know she would reject the call and she will definitely tell me that he called. But everytime she told me, my mind will be thinking alot... The thing is i really loved her.. if not, I would break up with her after she told me she had abortion and such..<br><br>I had already told her to change her number ASAP, and she will do it immediately after her subscription is over.. which is half a year time... Tell me fellow forumers... am I right to choose her? If she had met me in the first place, we will be really happy together... we are like so close and yet so far..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What if the situation is reversed?<br><br>U have unprotected sex and ur loved one knows and hates about it. How will u feel given u are remorseful of those act?<br><br>I know chastity is important, especially so if u are a girl. However, she admitted her folly that she did accept that bastard's request. Be more forgiving dude since she has assured u that she will draw a clear line with that bastard. If u find out that she cheats on u, it won't be too late to break then? What if she is really ur destined one?<br><br>If i was u, i will accept her provided i can felt her love. What's done is done. Dun ever ponder over it anymore and most importantly dun use this as an edge to hurt ur gf in the future if u two really get married.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by aicuole:</div><div class="quote_body">Few months ago, I've post on AA about the problem with my current gf now. This is the thread http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=282195 .<br><br>Now, after knowing each other for few months, and she came to singapore and spent 10 days with me. I can sense that she is really serious about this relationship and I wont want to it be ended up. A few example like, after she went back to the country to continue her study, she sent me stuff which is essential for me. Of course I told her not to but she insist.<br><br>We were really happy even though she was oversea and I'm here. She even agreed to come to singapore to live with me after getting her degree. Things were going really well except that her ex keep calling her. Well, she was being honest and told me that her ex called and she didnt reply or anything. She also wanted to change her number after her subscription end. Now the problem start... whenever her ex called, we will be engaging into a conversation about him... and i really mind! Alright, I may not be the super nice and open-hearted gentleman but I was able to accept her even though she had an abortion before.<br><br>But even so, what the f* that her ex keep calling her? Ok, i know.. he wanted to find her for sex! How I know it? I asked my gf to be frank with me, and she really did.. guess what? after her ex broke up with her for another girl, sometimes he still call her up for sex and she agreed!! OMG!!!  I was really sad when she told me all these.. and what's the worst? They were having unprotected sex!!!! for fu*k sake!!! She even told me she did that 2 times!! I really duno what to say, how can a girl be like that?? She is really a nice girl.. i can feel it..  She told me she was really stupid and ignorancem she really regretted it and even wont blame me if i wanted a break up after hearing this. However, in my heart, im angry and sad at the same time. If i saw that guy, I wanted to kill him.. My words were really harsh when talking to her after knowing the truth, i told her this, 'that guy cause you so much pain, cause you to have abortion, and after the break, you still find him for sex?? an unprotected one?? what are you thinking?? Oh, so you got an abortion once, you think it's ok for the next abortion??" I said that in front of her face in webcam. She cried and said no... She told me that the reason why she had abortion was because she dunno anything in the first place, she had kept her virginity till 22 year old and gave it to that f*cker! And nobody had teach her about sex education... no even her parents.. (Her parent was country-side folk and duno much about this things too) In her school last time, they didnt teach as well... and I'm the one who tell her what's right and what's wrong, what can do and what cannot do. She told me that that's the past and she really devoted to me. since then, she really listen to what i say. She is not the type who go clubbing, drinking, smoking and such.<br><br>I really very sad after hearing her past.. even a normal girl who have the sense of diginty wont allow herself to be like that. But strangely, I know she suffered alot in the past, she is really a nice girl and it's the guy lost if he dont treasure her. In my heart, it's like thousand needle poking it... very painful.. Somemore, she used some of her saving and will be coming to singapore again before christmas, as she wanted to spend christmas with me. It's silly that she went to book the flight without telling me first because it is really waste of money... the money she would use to pay her school fees and give her family. You must know what taking flight during these time (Special occasion) cost a boom.. I was touched though...<br><br>Now the thing is... Im trying very hard to forgive her stupid past... and it's all started because of the stupid ex keep calling her. I know she would reject the call and she will definitely tell me that he called. But everytime she told me, my mind will be thinking alot... The thing is i really loved her.. if not, I would break up with her after she told me she had abortion and such..<br><br>I had already told her to change her number ASAP, and she will do it immediately after her subscription is over.. which is half a year time... Tell me fellow forumers... am I right to choose her? If she had met me in the first place, we will be really happy together... we are like so close and yet so far.. </div></blockquote>Everyone keeps saying give her a chance. But I don't agree.<br><br>It's not your fault or her fault. Everyone has the freedom to do what they want. Women are emotional creatures and they go by their feelings. And if they feel a lot like doing something, no amount of logic will help.<br><br>A lot of times, they(the wrong women) keep saying they will do this and that but they fail to deliver their promises 100%. Example: in your case failure to cut off contact with the ex to show commitment with you.<br><br>I know you really mind them having sex and unprotected somemore. That's the key issue here. Will she be having your child or his child?<br><br>Very important question: Did she have sex while in a relationship with you? If so, that's a cardinal sin of adultery. I won't forgive someone like that.<br><br>If not, it's her past and it's up to you to decide if you want to accept it. I suggest you ask her if she still likes him and take her time to think through this. Take time to be alone to think through all these and see if it's really worth it to let a woman screw up your life like this.<br><br>Ask yourself: are you happy throughout the course of the relationship or are you just simply insecure?<br><br>doko<br><br></div>

Though i had been trying very hard to accept it and I already accept the fact that she had abortion before. Just that her ignorance bother me. If her mindset is right, she wont do such thing like going back to his ex for sex after their break up. seriously I dont understand why. Sometimes, she do things that she think it's ok and believe nothing will happen. To me, it's not right. As you see that she is now living in japan.. a country where people see sex as an open topic. I just want her to be safe, but there's still 2 years before she could come to sg to live permanantly with me.<br><br>Sometimes I feel that I should write a book to teach her "How a girl should do to protect herself"...
