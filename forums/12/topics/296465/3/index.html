How much of what she said is truth / fabrications ?<br><br>So, the answer to your question is. No, it doesn't mean anything, other than the fact that, I see sugar coating every corner.<br><br>You... do know the meaning of "stepping stones"... right ?<br><br>Get to know her more... I suggest you drag out the time, a little just to be sure.<br><br>Tell her, you are not ready to settle down yet.<br>Ask her to give you another 5 more years.

I'll catch that novel if i have time..<br><br>I know about what sympathy and what love is. Though from what you see, it's like a mixture for me. But I do know that if I truly love someone, I will want to understand her better about her past and life. Same goes I told her everything about mine. If just for the mere surface of love, I wont need to know what sh1t she went through. There's this phrase called 'learn from mistake' right?<br><br>Well, maybe you are right that im not the best person to help her. Even her family didnt really help her. I did not love her so I help her, I help her because I love her. Although I know my help is not strong enough but i'll try for the best i could.<br><br>Yea, it gets more difficult to handle... but i wont let sympathy and love mix together. Anyway, I dont have a good past too and i dont expect her to love me because of pity me. This... I understand. She had forgotten her past completely and I have forgotten mine... we had a brand new start. Just that her foolishness thinking....</div>
