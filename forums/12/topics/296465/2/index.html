            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by aicuole:</div><div class="quote_body">Few months ago, I've post on AA about the problem with my current gf now. This is the thread http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=282195 .<br><br>Now, after knowing each other for few months, and she came to singapore and spent 10 days with me. I can sense that she is really serious about this relationship and I wont want to it be ended up. A few example like, after she went back to the country to continue her study, she sent me stuff which is essential for me. Of course I told her not to but she insist.<br><br>We were really happy even though she was oversea and I'm here. She even agreed to come to singapore to live with me after getting her degree. Things were going really well except that her ex keep calling her. Well, she was being honest and told me that her ex called and she didnt reply or anything. She also wanted to change her number after her subscription end. Now the problem start... whenever her ex called, we will be engaging into a conversation about him... and i really mind! Alright, I may not be the super nice and open-hearted gentleman but I was able to accept her even though she had an abortion before.<br><br>But even so, what the f* that her ex keep calling her? Ok, i know.. he wanted to find her for sex! How I know it? I asked my gf to be frank with me, and she really did.. guess what? after her ex broke up with her for another girl, sometimes he still call her up for sex and she agreed!! OMG!!!  I was really sad when she told me all these.. and what's the worst? They were having unprotected sex!!!! for fu*k sake!!! She even told me she did that 2 times!! I really duno what to say, how can a girl be like that?? She is really a nice girl.. i can feel it..  She told me she was really stupid and ignorancem she really regretted it and even wont blame me if i wanted a break up after hearing this. However, in my heart, im angry and sad at the same time. If i saw that guy, I wanted to kill him.. My words were really harsh when talking to her after knowing the truth, i told her this, 'that guy cause you so much pain, cause you to have abortion, and after the break, you still find him for sex?? an unprotected one?? what are you thinking?? Oh, so you got an abortion once, you think it's ok for the next abortion??" I said that in front of her face in webcam. She cried and said no... She told me that the reason why she had abortion was because she dunno anything in the first place, she had kept her virginity till 22 year old and gave it to that f*cker! And nobody had teach her about sex education... no even her parents.. (Her parent was country-side folk and duno much about this things too) In her school last time, they didnt teach as well... and I'm the one who tell her what's right and what's wrong, what can do and what cannot do. She told me that that's the past and she really devoted to me. since then, she really listen to what i say. She is not the type who go clubbing, drinking, smoking and such.<br><br>I really very sad after hearing her past.. even a normal girl who have the sense of diginty wont allow herself to be like that. But strangely, I know she suffered alot in the past, she is really a nice girl and it's the guy lost if he dont treasure her. In my heart, it's like thousand needle poking it... very painful.. Somemore, she used some of her saving and will be coming to singapore again before christmas, as she wanted to spend christmas with me. It's silly that she went to book the flight without telling me first because it is really waste of money... the money she would use to pay her school fees and give her family. You must know what taking flight during these time (Special occasion) cost a boom.. I was touched though...<br><br>Now the thing is... Im trying very hard to forgive her stupid past... and it's all started because of the stupid ex keep calling her. I know she would reject the call and she will definitely tell me that he called. But everytime she told me, my mind will be thinking alot... The thing is i really loved her.. if not, I would break up with her after she told me she had abortion and such..<br><br>I had already told her to change her number ASAP, and she will do it immediately after her subscription is over.. which is half a year time... Tell me fellow forumers... am I right to choose her? If she had met me in the first place, we will be really happy together... we are like so close and yet so far.. </div></blockquote>japanese school teach sex education at a very young age, and most japanese girl lose their virginity at the age of 16<br><br>its true they subscribe for a certain period but they can change anytime they want their keitai, its just an excuse.<br><br>and this is this the things that she tells you , have you seen her mixi account?<br><br>dude as long as she is over there , you are in for more pain, sex is no big deal there</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You have a long distance relationship but you want to keep it close by chatting with her regularly but realistically, you only have a real chance at making it when you are both in the same country. A relationship is built, not on words coming out of screens and web cams, but when she is there beside you and you are watching her body language in your presence. I feel that you guys are advancing your relationship in the wrong way.<br><br>Why can't you guys stop talking about her ex boyfriend? Why did she even meet him at all? So she is in love with you, you are her boyfriend but your thoughts revolve around her sleeping with a man she got rid of - a man who called her and slept with her but hey you don't have to worry because although they had unprotected sex - you are the one she is deeply in love with.<br><br>Let's face it mate, when she met up with her ex boyfriend, the guy didn't exactly put a gun to her head, did he? He got to kiss her right? You mean she didn't turn her head when he went for her lips? She didn't push him away? Now that made sense doesn't it? Now do you know why her ex boyfriend is still calling her?<br><br>You spent all but 10 days with her. Have you kissed her? Has she made you laugh? Is she playing with your head or hopelessly in love? Is she latching on too soon? If you could not get over the fact that she was getting together with her ex then why do you keep going back for more? Does she have you right where she wants? As far as I Love Yous go, is it safer to keep it for the pet dogs at this point?<br><br>IMHO, maybe you guys should just stop talking about her ex boyfriend altogether, be quiet, keep your options open let your 'girlfriend' blab her guts out. You don't have to do anything mate, just sit there, type and smile. You don't have to come back with anything. Just wait for her to come over for Christmas.<br></div>

They get married, they have kids.<br><br>So which country is she from ?

Will she be having your child or his child?<br><br>Very important question: Did she have sex while in a relationship with you? If so, that's a cardinal sin of adultery. I won't forgive someone like that.<br><br>If not, it's her past and it's up to you to decide if you want to accept it. I suggest you ask her if she still likes him and take her time to think through this. Take time to be alone to think through all these and see if it's really worth it to let a woman screw up your life like this.<br><br>Ask yourself: are you happy throughout the course of the relationship or are you just simply insecure?<br><br>doko<br><br></div></blockquote>Ok thnx, I believe what you said is how I feel. Ok, the thing is.. as you know we met online, when our first chatting, (We dont know each other well, havent got into relationship yet).there were times where she received call from her ex and she angrily told him off in front of me. That is the problem I faced on my previous entry here http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=282195 .<br><br>While some say wait for her to come sg which is one month ago, we really into this relationship and indeed she didnt pick up any call from her ex. But her ex keep calling her though. And everytime when her ex called, she will told me as for being honest.<br><br>She didnt have sex while in a relationship with me. I did trust her for that and just the thing she do which she think is right let me feel insecure. She really comfirmed that she got no feeling for him anymore and made her more annoyed that he keep calling. Even though I'm happy with her in this relationship but... her ignorance in life scare me alot...<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Guardx:</div><div class="quote_body">What I mean by action is not sleeping around and talking to ex anymore.

Like i said, im not touched by her buying expensive stuff for me so that it gives her the right to sleep around.

The impression she gave is like even though i gave her a rock, she will treasure it that kind of thing.. you know?<br><br>And you're right, although i believe in her, i dunno why am i writing this for advise...

It will be unfair to her if she committed so much and I didnt do my part.
