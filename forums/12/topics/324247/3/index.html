              <p>Singapore is still not ready to accept gay for majority. Im not
              suprised your friend distance away. Its a normal reaction, if he
              treasure this friendship, and you show no interest in him, he will
              be your friend again. But i doubt the friendship will be as close
              as it used to be :(.</p>

              <p>like some girls, they tend to shy away when a guy becomes too friendly with them. because they don't want the guy to get the wrong idea?</p>

              <p>TS,</p>
              <p>Gay or no gay, the existence of a best friendship is as ambigious as spotting a bigfoot in a jungle. It takes years to truly know someone and 11 months is not a long time to know a friend. Some took years before the friendship ends.</p>
              <p>Another thing is, most relationships start from being best friends. How do anyone know if you will not fall for him one day? When you are depressed and sad, you will naturally look for him and over time, won't something blossom?</p>
              <p>But then your friend is a bit hardcore lah, over means over. Seems you do not know your best friend well enough too...</p>

              <p>you choose the wrong friend to be ur best friend la. anyway being gay isn't anything wrong, last time a friend of mine also told me he is, we still all hang out until we went army.. now he's somewhere else in the world studying.</p>
              <p>well, for all I know, I only have 1 gay friend(openly admit). :P</p>
              <p>I agree with some of the replies, probably the friend's concern would be whether one day you might fall for him and it'll get kind of awkward in a way. so it's also understandable he reacted this way?</p>
              <p>find some other mates ba.. :D</p>

              <p>You can't expect everyone to be liberal or open minded given the environment we brought up at.</p>
              <p>Give them some times to get used to it. You can be angry when people are biased towards you. Likewise, they do get angry when being kept in the closet.</p>
              <p>Don't get too worked up over it. If they are still giving you the slight due to your sexual orientation, move on with your life. Who needs these insensitive lots to be your friends?</p>

              <p><br>But this type of people also very the dangerous one<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="icon_mad.gif"> Have to be wary of them. It's ok they don't want to be friends with you after you fess up about your closeted identity. Worse is they go around telling others! And those others that share his bloody mentality will no doubt take the opportunity to step on you and tries to bring you down. Seen this type of people a lot in my office.</p>
              <p>So moral of the story. A lesson learnt here. Never ever confess to anyone your darkest 'secretest' secret of yourself until you bloody know you can trust them 100 bloody percent.</p>
              <p>I feel sorry for you man for knowing such people. Next time choose your friends carefully. Take care take care and better luck next time in knowing people.</p>

              <p>why you go and tell him you are gay when you are not interested in him in the first place?</p>
              <p>i guess your best friend is just really afraid that you are interested in him</p>
              <p>are you seeing anyone right now?</p>
              <p>if yes, intro your gay partner to your best friend to show him that you do not have any romantic interested in him</p>

              <p>TS, if you still want to be friend with him.   Give him time as in talk to him few months later on what is bothering him to just cut you off as a friend when he knows you are a gay.   Tell him you would not want to lose him as a friend.   Be prepared if he still insists he does not want you as his friend.   Take it with good spirit.   If he has cooled off and acknowledges that he was unkind and harsh and want to continue to be your friend, then I am happy for you.    Probably the news came too sudden to him and he could not take it.</p>
