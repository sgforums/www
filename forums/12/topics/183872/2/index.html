I for one very much doubt anger can be managed by sheer will power alone. Without a proper understanding of yourself, and wat makes u tick, I feel yr self confidence will not last for long. Control is tempory, misunderstanding of yr feelings is permanent. Tat said, in any case, hope with all sincerity tat u do succeed.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

The nicer sounding word would be PRIDE. The ugly sounding word would be EGO. There is a need for men to maintain autonomy in watever they do, fabulously workable in the working world, but not in a relationship. Men constantly tend to engage their romantic partners in a power struggle becuz they feel tat they are surrendering autonomy to their partners. But until a man is able to understand that the enemy is thier own fragile ego instead, it is hard for their love life to work out. LOVE IS A NATURE OF UNEQUAL SHARING OF BOTH AFFECTION AND BURDEN. I learnt this too late, after I lost the girl i claimed to love. With all sincerity, I pray yr guy learns to understand himself better.</div></blockquote>I understand...but it takes them sometimes too long to realise it...like with his ex is also the same...he lost her probably because of it...and to make things worse..women are beginning to tap on their own ego limits and how far they can go...and adopt some dingy "huh! don't needa guy!" attitude...things rarely work out...</div>

Most importantly, showing your own jealousy is a big NO-NO. It shows insecurity on ur part. Women hate guys who have insecurities written all over them, especially jealousy and lack of self-control.</div>
