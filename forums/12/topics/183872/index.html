            <div class='col-md body'>This is a time in which I feel u should really sit down and ask yrself this question. "Is it she or is it me?" Well, who is the one at fault. Is it the certain things she does which will cuz u to get angry? Is it her fault tat you got angry? Or is it really your fault tat you got angry?  It is very vital to be clear abt who u really place the blame on.<br><br>The first step about controlling your anger is not telling yourself not to be angry. U do not fight an enemy which u cannot see. I urge u to realise tat that enemy is more often caused by internal rather than external factors. For example, why is it u get angry when she talks to other guys? I doubt she was interested in tat guy, which u would view it as an external factor generating your anger. Your bad temper is mainly due to the insecurities which u feel in yourself. There are many ways in which u can learn to deal with these insecurities and your low self esteem, which will in turn automatically dissolve your anger. <strong>The key is first to understand yourself, before u can accept yourself, after which u can build up your self confidence.</strong><br><br>I would like u to ask yourself these questions. When u were still with her, do u constantly feel enstrangled? Finding to so hard to breathe? As if all yr freedom were being taken away by her? Put it crudely, do u feel as if yr manhood were on the line? The power of love is for u to feel empowerment, not to feel castrated instead by your own insecurities.<br><br>Last question of all to ask yourself, not anyone else in this forum: Are u missing her love and company just becuz u r now alone? Or are u missing sharing your life with someone u claim to love, tat is if u ever tried sharing any part of yourself with her. A word of encouragement, I do not think she has gotten over you, as yet.[/b]</div>

Hai.</div></blockquote>It is an inner born nature that a man has to live life on their own terms. The nicer sounding word would be PRIDE. The ugly sounding word would be EGO. There is a need for men to maintain autonomy in watever they do, fabulously workable in the working world, but not in a relationship. Men constantly tend to engage their romantic partners in a power struggle becuz they feel tat they are surrendering autonomy to their partners. But until a man is able to understand that the enemy is thier own fragile ego instead, it is hard for their love life to work out. LOVE IS A NATURE OF UNEQUAL SHARING OF BOTH AFFECTION AND BURDEN. I learnt this too late, after I lost the girl i claimed to love. With all sincerity, I pray yr guy learns to understand himself better.</div>

But you apologise and took each nail out. Now the fence is filled wif holes just like your gf is feeling now. Its not like you can cover each hole with a wooden filling. Your gf will find it very hard to trust you again.<br>Face it, you blew it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>every gal wants a guy to be understanding, supportive, take care of her, be around her when she needs, and a confidant.<br><br>not one that quarrels just for quarrel, going out just for going out.<br><br>why you want this gal?<br><br>Does she really care for you? or do you really care for her?<br><br>if you really want her back, win her back again. it is not impossible but difficult.<br><br>Try not to speak but listen more. Even if you are angry, listen to her first before you act like an immature brat. Listen to why, when, how she see things, try to communicate on her level.<br><br>And once you listen, you will know how this gal who is someone dear to you really function, and you then can know how you can bring joy and happiness to your r/s. Treasure it, it is not easy for two to become a couple. So work hard.<br><br>Do let things such as anger, suspicision, envy, jealous break you up.<br>Not worth it at all.<br></div>
