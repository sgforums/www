            <div class='col-md body'>Old ppl, like your parents luv to have their children around them. It makes them very happy, they don't feel neglected and lonely. You can spend as much time with them, buy stuff they like to eat and most importantly, sit and eat with them for as long as they deem it as enjoyable. What they really want is their children's time and company and the best place would be during those mealtimes. Chat with them about the good old times when you were young and vulnerable, requiring their love, support and protection. Aged parents just love to reminicise those times.<br><br>And it never fails to bring the glow in their faces when these good old times are brought back.<br><br>Bring them on outings if it is convenient and comfortable for them. But most important, it is the connection that you make with them during those intimate mealtimes that you share with them.<br><br>When it is time for them to move along from this earthly life, they will feel they have fulfilled their duty as parents to you......and you will also feel you have done your duty as a filial child. So you won't feel any regrets.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

Chatting with them, do house work together, watch tv programmes and laugh together. Rent a comedy show and watch loh. Or bring them to eat at the local restaurant. Shopping (GSS still OPENS!!!), go beach and enjoy some sunshine.<br><br>Bring them for a simple ride to relatives' house, to golf course, to sentosa. What they like to do, you go bring them there and enjoy the time with tme. So many things to do. There is no need for travelling all the time. That can be reserved for year end trip and special occassions.</div>
