            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks everyone for the consolations, somehow it makes me feel better to know there are similar people to me whom share this shadow over my life.<br><br>my parents are the type that will never tell you what they like, coz they believe they should not give their kids unnecessary burdens.<br><br>It was like the trip to Korea. I believed that my mum would love Korea (since she's so crazy about K-dramas), that even though she raise really vocal protests, I dragged her to Korea (not really literal, but more or less force her to go). In the end, I saw the best smile I have ever seen on my mum in YEARS. A smile so genuine and sincere it really makes me so happy. Thank god, I caught that smile on a picture, and it has been frozen forever in time.<br><br>That's why this time round, I am 'dragging' her to Japan. I know she will protest and protest, but I believe I should let my parents see the world to the best of my abilities.<br><br>My dad likes to travel, but does not demand from me. So I know that he is happy that we are bringing them together. I actually delayed the trip by 1 year due to my changing of jobs, so I did not manage to bring them last year. This year, I want to make sure I fulfill this.<br><br>Anyway, I also know that on their secret list, they would like to see Australia and possibly New Zealand, so I will work on making that come true for them.<br><br>Of coz, the everyday role of making them happy, I am still fulfilling.<br><br>Let me tell you, I had a problem in the past. My mum favours my brother more (he is the gem in her eye, coz he suffered more than me, and he is more intelligent and a high-flyer than me). I suffered quite a bit of imbalance in my heart coz I firmly believe she favours him more than me, even though she doesn't admit it.<br><br>But when I mature, I decided to just focus on making my parents happy, and not hanker over who they treat better, and now, I am happier than ever before <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
