Im 17 too and i am single now and i feel much carefree as compared with being in a relationship .<br><br>Have you ever wondered , having a GF isn't as simple as you think. You have to be financially stable as well . You must remember , on special occasions , you have to exchange gifts with one another . On the first date , you also have to treat her to a meal , not necessary on everything u must pay for it , but a meal is a must . Also , once in a while , you have to give a small surprise to her .<br><br>If you are financially stable , i have no words to say . Probably you have second thoughts now ?<br><br>Cheers .   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

There are people who are in a relationship and yet tops the class in exams . So can TS .<br><br>The biggest reason he should ponder over , is his financial status . Is he rich enough to go into a relationship ? He must remember that quite a number of things in SG are expensive , that includes meals .<br><br>Thats just my opinion . To me , studies isn't really an obstacle when it comes to relationship . The biggest obstacle would be be $$$ . Can you afford to get into a relationship ?</div>
