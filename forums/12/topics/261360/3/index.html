            <div class='col-md body'>17 and without a girlfriend?<br><br>I'm seventeen too. Why do you want a girlfriend for?<br><br>Sex? Emotional void? Companionship? Ego-fulfilling?<br><br>Sex: You can always find prostitutes. There are 17 year-olds already selling themselves. They're around you, and us. Some Poly girls, some JC girls. You get the drift.<br><br>Emotional void: Pets? As compared to girlfriends, they are relatively low-costing in upkeep (No offence to our feminine gender out there. But if it's an emotional void, it makes sense to get a pet instead of a girlfriend).<br><br>Companionship: You can always grab a couple of good friends, and go wild with them. Cycling, girl-drooling, whatever.<br><br>Ego-fulfilling: Kill that ego, please.<br><br>Unless your relationship is treated with a right attitude, it is doomed to fail, right from the very first day. Love is not a toy, despite what other adolescents may think.<br><br>A relationship built with the wrong attitude will, one day, blow its own cover, and manifest itself in the wrong ways. Of course, there are always exceptions. But do you want to take that minuscule chance?</div>
