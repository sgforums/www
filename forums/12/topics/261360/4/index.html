            <div class='col-md body'>A real relationship is one where you want to be with a person. In your case, you don't seem to have a specific person you want to be with. You seem to just want the status, or simply company of anybody (and not somebody specific). So my suggestion is, go with your heart. When you encounter that person whom you like, you will naturally want to be with her. Hopefully both will be happy together, and there you  have a nice couple. Anything else is secondary. If you don't have a specific person in mind, whom you always think of, your real prolem is the feeling of emptiness, which has many solutions other than going into a relationship. Some take drugs, some take up hobby, some go into religion, etc. But frankly, I think you should be patient and relaxed, try to understand your girl friends more. Be sincere and start with simple friendship instead of harbouring lofty thoughts about relationship. By and by you will understand more and develop your character better.</div>

If she knows that you're highly into her, she can sell herself at a higher price and that makes things difficult for you. Conversely, if you don't appear that you need her that much, e.g. don't immediately agree to go out with her if she asks, pretend to have some plans and say that you will confirm with her, and e.g. if you ask her out and she declines, don't pester her -- she's made up her mind -- but say something like "no problem, I'll ask  out instead, enjoy yourself :]" so that she gets the impression that she's not that important after all. Play your cards right and always make sure that you're boss.<br><br>Lastly, muscles are good accessories too.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"></div>

Just like shopping at the pasar malam, don't ever show your interest in the goods to get the best deal out of the bargain. If she knows that you're highly into her, she can sell herself at a higher price and that makes things difficult for you. Conversely, if you don't appear that you need her that much, e.g. don't immediately agree to go out with her if she asks, pretend to have some plans and say that you will confirm with her, and e.g. if you ask her out and she declines, don't pester her -- she's made up her mind -- but say something like "no problem, I'll ask  out instead, enjoy yourself :]" so that she gets the impression that she's not that important after all. Play your cards right and always make sure that you're boss.<br><br>Lastly, muscles are good accessories too.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> </div></blockquote>from wad i read, gals dont like muscles, lean n toned like a regular jogger will do  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

Depreciated GF have no scrap value... And usually will bankrupt till heart break...<br><br>The above :<br>1) No offence to females<br>2) When u pay, u dont pay by cash... u pay in the form of effort, time and blah blah<br>3) For those who dont understand, it simply means that having a serious relationship means more responsibility and more tie up... In fact, to own a car is even better... At least, after depreciated, car still got scrap value(can get back money)<br><br></div>
