I am gald this experience made you open you open your eyes and at least in the future, you won't be just blindly blinded by love - instead you would cautiously approach. Whether he is a good bf or not is doesn't really matter and I wouldn't know, but all I have to say is that how many relationship have you been? This is only just the begining of future relation is to come and because of that - you never know if future guys will be how many times better... (or worst).  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>The minute when he spoke about pure sexual relationship: Straight away like angel to your soul I warned you. The minute he said something that immoral, you should have heed the warning of your womanly instinct or my words.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Karmic relation I must say: Well, the lesson to be learned is that: when someone is good - treasure and appreciate it. When things become fishy and unorthodox in the future - do not solo and blindly look at him/her on the account of the past.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>TIme change, people change....
