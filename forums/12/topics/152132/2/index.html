Can you really settle down like them? That means no more sex with other people and only with one person thats all. NO more wild nights, no lesbian feelings...<br><br>From the past threads you have been telling us how wild you were in the past and you seems happy about it. If you seriously still want to play please go on and have fun, no one can stop you.<br><br>If you want to really to be serious about getting on with marriage and have children, then I suggest you learn to stop all these wild nights..</div>
