            <div class='col-md body'>What I can suggest to you will make you more appealing to both men and womenÂ…<br><br>The last paragraph you wrote sounded almost like a plea to men to accept you. This hard-selling tactics must stop. You sounded almost desperate and have already created a negative impression even before you meet him.<br><br>1)First and Foremost, think of yourself as a rare commodity<br>Once upon a time when paper money was not even created, people practiced barter trading. Then one fine day, one smart @ss decides that maybe it would be easier to find a commodity to represent value. Instinctively, he chose gold. You see, it is a psychological fact that people tend to place more value on things that are rare and harder to find.<br><br>The first thing you must do is to convince yourself that you are a good catch to men and you are a rare commodity.<br><br>Next you put your convictions into actionsÂ…<br><br>2)Focus on your dreams and ambitions<br>Your dreams at this moment does not include d!cks, pussies or boobs. All these can come later. A desirable person is someone who has a passion in something in life. Find something that you believe you can continue doing for life. Your romantic life is always a reflection of your regular life. When a person has a passion in his/her life, people naturally want to be a part of it.<br><br>3)Never ever feel the need to prove yourself to anyone<br>When you feel the need to prove yourself, you are pretty much screwed before you can even talk about starting a relationship. Women tend to fall into the common trap of being too self conscious when they try to prove themselves.<br><br>You for instance bombard yourself with questions like Â“I feel our conversation went fineÂ…why arenÂ’t they interested in me? Why donÂ’t they like me? I cant speak Chinese properly, that must be the problem?Â” When you feel the need to prove yourself, you become desperate to impress.<br><br>Look at your post for instance, if you are seriously looking for a man who will truly loves you, you believe he will be so concerned about your extraordinary boobs. Why is there a need to prove yourself?<br><br>So start doing some self-improvement, find out what you want to be and what can be the passion in your life. Work on it and you will begin to love yourself more and becomes more confident. A woman who is confident, knows who she is and has a passion in her life is appealingÂ…you will naturally become a rare commodity that men will sought after.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>techincally speaking i didn't 'have sex' with her. its impossible for a girl to have sex with another girl. all i did was french kissing, fondling her breasts, heavy petting occasionaly and sometimes licking.. the rest are too explicit and i choose not to disclose them. as far as i am concerend, i dont classify them under sex as no egg is fertilized in this case.. both of us are gals and there is no way any of us can get pregnant. so are we still having sex?</div>
