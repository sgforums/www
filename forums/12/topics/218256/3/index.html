My 2nd b/f , we also borke up b/c of long distance as he left for overseas (maybe I receive consequence in return for leaving the first). I have tried to get in  touch to be friends with him and he agreed, but then it is hard to be friends, we both decided not to email anymore, except say Happy New Year. We move on. My heart twists everytime I read the email, but to see him, NO. I will feel very hard to move on.<br><br></div></blockquote>I'm sorry to hear that.  I'm sure you will move on fine.<br><br>*pats</div>
