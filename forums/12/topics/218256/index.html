It depends on the 2 parties.  If they are willing to be normal friends, then it's possible.  But if one party has very serious character flaw than to remain as ordinary friends may not be possible.  My intention was to be ordinary friend with my ex.  But his serious character flaw affects the friendship, so we are not even friends now.  And also depends on what reason the couple break off to decide if friendship is possible.</div>

It helps if you have the mindset that everyone's an adult and we've got to accept things when they come.<br><br>It helps to have honesty and dialogue throughout, so even when things do not work out, things stay chummy. I see a total snub as a waste of human relationships, unless one party has done something so utterly unforgivable that it's impossible to remain on good terms.</div>
