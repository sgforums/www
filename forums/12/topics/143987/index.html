            <div class='col-md body'><br>sounds like the person is not interest or even missing u<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> if a person really like u, they will not stop thinking of you. They will answer every msg for yours.. thats the power of love<br><br>My advise is Maybe just drop a msg or call to check the person out again... find some excuse to talk or ask him/her on how well they are. Soemtimes they just forgotten abt u due to work or other problems in life but your msg will tell them u are still there for them.<br><br>but again if they are not responsive, the probablity is that u are screwed. They did have enough feelings with u to start the missing you feelling.<br><br>Last 2 method is to continue chasing them or just move on your life.<br><br><blockquote><br>Have you even wondered? How some ugly guys have super pretty girlfriends? Or how some jerks that abuses their girlfriends have girlfriends that love them so much? Or how some interacial relationship started? I most, if not all of them starts with rejection<br></blockquote>well its no wonder  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  either those guys are rich or they are just fun people to hang out. In other words, these guys got the "right" moves. Flowers, sweet words, romantic dinners, etc... its no wonder some ugly guys have pretty gfs  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>jerks abuses gfs? well the oppositie happens to guys too... well the world is not fair.. so no point bitching abt it. Just take the bite as a man or woman... anyway most females i noted recover much faster than guys.. i found most guys are more emotionally scar in a breakup when the guys loves the gal more. i am one good example i got dumped and was depressed like craze  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>interacial relationship. hahah the power of love is very powerful ... it can do lots of wonders, my friend. People can even die and sacrfice theri lives for love.. The phases of love can be one of the best or worse experiences that a human being can go, for us humans are soft-wired to be happiest or suffer terribly when we are accepted or rejected by someone we adore and it is for a good evolutionary reason. Romantic love is as powerful as hunger and it is no wonder people around the world will live and die for love. It can be used partly to explain for the human ability to sacrifice in times of great stress and needs. We call it part of evolutionary theory.<br></div>

A rejection might not be one and sometimes we might get the wrong idea.<br><br>For example:<br><br>You ask someone out, there's no reply, do you consider the following?<br><br>1 ) Busy, but doesn't know how to as replying busy might be seen as a form of reject if you don't know his/her schedule well.<br><br>2 ) Shy, sometimes he/she might not dare to reply or dare to go out with you alone as he/she is quite shy and doesn't dare show that he/she likes you.<br><br>3 ) Sometimes, you might not seen that person for a long time and you suddenly ask he/she out. He/she might be afraid of how the both of you have changed.<br><br>I know reality is harsh but please do consider all possible senarios before giving up, sometimes you never really know. Asking for opinions here is not a really good thing as I can see any declining of sort results in people thinking its a rejection but they do not know that person's personality well enough to judge things clearly.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Wow, bro i tod tis another philosophical, boring ole' thread on life. But this one rely struck a chord...<br>I get discouraged easily &amp; always wondered why i get rejected? Like when i msg this gal &amp; she doesn't reply, i wld feel rely down... thinkin she doesn't like me.</span><br><br>Have you even wondered? How some ugly guys have super pretty girlfriends? Or how some jerks that abuses their girlfriends have girlfriends that love them so much? Or how some interacial relationship started? I most, if not all of them starts with rejection.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Yeah this is rely a F_U_C_K_E_D up but common phenonemon.... It rely IRKS me like crazy... why is heaven so unfair??!!!<br>Must i be a lying, cheating b-astard before i can find myself a decent, pretty devoted GF??<br>Being honest, humble &amp; sincere seems to get me nowhere!
