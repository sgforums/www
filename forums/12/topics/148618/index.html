            <div class='col-md body'>Hey, a big thanks to reading this first.<br><br>Well... u see... i've this really close frd for now, known her for the past 3 years and the past 8 mths got to know her more. She'a typical shy girl i would say.. but get to click well with pple of both gender. Well, i do like her and have confessed to her...but her ans was she doesn't know. Well leave that aside, i would say at times... i'm guessing her feelings i would say, cos it's like she calls me like almost every night when she's free and sms me stuffs like (very tired, lessons boring etc...) so the thing is... but recently i felt that when she calls me is like cos it's only half hour to dinner, she's doing nothing and calls me to kill time. And i do really felt tt since her social circle has been enlarged due to school events, i'm getting further away from her. Sometimes i'm just wondering if i'm being used...emotionally i would say... cos whenever she needs help i'll be there to help her n stuffs.. but she nv really does concern abt me such as asking how i am etc... n recently things are bad that we can't talk face to face somehow...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hey.... ever wondered why she comes to you and not to her other friends???<br><br>this gal knows you feel for her, and coming to you for her problems seems to be a best thing to do, cos she feels she can always count on you. whether or not that is a good thing, you decide.<br><br>on her part, she's not showing you that much of concern for you prob cos sh's still unsure about her feelings for you, and before she sorts it out, she doesn't want to lead you on too much, hence she doesn't realy know how to show her concern without making you think too much...<br><br>of cos this is just my guess, if you really want to know what exactly goes on in her mind, ask her directly. tell her how you feel... see what she says...<br><br>cheers.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm...she is acting like my ex-crush. He used to call me all the time when he is feeling lonely, when he has problems, etc. Because he said I am always there to listen to him, and he feels like he can talk to me more than to any of his other frens.<br><br>I was secretly hoping that one day he will realize I was always the one who stood behind him, always the one to be there for him when he needs someone most. This went on for almost 2 long years. But in the end, we didn't get to be together.<br><br>So there is a thin line between being close frens, being someone who is always there to listen to her and being the one who finally wins her heart. Of course you can persist, but make sure you do not regret your decision, no matter what the outcome might be. She might feel close to you as a fren, but there might be chemistry lacking that causes her to pause before crossing that thin line that separates friendship and love.<br><br>Painful as it had been, I guess the two longs year did teach me some experience I will never forget in life <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Sorry about the thread hijack with Pinky.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br>As you can see, she's still unsure about her feelings for you. (Starblue is right)<br>The thing about not talking to you infront of others doesn't mean that she don't like you at all.<br>Sometimes, when you like someone... you kinda become speechless whenever you see her.<br>Why not give her some time to sort her feelings?<br>Good luck to you!!!!    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

She'a typical shy girl i would say.. but get to click well with pple of both gender. Well, i do like her and have confessed to her...but her ans was she doesn't know. Well leave that aside, i would say at times... i'm guessing her feelings i would say, cos it's like she calls me like almost every night when she's free and sms me stuffs like (very tired, lessons boring etc...) so the thing is... but recently i felt that when she calls me is like cos it's only half hour to dinner, she's doing nothing and calls me to kill time. And i do really felt tt since her social circle has been enlarged due to school events, i'm getting further away from her. Sometimes i'm just wondering if i'm being used...emotionally i would say... cos whenever she needs help i'll be there to help her n stuffs.. but she nv really does concern abt me such as asking how i am etc... n recently things are bad that we can't talk face to face somehow...</div></blockquote>What are you really expecting in returning?<br><br>If you feel that she's just making use of you, you can always don't help?</div>
