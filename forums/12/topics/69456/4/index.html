(if this is so, last time why did he say of his romantic plans to me? i personally feel that part of my expectation is also shaped by him.)<br><br>but, well... i accepted his line of argument... just take it as a normal day lohz... as long as he's happy den i uso ok about it... my only hope is that our time going to be spent together on sat will be sweet and nice.... it's having each other by our side that really matters... isnt it?<br><br>but next time i dunno if i can ever be honest with him about my views and position again. cos everytime i say something i feel about the relationship, he'll always blow his top and things would turn ugly. and i would have to pacify him. sometimes i myself dun even know if the problem is with him or me or just both of us together.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>and just wanna hear some views from you all...<br><br>wad do ya all tink of expectations?? ever had a case of ur bg/gf asking for too much?<br><br>and for vday izit that guys feel pressurized by gals to be more romantic and plan something big and nice?? just so can meet their gal's expectations? shd they really try their best to meet their gal's expectations or will not be indulgent towards them?<br><br>sometimes i really tink that simplicity is a beautiful virtue.<br>keep things nice and simple.... isnt it great this way?</div></blockquote>The last you you would want to do is to <strong>PRESSURE your guy to be ROMANTIC</strong>.<br><br>Please note that romance is a bonus not a must when dealing with man because generally, man ain't suppose to know how to think like a woman, therefore love/romance isn't part of the big plan. All man feels that responsibility is part of the love game not romance (The ability to cater and give) and it is only recently that man realise they have to add hint of romance into the game. (Appearance of SNAG and metrosexual).<br><br>Your expectation comes from him? Partially. The other partial reason came from our environment, our media, etc which glorify and commercialize Valentine's day, made people all over the world feels that it's a must to celebrate as a couple. Therefore, couple's compare. Who gets the most flowers, presents, etc. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> You will only realise this thought if you have been through a V-day, spend much money and probably effort - yet you ain't thoroughly happy on that day. You will discover that happiness in couple-ship survive on your daily basis and V-day is only 'useful' for people who have not been showing daily appreciation to at least show them on that day.<br><br>Your guy is a virgo - he is mentally stimulated when it comes to relationship. Because he lacks the empathy and overflowing emotional way of thinking like you do, he sees things practical and when issues are affecting this mental practicality, he is drained and snaps to protect his psychological mind.<br><br>P.S: Learn to appreciate what is given and not stated expectation. So do you actually give 'black-face' for this particular relative who usually give you $50 for red packet, but this year he only gave $10? <strong>There is no disappointment when there is no desire</strong>.<br><br>Cheers</div>
