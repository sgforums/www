Thru this, i made sure the same mistake never repeats itself.

Love is blind.<br><br>She said to me one day i have definitely changed alot and she loves me alot more now.  It really warms my heart when i hear her say all that.  Because i felt i have changed for the better too.<br><br>So its not really advisable to keep  to yourself.
