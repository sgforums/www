            <div class='col-md body'>today i expressed my hope to my bf that vday would be romantic and be different from usual other days together. cos it's our 1ST vday together so naturally will have more hopes and expectations. and i tot it will be good if i can be honest about it. he always said he likes me to be honest with him and tell him stuff.<br><br>but in the end he got all angry and defensive and chided me for being too idealistic and having too high an expectation. he said vday was just a passing day to him and i shdn't expect or ask for anything much. (if this is so, last time why did he say of his romantic plans to me? i personally feel that part of my expectation is also shaped by him.)<br><br>but, well... i accepted his line of argument... just take it as a normal day lohz... as long as he's happy den i uso ok about it... my only hope is that our time going to be spent together on sat will be sweet and nice.... it's having each other by our side that really matters... isnt it?<br><br>but next time i dunno if i can ever be honest with him about my views and position again. cos everytime i say something i feel about the relationship, he'll always blow his top and things would turn ugly. and i would have to pacify him. sometimes i myself dun even know if the problem is with him or me or just both of us together.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>and just wanna hear some views from you all...<br><br>wad do ya all tink of expectations?? ever had a case of ur bg/gf asking for too much?<br><br>and for vday izit that guys feel pressurized by gals to be more romantic and plan something big and nice?? just so can meet their gal's expectations? shd they really try their best to meet their gal's expectations or will not be indulgent towards them?<br><br>sometimes i really tink that simplicity is a beautiful virtue.<br>keep things nice and simple.... isnt it great this way?</div>
