              <p>Hi people, recently i am out with a lady. and well, we kinda can click. so there was this one time when we are out with my friends and so the 5 of us were talking.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>While the conversation is travelling across the table and it's kinda noisy. She kinda ask me this qns "are you single?" but i pretend i never heard it and just answer my other friends questions.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Recently she was alittle down and we are talking at msn. so she was kind of quite sad and she just tell me " just be there for me ok? "</p>
              <p>so i replied her i will. judging by what she type, i know i might think too much but i really wish to get an answer to it.</p>
              <p>Well, to be frank i am interested in her but still getting to know her better.</p>
              <p>Is she alittle attracted to me? Or she just treat me as a normal friend? Well for me, i wont go and ask my friend to be there for me unless i am interested in her. That's why i need a woman point of view here.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thanks alot for the guidance.</p>

              <p>If she rejects you 3 times.. then confirm she not interested in you loh.</p>
              <p>When you avoided her question... she already think you "taken".. so she ofcors won't make any more advancements lah.. so simple lah brah.</p>

              <p>actually i did tried once. but she could not make it. cos she have work the next day. but it kinda demoralise me.</p>
              <p>i was thinking if u are really interested in that person, you will still find time to go out for a short meal. but this issnt the case.</p>
              <p>is it normal to get rejected for a meal? i am a person that will think alot that's why i am kind of very demoralise now. like i dunno what else i should do. my feelings is getting deeper per day. sigh</p>

              <p>huh. but she not my relative. lols haha</p>
              <p>no la,i just wanna make sure she is interested in me before i
              proceed further. else also no point. sigh, i am pondering abt this
              the whole night. so many different answer.</p>
              <p>like one member wrote, she is interested but hesitant. why is
              she hesitant?</p>
              <p>and also i think she might really treat me just a friend. but do
              we say this to a friend? i dont say this unless i really like that
              person.</p>

              <p>Mr Mit,</p>
              <p>She is hesitant because you are also hesitant.</p>
              <p>Somebody gota make the move.</p>
              <p>Are you the one wearing the skirt ?</p>
              <p>Love waits for no one.. you can keep pondering until the cow comes home.. the next gentleman comes along. ... and you'd be history.</p>
