              <p>Why do you need to make her "forget" her ex ? And how are you gonna do tat ? Rip out part of her brain ?</p>
              <p>Her past cannot be erased, and is part of who she is today.</p>
              <p>Perhaps her ex had set a very high benchmark, that's why she is having a hard time finding someone who is comparable or better than him.</p>
              <p>Focus on your strengths and work on your weaknesses, perhaps then will you stand a chance.</p>

              <p>perharps i meant it in a wrong way. i should rephrase it as how to make her realise it's the past and it's the future she should look at.</p>
              <p>also to let her see my strength and let her know this guy here (which is me) is worth considering.</p>
              <p>cos its very hard to let someone notice you unless u do something that catch her attention.that's my problem cos i think she know i like her and i think she know my strength. but its the past that is hindering i guess. i duno thats what i guess</p>

              <p>The 'best' way - love her, partake of her as she IS and if it comes back it always was yours - otherwise be thankful that you had a chance to love lar.</p>

              <p>You cannot "make" her. You can only "motivate" her.</p>
              <p>What is worth considering.. is up to her to observe.</p>
              <p>You can send her a thousand flowers, but none will reach her heart .. when what you put on is only  a show.</p>
              <p>You can sit and wait.. but one day another guy will come and take her away.</p>
              <p>What you like.. others will like too.</p>

              <p>We humans like to be popular. We like to be a celebrity, like a pop star. We yearn recognition.  We are pragmatic and know that we all can't be superstars of thousands, but we like the feeling.</p>
              <p>Here this is what happened to you.</p>
              <p>1 She asked if you are single.</p>
              <p>2 She asked for "you to be there"</p>
              <p>By these she has place you on a pedestal, she make you feel like a superstar of 1 person. You have a fan and you are in love with yourself.</p>
              <p>Grow up, stop being childish.</p>
              <p>She is a friend, just be a friend, and don't let your ego set your feelings a flutter. Help her, and not woo her. You need a good dose of maturity for that.</p>
              <p>And then later, maybe, you will know if she is the one you can spend the rest of your life with or not. At present you just want her for yourself. Hey! She made you feel important and  you think she is your fan, and you don't want to lose that precious fan. Thats all on your part, on her side, she is thinking of herself. You  are just one of her friends, who is always not busy.</p>
