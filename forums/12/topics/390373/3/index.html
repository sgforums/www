              <p>mitgalant,</p>
              <p>She ask you whether u r single and always complain about her happiness..means good sign for you lah. Sorry to say, I am quite conservative one, perhaps your fear of not calling her is very right...</p>
              <p>If you want to sms or call her...make sure you have a good reason to do so. Don't just call her out of the blue and tell her how much you like her. If she's a good gal (0.01% chance), she'll probably fall into your arms. If she's a bad gal, she most likely (99.9%) tell all your office colleagues and friends about what you said to her. You most likely come back to office feeling strange why your co-workers talk to you in rather strange way.</p>
              <p>Best is...let everything flow naturally. If she really likes you, she'll come to you. If you need to do a lot of chasing...could mean she is trying to tiew ka (bargain)...which in any case it is not favourable for you. Firstly if you want to pull out halfway, you'll most likely face backlash from everyone around you. Secondly, you may have to go all the way.....face the pain of the game...like our good fren Hseng.</p>
              <p>Again best is...make friends with her first. If she can't be friends, no point going to the next step. Most of my married friends always found their life partner this way, they start off as friends first - there is mutual respect and everlasting relationship and most important...privacy. Of course, you need to do the first move but excessive chasing after the gal...means you are already in the quicksand game...and you're fast sinking.</p>

              <p>yup. i do get it. well, recently we did go out together to exercise together as a group also. but well, i get to spend some time alone with her while exercising.</p>
              <p>the thing is becos i kinda like her, that's why i will get tongue tied when i speak to her. well, i guess she should have know i like her. i think it's pretty obvious from what i have gather</p>
              <p>well, just not sure why if she is not interested then why dont just ignore me or give me a more cold shoulder?</p>
              <p>instead, she still talk to me, allow me to pick her up once etc. well. i also dunno why too. is she also trying to get to know me more? or i am just thinking way too much.</p>

              <p>girls like confirmation. just like police officers. they can have all the confirmation in the world pointing towards u as the accuse still they want a confession. anyway wat u think might be wat shes thinking as well. she might be thinking whether u interested in her. its human to fear rejection</p>
              <p>just continue to treat her well.. slow and steady.</p>

              <p>TS,</p>
              <p>Your stance is such that you are setting  youself up  to only be miserable. It is palbable that you have no love to share and yet you would like to very much partake of her. Beggarly love has nothing to share, it can only take, in other words, it hopes to fulfilled and no one can fulfill that for long.  Love is meant for giving not taking. Hence the word forgive and forgiveness - for giving and forgiving</p>
              <p>Man, love is not business and when it is made into one - it is no longer love but a transaction , a compromise and simply put, an ego trip. It is a mutual benefit scheme lar!</p>
              <p>Be fulfillled in your self, self <strong>minus the ego</strong> and you would be ok with ... whether she reciprocates or not. Otherwise, two things are going to be the mainstay of your daily living - anguish of the past and anxiety of the future.</p>
              <p>Till what is lacking within oneself is unresolved, one may ignore, pretend or be completely ignorant to that lack but it would surface.</p>

              <p>Then my boy, don't even bother.</p>

              <p>But I pity her if she does choose you.. for this is but a barter.. and nothing else.</p>
              <p>Shoud one day she is again unable to give you what you want.. will you be dejected .. and let the relationship goes to rot  once more?</p>

              <p>Some courtships move faster than 2/3 weeks. Look, I am not asking you to give up. Probably, you can keep in touch with her as a friend. Do things together as friends. If she really likes you, she come to you. If she openly flirts at you in front of everyone - be careful, she may be leading you on. But if she does it discreetly, you may still have a chance - just keep cool and everything will come naturally.</p>

              <p>actually i am friends with her now. we still go out together etc but of course in a group stage. well, prolly because of our age too, we dont flirt with one another. in front or behind of one another, our communications are all pure and no flirts at all.</p>
              <p>well, i think she kind of cant put her past behind her as well. so probably this is the part where i also cant do much. however i treated her better than any of our female friends and i believe she should have the vibe that i like her.</p>
