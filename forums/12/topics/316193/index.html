              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"> <span style="font-size: 10pt;">Before you begin dwelling in some incessant,
              bottomless pit of melancholy and depression, I think you need to have some
              deeper understanding of the misery you are into: there is quite a bit of narcissism,
              mourning why your ex-girlfriend always leave you in a lurch. However, when you
              reverse that self pity thought, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">I wondered why in the first place would
              you accept her again only to grant her access to create a second misery in your
              life one more time?</span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">In love, we all have that bit of narcissistic
              self, craving for the certain attention, love and companionship from our other
              half. It is natural. However, I cannot stress enough on the fact that your
              individual happiness in any relationship cannot be entirely depended on another
              person. The mindset of 'I can only be happy in his/her presence' merely
              suggested that you are not only emotionally instable, but also lacking the
              innate self love you ought to brandish before you could start expanding this very
              love to another person and forge meaningful bond we called 'relationship'.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Perhaps you are also blinded by the fact that
              this is already a 6 years relationship and it feels painful to relinquish an
              investment you have so carefully nurtured. But technically speaking, it's even
              less than 6 years - considering the fact that every time you broke off, it
              starts from point zero and not where you last end off. This is this inflated
              your perceived misery and forms a 'Greater Lost Syndrome' in love (CloUdiSm).</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Your sense of abandonment is reiterated, as
              you are unyielding to accept any possibilities in breaking-up or moving on. You
              merely create an avenue for your individual cosmic lesson to replay this
              excruciating karmic debt of helplessness and abandonment once again. You might
              clenched your fist and adamantly refuse to accept your outcome, but <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">death
              in love is deaf and it hears no denial</span></strong>.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Once the lessons are provided spiritually,
              any attempt to lengthen it often promise prolong wretchedness. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Perhaps it's time for you to preview your
              situation and decide if it is worth the while to yearn for someone who doesn't
              really bother about you. In Love, we cannot always use the same yardstick to
              measure our relationship six years ago and now - for we have evolved emotionally
              and psychologically, thus our needs, expectation and personality will surely
              change over the years. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">There are times when Love becomes irrelevant
              gradually - not because it did not exist in the first place, but rather, your
              spiritual journey with her has come to fruition and there is nothing else this
              relationship could provide for you. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Find someone who could walk through life with
              you, and not overly focus your effort on people who are bound to get down after
              a few bus stops. You can't stop them because that is their destination. </span><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="icon_idea.gif"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> </span></p>

              <p>Simple. It isnt a bad thing u know. cuz u saw her true colour now. Conclusion, she never really loved u whether u liked it or not.</p>
              <p>THe question is , will u still like this gal after u know its not true love? Hard to let go but u have to lor...just be in a quiet room, and mentally prepared to study for exam again. keep her things away from your sight in your room, perhaps u should pray for peacefulness before u start studying.</p>
              <p>Dont worry, one day u will feel that u are reallly loved after u meet the one. Its not your time yet, now just study ya</p>

              <p>yunhaier..thanks for the wonderful piece of advise u wrote. i too love reading your postings.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>wahsehwahseh: yeah u are right. must level up always. i level up 3 times oledi till the extent that i am now more relax about it. but still depressed. err... get wat i am trying to say? haha</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>midlusionz: ya i am gonna do that and reject her IF she ever comes back again.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Xavier1979: yup shame on me.. i really feel the shame becoz everyone asks me why i do gte back together despite so many breakup n problems. haha.. so yup..shame on me.. and i do feel the shame. but no more shame anymore. i am and will change all this.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>xaih: yup.. really damn sianz to know that this person leaves u in the lurch unconsiously every time when u are at the most bottomw of the pit. some ppl just dun realise their actions UNTIL they experience it themselves and my ex gf is like tat. that's why i had so many probs with her. always had to show her that she is doing wrong by doing that wrong to her myself. maybe in a way i was stupid n wrong too. haha..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>zarks: yeah i console myself by telling that thankfully we are not married. i can now only TRY to study to the best of my current situational ability. anyway thanks for all ur advises.</p>
