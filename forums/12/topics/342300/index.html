              <p>Just wondering why did you guys spend so much money when it's already hard to make ends meet?</p>
              <p>I suspect the crux of the problem doesn't lie in your family's income; but poor financial planning. There're families I've seen firsthand, during my stint as a volunteer, survived well with just a monthly income as low as 750. So if you think you're the poorest and your life is the saddest, you're not just wrong... but very ill-informed as well.</p>
              <p>You talked about your parents being poorly uneducated; you talked about them not being able to get a white-collar job for more money; you talked about how they screwed up your life and you talked about the God that doesn't give a flying hoot 'bout stuffing money into your pants.</p>
              <p>Why don't you take the first step to advise your parents on proper financial planning since you're better educated? Why don't you find some part-time job to help out?</p>
              <p>Before you point those crooked fingers at anyone else, always remember that you've a choice to stop crying, pick yourself up and work at getting yourself out of the plight.</p>
              <p>Time to reexamine yourself, boy.</p>

              <p>sry for being direct but i suggest you change your way of thinking.. ä¸�ç„¶ä¸�æ­»ä¹Ÿæ²¡ç”¨. .all your problem listed here is the result of a weak mind and a pampering lifestyle..</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>and no - office work cant give you more income.. hard work will..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>its not your parent's fault - its your own dysfuntional mind.. (maybe its theirs after all) å…»ä¸�æ•™çˆ¶ä¹‹è¿‡</p>
