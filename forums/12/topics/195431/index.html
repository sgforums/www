            <div class='col-md body'>password lock the computer<br>set aside a limited time to play per day<br>i wouldnt suggest gradual change eg from 5 hours to 4 hours to three hours that sort of thing. it might lead to more protests. say you want the limit to be two hours per day give it to him straightaway<br>reward him with an extra hour if he does well, hope it motivates him to study<br>i think you should also talk to him tell him the reasons why you are doing this, the possible consequences if this continues. dont yell, dont give physical punishments.<br>encourage other activites eg playing basketball<br>hope it helps</div>

In fact, he stays at home too long. I think there are only 2 things he does at home; Game and Homework... and sleep of course.<br><br>he doesn't go out much, cept when chased by us too much, he'll play some badminton downstairs...<br><br>Guess he's an introvert like me.</div>

Players of opposite gender can now get married in the game! It's not surprising if ur brother starts to think that he's married. Stop him from playing! Yea.
