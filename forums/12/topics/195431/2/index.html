            <div class='col-md body'>I dont suggest passwording your computer. It will just make ur bro agitated and really irritated (withdrawal symptoms lol).<br><br>The best way is probably to go to the maplestory files in the computer and remove a few important files so the game cant function. And then just lie and say ur com is incompatible or kena virus or whatever bullshit.<br><br>Another way is maybe to start playing com games with him. Its more fun if two people play. And it will be easier to persuade him to stop gaming too... like when you stop playing with him halfway and tell him 'we've played enough, lets go out/ study blahblahblah'.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I'm a gamer myself - holidays are the perfect time to play. I play at least 12 hours a day.<br><br>I would suggest you give him a reasonable amount of homework to be handed in like... per week. If he doesn't, DON'T LET HIM SLEEP. Force him to do his work, throughout the night (That's what you say. Just let him do until 2 - 3 will do). Explain to him that while you can play, you need to do work. So this is the amount of work I'm giving to you, and this is the amount you need to complete.<br><br>If he doesn't respond, just lock up the computer for a day, and tell him it's because he doesn't do your work. If he cries, throw up a temper, screw him and YOU use the computer yourself. Go play some games and let him watch and watch. "Want to play? Finish your work."<br><br>It works with me when I was 12.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
