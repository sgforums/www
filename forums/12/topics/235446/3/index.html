End of the day, you pays yo' money and takes yo' chances, but the smart money's on trying to get the best hand of cards possible.  Some girls pick bringing home the bacon over warm and fuzzy, others go vice versa. <span style="color: orange;"> The sad fact is that warm and fuzzy can be made up, but bacon's bacon and there's no two ways about it</span>.</div></blockquote>Well, the ideal will be, picking a guy who can bring home the bacon, and who is also reasonably warm and fuzzy   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Why must man stereotype her reason of departure as wealth and NOT because of the love itself?<br><br>And even if that was proven to be true: why would you want to date someone who cannot accept you for who you are and constantly having that mercenary perception of what you are worth to her?<br><br>Guys... you mean you rather have that wealth and that woman, while unknown to you, she's merely putting tangible figures into her mind with regards to her relationship with you? Because I know men who blatantly know this truth, but they are happy with the exchange of sex and companionship, so it doesn't matter to them.<br><br>Are you one of these guys? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"><br><br>***<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Don't be foolish if you allow this mindset to ruin your outlook in love. Yes... finance is important, but it doesn't mean that you got to earn a fringing 100k per annum before you can secure a decent mate. Finance is important, not because of cash itself, but because stable finance denotes quality of security (Especially appealing to Taurus, Virgo and Capricorn). And if the man works hard to harvest those wealth and not because of his family - it is devilishly charming to a woman as he portrays success.<br><br>I had this good friend who once dated a rich girl. The parents despise him, thinking that he's in a relationship with her because of the money (and at the point of time, he wasn't very well educated as well, although he has now completed his private diploma). There was once his girlfriend invited him back for family dinner, which includes her family and some relatives. Of course her parents weren't very happy because it was the gf's decision to ask him, not that of her parents. Sensing the hostility, at the dinner table, he stood up and stunned everyone with his speech (In Mandarin).<br><br>(Translation) 'Uncle... Auntie, I know I am not rich and neither am I very educated. But even if I was destined to remain poor all my life, I would never take a single cent from your family. And if I were to marry her in the future, I would support her with my own means and promise that she and the kids would have three meals and a roof over her head... even if it means I must go hungry and have none myself.'<br><br>Everyone was shocked and his gf cried. Her uncle stood up, raise his beer and shout 'Hao! (Good in Mandarin), before telling him that he fancied his personality. Later he wanted my friend to work for him (they are doing construction business), but my friend rejected his kindness - telling him that he wants to depend on himself to make it big, not because of connection or her family influence.<br><br>Love transformed him into a man of character; is it the same for you? Or would you rather blame it on wealth and all the other mundane issues and live with such a mindset for your entire life?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>
