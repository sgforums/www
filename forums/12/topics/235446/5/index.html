            <div class='col-md body'>Rich guy better than poor guy?  No fricking way.<br><br>Unfortunately, many girls seem to be falling into the materialism trap.  The thing is, money does not equal happiness.  Money does not guarantee that a guy will treat you well.  Money cannot buy you a piece of mind.. you'd be more likely to worry about how to keep your rich husband under wraps while he's housing and jetting around with younger, prettier mistresses!<br><br>A strong, meaningful relationship is gradually formed as a couple goes through thick and thin together.  Money cannot possibly buy such understanding and trust in a relationship.<br><br>Besides, marrying a rich man isn't as simple as it sounds.  If you want to marry a rich man and keep him, you better make sure you will always be an asset, never a liability to him.  How many women who dream of marrying a rich man are *that* capable, or have *that* much to offer?  Many girls just want to be a pampered princess, that's why they lose footing in the relationship .. they are not ready to be a queen beside their rich husbands.  That's all fine and dandy - until you reach your 30s.<br><br>Poor man the best.  At least you know exactly what you're getting.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
