The role was advertised as a full-time job, which I was in fact not allowed  to apply for, within the conditions of my student visa.  The job was to completely redesign a recruitment system that could largely be put online, and the money offered was actually lower than what could be asked for that kind of project.<br><br>I figured what the hell and put in my application anyway.  From 1997 through 2000, I'd racked up a fair bit of experience in part-time jobs as a recruiter, and by the time I applied I'd had a fair bit of hands-on experience.  As it turns out, my practical knowledge was considered better than that of Masters' and PhD graduates who also applied.<br><br>Anyway, it came time to talk turkey with the boss and that's when I said that I was only allowed by the Immigration Department to work for 20 hours a week, which is half of the standard work week.  After a bit of negotiation, we settled on me doing 20 hours a week paid and the other half for free, but my hourly rate for the 20 paid hours would be doubled.  Like I said, all it takes is a bit of imagination and audacity - roll the dice and hold your nerve, and you never know what might come out of it. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Financial stability is really important. Think about it, couples normally quarrel over either money or relationship issues. If you have no financial worries, it's one less problem for the relationship.<br><br>Many girls in singapore grow up living a pampered life - protective parents or brothers, no need to do NS. It's only natural that they want to look of a husband who can continue to provide that kind of lifestyle for them. Even if the girl dont come from a rich family, she may have even more reasons to look for a husband who can look after her better than her parents did.<br><br>I think it really is a fact of life with the people in singapore these days. People have to understand if you want to have a gf of very high standards - good looks, high education. It's better that you belong to that league too.</div>
