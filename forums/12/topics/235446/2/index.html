            <div class='col-md body'>Hi to all, I am a guy and I have such question in mind when I suffered from a failed r/s. I asked quite alot of my female friends whether they would choose those who are financially stable or believe in love and work hard together for a better live. Alot would choose a guy who is financially stable. Some are willing to work hard with they person she loves but they hope to see where he will progressing in future....<br><br>But then, we agreed on one thing, the divorce rate are so high and who can guarantee that nothing will happen in future, be it girls looking for rich guys or guys looking for pretty girls etc etc.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm going to throw a curveball in here, working upon the understanding that "rich guy" doesn't simply mean that he's a brat from a rich family, and that he could well have made his own money.  That being the case, it raises the question of what's the horse and what's the carriage.  Could it be that the fellow's financial status is simply the result of him having already gotten his act together?<br><br>Put simply, guy A is a mess and he lack the ability to gain stability in both his finances and relationships.  Fellow B, on the other hand, has his act together and as a result is more attractive to the girl, with the financial stability being simply a nice fringe benefit.</div>
