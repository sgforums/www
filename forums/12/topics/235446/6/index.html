There was once his girlfriend invited him back for family dinner, which includes her family and some relatives.

Your friend has a backbone and a real belief. Belief that he can carve a niche for himself and the gal. Its nice and beautiful in a sense. I am very sure you feel great to have a good friend like him as you are to him too. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
