            <div class='col-md body'>Currently I'm working, my so call gf in Aust studying for her degree together with 2 guys (They were her poly mate &amp; one of them has been waiting for her for 5 years) They have been living under one roof for the past 8 months now. Who should i trust? The first 3 months abroad she called me at least once a week. But after that her excuse was "can't find me so it is better for me to call her". Claims to be busy wif her school work and stuff. Shld i wait for her? R shld i venture beyond and find someone else in SG. This guy who has been waiting for her for past 5 yrs now. I got her jus after 2 weeks of dating and we been together for almost 1 1/2 yrs now. In terms of looks and height i'm much superior to him but in terms of patience and caring he knows her more then i do. Afterall 5 yrs of waiting ain't tht short. She always expects me to pay for her a decent meals even when i myself ain't eating. Even till today. There are times i feel she is comparing me to her ex who drives a car and 5 yrs older then me. During our first few dates after we are together, she lied to me about going out with this older guy behind my back even though they were through. Even until now he still contact her even though she knows i don't like it. No one of her guy friends knows my existence. Not even that old guy. She would never tell her guy friend about me as a bf just assuming those who seen me with her shld know. She has this habit of getting very irritated when i happen to steal a look at girls. Even worst even when i'm not looking at gers jus looking straight on the street. A girl pass by infront of me and she told me off:" Why u look at girls for wht?". Tht spoilt the day. I've already told her tht she is my one and only and there is no one else in my life except her alot of TIMES. And yet her ans is:"If i'm the only one why do u hve to look? If u look means u hve lost interest in me and wnts to get another gf." This i can tolerate but wht i can't tolerate is she still keeps in contact with ther old guy (27 to be exact, i'm 24, they been together for jus 1 yr but as u see he sign on, got car, she waited for him for 1 yr to return from studies and yet i'm wif her while after he came back from aust she would cry to me and ask me why does he treat her so cold when I'M HER BF!!) Rite now i'm just working not knowing wht would happen when she cums back. Shld i hold on to this relationship? R shld i face the truth and move on? Cum on guys and girls with 2 guys staying with her under one roof There is little chance of her not "doing" with them? Even a slight petting could be possible? Girls will get lonely out there? As for me making money is my top priority rite now. Wht shld i do?<br>(I post to alot of times to you guys but no one respond)<br>Recently i jus say this ger at mech master at paya lebar working at the counter. Interested in her as she (I'm not sure either) show sign in me. It happen when i wore only once (as i'm alwasy wearing casually) my cousin polo tee. Quite fitting for me as my pecs and nipples poping out. (Is jus a fact) i feel tht she might notice me more often then usual, jus a feeling. As she now tok to me more then a little while when i used to jus xchange my coins for arcade coins, playing cs. Jus a feeling or m i being too overly sensitive becos of my lonelyness? Sorry guys if this takes a while to read. Jus join this forum not long and i wish to get some advice on it. Thks again<span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></div>
