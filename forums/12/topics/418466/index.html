              <p>What one resists persists, what one accepts frees. Otherwise, one is merely suppressing or at most one pursues at 'sth' else or someone else is subsituted.</p>
              <p>The 'problem' or it becomes one when one intreprets the 'clouds' for the sky. One can never be rid of the 'clouds' (emotions) and handling or trying to handle it is an exercise in futility. The anguish/pain is not from the circumstance/event/situation but cos of the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">identification</span> with the particular emotion.</p>
              <p>However, when one understands, acknowledges, accepts and knows that all emotions are akin to the 'passing clouds' and behind the clouds is the real me (the clear sky) one can handle oneself differently.</p>

              <p>There is nothing pathetically wrong with you, it is just your conscience at work over your anger to rein you from causing danger to yourself and others. Try to be forthcoming in charity by volunteering yourself, you get to met more conscientious personalities and learn from there. A conscience is more in tune if you get to maintain a constant bliss without over-reacting yourself <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>emotions are what distinguished us as humans..... its your experiences and mental script....u need to consult a psychologist or read a book called Managing Your Emotions...too much overflow may indicate unleashed states of neuro-biological reactions too...then you will need psychiatric help which is not your case...so dun worry...what u need is how u guide yourself...</p>
              <p>there are worst people who can't manage their emotions...in worst cases this become emotional disorders....they may transform themselves into..."dun make me angry, you wouldn't like me when i m angry"....</p>

              <p>Like you, I am a pretty emotional person myself and I find that emotions are something that you can never hide because it is a gift to us; it's just part of our nature. The harder you suppress it, the more painful it gets. </p>
              <p>What I do when I am upset, is to acknowledge that I am feeling sad, bawl my eyes out in private and then have a good laugh at myself. Because the most important attribute many of us lack, is the ability to laugh and let ourselves loose. Most importantly, learn to love yourself and you will accept your emotions better.</p>
              <p>Let yourself have some space when you are faced with a heated situation. Excuse yourself and walk off. There is no need to answer every question immediately. when you have calmed down sufficiently, then provide a careful and concise response.</p>
              <p>When someone is treating you unfairly, ignore what he is saying and try to think of mundane things that happen throughout the day while the guy is lecturing you. Like a shopping list you need to get for your groceries, or retracing your route back to work in your mind. If the person can't get an emotional response from you, you are unlikely to lose control of your emotions.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Im a guy and I hate the fact that my emotions always got the best of me. I just cant seem to fight it. Whenever I blew top or got really angry, I feel that my tears starts rolling down my eyes. Whats wrong with me? How can I stop this thing?<br><br>Watching an emotional scene from a movie can drove me to my tears too. I never cried at the movies cuz never watch sad movies at the theatre.</span></p>
