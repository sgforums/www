Her school stuff was always more important to her, her netball, her prefect stuff, her friends. i never seem to be one of the things she holds dear to. then i initiated a break.... she was devistated, but i held on to my decision. i was 18, and her, 16.

(more like i avoid her...)<br><br>Fast forward to 2003, we met thru some old friends and rekindled the relationship. she just broke up with her BF and was in a very fragile situation. i came a gave her the encouragement to live life again, thru this time, i realised i fell for her, slowly but surely.... but she didnt want to commit to anything so we are just friends, or rather, very close friends( if you know what i mean ).<br><br>i went into NS( dont you think there's too much of this kinda stories?) and some school mate of hers decides to hit on her. and she followed. i was in camp, knowing that she's betraying me, yet there was nothing i could do. Now she regrets her actions, and wants things to be like last time(2003) but i lost all faith and trust in her, i cant even see her message someone without thinking that it might be a/that guy. she still cant commit to a relationship. i've been trying to avoid her, to not talk to her, but it seems it doesnt work. she tries everything to want things to be like they used to be.<br><br>she wants me but she doesnt want a relationship. and i feel trapped. i cant stay like this, i need to move on...<br><br>please, read my life and tell me what should i do..<br><br>regards....<br><br></div></blockquote>She has never learnt her lesson from the past r/s.. When she was with you.. She still young.. understandable that she cou;dn't commit or really fully understand what a r/s was for.. ut then after 6 years.. She's still living in the world.. SHe has a problem with herself.. Something which she herself don't even know.. But only outsiders can see.. <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>"HIDDEN SELF".</strong></span><br><br>She wants to have the best of both world.. to have you.. and yet not into a r/s.. She's seriously not ready for a r/s.. You are so close but yet so far away from her emotionally and spiritually.. Don;t let her tied you down.. She being so inferior.. and then you give her the security.. and/ or rather you still can be the "spare tyre" for her.. when she's out of love or blah blah.. she catches and get hold of your weakness.. which she knows that no matter what.. you still be there for her..<br><br>If you really don't wan to live your life like this.. with her manipulating your life and screwed your youth.. then move on! You stil can be her friend.. but then dun <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>PUT TOO MUCH ATTENTION on her!!! </strong></span>The more you do.. the more she become dependent on you.. You wan to get your life on.. and find your own true love.. Stay as friends.. Even if you enter into this r/s there will be no good ending.. Stop now.. and let the past be a good memorable one.. rather a bad one... AT least you know you do have some good times with her when you think back.. and not too much of the bad ones...<br><br>Well, as a friend or whoever you think you are to her.. have a talk with her.. tell her what's her problem in r/s.. or when comes to such situation.. Don't reprimand her.. but jus a good and nice chat.. pinned out the point that she needs to learn from... Your r/s and maybe if you can help.. her previous r/s too.. This will let her know what's always goes wrong... Tell her when she's out of a r/s she doesn't lose everything.. she learn a precious lesson in her life..<br><br>Cheers..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

So why do you feel betrayed? You mentioned that you don't want to commit and remained very good friends - so what's the issue of her accepting another guy into her life at that period of time? Where is your position to forbid?<br><br>You are afraid to be hurt, yet you walked close to the flame. As your circled around the fire, you didn't even realise you grew closer and closer to it until the flame licks you and causes you to yell.<br><br>She doesn't even know what she wants - and she lack the courage (probably the face as well) to enter into a relationship with you. <strong>Woman in their first love, loved their lovers. In all others, they loved love.</strong> If you can't give her what she wants, she has to out-source. You are right about the fragile period, she is still within the process, trying to find a way out.<br><br>You people should remain friends for the moment and that's it. Until maybe next time when you wished to make a decision regarding the both of you. Sometimes, what is presented to you, isn't something you HAVE to have - <span style="text-decoration: underline;">you have a choice. </span>But if it will cause you fall for her and at the same time, create misery for you. Reduce friendship to a causal one. Remember, you don't always have to chat on the phone, meet up or anything to be considered as a friend. And you don't have to be a good one here - causal would do just fine.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

Her school stuff was always more important to her, her netball, her prefect stuff, her friends. i never seem to be one of the things she holds dear to. then i initiated a break.... she was devistated, but i held on to my decision. i was 18, and her, 16. (now if you're thinking this sounds like puppy love, it is. but it's something you'll never foget.) we never met after that. (more like i avoid her...)<br><br>Fast forward to 2003, we met thru some old friends and rekindled the relationship. she just broke up with her BF and was in a very fragile situation. i came a gave her the encouragement to live life again, thru this time, i realised i fell for her, slowly but surely.... but she didnt want to commit to anything so we are just friends, or rather, very close friends( if you know what i mean ).<br><br>i went into NS( dont you think there's too much of this kinda stories?) and some school mate of hers decides to hit on her. and she followed. i was in camp, knowing that she's betraying me, yet there was nothing i could do. Now she regrets her actions, and wants things to be like last time(2003) but i lost all faith and trust in her, i cant even see her message someone without thinking that it might be a/that guy. she still cant commit to a relationship. i've been trying to avoid her, to not talk to her, but it seems it doesnt work. she tries everything to want things to be like they used to be.<br><br>she wants me but she doesnt want a relationship. and i feel trapped. i cant stay like this, i need to move on...<br><br>please, read my life and tell me what should i do..<br><br>regards....<br><br></div></blockquote>u noe wat? e kind of ppl who i hate most r betrayers!!! if she could do this to u, she can do tt again... y risk it?? i agree with some of e repliers tt she is indeed one selfish pig!!! she juz wans u as a spare tyre... so when she has no one, at least there's u for her to lean upon.... surely u can do betta without this "leech"... u deserve betta... mayb u can still stay as frenz... but kick her off ur potential gf list....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Whats in the past IS already in the past. Why bother to TRY going back to those good old days, when deep down inside you know that things will never be like it used to?<br>I think it's about time you should move on and not look back. The past is worth reminiscing, but why live in it? You should live for the future. Think abt this. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
