I stared at her long, silky hair, and wished she was mine. But she didn't notice me like that, and I knew it. After class, she walked up to me and asked me for the notes she had missed the day before. handed them to her. She said 'thanks' and gave me a kiss on the cheek. I want to tell her, I want her to know that I dont want to be just friends, I love her but I'm just too shy, and I dont know why.<br><br>--------------------<br><br>The phone rang. On the other end, it was her. She was in tears, mumbling on and on about how her love had broke her heart. She asked me to come over because she didn't want to be alone, so I did. As I sat next to her on the sofa, I stared at her soft eyes, wishing she was mine. After 2 hours, one Drew Barrymore movie, and three bags of chips, she decided to go to sleep.She looked at me, said 'thanks' and gave me a kiss on the cheak. I want to tell her, I want her to know that I don't want to be just friends, I love her but I'm just too shy, and I dont know why.<br><br>--------------------<br><br>The day before prom she walked to my locker. "My date is sick" she said,"hes not gonna go" well, I didn't have a date, and in 7th grade, we made a promise that if neither of us had dates, we would go together- just as 'best friends'. So we did.Prom night, after everything was over, I was standing at her front door step.I stared at her as she she smiled at me and stared at me with her crystal eyes. I want her to be mine, but she doesn't think of me like that, and I know it. Then she said- "I had the best time, thanks!" and gave me a kiss on the cheek. I want to tell her, I want her to know that I dont want to be just friends, I love her but I'm just too shy, and I don't know why.<br><br>A day passed, then a week, then a month. Before Icould blink, it was graduation day. I watched as her perfect body floated likean angle up on stage to get her diploma. I wanted her to be mine-but she didn't notice me like that, and I knew it. Before everyone went home, she came to me in her smock and hat, and cried as i hugged her. Then she lifted her head from myshoulder and said- 'you're my best friend, thanks' and gave me a kiss on the cheek.
