              <p>Do you have enough savings to last you for a year or more?</p>
              <p>If you have, go ahead and quit your job. You can always find a new job later (though it may be difficult), but once your friend is gone she won't be back. </p>
              <p>If she is just "another friend", you may have to think twice. But since she really needs you, and you are really that close to her, there isn't much reasons save for financial ones for you to leave her be.</p>
              <p>Touchwood, but who knows if she will even return from this trip? If she didn't, then at least her last moments are with someone whom she wants to be with, and not alone with some random tour agency.</p>
              <p>If you do not have enough savings, you can consider borrowing from your family or close friends, but do return the money to them once you have the financial ability to do so.</p>

              <p>Im having a dilemma now. Im starting my new job soon and at same time I have a friend who wants me to accompany her for a trip to Europe. </p>
              <p>The problem here is, she has stage 3 lung cancer and was told by her doctors she only have about 3-6 months to live. But she still wants to go for the trip anyway.</p>
              <p>Since Im starting a new job, I know my leave wont be approve and my friend wants to be there at least 2 weeks. And since she dont have much time, I may have to quit my job and help her fulfilled her dying wish. She has made it clear to me that she only wants to go with me and no one else. She even offered to pay for my expenses. I feel bad about that.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So shall I quit my new job to help her fulfilled her wish? Im at a loss now and I dont know what to say. She's in a very fragile state and I have to be careful with my words. I've no experience in dealing with such people. And she needs me by her side for the remaining time that she has.</p>

              <p><br>I think you have to be fair here, it is part of a christian duty to ask people to join them, to them, the mission is to save as much people as possible. But then, on the other hand, it is up to you to join or not, there is no force issue as to someone putting a gun on your head to ask you to join or face a bullet in your head ya.</p>
              <p>Sure, no one can tell u what happen after death, no even the hindu, the buddhist, and so on. But religion is a believe and a faith, if people are inclined to it, so be it. And there is never any ill intention in asking people to join, aint it?</p>
              <p>Dying will happen to everyone, by weighing the pros and cons, TS should be able to decide for himself whether to accompany her thru her last days or be more wise to take care of the alive rather than those going to die. But if TS is going to regret  and feel remorseful after her death, then better be with her. Make issue simple ya</p>
