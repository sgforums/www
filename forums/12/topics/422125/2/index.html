              <p>Err.....how close are you to her ?</p>
              <p>If I am you...most likely I will try to go with her....</p>
              <p>Maybe you try to talk to your new company and see if you can get to be excused for 2 weeks.....try to talk....who knows....</p>
              <p>So if they allow you to go, then problem solved.</p>
              <p>Let's say if the company does not allow....</p>
              <p>Mmm.....</p>
              <p>Maybe I will still go.</p>
              <p>Because this friend is dying......you can always search for another job, if the worst case happens that the company fires you (may or may not be the case)</p>
              <p>And also I will not think so much about whether I am close or not close to this friend....because she has asked for you.....which means for her, you are her closest one....so even if you dont feel close to her, at least I believe you should try to help.</p>
              <p>Ok good luck.</p>

              <p>The problem here is, she has stage 3 lung cancer and was told by her doctors she only have about 3-6 months to live. But she still wants to go for the trip anyway.</p>
              <p>Since Im starting a new job, I know my leave wont be approve and my friend wants to be there at least 2 weeks. And since she dont have much time, I may have to quit my job and help her fulfilled her dying wish. She has made it clear to me that she only wants to go with me and no one else. She even offered to pay for my expenses. I feel bad about that.</p>

I've no experience in dealing with such people. And she needs me by her side for the remaining time that she has.</p>

I dun look at people who act pitiful and think that is a heroic or brave thing to do to kill onself inorder to save the other, take care of yourself first before taking care of others, and face the any issue in life at face value, do not seek death, it is the most lame of all lames</p>

              <p><br>by ending one own life to save another, do you think you very heroic ar??? hello, this is not those bollywood or hollywood show hor, ending one own life is the worst crime of all crimes, meaning self murdering, do you know that those who took their own life end up being handcuffed, attend a court session, get caned and jail term too, even over their death bodies, because the law is fair, you murder yourself, you need to be punish. I dun look at people who act pitiful and think that is a heroic or brave thing to do to kill onself inorder to save the other, take care of yourself first before taking care of others, and face the any issue in life at face value, do not seek death, it is the most lame of all lames</p>

              <p>Im having a dilemma now. Im starting my new job soon and at same
              time I have a friend who wants me to accompany her for a trip to
              Europe. </p>
              <p>The problem here is, she has stage 3 lung cancer and was told by
              her doctors she only have about 3-6 months to live. But she still
              wants to go for the trip anyway.</p>
              <p>Since Im starting a new job, I know my leave wont be approve and
              my friend wants to be there at least 2 weeks. And since she dont
              have much time, I may have to quit my job and help her fulfilled
              her dying wish. She has made it clear to me that she only wants to
              go with me and no one else. She even offered to pay for my
              expenses. I feel bad about that.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So shall I quit my new job to help her fulfilled her wish? Im at
              a loss now and I dont know what to say. She's in a very fragile
              state and I have to be careful with my words. I've no experience in
              dealing with such people. And she needs me by her side for the
              remaining time that she has.</p>
