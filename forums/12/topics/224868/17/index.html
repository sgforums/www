Otherwise, wouldnt it appear that he/she just want best part of the relationship and not making efforts to overcome the problems that come with it?

For eg, i never expect to see him more regular than weekends (which is the understanding of the relationship).  I never expect him to be here for me when i was in really bad shape, when i was really troubled.  All i ask for from this man, who says he wants to be there for me, to be there for me over the phone.  Too much to ask for?  Is that something that is unreasonable to expect from a LDR or any relationship?<br><br>Btw, i dont have "previous bad experience with LDR", for the record.  That relationship didnt breakdown because it is a LDR.<br><br>I do agree that the more I harbour on the trust factor that eats into my insecurity, the more tormented i feel inside of me.

I had considered that a man who wants to cheat can attempt to do it at all cost.  But if there is no red flag, and the man shows he is sincere, shouldnt we try not to be too skeptical and think every man is a cheat?  Well, that is the path i chose.  I chose to believe that he is sincere, and with no red flag, i slowly begin to build my trust over the 3 mths plus.<br><br>Anyway, like wat you said, anything is possible.  With all the red flags (MIA), my insecurity has bred, hence this thread.<br><br>Just fyi, i had explored the reasons that gave rise to the MIA, well, the reasons are the same as yours (highlighted in blue).<br><br>I am glad that you wrote that.
