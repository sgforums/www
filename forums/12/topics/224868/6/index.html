Of course he didnt do that, and i wouldnt expect that too.  He was really joking (confirmed by the hindsight).</div>

I do not expect him to meet me all the time.  Infact most of the time, we dun meet, except on weekends, which during some weekends, he also cant make it.  I accepted that graciously too.  We can dun talk long on the phone daily, i know he is busy, fine, no long hours of chatting on the phone then.<br><br>Is being contactable too much to ask for?  Hey, i am not asking him to make sure he answers all my calls you know?  I am merely saying, do not miss ALL my calls.  Too much to ask for?<br></div>
