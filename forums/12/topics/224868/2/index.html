            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by bee_gal:</div><div class="quote_body">Yes, i may be a little narrow minded in this, but we had juz met 2 days and talked in the phone for barely more than an hour and msn another hour in the past 2 1/2 weeks, within one week after we are officially together when we talked for hours daily juz before that.<br><br>(This is the first weekend inthe past 3-4 mths that we didnt meet up).<br><br>And to make things worse, i was also down cos of something unfortunate happened at work.<br><br>And as if things arent bad enough, during the 2 1/2 weeks, i tried not to disturb him too much, so i barely called him.  But all the 4 times that i called him, he also didnt answer the calls, though he had returned my calls perhaps some 15min to half hour later.  Due to the lack of time spent and therefore lack of communication too, i really feel so alone, and he is not there for me too (i am really upset by the unfortunate things that happened in office. he is aware of this).<br><br>A relationship may not be all about companionship, but it is companionship that helps both parties understand each other, forge understanding and therefore the growth of emotional attachment, isnt it?  Without being there, how can you assure your loved ones that 'you are there' for the person?  to be the pillar of support for your loved ones?<br><br>I also understand that relationship can be eventful and full of obstacles, but 'different level' of relationship can only handle the stress levels in that stage, no?  For example,  2 people in a relationship of 2 years, may be able to manage a LDR in the event the guy/gal needs to go overseas to work for half year.  Do you expect a relationship of 2 months to be able to handle that?<br><br>Yes, the more intense the fire burns, the faster it will extinguish itself.  But do not let the fire be so small, hoping that it will last.  Because, the fire may juz be so small and weak, that it goes off anytime.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation"> </div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Your mindset is veered towards some uncontrollable ill feeling, bred from negativity that came from your subconscious. If you actually read what you write, there are self-made conclusion/s appearing in your post even if there wasn't plot moving along that direction.<br><br>You are worried that your relationship couldn't take the distance, given the reason that this relationship is young. Contrary to your belief, most LDR failed because they are lengthy and not because they are relatively young in nature.<br><br>If your relationship cannot even stomach that distance, it really wonders how are you going to envision your relationship to overcome greater obstacles that will bound to crash in your way? (I am assuming from that fact that this isn't an LDR because you have mentioned that you did meet him up before he left overseas to visit his sister. And because of the nature of his trip, it is highly unlikely that he will remain there and transform this relationship into a LDR?)<br><br>In fact, your post worries me because you do not seem to have anybody else dependable to resolve your crisis. You have misread my post for belittling the role of companionship in a relationship; I mentioned that the <strong>over-emphasis </strong>on companionship makes a relationship unhealthy - it wasn't implied that they arenÂ’t important. Same goes for over-dependency... of anything. (Worst if Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces)<br><br>I don't see a reason why should you fear having your 'small flame' die out. Is he even showing signs of drifting in the first place? Or is there anything suspicious that could constitute cheating or anything critical to extinguish that little flame of yours?<br><br>Absolute nothing my dear... it's just you.<br><br>P.S: When you stack bricks of Lego one after another - the taller it is, the easier it is to fall. Although it's equally possible for uneven placing of Lego bricks to collapse from a shorter build, but one thing for sure - it's easier to clear up and start all over again and the impact of the fall is less 'deafening'?<br><br>I am sure you understand what I am driving at. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

Altho you are his gf, but he has other commitments too.<br><br>Distance makes the heart fonder.  Dun worry too much.  I believe when his sis is well, and he's not so occupied with work, he will look for you.<br><br>I dun think it's not appropriate to show concern for his sis, but since u said they are overseas, then perhaps there's nothing much you can do.  But be supportive of him ba.  Can understand the stress that he is going thru.. work, sister in hospital etc.. be a bit more understanding, put yourself in his shoes and be there for him whenever he needs you.  </span></div>

Any girl will start wondering what happened as the amount of time spent on phone and dating actually dropped so drastically as soon as you accepted his courtship and went into a relationship.<br><br>Are you thinking out loud if he's really serious with you or not? Or was he doing all those previously just so to get you, and once his objective is achieved he'll just chuck you aside and concentrate back on his work?<br><br>If you really are thinking about this, I would suggest you not to let your mind intoxicate you.  Because these are all what you are conjuring up, whether or not it is true is yet to be proven.<br><br>In a new relationship, lots of communication is required as both parties start to learn newer and deeper things about your partner that wasn't so apparent during the courtship days.<br><br>So a whole load of fitting in is taking place during this time. The fact that his sister met with an accident only means you can use this incident to see how he handles such emergencies.<br><br>After this thing is over, find a time and have a good talk with him. Share with each other your expectations of a relationship and of him.<br><br>Since you must have like him enough to accept him as your boyfriend, then the least you can do now (if not helping him to take care of his sister) is to give him the benefit of the doubt. After all, you've been together for only 3 weeks, and you don't really know him too well yet.<br><br>Lastly, what is stopping you from showing concern to his sister? It may just mean a great deal to him, especially when you've only been together for 3 weeks and you already can have such care and concern for his family members. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br><span style="color: red;">Don't worry too excessively.
