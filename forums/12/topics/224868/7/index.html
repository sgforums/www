It appears there are things going on at his end that make it hard for him to talk openly comfortably when you call. If he's busy, if he's taking lunch with someone, what's so hard in telling you what he's doing at that moment unless he's got a private life that he hasn't/don't dare to tell you. I feel a genuine bf (gf for me) should readily be happy to answer and talk when the phone rings even if he's busy - he just simply needs to answer and tell you (and others around him) how he's and you're doing. What's so difficult with that unless he doesn't want some people (single ladies) around him know he's attached?<br><br></div>

Got happened a few times, but he always called back as soon as possible. reason is cos he sometimes has to go meet client or attend lessons, so his hp will be on silent mode. Then when I call he wudnt hear the ring so will only call back when he sees the missed call sign on his phone. Either that or he was showering, eating with his family, etc.<br><br>I trust him, so if he calls back and tell me the reason, I wud believe what he said <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> Trust is also very important in a r/s...and I understand that both of us sometimes have very busy schedule, so some calls mite get missed (I missed some calls too sometimes, but similarly I will make sure I returned the call as soon as possible).<br><br>maybe just bring this issue up to him? Said that you will feel worried if he does not call you back. tell him that both of you are in a LDR, so constant communication is important. Ask him if he is willing to make this effort. If he says he is too busy with other matters, then ask him does he really have time and energy to maintain a r/s?</div>
