He may be just being honest with you. But if this the current trend of work then you have to be prepared to be with this kind of schedule in the future with him<br><br>if you think you cannot handle this kind of pressure , then give it up.<br><br>its a matter of both of you , neither i or any ppl with infinite wisdom can give you the ultimate answer, just viewpoints from parties who dont know you or him , or the real details or stories. we are not good enough to judge your relationship.<br><br>dont take us seriously , take your ownself seriously.<br><br>and i say again pls dont seriously consider the opinions, just read and digest.<br><br>then final decision lies with you but<br>make it fast and snappy.<br><br></div>

Being more insensitive to things is often the way he choose to handle things. Similarly, he can choose not to be. Though the latter is often not his style. He is more for insensitivity when it comes to emotions handling usually because this is not so much of his good ground and more so since he's a male.

Did he told you in quite actual words that it'll take 4 months to do his back log? Did he even explained why?<br><span style="color: blue;">-&gt;yes, he told me in actual words over sms:  "im worried abt neglecting you but i also know realistically i need 4 solid mths to settle my stuff and obligations"</span><br><br>2nd thing. <span style="color: blue;">Remember you told me that he can't make it for the weekends, then there'll be no way this relationship would be going on? But now he's buying a 4 months.. He has probably reversed the table well and effectively by hitting on your weak spot.. Trust issues aside. Even IF he's trustworthy, would you be able to stand and handle a relationship in such a form? </span><span style="color: orange;">Like I've already suggested to you before, you'll probably just slips into a shape he has formed up for you.. A role for you to play in his life.. Intentionally or unintentionally.. True love or not..  It seems very well to me that he's still holding the upper hand rather well. Won't you agree with me?</span><br><br><span style="color: blue;">-&gt;True, i share the same opinion too.  Well, i will clarify with him and get him to be more specific about it, if that is really the case, then it will be too hard a deal to take.  i cant live in a state of insecurity and confusion for almost half year.   Not acceptable.<br>That is a deal breaker.</span><br><br><span style="color: orange;">-&gt;True.  But i dun mind slipping into a shape formed if that is consistent with what i want and it is good for me.  Well, if the shape isnt, there is always a solution for that:  bail out.</span><br><br>Last set of questions.. Did the part where he told you he has slacked in his work appeared in MSN or e-mails? <span style="color: orange;">(MSN)</span><br>How often do both of you chat over MSN? <span style="color: blue;">(used to be evey evening, not much durin the past 3 weeks.  Resumed again the nite b4 last nite)</span>E-mails? ](used to be evey day (office hours), not much durin the past 3 weeks till now)[/color]What 'bad news' he told you last night? <span style="color: orange;">(he has to be overseas for almost a week)</span>From the time he broke the news about how he had slacked from his work to last night... About how long was the duration?<br><span style="color: darkred;"> he vaguely broke that news to me 2-3 weeks ago, we didnt have much time to talk till sunday night, monday morning he told me the extent of how he neglected his work.</span><br>Any much communication (close chat) between the both of you during that period?</strong> <span style="color: blue;"> -&gt; what is close chat communication?</span> [/b]</blockquote>At this point I maintain that there's no concrete or valid reason to doubt him. But my trust level for him has gone down. Combined with the minors which had happened before this, I no longer hold a 50-50 stand. But to be fair to him, I would say my trust level has only gone down that little.<br><br>Were you sad and let him knew that you were sad when he broke the news of his 'work slack' weeks back? Were you sad when he went on to talk about the extent of his negligence on work because of you again weeks after he had 1st broke the 'news' to you? Did you show your sadness or something?<br><br>Your bf has plans probably. To lead you forward through time? To the time where he could be with you in Singapore. He seems to have much confidence of himself from there on. But he's more or less carrying out his plans on his own. Not working hand in hand with you. In a way, you might like to see it as 'dishonest'. But it's not totally fair to penalise him on that. At this point, it's more of his true intention which I'm concerned with.<br><br>Btw, did he sounded very stable as he broke the 'news' of not being to be truly with you for 4 months? Or did he sounded more like confused and desperate?<br><br>You mentioned that you're ok with the way he wants to shape you if it's ok enough.<br><br>He already has plans to bring you along there. Remember how I told you it's difficult to reach forward for this relationship? You can do so now if you just flow along his plans... Of course, 'penalties' being that you would suffering more on your end compared to him.. And you would have no proper build on that already missing foundation. Meaning you're likely to be on more shaky grounds as the situation develops.<br><br>That should bring you to the part I've mentioned to you about the clash between your characters. And it's also very likely that you'll be seeing so much more of him which you have not really seen before. Just on a contradictary note.. Notice how little you do know about him in certain ways...? This is part of his character... It could be good or bad thing.. But judging on the part on your character clash, it's very more likely to be a bad thing...<br><br>You don't have to worry about the part on 'close chat communication', I've already got the answer I want from your post.<br><br>It's interesting for me to have neglected.. And yet occur to me at this point that you're somehow already 'attached' and 'bounded' to him in certain ways... That though you have no strong foundation with him... And despite the doubts... You have already chose to go on with him to see more? This form of 'attachment' is readily seen as part of your character. And as you go along with him on this relationship... knowing or not knowing where you're moving along... This 'attachment' would naturally grow in you. But mark though this is no 'foundation'. Something which could seems rather similar in feelings, and likely to confuse your senses and thinkings with time spent. And I think? There're still some facts which you're 'hiding' from me..? Which you've probably just dismissed as 'unneccessary' to disclose or share.... Nonetheless.. Not so important for now...?<br><br>Last note. Your bf? What are the chances that he could be reading all these...? Do you want him to know? That might cause him to change the way he choose the way he might react to you or handle you...? Difficult for certain judgements I should say...? Maybe we should just go 'invisible'?</div>
