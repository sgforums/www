            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Devil1976:</div><div class="quote_body">He is established. He is commited to his work. This is the way he has to stay.<br><br>I'm not sure how physically attractive he is in person. But he has 'x factor' and probably great personality. Great company. He sort of have you glued to him, but the logical part of you is working it out to be a 'no no'.<br><br>I still stands on my ground that you hold much doubts and distrust in him. I won't really blame you for that though. If you force me to guess, I would say he's sort of 'suspcious' for his background too. Though given his character, the things that are happening now could have well been happening with concrete truth too? So basically, I would say there's hardly concrete proofs about your doubts in him. This point the trust factor me would be standing a 50-50.<br><br>Is he a good sex partner? I think the doubts you hold in him.. The insecurity is at least partly related to what's attracting you to him.<br><br>You can be a confused person by nature. And insecurity breeds fairly easy in you under the right conditions. The more problematic side is that you often act 'cool' about things and only to 'suffer' in silent. The more optimestic side of you often would choose to 'suicide' a relationship much faster than you would like to believe you could.<br><br>He is not suitable for you in character. He is a 'leader' but you often likes to be loved and pampered. Not to be 'ordered around'. He can be so inspirational but he can also be quite 'plain strict'. He can be stubborn, determined and strong-headed. You are in your own ways so, though your ways are often not so direct.<br><br>Simply put your characters and ways of management would easily clash. He would not be likely to keep up to you, though he would like to believe so. He is one who strongly believes in himself. You're one who rather see the 'truth' and reality with your very own eyes.<br><br>On the long run, you'll be 'degrading' to him. You'll spoil and condemn his 'ego' if he keeps you by his side. On the other hand, whatever's attracting you to him, you would not be having much at least for the time being. Only time can tell the story further for you if you're even interested in listening to it.<br><br>You're right he's a highly insecured person. And he likes to hold certain form of 'control' over the 'things' he 'own'. Especially if that person's so very dear to himself. This is another loophole between 2 of your characters.<br><br>When I mentioned that he's a 'warrior out of a battlefield', I meant after his courtship phase.. He would expect himself to be taking a 'break' or going back to focus on his work which he might have more neglected while going after you.<br><br>He's one more for long run (the way he sees it) if he's really honest and heart true to you. Neglect the 'little things' (which you so much treasure). If he's truthfully, he might be seeing further. Like the 'next year' thing he was talking about. His only main fact is his attractiveness and sometimes as a man might stray? More likely he would be a loyal partner if he is not holding any plan to hide anything to you. He would rightly claim his own 'break' from the courtship to walk a longer distance.<br><br>When I mentioned that ya need a lesser need to 'lag' after courtship. I meant you actually expects the relationship to start NOW.. Straightaway... While he's sort of like on a 'detour' to you?<br><br>You're one who like to enjoy every significant moments you can with someone you love and like... While he's more like one who creates 'significant moments' in parts... With voids in between the various periods within a relationship... On this note, a LDR can be quite a good choice for him so long as he can get his security in check.

It would be unfair for the both of you to just blindly comment on that.<br><br>I do agree that a minimum level of trust have to be there in order for the relationship to at least be on stable moving motion. It won't sound logical at all to be on absolute blind trust if you have none to start with? 'Blind trust' can only be added (on willingness on a party) if there's sufficient and adequate trust already existing on the ground. A good example of this would be a relationship's foundation.<br><br>Not that absolute 'blind trust' couldn't be issued when fundamental trust level is not there, but it would then be weighed on other more 'instinctive' factors. Often one might just end up a lousy gambler. Could risk to be really degrading to one self (or his / her judgements) if the stake isn't returned in kind?</div>
