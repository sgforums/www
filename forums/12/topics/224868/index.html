Any girl will start wondering what happened as the amount of time spent on phone and dating actually dropped so drastically as soon as you accepted his courtship and went into a relationship.<br><br>Are you thinking out loud if he's really serious with you or not? Or was he doing all those previously just so to get you, and once his objective is achieved he'll just chuck you aside and concentrate back on his work?<br><br>If you really are thinking about this, I would suggest you not to let your mind intoxicate you.  Because these are all what you are conjuring up, whether or not it is true is yet to be proven.<br><br>In a new relationship, lots of communication is required as both parties start to learn newer and deeper things about your partner that wasn't so apparent during the courtship days.<br><br>So a whole load of fitting in is taking place during this time. The fact that his sister met with an accident only means you can use this incident to see how he handles such emergencies.<br><br>After this thing is over, find a time and have a good talk with him. Share with each other your expectations of a relationship and of him.<br><br>Since you must have like him enough to accept him as your boyfriend, then the least you can do now (if not helping him to take care of his sister) is to give him the benefit of the doubt. After all, you've been together for only 3 weeks, and you don't really know him too well yet.<br><br>Lastly, what is stopping you from showing concern to his sister? It may just mean a great deal to him, especially when you've only been together for 3 weeks and you already can have such care and concern for his family members. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Don't worry too excessively.

Not that it's wrong, but overemphasise on one's company is unhealthy.<br><br>Broaden your mind and heart a little - don't be so narrow in perspective. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers[/b]</blockquote>Yes, i may be a little narrow minded in this, but we had juz met 2 days and talked in the phone for barely more than an hour and msn another hour in the past 2 1/2 weeks, within one week after we are officially together when we talked for hours daily juz before that.<br><br>(This is the first weekend inthe past 3-4 mths that we didnt meet up).<br><br>And to make things worse, i was also down cos of something unfortunate happened at work.<br><br>And as if things arent bad enough, during the 2 1/2 weeks, i tried not to disturb him too much, so i barely called him.  But all the 4 times that i called him, he also didnt answer the calls, though he had returned my calls perhaps some 15min to half hour later.  Due to the lack of time spent and therefore lack of communication too, i really feel so alone, and he is not there for me too (i am really upset by the unfortunate things that happened in office. he is aware of this).<br><br>A relationship may not be all about companionship, but it is companionship that helps both parties understand each other, forge understanding and therefore the growth of emotional attachment, isnt it?  Without being there, how can you assure your loved ones that 'you are there' for the person?  to be the pillar of support for your loved ones?<br><br>I also understand that relationship can be eventful and full of obstacles, but 'different level' of relationship can only handle the stress levels in that stage, no?  For example,  2 people in a relationship of 2 years, may be able to manage a LDR in the event the guy/gal needs to go overseas to work for half year.  Do you expect a relationship of 2 months to be able to handle that?<br><br>Yes, the more intense the fire burns, the faster it will extinguish itself.  But do not let the fire be so small, hoping that it will last.  Because, the fire may juz be so small and weak, that it goes off anytime.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation"></div>

The last sat, when we were out, he suddenly said his only younger sister met an accident and he had to go home.<br><br>Since then, we hadnt really talked much cos he said he had been in the hospital.  he has sms me now n then, but not much.  I also didnt call him cos dun wanna disturb him.<br><br>I dunno why i feel so insecure about the whole thing, that after we are together, suddenly he is so occupied by this and that.<br><br>Am i oversensitive?</div></blockquote>Apart from being understanding by just simply leaving him alone, perhaps make an effort to find out what exactly happened to his sister and how she is doing etc?  Listen if he tells you but if he's not ready to talk, don't push.
