But my trust level for him has gone down. Combined with the minors which had happened before this, I no longer hold a 50-50 stand. But to be fair to him, I would say my trust level has only gone down that little.<br><br>Were you sad and let him knew that you were sad when he broke the news of his 'work slack' weeks back? Were you sad when he went on to talk about the extent of his negligence on work because of you again weeks after he had 1st broke the 'news' to you? Did you show your sadness or something?<br><br>Your bf has plans probably. To lead you forward through time? To the time where he could be with you in Singapore. He seems to have much confidence of himself from there on. But he's more or less carrying out his plans on his own. Not working hand in hand with you. In a way, you might like to see it as 'dishonest'. But it's not totally fair to penalise him on that. At this point, it's more of his true intention which I'm concerned with.<br><br>Btw, did he sounded very stable as he broke the 'news' of not being to be truly with you for 4 months? Or did he sounded more like confused and desperate?<br><br>You mentioned that you're ok with the way he wants to shape you if it's ok enough.<br><br>He already has plans to bring you along there. Remember how I told you it's difficult to reach forward for this relationship? You can do so now if you just flow along his plans... Of course, 'penalties' being that you would suffering more on your end compared to him.. And you would have no proper build on that already missing foundation. Meaning you're likely to be on more shaky grounds as the situation develops.<br><br>That should bring you to the part I've mentioned to you about the clash between your characters. And it's also very likely that you'll be seeing so much more of him which you have not really seen before. Just on a contradictary note.. Notice how little you do know about him in certain ways...? This is part of his character... It could be good or bad thing.. But judging on the part on your character clash, it's very more likely to be a bad thing...<br><br>You don't have to worry about the part on 'close chat communication', I've already got the answer I want from your post.<br><br>It's interesting for me to have neglected.. And yet occur to me at this point that you're somehow already 'attached' and 'bounded' to him in certain ways... That though you have no strong foundation with him... And despite the doubts... You have already chose to go on with him to see more? This form of 'attachment' is readily seen as part of your character. And as you go along with him on this relationship... knowing or not knowing where you're moving along... This 'attachment' would naturally grow in you. But mark though this is no 'foundation'. Something which could seems rather similar in feelings, and likely to confuse your senses and thinkings with time spent. And I think? There're still some facts which you're 'hiding' from me..? Which you've probably just dismissed as 'unneccessary' to disclose or share.... Nonetheless.. Not so important for now...?<br><br>Last note. Your bf? What are the chances that he could be reading all these...? Do you want him to know? That might cause him to change the way he choose the way he might react to you or handle you...? Difficult for certain judgements I should say...? Maybe we should just go 'invisible'?</div></blockquote>i think if if comes to this, its very sad already because it has become a game of chess for two parties rather than a simple bf/gf situation. Now the scenario has become a war games with war room situation.<br>Situation that can be resolved easily has become complicated with too many scenario plots etc.To be honest i really dont have much respect for affected parties to air their agonies on the internet and form their decision on other parties rationale.<br>Its rather sad that you have other people to dictate your love life, i don tknow how old are you but you should have enough sensibility and maturity judging from your post<br>What i think is only lacking your courage in carrying out what you decide.</div>

Though personally I don't feel much as I'm a devil. n fact, I think the TS believes it's pointless to go on 'war games' too?<br><br>I disagree that the situation could be resolved easily. It's just willingness of one to believe that such could be done fairly easily - only having a fairly easy outcome as well... That is to face the consequences...<br><br>Contradictary to what you believe, the TS is a person too well capable of digesting and making decisions based on her own discrete...<br><br>Sometimes 'courage' itself is just not enough.<br><br>"1 part brave, 3 parts fool"....?</div>
