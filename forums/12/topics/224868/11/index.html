I think that meant alot already... not to mention it's pretty regular trips right?<br><br>But you kept mentioning "it takes two hads to clap"... that I agree...<br><br>Not answering calls, or missing calls is pretty common... since he's a business man... as much as you are important to him (as mentioned he has no qualms about expressing how impt you are, how much he loves you etc) he's human too....<br><br>Running a business is hard, and unlike the life of an employed, I figure his work probably eats into his personal life as well... It can be terribly draining when the performance of the business and his employees' welfare all rest upon his shoulders...  I think, there are times, he just needs his own space and privacy.<br><br>Then again, some men don't like to discuss that with their partner... so maybe you really can't tell what's in mind....<br><br>Diff people handle diff issues differently... so maybe he's alittle different on how he handles issues and all...<br><br>Rather than to look at everything he did not do... why not focus on why you love him in the first place?  Doing the "tit for tat" when he don't answer your calls isn't gonna help...<br><br>If you really love this man, then you must be ready to accept him as he is... and when you get to talk to him or spend time with him, treasure them...<br><br>Being understanding is not just keeping quiet... it is really accepting it, which means you won't feel a pinch or uncomfortable when you say "it's ok" but in actual fact you still feel that slight anger... disappointment is ok... but if you feel you are "bottling it up"... something's not right... cos you are not accepting it...<br><br>Cheer up... things may not be as bad as it seems...

Even if a guy is filthy rich, it takes effort to board a plane, check-in into a hotel to see his GF... I think that meant alot already... not to mention it's pretty regular trips right?<br><br>But you kept mentioning "it takes two hads to clap"... that I agree...<br><br><span style="color: red;">Not answering calls, or missing calls is pretty common... since he's a business man... </span>as much as you are important to him (as mentioned he has no qualms about expressing how impt you are, how much he loves you etc) he's human too....<br><br>Running a business is hard, and unlike the life of an employed, I figure his work probably eats into his personal life as well... It can be terribly draining when the performance of the business and his employees' welfare all rest upon his shoulders...  I think, there are times, he just needs his own space and privacy.<br><br>Then again, some men don't like to discuss that with their partner... so maybe you really can't tell what's in mind....<br><br>Diff people handle diff issues differently... so maybe he's alittle different on how he handles issues and all...<br><br>Rather than to look at everything he did not do... why not focus on why you love him in the first place?  Doing the "tit for tat" when he don't answer your calls isn't gonna help...<br><br>If you really love this man, then you must be ready to accept him as he is... and when you get to talk to him or spend time with him, treasure them...<br><br>Being understanding is not just keeping quiet... it is really accepting it, which means you won't feel a pinch or uncomfortable when you say "it's ok" but in actual fact you still feel that slight anger... disappointment is ok... but if you feel you are "bottling it up"... something's not right... cos you are not accepting it...<br><br>Cheer up... things may not be as bad as it seems... Don't let your insecurities take away your happiness...<br><br></div></blockquote>Even when he missed all calls?  by that i mean he didnt even once pick up the phone when i called even though he is at home.</div>

I think there are just times you also want to have some time to yourself right?  I don't know about others... but there are times, I will leave my phone in my room and just do what I like to do (eg, read papers, watch tv, play game, read a book etc) just to rest and forget about the stress at work... and seriously, i hate answering phones after work...<br><br>And i also missed my BF's calls quite a few times when i am at home, cos i was soooo tired, i dozed off infront of the television...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>If need to "check-up" on him, then might as well give up on the relationship already... he is in country X and she's here... how often and how much can she check?<br><br>Knowing friends also no point... they are HIS friends... you think they will tell the truth?  And seriously, which man like his GF to go round asking HIS friends what he's been up to?  bee-girl... please don't do this.. this is one of the ways you can double-cross yourself...</div>
