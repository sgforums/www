I also agree that being in a relationship, it is about a package.<br><br>Having said that, if one is willing to go into a LDR which is characterised by such problems, he/she should bear in mind that such problems exist and make constant effort to soften the impact of such problems, if not find alternative ways to make up for problems (for eg, the lack of presence, like what rainee has mentioned, constant communication), aint it?   Otherwise, wouldnt it appear that he/she just want best part of the relationship and not making efforts to overcome the problems that come with it?  Wouldnt he/she guilty of not accepting the relationship as a package too?<br><br>For eg, myself.  i know he is insecured in certain ways.  I will always let him know my programs after work, and try not to miss his calls by stringing my phone round my wrist when i am out pubbing.<br><br>I do not think i have the normal expectation of a relationship.  For eg, i never expect to see him more regular than weekends (which is the understanding of the relationship).  I never expect him to be here for me when i was in really bad shape, when i was really troubled.  All i ask for from this man, who says he wants to be there for me, to be there for me over the phone.  Too much to ask for?  Is that something that is unreasonable to expect from a LDR or any relationship?<br><br>Btw, i dont have "previous bad experience with LDR", for the record.  That relationship didnt breakdown because it is a LDR.<br><br>I do agree that the more I harbour on the trust factor that eats into my insecurity, the more tormented i feel inside of me.  Like you said, i only have 2 ways:<br><br>either to:<br><br>a) tweak my mindset (accept it as a whole and just dont think too much of it)<br>Or<br>b) actually pull plug.<br><br>P/s:<br><br>1) last night, he told me he will definitely try to answer my call when i talked to him very seriously about it.<br><br>2) btw, he told me he cant make it this weekend again, due to work.  Want to show me some proof that he is actually working.   I rejected to seeing it.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think this is more of a problem of both of you having different expectations from each other. You are willing to make him feel secure by telling him about your whereabouts, but that doesn't mean he is willing to do the same. he might not put you as the first priority, he mite think that some other things in his life are more important at the moment. So for him, it is either you can accept him this way or just move on to another guy who can satisfy your expectations.</div>

I missed christmas, new year and valentine day. It was torture for me but she was the one who gave me the comfort and peace of mind. We coped by talking every night for an hour or so. What made me choose her was her maturity and understanding. It meant a lot to me.<br>But different couple, different expectations. My world is her but in the real world i still need moolah. Hence we have real expectations.</div>
