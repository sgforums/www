              <p>Easy problem. Depends on the situations. May be you can present it here and let us to judge. How old are you?</p>
              <p>Use "logic" to fight her.</p>
              <p>Debate with her, on the issues to show her the facts, graphs and stats. Present it. Shoot until she cries.</p>

              <p>I say if your mum still makes ur meal, do your laundry, worry when you do badly  and when you're sick, then she's just a regular mother who loves you (and your family) and worry too much.Most mothers usually have too much to do and a heavy sense of responsibility for her childrens' and for her husband's well being.</p>
              <p>I do not know if your mother is just the normally 'ba dao' mother (as in most families) or she does have a mental condition (be it stress, depression or others). But in my own experience, my mother was UNusually easily agitated bcos she had a mental condition which lasted for 20+ years till her death (which also deteriorated to the point of being incapacitated in that period). Her condition of cos created certain changes to her personality and limited her ability to be a mother and a wife.</p>
              <p>Bcos I was still very young when she first got sick, I never really did knew her well in her normal state and of cos being young didn't understand what was wrong with her . In my teenage years, I hated her, hated that she was sick and hated all the things that happened bcos she was sick.</p>
              <p>And even before she left us,  I knew she would be a cross I have to bear till my own death and I willingly carry this bcos I could have been nicer, kinder, loved her more and I wish I had understood then what I understood now. There are many things that I shouldn't have done and even more things that I should have done, but its too little too late. I think about her every day now and I wish I thot about her more when she was still here.</p>
              <p>All I can say to you and to everyone else is be nice to your mother while you still can bcos for most of you, your mother really do love you.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>I remember when i was a youth, I was imature. They throw their temper onto me everytime they came back home from work. And i alway thought they were asking for trouble and i never fail talking back. I felt embarrassing right now while thinking of that period. And right now,I'm a teenager and their temper are changed. No matter what they scold are all because of you.(Left right in and right ear out). If a parent are ignoring you means they gave up on you or definately not your parent lol.</div>

              <p>Hello Triangle,</p>
              <p>She needs counselling....try and approach your uncle or aunty from your mother's side to talk to her....see what happens after they spoke to her ok...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My thinking is that maybe she loves the family as much as any mother loves her own family and perhaps you and the others have not been giving her attention and attention I mean by taking her out for dinner or shopping or maybe buy a present to make her feel loved...I guess...maybe..don't you think so Triangle.</p>

              <p>If ur mummy's like that, jus minimise all interaction. Mothers always think they know more, so no point arguing, esp if u r jus a kiddo. She may mellow down as she gets older. With no offence intended, ur mum may have been brought up the same manner by her parents, which leaves little room for tolerance and patience. It's up to u to break that cycle in ur generation.</p>

              <p>Tell your self that you can take it before any argument. And be sure that your reason is really correct.</p>
              <p>After that think about all the logical stuff to explain to win over your mother</p>
              <p>Be sure to make sure u can argue all the way, it take ssome training to do that</p>
              <p>In some events, your mother will, or might, say something like you are her son and you dun care about her and all those things. <br><br>Then must say i am ur son, i want u to think correctly, not your own weird reasonings etc etc...<br><br>I hope this will help to an extend. However if you go abit overboard your mum might really threaten to commit suicide(i hope not)<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Or <br></span></strong><br>You can just let her win.  Cos everyday at home do housework and work like a slave, she will start to live in their own world, and think that what they do is very rough. SO in turn they will start attracting some attention and say this and that....</p>
