            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm, this thread got me reflecting about my previous relationships.<br><br>Two of the women that I entered a relationship with were the possessive kind. Initially, they didn't appear to be so until some time later in the relationship. Perhaps, women are possessive as they feel that by being more concerned about their beau, in ways such as talking more often to him, wanting to go out more often, et cetera, he will trust them more. Note, this is just a hypothesis that I conjured up within a short span of time.<br><br>For instance, there was this girl who would indirectly insist on talking on the phone each night. I'm okay with it, but after an entire day of walking around town, I'm just too tired to continue interacting with her on the phone. In addition, because I enjoy running/jogging, she commented that it seems that I was devoting more time to this leisure activity of mine. To me, it's hilarious as I can manage a long two hour conversation with her, but for me to run continously for 2 hours? Yah, I'll lose 20% or more of the water in my body.<br><br>Still, I believe that if women want to trust their men more, and want their men to give them his trust, give the men his own personal space.<br><br>Just my opinion.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

Remember... DON'T PUSH or PRESSURISE... Often than not, a relationship which lacks of communication can't simply be saved by starting a 'conversation' (and many would think... Hey.. We have 'communication'...)... A rusty part needs a gentle start... Have just general communications 1st... Talk about other subjects and things.. Share ideas... Mention the 'more important things' only when both are comfortable enough with it... Remember always... NEVER to PUSH it... A relationship is a 2-way thing... Comments &amp; LISTEN....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
