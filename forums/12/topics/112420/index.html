Alot.<br><br><strong><br>wad cause u to trust yr partner?</strong><br><br>It's a choice. So far, she well-deserves it. We're very open in the relationship. Little things that we need to hide from each other...<br><br><strong><br>wad cause r/s to last?</strong><br><br>Trust. Compatibility. Reason(s) to be together. Interest.<br><br><strong><br>wad do have doubt on yr partner?</strong><br><br>Don't quite get this question.<br><br><strong><br>how to gain trust in r/s?</strong><br><br>TRANSPARENCY. But note. Not everybody can take that. The other is by the things that you do. Self-discipline?<br><br><strong><br>do u tell yr partner everything : yr sadness and happiness?</strong><br><br>From time to time, I do tell her quite alot of things deep within myself. One main reason being that I find that she is one of the rare one who can truly understand what I've got to be. Be it good or bad. Though she's my gf, she just accepts me as I am. I feel very comfortable in sharing most of my things with her. I'm a DEVIL. I feel great POWER. She doesn't really display alot of that. But most of her is 'inwards' to me. She earns much RESPECT from me.<br><br>She tells me alot too.<br><br><strong><br>hw u solve if problem occurr?</strong><br><br>Depends on big or small issues. Always ask yourself this question. "Is your relationship more important or the problem more important?" It doesn't mean not solving or handling things at all. That would probably lead to more problems. But could things be set aside for a while?<br><br>Small issues. I believe our love is enough to overwhelm it. Doesn't really matter who's right and who's wrong. I'm usually more concerned with issues which might affect stability of the relationship. Often discuss about it. She understands my genuine concern. Often we talk it through or she'll heed my advice.<br><br><strong><br>wad is most important in maintaining a r/s?</strong><br><br>Depends on the couple. Other than that Trust is often an important issue.<br><br><strong><br>wad makes u fall in love wif yr partner?</strong><br><br>Choice. Comfortable. Respect. Freedom. Compatibility. Trust. Understanding. Just the way she is.<br><br><strong><br>can you tell n explain to mi why whenever i smsed him he nv replied<br>whenever i called him he didnt ans or the conservation wont last more than 15 minutes i'm hurt but i always pretend nothing has happen in front of him cos i dun wan him to see sad and feel pressured due to mi wad should i do nw ... i'm loss totally loss<br><br>can ani1 give mi some solution on some of those Qn above .....</strong><br><br>To me. It doesn't matter if it's 15 mins. Or just a word or 2. Have you seen couples who can do just nothing but stare into each other for hours... Enjoying the company...?<br><br>Couples just doing their own things yet love each other much...? Couples which quarrels every now and then or to cuddle each other in the end...?<br><br>Love is what you and him defines it to be... If it don't happen...

"<br><br>Like $e@wEeD have said These thing will happen. So will you trust or not ? Because that's the guy you have chosen to spend your present part of your life with. Maybe you are going ot spent your future with him too. So its ur decision.<br><br>My personal Advice to this issue is, just ask him if he still loves you. That will be a simple and effective solution. Tell him that you have felt that you are drifting apart ( assuming From the descriptions of the things happening ). Ask for a Explantion.

It's also the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">beginning of trust</span> in that friendship kind of relationship. Why would I bother to befriend you if I don't trust you in the first place? What makes you think a friendship will form without trust? Thus, if there's not even a single bit of trust in such a simple friendship between two or even more people, what makes you think that bringing the relationship to the next level will result in better trust?<br><br>It doesn't work that way.

While u are continuously affected by this issue, u will show it out eventually but your partner will not know why. Then there will come to a point of him complaining why u are so unreasonable or something, getting angry over small small things while actually u r angry due to the accumulation of anger from many many events. Pls solve this first.<br><br>U may be afraid that by bring it up will affect the r/s between u 2. But room for discussion and respecting each other's feelings is an impt part in r/s. U will never want someone who dont care abt ur feelings as a bf also right? So sometimes by bringing up such matters which u think shld nv be brought up will imporve the r/s. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Trust is a choice. Everyone starts a r/s with others with different amount of trust. Some start with complete trust, some no trust, some in the middle. This is then build up or reduced when u analyse his/her actions when interacting with u or others.</div>

What is trust in your defination then?
