              <p>Hey Doc4u</p>
              <p>It was so much easier in the old days... either you were on or
              you were not. Its not about being selfish or anything, but being bf
              and gf impies a commitment to be exclusive, unless she wants an
              open relationship? So IMHO, I think there is something fishy,
              especially if she will not answer your questions. I'd say there are
              other fish in the sea... let the line loose on this one and go
              fishing again after a suitable time. She is too selfish and not
              worth it. Her basic character shows already by what she is doing.
              She does not respect the relationship and she does not treasure
              what you have.</p>
              <p>I can understand having space and going out with other friends
              in a group, but one on one with a guy... ??? whom she has just met
              online...?????? what the??????!!!!!!</p>
              <p>Call me old fashioned, but there are things that are just not
              right and she is currently doing something that IS NOT RIGHT. My
              two cents.</p>

              <p>This is exactly how i feel.  She doesn't respect and treasure the relationship.  In fact i mentioned to her that although she's not looking to have a relationship with this guys and was just merely being "friends" with them that its possible for her to like one of them eventually.  And she agrees that its possible.  And so i told her that she is risking our relationship by doing this things and she just doesn't want to answer.  </p>
              <p>Well i guess i'm old-fashioned too.</p>

              <p><br>You should just give her time and give yourself time to observe, don;t jump to conclusion.    If she is the outgoing type, likes to make new friends, it is possible that she only treats them as casual friends.   However, I don't discount the possibility of her sourcing for new bf.</p>
              <p>Why don't you have a heart to heart talk to her and sort this out?   YOu like that huh, you give yourself stress.</p>

              <p>doc4U,</p>
              <p>Dude.. girls who are into their relationship don't go out dating strangers.</p>
              <p>What has she to gain from knowing the stranger males ? She's just plain vain. and she likes the attention.</p>
              <p>I'm pretty sure.. when she goes dating with those guys.. she probably never let them know she has a boyfriend.</p>
              <p>Obviously.. to her.. you are just a convenience during her downtime.</p>
              <p>You are not important in her life.. right now.. she's looking for bigger fish to fry, and keeping the shrimp just in case she couldn't find big fish.</p>
              <p>You need to give her an <strong>ultimatum</strong>... and I can bet she doesn't even care even if you disapear from the face of the earth tomorrow.</p>
              <p>To her.. you are like " ai lai, mai suah".. you want take.. don't want fark off.</p>
              <p>If you so enjoy being a spare tire.. then you should continue your relationship with her.</p>

              <p>Any difference?</p>
              <p>I'd like to know what the girls in this forum thinks.  I
              know i've posted this in another section but i want to know more
              opinions about this.</p>
              <p>You see, my girlfriend keeps insisting that her going out with
              her guy friends (1:1) is just nothing.  And its not a date.
               Guy friends that she meets online and meets personally for
              the first time on that "date".  We've had several arguments
              about this because to me going out with a guy is the same as having
              a date with him.  Like i wouldn't spend time and effort if i
              don't like this person.  </p>
              <p>Now, its quite different if you've been friends with this guy
              friend of yours for a long time.  That i can take and
              understand that its just a friendly date.  But to go out with
              a total stranger just to meet him and be friends to him is
              something im not comfortable with.</p>

              <p>hm... hm.. I think it is common to make friends. As  a bf , you should tell her to draw a line. What you expect her to do?</p>

              <p>You also have female friends rite... Then let the relationship come naturally. That mean you have to pay more attention to your gf.</p>
