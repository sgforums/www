              <p>Any difference?</p>
              <p>I'd like to know what the girls in this forum thinks.  I
              know i've posted this in another section but i want to know more
              opinions about this.</p>
              <p>You see, my girlfriend keeps insisting that her going out with
              her guy friends (1:1) is just nothing.  And its not a date.
               Guy friends that she meets online and meets personally for
              the first time on that "date".  We've had several arguments
              about this because to me going out with a guy is the same as having
              a date with him.  Like i wouldn't spend time and effort if i
              don't like this person.  </p>
              <p>Now, its quite different if you've been friends with this guy
              friend of yours for a long time.  That i can take and
              understand that its just a friendly date.  But to go out with
              a total stranger just to meet him and be friends to him is
              something im not comfortable with.</p>
