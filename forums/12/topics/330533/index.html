              <p>Any difference?</p>
              <p>I'd like to know what the girls in this forum thinks.  I know i've posted this in another section but i want to know more opinions about this.</p>
              <p>You see, my girlfriend keeps insisting that her going out with her guy friends (1:1) is just nothing.  And its not a date.  Guy friends that she meets online and meets personally for the first time on that "date".  We've had several arguments about this because to me going out with a guy is the same as having a date with him.  Like i wouldn't spend time and effort if i don't like this person.  </p>
              <p>Now, its quite different if you've been friends with this guy friend of yours for a long time.  That i can take and understand that its just a friendly date.  But to go out with a total stranger just to meet him and be friends to him is something im not comfortable with.</p>

              <p>You mentioned that she is your gf? If thats the case, I feel she should not go out with other guys (any guys) on a 1:1 date.</p>
              <p>You already voiced your concerns to her and yet she still do it, something could be wrong?</p>
              <p>Possible reasons:</p>
              <p>she like the guy</p>
              <p>she's confused about herself</p>
              <p>its just her character</p>
              <p>But nonetheless, if you think its bothering you, just ask her to tell u the things she did with the guys she met. What is the guy's name, what they do, where they went etc... if she tells u honestly, then should not have any problem. But if she really care for u, maybe she should not do it anyway (meeting with any guys).</p>
              <p>gd luck.</p>

              <p>i think it's just your relationship problem.</p>
              <p>as a girl, i think i wont really do that to my bf (well, if i have one)</p>
              <p>but idk. i might do that if my bf cant really meet my expectation.</p>
              <p>but wait, if he cant meet my expectation, why would i want him to be my bf at the first place? lols.</p>
              <p>but yeah, i think girls do need some space or a break from her bf.</p>
              <p>it should be a good thing, coz if your gf do that to you, then i think your relationship will last quite long :)</p>
              <p>but yeah idk.</p>

              <p><br>Agreed.</p>
              <p>I reckon that maybe you have to sit down with her and tell her calmly how you really feel about her going out with other guys. It's alright for your gf to go out with other guys who she has just befriended as long as she doesn't cross the line. As she needs her own social circle too. Friends can be either male or female. But you need to put your foot down on this matter if you feel uncomfortable about it and tell her how you feel but don't do anything rash if she doesn't really seem to bother. On one hand, it may seem that she don't really care about you but on the other it might just be her character. How old are the both of you? Age plays a factor too. if both of you are still teenagers, this sort of things do happen i suppose. =/</p>

Like if she happens to find someone better, she might go with him, if not, she can always fall back on the backup (i.e, you).<br><br>Either that, or it is really her nature, which in that case since you're not comfortable with that, that I suggest you reconsider your relationship again.

              <p>she dun see ur pt. might as well u go out with other gals (1:1)</p>
              <p>see how she reacts to it. if she not comfy, den she's one selfish woman.</p>
              <p>it's like she can go out with other guys 1 to 1, y cant u?</p>
              <p>u've done enuff on ur part.</p>
              <p>if those guys are PURELY FRIENDS, i tink it's ok. but like u said, new online "friends"?obviously she didnt tell them she's attached. if she did, it only shows that those online guys are out to challenge u.</p>

              <p>You mentioned that she is your gf? If thats the case, I feel she
              should not go out with other guys (any guys) on a 1:1 date.</p>
              <p>You already voiced your concerns to her and yet she still do it,
              something could be wrong?</p>
              <p>Possible reasons:</p>
              <p>she like the guy</p>
              <p>she's confused about herself</p>
              <p>its just her character</p>
              <p>But nonetheless, if you think its bothering you, just ask her to
              tell u the things she did with the guys she met. What is the guy's
              name, what they do, where they went etc... if she tells u honestly,
              then should not have any problem. But if she really care for u,
              maybe she should not do it anyway (meeting with any guys).</p>
              <p>gd luck.</p>

              <p>Hey Doc4u</p>
              <p>It was so much easier in the old days... either you were on or you were not. Its not about being selfish or anything, but being bf and gf impies a commitment to be exclusive, unless she wants an open relationship? So IMHO, I think there is something fishy, especially if she will not answer your questions. I'd say there are other fish in the sea... let the line loose on this one and go fishing again after a suitable time. She is too selfish and not worth it. Her basic character shows already by what she is doing. She does not respect the relationship and she does not treasure what you have.</p>
              <p>I can understand having space and going out with other friends in a group, but one on one with a guy... ??? whom she has just met online...?????? what the??????!!!!!!</p>
              <p>Call me old fashioned, but there are things that are just not right and she is currently doing something that IS NOT RIGHT. My two cents.</p>
