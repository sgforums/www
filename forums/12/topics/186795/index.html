But one might just change their opinion from time to time (may it be due to personal preference / experience / or change in institute's polices or systems etc...)... That's just one way why forums are quite different from a bulletin board, otherwise we might just have something like that? One may try to consolidate all the information into a single thread, but that might have to be constantly updated and maintained by someone? Not to mention that the person doing the job might or might not be constantly updated with the relevant information, and is his / her opinion about what could be 'relevant' can be higher subjective to his / her personal view...? With that kind of effort, I would also think perhaps it might be better to have a forum under 'school / education' to address that? But of course, that just might not yield adequate response in a way?<br><br>Also, having various threads encourage discussions on the topic... It's difficult to do different discussions within a single thread though at times they might have more information and opinions... But else, it could be quite messy...? The readers and the ones asking for advice might need to be quite selective... It would definitely be much easier to be 'selective' (for them to choose to read the other related threads) than to screen through a single thread for what they want... Take myself for an example is a person who is often reluctant to read through long threads.. That might in a way dampen response? But of course, that might just be me?<br><br>Under different threads, it would also be easier for forumites to provide the relevant form of information needed by that particular person and even stem off the discussion somewhere further...?</div>
