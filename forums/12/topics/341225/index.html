              <p>Well, judging from your account. I believe you're still young and very green in the ways of the world.</p>
              <p>Is it a huge blow to your ego to get served by the f-ed goldfish-faced hedonist who don't give a flying hoot 'bout his studies? He sounded like that kinda dude who's having a lot of fun everyday; the kind of dude who's excited to be with. He's spontaneous, free-spirited and a walking adventure.</p>
              <p>While you reek of nothing but boredom and teddy bears.</p>
              <p>Sad, isn't it?</p>
              <p>Not trying to put you down here, but it's high time to reflect on this whole thing - why and how did you lose? Simply put, what is it that the other guy has that you lacked. Your kind of personality would make great friends with the girls - but I'm afraid that's where it all end.</p>
              <p>If you take my advice for what it's worth, mate. Be fun, be challenging, be humorous, be witty, be romantic, be adventurous... That's how you start attracting the opposite sex...</p>
              <p>And for the record, I don't think she cheated you in any way. Perhaps, she failed to handle this whole clown show tactfully but that's all you can put on her head.</p>
              <p>C'est la vie - meanwhile, go learn to be a good loser.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

              <p>You were just like me at one stage, I think when I was like 18 (5 years ago) I liked my friend's cousin. My friend suggested that I should go for her and I did. We went out almost everyday and hanged out just the two of us, I would sms her or call her on days I couldn't see her. After being close friends for about a month or so, I asked her whether I could be her bf. At first she didn't reply me, so it took her about two days to give me a reply saying that she had a bf but she really liked me.</p>
              <p>Sometimes it's best to observe the girl and know her better, probably I was still too stupid even to notice that. Anyways we kept in contact and a year passed, she told me she broke off her with bf. I became her bf and we went out for eight months and again I was dumped by her. From what my friend said, she dumped me for some Indonesian guy that was quite good looking and had the body that girls normally go for.</p>
              <p>Anyways two years passed and she was dumped again by that guy. Somehow she wanted me to go back with her and I rejected her. I told her we can remain friends rather than being in a relationship. Some people never change after such a long time and now she's still a little whiny bitch. </p>

              <p>sob....at least i'm not alone in this kind of situation....but at least i knew myself better from this experience and learned a lot of things....</p>
              <p>In fact, i anticipated a 90% failure and i asked myself what will i do if it came to that. I only slept 6 hours for 4 days to figure it out and decided whatever the outcome, i accept it and move on....learn new things or know more about the people around me...if i do not do so, i will end up with no friends, or worse, isolate myself and ignore my duties at work... </p>
              <p>It was a rather cruel and hard fact to take in the first place, but when i let it sink in, i accepted it and acted as per my decision...and yes, i was hurt but i still have my friends around me and a job i can perform well in </p>

              <p>2 options for you: A) Continue pestering her</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>If I were in your situation, I won't be fazed by what she says. So what if she has a boyfriend? Girls cheat on their boyfriends if they like you enough. If every girl tells you that she has a boyfriend in all your pursuits, don't tell me you are gonna give up on girls? But there is a catch. Are you willing to take on the responsibilities on a cheating girl and the potential fight with another guy? Trust me, I don't think it's worth to fight with a guy over a girl. Great girls are everywhere.</p>

              <p>in any case, u shld hav tried to find out if she's attached right from the first time u 2 went out, if not at least from her frens. it's risky to pop the qn w/o find out such an essential qn</p>
