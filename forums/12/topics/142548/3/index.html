            <div class='col-md body'>hey dude, wha.. if i were u, i really cant bring myself to trust this girl anymore lor.. like the others said earlier on, a leopard never changes its spots... seems to me that even though she's 30, she's quite immatured and refuses to commit herself in a relationship.. as for the crying incident, she was most probably shedding crocodile tears... if you take her back, i'll forsee that she might she might cheat u again (and u might have to spend another bomb on a PI to check up on her).. yup so just forget abt her n move on, thats what i feel la. on a brighter note, u can start looking for another better girl (u can try matchmaking agencies ?) during the 3 years when the both of u file for the divorice and u can get married to the new gal when u turn 43 ma.. yup, dun be upset le... you have evryone's moral sprt..! =)</div>
