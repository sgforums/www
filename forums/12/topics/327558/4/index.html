              <p><br>wow power. you may not have that in mind. but knowing the guy for less than a month, met 3 times and talk on the phone you consider understand him liao. you are using yourself to risk how he going to treat you during the trip, then go ahead. deep down inside you, you will not resist him when you and him are alone overseas.  lets just hope he will not disappear when both you come back to spore, if he did something to you.</p>

              <p>It is a big risk. You don't have help overseas and you will be isolated. Don't go. Even if you know a guy for 3 months , it doesn't mean that you know everything about him. Do your parents and his parents know about your relationship? If they do , then maybe you can consider. If not, use your brains.</p>

              <p>There're guys who slept with girls they are interested in because they like the girl. And they officially became a couple after having a sexual relationship once. I know some of these people and their relationship is still going strong up till this day.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Some girls who think they will only sleep with another guy after marriage and the issue of preserving their virginity for their husband who may or may not even exist.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I find this rather absurb. That means if the girl happens to be sexually violated one day, she should be forfeited of her chance to get married or have a relationship?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Let's face it. Men are always interested in sex. But not all men will sleep with any girl they want. All normal men have a sex drive which they will only satisfy through a girl he has special feelings for. What is wrong with that? Only a severely sexually deprived or playboy can sleep with any girl he can lay his hands on.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"If you love me, you will wait for me" says the girl.</p>
              <p>Normally in this situation, the girl is only demanding the guy to be at her beck and call; plainly not interested in the guy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"If you love me you will give it to me" says the guy.</p>
              <p> The guy is only demanding that the girl sleep with him for the sake of sex.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Sleeping with the guy or not has to be judged through feelings. For both the girl and guy. How do you feel about the guy and does he give you the sincerity and trust you need in order for you to give in to his sexual advance. I suggest that you spend more time with him before going on a private trip overseas. By doing so, you are putting yourself into a very tricky situation when you have to compromise your desire to learn more about him.</strong></p>

              <p>There're guys who slept with girls they are interested in because they like the girl. And they officially became a couple after having a sexual relationship once. I know some of these people and their relationship is still going strong up till this day.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Some girls who think they will only sleep with another guy after marriage and the issue of preserving their virginity for their husband who may or may not even exist.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I find this rather absurb. That means if the girl happens to be sexually violated one day, she should be forfeited of her chance to get married or have a relationship?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Let's face it. Men are always interested in sex. But not all men will sleep with any girl they want. All normal men have a sex drive which they will only satisfy through a girl he has special feelings for. What is wrong with that? Only a severely sexually deprived or playboy can sleep with any girl he can lay his hands on.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"If you love me, you will wait for me" says the girl.</p>
              <p>Normally in this situation, the girl is only demanding the guy to be at her beck and call; plainly not interested in the guy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"If you love me you will give it to me" says the guy.</p>
              <p> The guy is only demanding that the girl sleep with him for the sake of sex.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Sleeping with the guy or not has to be judged through feelings. For both the girl and guy. How do you feel about the guy and does he give you the sincerity and trust you need in order for you to give in to his sexual advance. I suggest that you spend more time with him before going on a private trip overseas. By doing so, you are putting yourself into a very tricky situation when you have to compromise your desire to learn more about him.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
