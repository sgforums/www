              <p>well apparently none of her friends asked her to go with them, the guy did. i didnt say it's always safe but it's not like it they're total strangers. and you can know someone for years and still not know them well enough. dont you know most serial killers are nice quiet people nobody would ever suspect. if she's careful she'll be fine. i never said it's completelt safe..just dont scare her to death or insult her.</p>

              <p>In the first place, going on a trip with any of your friends should be alright even if they are of the opposite sex and/or just the both of you.</p>
              <p>I do not think that there should be any negativity towards your travel partner and the trip. If you do have the slightest then it would better not to go at all. So, you have decided to go along and as a rule of the thumb I would advocate that there be some precautions like ensuring that you have your own bed in the room if the both of you need to be in 1 room. Another room would of course be the best but sometimes due to budget concern I could understand. Other than that, I suppose you will need to exercise care and tact in your conduct and dressing as you are no longer having a room all by yourself.</p>
              <p>Self control on the part of both parties is also important here and I do not need to emphasize the consequences of negligence in this area. In all just remember that the both of you need to enjoy the trip so do plan ahead and look forward to be happy.</p>

              <p>Sleepig the same hotel room with a guy arh.</p>
              <p>Out of so many times, this one time is most memorable:</p>
              <p>I was suppose to share a room with a female rider.  But last minute, she went to share a room with her bf.</p>
              <p>So I was stuck with another guy at another room.</p>
              <p>He was a really nice chap, and we all had fun drinking and eating.</p>
              <p>When we sleep, he went into serious snoring and some choking in his sleep.  I was kept awake by the snoring and worried about his choking to death in his sleep.</p>
              <p>He finally wake up about 6am and started smoking.</p>
              <p>I was too relieved that he is still alive that I went to sleep.  But the smoking was so bad, I had to wake up at 7am, went into the shower to try to shower away the smokes and went for breakfast myself.</p>

              <p>im just trying to show how retarded it is to think that every
              guy you meet will try to rape you like most ppl seem to think on
              this forum. what worries me is that most of those ppl are guys...so
              guys...is what you really mean when you ask a girl to go abroad
              with you "i wanna rape you over and over again"? if so you really
              are sick..and if not then why do you assume all guys think like
              that? <span style="color: #ff0000;">i kind of feel you're offending my fiance here. i went to
              stay with him in his home country for more than 2 weeks. and we'd
              had only one date before that. and a couple of weeks later we took
              a holiday together..another 2 weeks abroad.</span></p>
              <p>if you're afraid he might hurt you buy mace, carry it with you
              all the time and dont stay alone with him in the same room. then
              you should be perfectly safe. if he really is a psycho out to get
              you then you wont be safe at home either.</p>
              <p>other forum members:it doesnt seem like you just want her to be
              careful, seems like you're trying to scare her to death. plus a lot
              of you called her stupid for even considering it..thats just

              <p>human beings ma - if we only listen to our voice of reason, and not to the voice of emotion/temptation/desire bla bla - then a lot of things will not get accomplished simply because a lot of things don't provide us with good reasons to do them.</p>
              <p>on the other hand, freedom of choice comes with the freedom of taking the consequences: both rewards and uhh others. So regardless of choice made, don't regret lo.</p>
