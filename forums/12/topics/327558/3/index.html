              <p>It is best not to go overseas with him alone.. this is because u have known him for less than a month.. and by going out with him only 3 times, what makes you think that you know him well. If you want to know him better you can do it here in Singapore.. no need to go overseas. It is very risky for a girl to go overseas with a guy especially when u know him only for a limited period. You never know what type of guy he is.</p>
              <p>Some guys may be acting only.. they may appear very caring just to attract the girl and when he finally show his true colours it would then be too late for the girl.</p>
              <p>You never know until its too late.. May be really 2 person go come back 3 or if you lucky come back 4.. Also spare a thought for your parents, you do not want them to worry about you right if anything really happens.</p>
              <p>So my advice is dont go for the trip until you know him inside out and outside in..</p>
              <p>I hope you will give it a serious thought... dont ruin your life by making a wrong decision.. you are only 20 and still have a long way to go...</p>

              <p><br>you very brave, going to a trip with a guy whom you know less than a month! even years of friendship can also turn out to be a nightmare. knowing him for less than a month yet going to a trip with him alone will let him think you are not a decent girl. and you have the cheek to even ask if want to share room with him!! do that mean that you actually want things to happen? or you are really so innocent to think you so lucky to have found a upright honest guy for less thn a month??</p>
              <p>if anything happen, you are the one who give him the chance.</p>

              <p>What the..</p>
              <p>Why no one think about the sincerity of the guy. Maybe its 1 chance to impress her ler.. before becoming life partners. Soulmate. Why all the negatives. Why u all such realists.. no wonder the world is getting more fuked up.</p>
              <p>Anyways la.. i got girls travel with me overseas before and nothing happened. But after the trip many things happened. LOL! Stay true to ur character , ur principles and being a gentlemen and if i were to impress the girl.. sure she gets impressed. Unles the girl at night come raba raba... then.. .. what can i say. I will be found guilty of not giving her love and care right ?</p>
