              <p>im just trying to show how retarded it is to think that every guy you meet will try to rape you like most ppl seem to think on this forum. what worries me is that most of those ppl are guys...so guys...is what you really mean when you ask a girl to go abroad with you "i wanna rape you over and over again"? if so you really are sick..and if not then why do you assume all guys think like that? i kind of feel you're offending my fiance here. i went to stay with him in his home country for more than 2 weeks. and we'd had only one date before that. and a couple of weeks later we took a holiday together..another 2 weeks abroad.</p>
              <p>if you're afraid he might hurt you buy mace, carry it with you all the time and dont stay alone with him in the same room. then you should be perfectly safe. if he really is a psycho out to get you then you wont be safe at home either.</p>
              <p>other forum members:it doesnt seem like you just want her to be careful, seems like you're trying to scare her to death. plus a lot of you called her stupid for even considering it..thats just rude.</p>

              <p>so? it's always good to be careful. but she doesnt have to do anything if she doesnt want to. esp if she's paying for her own room. she's not actually obligated to do anything..thats my point. and she's not a baby anymore..she's a grown woman. it's actually safer than travelling alone</p>

              <p>you cant go through life being scared of everything. there are ways you can protect yourself when travelling with a  stranger which i already mentioned in my previous post. and it's not like he's a total stranger. it's only a couple of days, to a neighbouring country and it's still safer than travelling alone. if they get separate rooms she should be perfectly safe. she can also book the room herself and give her family and friends the address of the place and tell them exactly who she's going with. let's face it..it's not that big a risk. i dont think he'd try to force himself on her in a public place.</p>

              <p>you take a very dim view of the general public if you think only family would help someone... if i saw someone in trouble like that i wouldn't stop to check if it was my sister before doing something about it...</p>

              <p>no point in travelling with a stranger? what's the point of travelling with friends then? i thought the point of travelling was the see new places, make new friends...silly me.</p>
              <p>if she doesnt have it shecan get it..thats the point. she can be prepared.</p>
              <p>nobody said they have to stay in their rooms 24/7. do you really think he'd try anything in public and nobody would do anything.?it's always good to notify ppl where you're going and give them the exact address and names of the ppl youre going with. it makes the guy less likely to try anything..he'd know he'd be the one held responsible if anything should happen.</p>
