            <div class='col-md body'>haiz, got to know her thru a fren 2 mths ago. It wasnt a crush or smth, but i began to hv feelings for her. About 1 mth ago, i confessed tt i liked her but she doesnt noe whether she likes me anot.. I had a Don't Know for an answer. Even after the confession, she still sms me, talk on the phone and goes out with me. Just when i thought that things are changing for the better and i wanna confess to her again on valentines' day, her fren told me that she is still unsure of her own feelings, saying that she doesn't know whether she likes me anot as the feeling is weak. I wonder why does she continue to go our with me, i would rather she makes up her mind and gives me a clear yes or no.. As the time goes by, i think i'll really fall deeper in love with her but now, i don't know what to do.. I told myself that i will never ever shed a tear for any1 else other than my ex but it seems that after 5 years, it happened again...<br><br>I'm really confused now... should I ask her on v day?? if it's a yes then fine, if it's a no, i think i'll give up.. But i seriously do not know how am i supposed to react if she tells me DON'T KNOW.. Or, i should just enjoy the unspoken feelings and leave it as it is.. no commitments nothing but i'm not really the kind of person who likes to leave things dangling in midair..</div>
