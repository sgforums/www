            <div class='col-md body'>This is a long story. I started to like this Aunt who I meet about a year ago, she is old enough to be my mother.   Recertly this feeling is even much stronger, she is always in my mind.  I have a son who is about 5 yr son.  This anuty love him very much and always tell everybody she meet that this is her grandson. She is living all alone in Malaysia,  this make me worry and miss her more. I am always thinking of her but I am too shy to show my feeling towards her.  I am wounder why I am feeling this way.  Am I a bi-sex or mental?  I should say when I was young I lack of mother love, this could be one of the resons.  But what should I do next since I am so shy to show her my concern.</div>

Even any students studying overseas or far from family will miss the mom/dad very much sometimes.<br>If you love her... Yah, maybe it's going back to what u said 'lack of mother love'. The role of any mom to any guys sure a lot....<br><br>Some guys like a partner that resemble their mother (If he has a good mother), some like a partner that is better than his mother (if the mom is not so good). In your case.. In my opinion... Maybe it's normal.. if you like her because you think she has the good characteristics that you expect from a good mother which you cant find from your own mom. Or... Maybe it's just you concern and like her in terms that you want to protect her and want a person like her to be your mom...<br><br>I think It is reasonable if you want to treat her good... like maybe you may invite her for dinner, bring her to places during holidays... But if you do so... you may need to explain things to your wife also, as this may cause jealousy problem. It's an issue! Some wife are jealous to their husband who treating his mom too good.</div>

By the way I am a mother myself.<br>But when you like someone so much it is so difficult to open yr mouth to ask her out.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">   If I ask her out and she know that I like her so much what will she feel.  Maybe she will think I am mental. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
