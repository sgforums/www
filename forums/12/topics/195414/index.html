I used to think much about them, but not really anymore...?<br><br>I find that sometimes it's because I'm just too tired... And that I'm actually not the only one... Quite alot of people snores when they're really tired... I think sleeping positions also help, because certain sleeping positions would tends to bend your head backwards and open up your tract, while others tend to open up your jaws.. Try to give yourself some time to 'tone down' just before your sleep... Making you allow yourself to relax and not think too much just before your sleep... You can try some deep relaxing techniques or meditation if you like?<br><br>Hope that helps...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>One doesn't need to be overweight to snore. It could be that you are really tired, and when you sleep, you snore. It could also be some underlying medical condition that you don't know, so it will be good if you go for a checkup. If there's nothing wrong, then what you need is plenty of rest.<br><br>As for sleep talking, most of us do, it's either so loud that it disturbs another person who is sleeping with you or it's just mumbling.</div>
