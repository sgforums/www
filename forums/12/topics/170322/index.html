Sometimes it's not just about the things they say. There are two kind of suicidal types. One, they know they are sucidial and seeks help by talking to someone about it. Two, they know they are sucidial and are bent on seeking death. Usually these type of people are keep quiet of their tots but not without signs.<br><br>I've got a friend, she usually are the quiet type of person and doesn't engage much into outdoor activities. We've come to know that she's facing some family problems but she always seemed to us that she's coping well with it and does talk about it to some closer friends and we find nothing amiss.<br><br>Just about two weeks before she commit suicide, her behaviour starts to change. She becomes more chatty, more cheerful and initiate to date friends out for movies and even to EC to cycle and canoe. Things she seldom do, she suddenly show immerse interest in it. It came as a bit shock to her friends but we all thought that probably her family problems are mostly solved and she's feeling less stress about it.<br><br>It was till the fateful day when we recieve the news that she had commit suicide that we realised that for the past weeks, death has been on her mind and she had planned it since then and all the going out and all the enjoyments are her way of celebrating her last days and she knew that soon she'll be freed from all the problems. In her suicide note, she mention that she felt relieved when she makes this decision and she can finally enjoy her last moments without having to worry about anything else.<br><br>I did sense something wrong but quick to pushed that aside cause she seemed really happy. It never occure to any of us that she's celebrating.</div>

It's not true that there's no way to stop a person when that person is determine to seek death. No one will commit suicide for no reasons. For a person to be able to seek death successfully the blame should fall in the livings, the people around that person. How observant you are towards your friend's behaviour? Will you notice if he/she has a sudden change in character or habit?<br><br>Of course I won't deny that there are people who cry out loud and threatens to commit suicide to get attention or to get what they want others to do for them. These I call them "Fake Suiciders". A person who are determine to die mostly won't make a threat.<br><br>Actually, I really do admire those who commit suicide by jumping down a building although I don't agree to committing suicide but neither will I deny that one day I might have that thought too and carry it out silently.<br><br>For years, I've been struggling with the death devil. There are times when my will to live is so low than it ever come cross my mind to end it all.

It's not true that there's no way to stop a person when that person is determine to seek death. No one will commit suicide for no reasons. For a person to be able to seek death successfully the blame should fall in the livings, the people around that person. How observant you are towards your friend's behaviour?

One thing that always lure me from darkness is that I don't have to see anything I don't want to see cause you can't see anything in darkness.<br><br>The only reason I'm still alive now is because I still can feel. The only reason why people can successfully end their life is because they could no longer feel anything. No happiness, no sadness, nothing at all.<br><br>Maybe it's just a matter of time I'll reach that stage but as long as I can feel, I'll try to fight on.</div>
