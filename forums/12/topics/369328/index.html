              <p>I still clearly remember what happen everything from the encounter to when she agreed to be with me.. It was not very long ago (around 1 year), I still remember how lucky i am and touched that my effort on getting her have finally pay off( we are the kind whom proceeded from friend zone to lover which is actually harder in my sense)..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>now only one year down the road I am confused.. I still have feeling for her and still wants to continue if not share my life with her in the future but something somehow hit me..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I realise I've lost that interest in her slowly.. (I still love my gf)</p>
              <p>but Im jus confuse why is that so... even sexually(theres even once I got trouble getting errected and have to rely on my imagination to keep it going) I lost that interest is that because I no longer love her without knowing it?</p>
              <p>or its just part of a long term serious relation deal? like a stage which i will eventually overcome? </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>or am i a bastard who cant stay committed? I am really confuse on it.. shes a great girlfriend(just abit clingy) and no doubt is someone you will not mind spending your life with but im worry that lost in interest will last and might cause me to stray..</p>

              <p>memories with your ex-es are meant to be kept INSIDE your head. Not share it with your gf.</p>
              <p>Let me ask you this.</p>
              <p>Would you rather your EX-gf control you or your gf control you ?</p>
              <p>EX gf are EX for good reason. They will be laughing and popping champagnes when you finally break off with your GF.</p>
              <p>They keep in contact with you waiting for the day you finally screw yourself up again.</p>
              <p>SO, Tell those ex bitches to shut the fark up, you now belong to your GF.</p>
              <p>Since you have lost interest in your gf, then let her go. She's not gonna die without you.</p>
              <p>Infact, now that you have become IMPOTENT.. she'd be happier with another MAN.</p>

              <p>She is not mad, she is just being direct to you.</p>
              <p>A relationship is what they known as : "3 years of flame, a lifetime of commitment"</p>
              <p>Most people failed to realise this though, and prefer jumping from 1 girl to another. If you are going to go after another girl and dump this gf just because you "feel" that the feeling is not there anymore, then I can assure you that you will repeat this cycle over again and again.</p>
              <p>As for sexual matters wise, have you been having sex too often recently? This could be one of the reasons why it is getting harder and harder for you to erect.</p>
              <p>If you were to be uncommitted to your relationship, it doesn't matter how much you love your gf now; you will still stray. I will leave it to your ownself to decide what to do now, but don't regret your choice.</p>

              <p>The confusion is cos u are relating to a relationship lah - a dead thing, liveless lar. When u go home - do u relate to your furniture or fan? One cannot relate to a thing! Now your gal friend (whatever she means to u) has been reduced to a thing also. A human being is an <span style="text-decoration: underline;">evolving living</span> being - however, the dust of the past is so very much imprinted in the mind - one only reacts to the past or from memory. One's<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> inner mirror is distorted </span>- it reflects only the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">imprints of the mind</span> not as things or people as they are.</p>
              <p>Try relating <span style="text-decoration: underline;">without a relationship</span> which u did when u first got to know her - eg, u were very freindly, very open to experimenting , a let-go stance- i m sure it was never boring, never dull, always exciting - well, now stale lah cos it has lost its flavour of<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> uncertainty, thrill and newness</span>. Relating is uncertain and many fear losing out - so quickly they rush into making into a relationship and after that wonder why the boredom, why the staleness , why the dead feeling!</p>
              <p>One cannot see newness in another if one does not see newness in oneself. What do u see?</p>

              <p>With love comes the responsibility of 'committment'. Some say love is not committment, for it has to be free or an ordered life will be an imposition to one, as not one thinks like the other, similar in every way.</p>
              <p>However, committment is not a chain around one's neck. In truth, committment is as free as love should be, for in love will you find comfort and solace in another, despite the differences, flaws and all, thru the fond memories of better togetherness, and the chance that such feelings will recurr and occur, despite lulls in love's excitement. In love will good things come such as tolerance and patience.</p>
              <p>And it will be intolerance, impatience and the feel of committment as a yoke of responsibility which you claim is still love, that will drive you apart.</p>
              <p>In time, when the break occurs and the distance unbridgable...the fond memories of you and her will linger, haunt and make you seek her back...but only too late.....for she is gone...</p>

              <p>Well, you dun expect a relationship to be all passionate and sweet all the time... or do you?</p>
              <p>In my opinion, there would be up and down, stray and back on the right track. When I say stray, it's not having an affair although sometimes it happens, but more like developing feelings for another.</p>
              <p>What really matters is that whether you are interested in making this relationship works or not.</p>
              <p>For the sex part... are you doing it so often that you had lost interest cos of the frequency? Well, different people got different level of sex drive. I mean your girl might want it all the time but you only want it once in a while. Try limiting it then. Although I dun really think it was a problem for most guys to get it up unless the guy is really low on sex drive.</p>

              <p>Are these few names you are thinking about those of your ex-gfs?</p>
              <p>If that is the case, then there is nothing unusual with it. I won't say it is right to think of other girls when you already have one beside you, but that is what a lot of men do. They will keep reminiscing about the good times they have with their exs, and honestly speaking, it is impossible to totally forget about all these.</p>
              <p>On to the topic of settling down, are you truly ready to settle down yet? From the looks of your current situation, I will say that you are not ready yet. Your mind hasn't settled down yet, and thus neither will your heart.</p>
              <p>Give yourself some time to think it over, and ask yourself : "Am I ready to fully commit myself?" If you are not, then I suggest you stop thinking about settling down anytime soon.</p>

              <p>My <span style="text-decoration: underline;">take is this</span> lah- the exploitation of each other has peaked and there is nothing left to hold it except be torn asunder by all these rationalizations and apportioning blame on some many factors or the past.</p>
              <p>Know this lah - love knows no reasons, knows no fears and love only then abides!</p>
              <p>One who can relate to ONEself (one's being) is just one who will always seek out another. Seek out another - but acknowledg this weakness, this deficiit, this paucity - otherwise its doomed from the start and the wise would understand this (these) and RELATE!</p>
