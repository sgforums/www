              <p>What a misnomer and an anomaly lah - u - i m refering to your
              stance when your so-called relationship(s) are concerned.</p>
              <p>My <span style="text-decoration: underline;">take is this</span> lah- the exploitation of each other has peaked and there is nothing
              left to hold it except be torn asunder by all these
              rationalizations and apportioning blame on some many factors or the
              past.</p>
              <p>Know this lah - love knows no reasons, knows no fears and love
              only then abides!</p>
              <p>One who can relate to ONEself (one's being) is just one who will
              always seek out another. Seek out another - but acknowledg this
              weakness, this deficiit, this paucity - otherwise its doomed from
              the start and the wise would understand this (these) and
              RELATE!</p>

              <p>Fuggy, can you explain "RELATE" in layman term ?</p>
              <p>Your advise are wise but rather grandiloquent for young people lah.</p>
              <p>Wise words are great tools. To maximise benefits, one must know the meaning of each component , yes ?</p>

              <p>You have an addiction to phenyl ethylamine. The love drug your brain produces when you fall in love.</p>
              <p>But lacks Dopamine and norepinephren to stay connected in your relationship.</p>
              <p>And also, you don't produce enough oxytocin during intimate sessions with your partner and thus lack the will to carry out your manly duties.</p>
              <p>However, you have no problem with producing Vasopressin, as it seems you do have the ability to remain monogamous in a relationship.</p>
              <p>Therefore, as you can see, you are just suffering from chemical unbalance.</p>

              <p>Thanks for the insightful rant. Anyway, what I said is not cast in stone - all that i espouse is relative truth not absolute. As such, take the tumbles and cruise along - and if u can (which i m sure u want to) just live and grow UP on the way as opposed to growing OLD.</p>
              <p>Jojo,</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Relate</span> - I am merely using love as an eg, as its a universal phenomenon. Being love is poetry in motion. Being angry, Being kind, Being rude .... n imagine what ensues. It is present and continuous.</p>
              <p> Relationship - no longer in motion. It has become a thing and it is used and put aside and used again n .... many forget that a person is a flux - evolving , changing. A thing, eg, a chair in your room is dead - no change, its finished. It can only be improved on the outside, encrusting, decorating ...</p>
              <p>Of course, relating is difficult cos the element of certainty is not there. There is no security.One never knows if the other (person) or situation is going to stay as it is or change. Hence the anxiety and insecurity. That is the reason why one quickly wants to make it secure - how? relationship.</p>
              <p> how one relates to another, whether its a spouse, at workplace or ... does eventually add or diminish the quality of one's relationship with ....</p>
