Just before sleeping(by the bed), during dinner, lunch, during a date, after the movie, its different for everyone.<br><br>Bring it up when you think you're both comfortable, and then try to be understanding to his needs.

My father is also like that, he doesn't allow my mum to work because her job needs her to travel between singapore and malaysia quite often. He is so afraid that my mum would soon become a businesswoman and not care about the family.<br><br>To me, Males who have this particular problem with being overly protective or posessive is just not having self confidence. He is scared that he might not be the support that you will turn to when you have problems, turning himself to be an unsignificant figure and you might be stronger than he is.<br><br>Anyhow, your bf is having a hard time finding self confidence. Be patient with him and try to figure out a solution for that. Assure him that you really is in love with him.<br><br>Take Care and gd luck!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I can suggest going to visit a marriage counselor, many couples before they get married do, so its not weird or anything, in fact, many couples either see a marriage counselor or their pastor if they're christian. This helps in many ways as the counselor/ pastor will say/preach what it takes to marry each other...<br><br>You have to talk to your bf and let him know that he's being very possessive. See what he says and try to reason it out with him.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

He seems to be having alot of 'pms' recently.....<br>&amp; I've been thinking alot recently...whether he is the right guy...sigh  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> </div></blockquote>Well... this is kinda normal thing to happen.  If you do read and study a lot about man and woman's mental profile, you will realise that possessive is often caused by insecurity and lack of confident and trust.  Well, take your time to figure it out what causes him to behave like these.<br><br>As for your problem, well, some guys are like these.  They demand to know the truth.. and yet, they can't handle the truth.  Sometimes, a little white lies would help.. as long as he don't find out.  Often, if you are not a good and tactful person to create white lies.. then don't use this approach.<br><br>The people whom we love and loves us are the one who shapes us.  There is very little chance of anyone to let go of their friends for just one person.  Being tactful is very important to your relationship when it comes to him.  Communicating your feelings and being honest won't really help if he is insecured and lack confident.<br><br>Try this approach, it may help.<br><br>1. Ask him nicely if he has any program for certain date.<br>2. If no, ask him with all respect, if he minds you going out with your friends.<br>3. If he says yes, then humbly accept his request and don't even need to ask why.  Just tell him, he has to tell you all his schedule and if ever you don't like, he must comply as well.<br>4. Chances are, he will ask you why are you doing this instead.  Then.. tell him, the same reason he is doing it to you.<br>5. If he insists that you meet his friends, tell him, he knew none of your friends.<br>5. If he gets the msg, good for you. If not, things will get very very interesting.<br><br>Thing is this, a relationship needs leverage at times.  Otherwise, you may as well get an Sony Aibo and treat it as your hubby.. or simply be as obedient to him as if he has got himself a Sony Aibo.<br><br>Try try and see...<br><br></div>
