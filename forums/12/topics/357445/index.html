              <p>hmm, wonder what giga will say later if he sees this. He should know very well what i'm hinting and reason for earlier question :p</p>
              <p>1) Just do your best for the heats. Do not always take winning and lossing so importantly. The experience is more important.</p>
              <p>2) Change your lifestyle, meet up with friends, go out walk walk during the weekends etc and not keep yourself at home all the time. Go think why your friends are not on good terms with you, is it your own behavior/personality/attitude that causes it?</p>
              <p>3) In terms of attire, i feel its more important to wear what you feel comfortable in. Singlet and shorts at home is fine, u are not having a fashion parade at home but if you go to Orchard etc in singlet and shorts then i would say thats a problem.</p>

              <p>1) In life, learn to give and take, you can't have everything you want.</p>
              <p>2) Thats hard to say esp since i was ur age so long ago. How do you behave and what do you do that might make people dislike you?</p>
              <p>3) Personally i got no fashion sense as well and don't really care what people think about how i dress but at least wear a decent t-shirt/polo t-shirt with pants/jeans when you go out.</p>

              <p>Find common things that you and your friends have interest in and that will enable conversation. Sometimes just try to laugh at lame jokes and look amuse if everyone is. Go with the flow and majority. If its hard to approach a group, if opportunity arises and you managed to talk to maybe just 1 person, you could slowly through him get to join his group of friends and slowly expand your network of friends.</p>

              <p>This is all part of growing up. Do not falter. Take action, and you'll see results (but not anytime soon).</p>
              <p>You are a typical S'porean nerdy boy. You are the main reason S'porean girls get all slutty when they see a not-so-nerdy white dude. Do yourself a big favour - go wank.</p>
