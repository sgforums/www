              <p>Judging from what he had done, his clearly <strong>not a friend</strong>, so its best to <strong>ignore him</strong>. Smart ppl will <strong>stay away</strong> from these kind of people. He is probably the one feeling insecure and needs to do that to well i dunno "satisfy himself“? by spreading tales. Do not stoop down to his level and argue with him, u will only cause more troubles for urself.</p>
              <p>Just continue mixing around with ur friends, if u mix long enough with them, they will eventually find out what kind of person u really are and might just speak up for u the next time he badmouths u again.</p>

              <p>Are u in Secondary one or two? Cause ur "friend" seems really childish to be doing that kind of things. U have something in u that he is lacking, thats why i think he is always picking on u. What was that girls reaction after he told tales about u?</p>
              <p>I very seldom run into these kind of awkward and silly situations back then but as always the best solution is to ignore him. It may be true that if u ignore him he will continue to torture u for awhile more but eventually he might just get bored and stop, how long has this been going on?</p>
              <p>Just remember that violence will not solve the problem if he is bent on provoking u.</p>

              <p>Why does he continues to piss u off? Its because you react and by reacting, you let him achieve his aim and motivate him to continue on. Just ignore him, don't give a damn and he would get bored of it.</p>

              <p>You need to take initiative to make friends, time to spend with them to maintain the friendship etc. Friends don't come just because you want them to and stay just because they once were. Both 'parties' needs to put time and effort to keep any and every sort of relationship alive.</p>
              <p>If you tell me your mum don't allow you go out then why are you complaining about no friends to spent your weekend with if you can't?</p>
