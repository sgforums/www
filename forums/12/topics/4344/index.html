            <div class='col-md body'>Hey look, I have tons of gal friends, and we have body contact....(when they pass me stuff, our hands touch...) hahahahah. And I admit at times the sexual tensions run high, and you think you fall for one of the girls. A perfectly platonic relationship with the opp sex does not exist from my point of view. You will always have this "thing" about being in a group full of the opp sex, but you don't let it develope into a full blown BGR arena. That is unless you are gay......and I have gay friends.<br>I am a guy, I mix better with the girls, because they offer me a sense of security, strange but true. I don't always play the part of macho male protects gals. It's almost always the other way around, unless pure brute force is required. OKok, this applies only when I am single, cause when I am attached, I cannot seem to find time to hang around the gals, and even if I do, I cannot shake off the idea that I am already someone else's property. But we still discuss about my buaya habits.<br><br>So do I flirt? Yes, I flirt, in a subtle way, my coach flirts too, he's got a wife and several girlfriends all over asia......but he sees it as enjoying the company of a beautiful lady. I am not saying we should follow this, but some people are like that, and they know their limits. They dun bring their gfs home either.</div>
