              <p>Its quite obvious actually that you have a fear of rejection, in this case it is a particular fear of rejection from a cute or attractive girl that you deem to be so.</p>
              <p> It is called Caligynephobia, the fear of beautiful women (probably related to shyness and fear of rejection) [Seems like it does not interfere with your daily working life and leisure time and daily functioning]</p>
              <p>It can also be classified as Venustraphobia depending on the extent it interferes with your daily life and functioning. It is an abnormal and persistant fear of beautiful women. The main keywords are Abnormal (being consistently unable to adapt and function effectively in a variety of conditions)  and Persistant (over a prolonged or excessive period of time).</p>
              <p>Allow me to share my experiences with you so that you will feel that you are not alone as you think you are. Here goes nothing:</p>
              <p>"Frankly, i also share the same problem as you as I will inevitably get tensed up when i see a certain girl i love but can never able approach her without feeling so anxious and worked up. As i result, I can never ever talk to that particular someone in person face to face, even though my feelings to her are quite deep rooted in my heart.</p>
              <p>I tried to overcome this problem by talking to her via MSN Messenger but after i while i did something foolish as my feelings for her are so deep and i want to express them to her but I can never do so face to face and she was graduating soon from JC and i could not delay any longer.</p>
              <p>In order to show her that i really liked her i said these exact words on MSN Messenger: "You are perfect in my eyes". This made her say that she liked a certain someone already.</p>
              <p>Even though we said we could still be friends,  after that fateful day where I was really desperate till i rushed things too fast, she began to avoid me everytime I saw her in school for so many months.</p>
              <p>It was heart wrenching and it really made me feel so empty and upset and regretful about my actions till I feel into depression. Consequently, i was sequentially referred to the School Counseller, the Principal and finally the Psychiatrist and Psychologist to treat my mental and emotional trauma.</p>
              <p>Even up till today, i couldnt forgive myself and part of me hated myself for what i have done and how insensitive i was.</p>
              <p>But i managed to clear things up recently by sending her an email telling her why I liked her(because she was outgoing, had a cute and lovely smile and was modest in what she does) and why she was important to me. I also expressed my desire to want things to be back to they were before and to be just friends again to forget everything that has happened and to seek a New Beginning.</p>
              <p>She replied me via her SMS that she forgave me and even asked me to focus on my studies(as she knows im into Biomedical Research). She also told me to forget everything and the impact her actions had on me and my family as I recently had suicidal thoughts because of her (that i didnt disclose to her). She even told me to cheer up and live life to the fullest as I only have one life only.</p>
              <p>After reflecting on this issue, it seems I get a clearer understanding of my confused emotions and how to move forward from here. Even though Im unsure on how to communicate to her in a more sensitive light and what should I do to proceed with this important relationship to me to make this attractive, confident, modest and well-dressed girl to like me better and also to know her more without having this excessive fear of rejection again.</p>
              <p>Anyways, my greatest and most sincere thanks to the thread starter to allow me to express my confused feelings and emotions in a more objective manner. =)</p>
              <p>PS: ALL THE BEST in your relatonship with this girl you really are attracted to as I understand what you are going through and know how much you can really like someone but find it excessively difficult to approach her no matter how much your heart longs to do so.</p>
              <p>Just approach her and talk to her casually while smiling a lot as the smile is a universial gesture that you feel affectionate with someone. Also keep on telling yourself that you are worthy of her affections and believe in yourself and your strengths.</p>
              <p>If all else fails, just be as confident as you can be as this type of experience is quite rare and you may regret it later (trust me, i have been in that horrible, excruciating experience many, many times).</p>
              <p>However, as time flies you cannot deny you may find girls in your new found social circle in your new Secondary school, JC, Polytechnic or University as you move on with your academic career and graduate to institutes of higher education.  </p>
              <p>So if I were you and if you will not see her again, just move on with your life as you should never ever limit yourself to one girl only as there may be others out there that you never noticed before that are also close to you emotionally."</p>
              <p>Heres a quote i will like to share with you by Alexander Graham Bell that I think applies to both our situations, to say the least:</p>

              </tr>
              <tr>

              <p>PS: Off topic here but the reason I wanted to be a Biomedical Researcher was because I wanted to alleviate suffering in the world, by eradicating illnesses one by one till the end of my life, that cause numerous helpless, hopeless and worthless souls in the world that are suffering and even dying day by day to make them see the light again.</p>
              <p>This is for them to be normal functioning human beings like us with limbs that are not amputated (due to Gangrene or Diabeties Mellitus) or fractured badly as these people cannot even walk anymore and have to rely on a wheelchair to move around for life or even a close relative to push them around all the time and as a result lose their sense of independence.</p>
              <p>Some also even lose their sense of sight due to Cataracts or Muscular Degeneration of the eye muscles that prevents them from focusing on any image. The sense of sight is something we all always take for granted till the moment we lose it someday due to  unfavourable circumstances such as aging or other illnesses caused by pathogens (disease causing agents like harmful bacteria (as some bacteria are beneficial to our survival as seen from an extract from Wikipedia on the article on Gut Flora, </p>

              <p>Its quite obvious actually that you have a fear of rejection, in
              this case it is a particular fear of rejection from a cute or
              attractive girl that you deem to be so.</p>
              <p> It is called Caligynephobia, the fear of beautiful women
              (probably related to shyness and fear of rejection) [Seems like it
              does not interfere with your daily working life and
              leisure time and daily functioning]</p>
              <p>It can also be classified as Venustraphobia depending on
              the extent it interferes with your daily life and functioning. It
              is an abnormal and persistant fear of beautiful women.
              The main keywords are Abnormal (being consistently unable to adapt
              and function effectively in a variety of conditions)  and
              Persistant (over a prolonged or excessive period of time).</p>
              <p>Allow me to share my experiences with you so that you will feel
              that you are not alone as you think you are. Here goes nothing:</p>
              <p>"Frankly, i also share the same problem as you as I will
              inevitably get tensed up when i see a certain girl i love but
              can never able approach her without feeling so anxious and worked
              up. As i result, I can never ever talk to that particular
              someone in person face to face, even though my feelings to her are
              quite deep rooted in my heart.</p>
              <p>I tried to overcome this problem by talking to her via MSN
              Messenger but after i while i did something foolish as my
              feelings for her are so deep and i want to express
              them to her but I can never do so face to face and she was
              graduating soon from JC and i could not delay any longer.</p>
              <p>In order to show her that i really liked her i said
              these exact words on MSN Messenger: "You are perfect in
              my eyes". This made her say that she liked a certain someone
              already.</p>
              <p>Even though we said we could still be friends,  after
              that fateful day where I was really desperate till i rushed things
              too fast, she began to avoid me everytime I saw her in school
              for so many months.</p>
              <p>It was heart wrenching and it really made me feel so empty and
              upset and regretful about my actions till I feel into depression.
              Consequently, i was sequentially referred to the
              School Counseller, the Principal and finally the
              Psychiatrist and Psychologist to treat my mental and emotional
              trauma.</p>
              <p>Even up till today, i couldnt forgive myself and part of me
              hated myself for what i have done and how insensitive i was.</p>
              <p>But i managed to clear things up recently by sending her an
              email telling her why I liked her(because she was outgoing, had a
              cute and lovely smile and was modest in what she
              does) and why she was important to me. I also expressed
              my desire to want things to be back to they were before and to
              be just friends again to forget everything that has happened
              and to seek a New Beginning.</p>
              <p>She replied me via her SMS that she forgave me and even
              asked me to focus on my studies(as she knows im into Biomedical
              Research). She also told me to forget everything and the impact her
              actions had on me and my family as I recently had suicidal thoughts
              because of her (that i didnt disclose to her). She even told me to
              cheer up and live life to the fullest as I only have one life
              only.</p>
              <p>After reflecting on this issue, it seems I get a clearer
              understanding of my confused emotions and how to move forward from
              here. Even though Im unsure on how to communicate to her in a more
              sensitive light and what should I do to proceed with this important
              relationship to me to make this attractive, confident,
              modest and well-dressed girl to like me better and also
              to know her more without having this excessive fear of
              rejection again.</p>
              <p>Anyways, my greatest and most sincere thanks to the thread
              starter to allow me to express my confused feelings and
              emotions in a more objective manner. =)</p>
              <p>PS: ALL THE BEST in your relatonship with this girl you really
              are attracted to as I understand what you are going through and
              know how much you can really like someone but find it excessively
              difficult to approach her no matter how much your heart
              longs to do so.</p>
              <p>Just approach her and talk to her casually while smiling a
              lot as the smile is a universial gesture that you feel affectionate
              with someone. Also keep on telling yourself that you are
              worthy of her affections and believe in yourself and your
              strengths.</p>
              <p>If all else fails, just be as confident as you can be as
              this type of experience is quite rare and you may regret
              it later (trust me, i have been in that horrible, excruciating
              experience many, many times).</p>
              <p>However, as time flies you cannot deny you may find
              girls in your new found social circle in your
              new Secondary school, JC, Polytechnic or University as you
              move on with your academic career and graduate to institutes
              of higher education.  </p>
              <p>So if I were you and if you will not see her again, just
              move on with your life as you should never ever limit yourself
              to one girl only as there may be others out there that you never
              noticed before that are also close to you emotionally."</p>
              <p>Heres a quote i will like to share with you by Alexander Graham
              Bell that I think applies to both our situations, to say the
              least:</p>
              <p><span>"When one door closes another door opens; but we so often
              look so long and so regretfully upon the closed door, that we do
              not see the ones which open for us." </span><br> <br> <span>  --  <strong>Alexander Graham
              Bell</strong></span></p>

              <p>wow.. lonewolf you have really wrote one whole bunch. i thank you greatly also on behalf of everyone ^^</p>
              <p>Caligynephobia and Venustraphobia refers to 'beautiful women'. but wat if the woman isn't beautiful? or she is, but only in a secret admirer's eyes?</p>
              <p>to fall for a person and not being sure if your feelings are reciprocated, or, if that person rejects you, is really heart-wrenching. im glad you got over it.</p>
              <p>from what you have told us, it shows the girl cares for u, but she avoids you to prevent awkward situations, and to spare you pain.. hope all goes well for you and TS ^^</p>
