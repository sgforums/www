I totally agree, if they want to be an ass treat them like one.<br><br>Anyway Guru78, let me ask you a few question, how you know they are talking about your height different?  couldnt it be that they are admiring you and your gf?<br><br>I do know a few guys who like short gals, best around 1.5m, thinking such gals are cute.  And they themself is about 1.7m tall.  Of course they are no taller than you but guess what, sometime when they saw a couple like you and your gf they will just wonder how that guy over there can have such cute cute gf. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Regards<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by elindra:</div><div class="quote_body">You can't really stop it. My hubby and I are of different race and we put up with our fair share of rude stares.<br><br>Anyway, I think if people are rude, you don't have to be nice either. What I do is to give them an equally rude stare and he likes to comment loudly, " Dear, why are they staring at us." and I will reply," I don't know, why don't you ask them."<br><br>You will see some rude people turning very red and uncomfortable.<br><br>Yes we can be real asses  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> but seriously if they want to be an ass, just treat them like one.</div></blockquote></div>
