How do the two of you meet and fall in love if you have nothing in common? During courship, you two must have talked over some topic, do somethings that you enjoy together, be it catching a movie, strolling along Pasir Ris Park, chatting over a cup of coffee etc etc etc... Try to find the thing that created the 'spark' in your courtship days. If there is truly nothing in common with the two of you, it might not have been love you are experiencing, merely infatuation.<br><br>Sex I agree, is also a problem, though the problem I see is somewhat different to the one you mentioned. A relationship will lose all its novelty if you engage in sex too soon. Barely a year plus into a relationship, it is already burning up... In my opinion, it takes a longtime for a 'true' loving relation to develop. In the early days of the courtship, you two are drawn together and are so deeply in a romantic mood that you are blind to each other's shortcoming. It takes time to learn and accept these shortcomings, and this period may be potentially stressful to the relationship. Think of it as a test. If the relationship can survive this period, it will mature into something far more lasting...<br><br>However, if at this stage, you have already done everthing a seasoned couple has done, sex and all etc. There will no longer be any allure and mystery to the relationship. All that is left is a keen awareness of each other's shortcoming. This is the kind of thing that will bring about the downfall of a relationship.<br><br>On the physical aspect of the sexual problem, is your bf suffering from any medical conditions such as premature ejeculation? If not, you can also prolong the session by "taking initiative" (I dont want to talk about it here, but if you really want my humble opinion, I can send you a private tell)<br><br>I also agree with the previous poster. Have a candid talk with your bf. It might be that he is not aware of your needs, both physical and emotional.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Can't blame him though, he is what he is, don't ever make him change, you will only piss him off even more. Regarding the sex issue, try to talk to him and ask him to finger you for a longer time before he put his penis into your vagina, this way you will enjoy more and get the orgasm longer that u desire for.</div>

For a starter... You mentioned you've got nothing common with your bf and getting bored of the relationship.. Yet you don't wish to give it up...? Hmm.. Then what do you really intend to keep him for? Take care of you....? How old are the both of you btw...? If all these persist, try to get your OWN life other than just time with him to make your life more meaningful... If you hate his SCV and 'in-house policy' so much, date him OUT next time... And STAY OUT!! Make PLANS that can LAST the both of you OUTSIDE....<br><br>Sex-wise... Learn to satisfy yourself lor... If sex really mean much to you... Else you can also help by creating the 'mood' and everything for him...? Go read up on books and magazinez to find out how you can do that.....</div>

I read that premature ejaculation occurs more often in men who dont have sex on a regular basis. In order to extend your playtime, your guy has to learn to control both physically and psychologically. Maybe u came too hard on him, and he's unable to control? It's not a physical problem, but a mental one, which can be overcomed (no pun intended) easily with the help of both spouses.</div>
