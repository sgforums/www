            <div class='col-md body'>Hi guys, I was always looking around in Aunt Agony and seeing people with their emotion problems. Never expected 1 day I would need to post here too.<br>I was with my gf for 3 years plus. Our character is very different. I don't know how to describe the differences, but we are just plain different. I used to be a guy who is like very easy going 1. So she used to complain that I am not gentlemen etc. So I tried to changed by doing things like opening doors for her, carrying her heavy stuff for her even if she didn't ask me to. She also changed in her own way.<br>Then recently for the past few months, we will always be quarreling over the slightest issue. Like we have different opinions on things also can quarrel.<br>So is over all this small minor quarrels that I know that she actually know she got so much unhappiness about me. Eg, she thinks I am still not gentlemen enough, I not sweet enough, not gentle enough. And everytime after all this quarrel, she will try to dump me. Even though sometimes is not my fault. So tried to pacify her and try to get her to patch up the relatioship back after all this small quarrels.<br>And today we quarreled yet again. This time over branded stuff. I told her, she buy branded stuff is for the brand and not for the quality as she claimed. Then she go use all her business knowledge she learnt in poly to 'attack' me back, and so the quarrel leads again to the same ending again. We 'broke up' again. Whether we will come back together again, I really don't know.<br>My point is that she keeps asking me to change. But I am I. It is my characteristic. Why keep asking me to change? Her ideal bf must be atleast Average looking(i don't think too highly of myself physically),<br>Must be a gentlemen(I am just a guy who don't treat female with special care. It is like I treat my female friends equally as my male friends. I won't go rush to open the door or what. I open if i am nearer to the door or something like that)<br>And she like guys with nice chest. (I used to be a Staff Sergeant in the NCC but after coming to poly, you should know what happen to the fitness and body shape)<br>Am I such a lousy bf? Why does anything I do seem to be wrong to her? I loved her alot but why I do seem so weak in relationship, or am I just plain lousy? I really don't know. I am really so sick of life. I can't get distinction for any of my poly subjects, relationship screwed up. I don't know what I want in life anymore. I feel like a loser. Someone unwanted, some worthless sucker.<br>I have thought about dying, but afraid to jump. Wanted to take pills, but worry of a slow painful death. Even ending my own life I am scared. I am really very useless and lousy...<br>Sorry for the long entry, I just don't know where to voice out my feelings anymore.</div>

Then technically she won't be a GF but just a friend. So naturally your GF would be pissed.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by p0610465:</div><div class="quote_body">Am I such a lousy bf? </div></blockquote>I won't say lousy.

But if we think from another perspection, when I die, won't they be saving alot of money for the future?<br>Ya, exams are coming, you sure know aeronautical engineering students all very kiasu 1. class competition very fierce. so stress is there. I aim not to pass, but to get distinction for all my subjects. sounds very kiasu but I am aiming for uni entry through poly. So i need to get as many distinctions as possible over the 3 years.</div></blockquote>your perspective is flawed becos your parents arent going to keep spending money on you. You are almost reaching the point where you have to pay them back.<br><br>how about you think in this perspective, your parents already invested so much money in you. You have yet to repay them back, but you decided to take the easy way out by suiciding and not paying them your dues.<br><br>Oh, you shld try to score a GPA of 3.8 and above, otherwise its will be very difficult to find a good ITP company who will accept you. Most of my friends in DARE, forced to go non related companies to do their ITP(Ikea, golden village ect ect) all becos their GPA was less than 3.8...anyway, most ppl in MM seems to be scoring above 3.0 for their GPA...<br><br>Maybe you can tell your gf taht is cheaper to buy something cheap and change it after 2 years den to buy something triple the price and change it after 3years...but maybe your gf PMS tt day...also sway...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey have more confidence in yourself.  She probably doesn't deserve you if she can't accept the good guy in you, and demands change that compromises your personal boundaries and beliefs.  Suicide is never the solution to anything; it only creates more problems.  Look around you and find strength in your friends. There will always be someone willing to help you. Talk to them. You must understand that you are not the only person with problems in this world. If you can stand up to your problems and overcome them, it will only make you stronger and ready to face other things in life.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

Never expected 1 day I would need to post here too.<br>I was with my gf for 3 years plus. Our character is very different. I don't know how to describe the differences, but we are just plain different. I used to be a guy who is like very easy going 1. So she used to complain that I am not gentlemen etc. So I tried to changed by doing things like opening doors for her, carrying her heavy stuff for her even if she didn't ask me to. She also changed in her own way.<br>Then recently for the past few months, we will always be quarreling over the slightest issue. Like we have different opinions on things also can quarrel.<br>So is over all this small minor quarrels that I know that she actually know she got so much unhappiness about me. Eg, she thinks I am still not gentlemen enough, I not sweet enough, not gentle enough. And everytime after all this quarrel, she will try to dump me. Even though sometimes is not my fault. So tried to pacify her and try to get her to patch up the relatioship back after all this small quarrels.<br>And today we quarreled yet again. This time over branded stuff. I told her, she buy branded stuff is for the brand and not for the quality as she claimed. Then she go use all her business knowledge she learnt in poly to 'attack' me back, and so the quarrel leads again to the same ending again. We 'broke up' again. Whether we will come back together again, I really don't know.<br>My point is that she keeps asking me to change. But I am I. It is my characteristic. Why keep asking me to change? Her ideal bf must be atleast Average looking(i don't think too highly of myself physically),<br>Must be a gentlemen(I am just a guy who don't treat female with special care. It is like I treat my female friends equally as my male friends. I won't go rush to open the door or what. I open if i am nearer to the door or something like that)<br>And she like guys with nice chest. (I used to be a Staff Sergeant in the NCC but after coming to poly, you should know what happen to the fitness and body shape)<br>Am I such a lousy bf? Why does anything I do seem to be wrong to her? I loved her alot but why I do seem so weak in relationship, or am I just plain lousy? I really don't know. I am really so sick of life. I can't get distinction for any of my poly subjects, relationship screwed up. I don't know what I want in life anymore. I feel like a loser. Someone unwanted, some worthless sucker.<br>I have thought about dying, but afraid to jump. Wanted to take pills, but worry of a slow painful death. Even ending my own life I am scared. I am really very useless and lousy...<br>Sorry for the long entry, I just don't know where to voice out my feelings anymore.</div></blockquote>Problem is not you. You are you. I would rather you live your life the way you want to than live someone else's way(in this case, your girlfriend).<br><br>Going by your words, this relationship is going nowhere. I may be harsh but this girl is not good for you. If it's me, I would have got rid of her already, let alone beg her to come back to me. Can't you see? She's trying to get rid of you.<br><br>I shall repeat again, don't live a way just to please someone, not even your girlfriend/wife. You won't be happy eventually.<br><br>Take care of yourself. Your most important persons in your life is your parents/siblings/close friends.<br><br>doko</div>
