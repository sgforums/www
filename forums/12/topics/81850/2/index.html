            <div class='col-md body'>if she can treat u like a emotional safety strap, u too can play her back in her own game as a sexual tension releaser...i was in a similar situation once..my partner was goin out wif guys almost every other day when im not meeting her, i gave her a taste of her own medicine and when she felt the pain she stopped immediately n apologized, and asked for a patch back. I dumped her on the spot, the look on her face? PRICELESS... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

They can be fulfilling and harmonious only after the rain - but to endure the rain is <strong>not</strong> about persistence and being just an energizer battery - <strong>it's more by solving issue with your own hands and succeed</strong>. It took me damn long to realise this sacred law and could have perish in the attempt to understand that.<br><br>Karmic relationship is difficult because of afflicted bonds. Logically speaking, some people are meant to be, while some are not. In love, karmic relationship tends to mimic the same intensity and feel as Higher Twin Self (what I meant is true love - easiest explaination). People feel drawn to the particular person because of the inability to sever bonds.
