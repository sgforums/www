I have all along have the mind set we will get marry n live everly happpy together. N recently after we came back for a couple of mths while we are still struggling to look for a job she decide to break wif mi. N less than 1 week after we breakup she is back wif her ex-bf whom she has break up twice oredi before. This guy is a know to have many girls around him all the time n this is one of the reason that she broke up wif him in the frist place. N now he is doing part time poly nite time but he has a stable income.<br><br>I try my best to win her back but all she say is that she is KIV mi. N that her relationship wif that guys is like those of a teenage love n those of mi is of adult nature. n she at the moment prefer those of teenage nature.<br><br>On mi<br>-she say that im her veri special good friend( i still can visit her home).<br>-Im like a product that one look n look before buying home becous when im brought home it definily can be use n keep.<br>-she feel comfortable n can be herself when wif mi<br><br>On him<br>-he is a good friend<br>-he is a product that one will buy without thinking n then when at home will think is how n why it can be use.<br>-she feel happy to see him<br><br>Im confuse by all she has say becous n different day she can be saying different thing. N she say she has even kiss n hold his hand n trying to work out the relationship. N she still kiss mi every now n then and then tell mi she still love mi n care for mi. But everytime when we are together n the guy calls she always told mi to make no sound, n she call chat happily wif him while im just like an idiot waiting there. She did not let the guy know wat anything about us like going out n on the phone. Even when going out on a date she always gave pirority to him n feed mi in on days when he is no free.<br><br>Is she trying to tell mi something? i keep asking her or is she 2timer mi n is she fooling mi? she just keep saying no n all the answers she tell is like maybe n dun know she cannoot just gave mi a yes or no answer. N last week when i try to returen the ring to her she at first say not to pass it to her directly becous she do not dare to take it n then later she change her story to that maybe i should keep it for another few mth then see how from there on. N i just being use as a spare wheel. sometime she can say then she dun know is her relationship wif him can work out or not n that for mi she has higher hope. Wat man i  getting soo confuse on wat to do. I try to tell her im not playing wif her anymore n she just hold on to my hand n cry n refuse to let go.<br><br>I really love her soo much after all that we have being thru. N just this afteroon she tell mi she is like that becouse she treat n love different people differently. tell mi guys wat i should do. Just now that guy just calll n the next moment she is out of the house again. im getting veri the confuse n sad.

That's because of the length of years and the effect of seduction that you are trapped within her grasp, has sunk deep and poison your decision making skills and love for her.<br><br>I am so fringin` sure that, in the first place, your position in her heart was <strong>never</strong> the first. You are back for only a while and she returned to her ex within one week? Let me reassure you with 95% confidence that there are stories on her side you never knew when you were in OZ and when you are back here.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Truth number one:</strong></span><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> They have always kept in contact and I am sure that the contact wasn't simple and pure. These contacts locked emotional motive beneath those words and thus she never really got over him.<br><br>You are trashed under his feet the minute you returned to Singapore. Can you imagine, all these years and sadly, you never stood a chance?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Teenage love? Adult love? Complete nonsense. Allow me to enlighten you on why she is behaving in such a manner: She wants to have the best of both worlds. Even though this guy may not be suitable for her, but he has the kind of qualities she would go crazy for - too bad, he lack stability.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Therefore, she would need you to supply her with stability</span> - someone to fall back in case this guy loses interest in her and at least she won't lose everything. She would still be stable, in some sense.<br><br><strong>This woman is highly deceptive</strong>. Her words and position changes frequently. Look at how her points shifted to suit to her current position? Your eyes are blindly in love with her, but surely your mind understand what I have wrote?<br><br>If you are willingly to be a mere shadow of the guy, continue what you have been doing because it have been 5 years and <strong>you never succeed in portraying the real you and win her over EVEN THROUGH PRIVATE &amp; CONSTANT meeting and living together in oz.</strong> There isn't any meaning to this chase anymore.<br><br>If all these words are unable to tear open your soul on why you should sever this karmic bond once and for all - you will be fulfilling this prophesy of mine in the first paragraph.<br><br>P.S: Is she is Pisces or Libra?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>

I have being together wif this girl for almost 5 years from the time we are in poly to Oz to study n back. During our time in Oz we live together n do things that only husband n wife do. I have all along have the mind set we will get marry n live everly happpy together. N recently after we came back for a couple of mths while we are still struggling to look for a job she decide to break wif mi. N less than 1 week after we breakup she is back wif her ex-bf whom she has break up twice oredi before. This guy is a know to have many girls around him all the time n this is one of the reason that she broke up wif him in the frist place. N now he is doing part time poly nite time but he has a stable income.<br><br>I try my best to win her back but all she say is that she is KIV mi. N that her relationship wif that guys is like those of a teenage love n those of mi is of adult nature. n she at the moment prefer those of teenage nature.<br><br>On mi<br>-she say that im her veri special good friend( i still can visit her home).<br>-Im like a product that one look n look before buying home becous when im brought home it definily can be use n keep.<br>-she feel comfortable n can be herself when wif mi<br><br>On him<br>-he is a good friend<br>-he is a product that one will buy without thinking n then when at home will think is how n why it can be use.<br>-she feel happy to see him<br><br>Im confuse by all she has say becous n different day she can be saying different thing. N she say she has even kiss n hold his hand n trying to work out the relationship. N she still kiss mi every now n then and then tell mi she still love mi n care for mi. But everytime when we are together n the guy calls she always told mi to make no sound, n she call chat happily wif him while im just like an idiot waiting there. She did not let the guy know wat anything about us like going out n on the phone. Even when going out on a date she always gave pirority to him n feed mi in on days when he is no free.<br><br>Is she trying to tell mi something? i keep asking her or is she 2timer mi n is she fooling mi? she just keep saying no n all the answers she tell is like maybe n dun know she cannoot just gave mi a yes or no answer. N last week when i try to returen the ring to her she at first say not to pass it to her directly becous she do not dare to take it n then later she change her story to that maybe i should keep it for another few mth then see how from there on. N i just being use as a spare wheel. sometime she can say then she dun know is her relationship wif him can work out or not n that for mi she has higher hope. Wat man i  getting soo confuse on wat to do. I try to tell her im not playing wif her anymore n she just hold on to my hand n cry n refuse to let go.<br><br>I really love her soo much after all that we have being thru. N just this afteroon she tell mi she is like that becouse she treat n love different people differently. tell mi guys wat i should do.
