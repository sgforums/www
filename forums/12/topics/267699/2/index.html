How much?<br><br>Do you have time trying to get used to physical with guys?<br><br>What do you mean you are devoted and yet you don't like to be physical with him? Aren't you contradicting yourself? It leads to the question of where is the love, if any, you have for him?<br><br>I don't see how he's taking you for a ride when you rejected him by rejecting intimacy with him. If you truly like him, why are you rejecting him? It's not a nice feeling to get rejected you know. He probably got hurt and you know, a man has a high ego. He probably thought you are not interested in him.<br><br>You rejected him and you say he's taking you for a ride? haha..<br><br>What else do you want him to do when you already rejected him? To keep requesting? Or to not waste time by searching for new love?<br><br>If you love someone, will you let them go?<br><br>Some guys like intimacy not necessarily because of sex, they just love the warmth of a body to hug. It's just a nice feeling. I know because I am a guy.<br>=)<br><br>I have to agree his attitude is wrong for ignoring you but it does not mean he is totally wrong.  However, it's too quick to judge. "Heartless" is too strong a word.<br><br>I feel he thinks you don't really like him by giving him bad signals, hence he does not want to waste his time and yours, as well.<br><br>doko<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>he has made it very clear to u that he just wants sex. His only interest is to get free sex. Many girls stupidly give in to demands for sex, after the man threaten to dump her if she refuse to give sex. In the end the girl gives in, only to be dumped in the end. After the initial success, the man will then continue to search for other new girls to get free sex, using the same tactic.</div>
