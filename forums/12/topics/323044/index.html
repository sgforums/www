              <p>Take it easy. The announcement is not even out and you're looking down on yourself already.</p>
              <p>Those who have a similar CCA during their secondary education would definitely gain an upper hand in getting into the competition. Who knows, maybe they have committed as much time as you do into their CCA while they were still secondary students. But as the Chinese always say, "å­¦å¦‚é€†æ°´è¡ŒèˆŸï¼Œä¸�è¿›åˆ™é€€". If they actually don't bother to turn up for any more practice sessions, thumbs up for you - you're one <strong>big</strong> step closer to beating them this year, if not next year.</p>
              <p>Just ask yourself, are you really passionate about your CCA? Because no one would give up what they love just because of the obstacles they face in pursuit of their dreams. If, say, you've just joined a CCA about playing DotA. Then your team got pwned by another who has played it for 5 years and they were like gulping coke and munching pizzas while they cleared your team. You don't say "zzz. we too n00bs le. tio pwnzor by pr0s sia. i wan quit dota liao sio.", but look forward to the next match, hoping to defeat them with lots of training in between.</p>
              <p>I wish you all the best.</p>

              <p><br>It ok, at least you tried, and you trained yourself, healthy and fit, it a gain for you, it only a sport, take it as an exercise for you. You learn to take disappointment as part of life, nobody life is in pink all the time, sometime it turns grey, but then with a good mentality and determination, we can alway turn it pink, it all up in your mind. Be happy ya.</p>

              <p>Why compare? Some people are made for it; others achieve it thru' sheer hard work.</p>
              <p>Wallowing in self-pity isn't going to get you anywhere. If you're not going to pick yourself up and carry on, I'd recommend you give up the sport, since you've admitted that everything is beyond your control. Thus, any more hard work isn't going to be worth it.</p>
              <p>Conversely, if you keep thinking you can get better and better each day, if you truly believe you deserve a spot in the team, and that you control your own future, I'd boldly say that things will eventually turn out in your favour.</p>

              <p>u cant swallow the fact? y be so concerned..? one mountain still got one mountain higher..</p>
              <p>what's important is whether u have learnt something and benefitted from it in the end.. im sure whatever sports it is, u would have been good at it right now..</p>
              <p>last time i oso from a sports cca in secondary school.. summore in the sports class.. but 2 yrs later kena kicked out.. go normal class.. while the rest of my classmates go on and go tournament, go zone, go nationals, win nationals.. while me? 4 yrs in badminton leh.. never play one match with other school ppl b4..</p>
              <p>if im u, i wun be here typing too.. den after that, go jc, join track and field two years.. everyday training training training, train until here pain there injured, same thing happen.. never go nationals at all.. and guess what? it's not becoz im lousy or what u know, it's becos the new guy was damn good at sucking up to the teacher in charge.. then teacher choose him.. im always the pom-pom boy, always the water boy, always the supporter, always the logistics boy..</p>
              <p>but den, all these has taught me that, it's not possible to be a champion just becoz u worked for it.. there will be ppl better than u.. but there are always ppl lousier den u... now becoz of my past with sports, im healthier, and fitter.. and a better person who takes losing in my stride, and not be a whiner about it..</p>
              <p>when u look back next time, u realise that it's nothing.. really.. just like how u look back at primary school and larf about those times when u are so afraid of punishment and like the whole world is crashing down becoz u forgot to bring ur exercise book..</p>

              <p><br>why i was born poor and not in the family of the LEEs or some rich family?? look dude, there are so many things in life that need to swallow ya, not only this ok, as i said, u must learn to take disppointment, learn to evade jealousy, learn to forgive if not forget, all this only bring hatre and pain in ur unsettled mind.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And if cannot take it, go, go and jump and die better, u cannot even match our gals mentality, go die better, let your parents cry over you and newspaper publish big big saying u die because you fail to go thru a sport event. The lamest guy in Singapore.</p>
