            <div class='col-md body'>Sometimes it is easier to say than to do. When you are really upset and you character does not allow you to live with it, you really have to force yourself to divert your attention to something else. I didnt always have nice time in the past, and I know how it feels because I dont live to lose. I think it is my character that does not allow me to always have a nice time in r/s. I pick on crap for nothing at times, and end up wanting to fight for a win. My last resort is to always to remind myself that I had worked so hard in my studies, and I love what I have now, so I put myself in front of anyone. So I dont die.</div>

I took it as a sign that I was not meant to die at that time, and looking back now, I am glad I didnt waste my life on such a jerk.<br><br>Maybe that time I was not really thinking about killing myself, but just want a way to channel my pain and frustration? I was hurting that time to the point of I am unable to cry, so I couldn't find any release...so I thought cutting myself would at least provide enough pain to distract myself from feeling the emotional pain... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Suicide is choice, like everything else. Yes, it doesn't solve many problems. It hurts your kin, and taints your own memory. The only thing it does is for the person; for him/her, the pain is over. But this pain is forced onto others.<br><br>However, to call a person "stupid" because he chose to end his life is uncalled for. These people have lost their way, and it is the responsibility of the people around him to bring him back. Comments like "Why are you so stupid?' and "You so dumb go hurt yourself for what?" are extremely hurting to one who is already suffering. Comparing his suffering to the suffering of others (like kids in Africa, starving people) will possibly make him feel worse and drive him off the edge. I would know because this is what many have done to me before. Shocking a person with harsh words is a gamble that should not be made casually, because the odds of losing are very high.<br><br>Empathy, unconditional sympathy and kindness are the ways to remove the cancer of suicidal thoughts. Be kind to someone who has lost love, and he will see that he has not lost any at all. Be gentle with someone who has been hurt, because it will remove the pain in the least painful way. Be caring to those who need care, because they will then be able to care for themselves.</div>
