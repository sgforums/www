Yes i agree that u cannot stand ur boss' fussiness but then this is life.<br><br>There is absolutely no need to volunteer urself back during weekend but rather the key here is to prove urself to him that u can performed. I believe the assignment he gave u can be a bit tough but always remember that there are people much worse off then u.<br><br>My old colleagues have to stick to the old, stupid administrative procedure that serves no significant meaning. But what to do? Because of this system, they work OT EVERYDAY and sometimes have to go back on weekends. This is life dude. I know is stressful but learn to overcome it. U will become a stronger person later in life.<br><br>Wish u success in advance <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> </div></blockquote>Thanks for your advice.
