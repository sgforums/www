              <p>personally, i dun think its right to chase after a guy.</p>
              <p>i think as a woman, we need to have the basic pride or maybe i very old-fashion?</p>
              <p>my frenz keep saying me stubborn and old-fashion too.</p>

              <p>I am quite okay with it actually, but I would prefer the girl to at least leave me with a bit of work and not to tell me outright.</p>
              <p>so I think it would be best to drop very obvious hints, like asking him out for a movie or dinner (the guy should know enough to offer to pay) with just the two of you or you calling or messaging him to chat often.</p>
              <p>if the guy does like you, I am sure he would catch the drift and jump at the opportunity. as the saying goes, å¥³è¿½ç”·éš”å±‚æ²™ï¼Œç”·è¿½å¥³éš”åº§å±±</p>

              <p>small talk about work perhaps? you all work at the same place after all, there must be something common about it you two can talk about. you can also talk about something interesting that happened or you witnessed in the day. if he is that much of a woodblock and not talk about something similar, you can ask things like "so what had you been busy with all day?". after a few times doing such stuff, he would normally be more comfortable chatting with you and would take the initiative to chat you up.</p>
              <p>the above is just my personal opinion. thought it sounded a little dumb lol.</p>

              <p>hmm...probably as many of our forumites have said, although now more n more girls chasing guys, its still onli limited to the minority bah...n u say u shy mah, so difficult for u to initiate oso...it will b good n courageous for u to initate of course, but if not done rite, it may cause many embarassments for both of u...</p>
              <p>asking him out for a date is not bad bah like lunch n stuff...whenever he isnt gonna eat with anyone yet, try to ask him if he wants to join u for lunch, then u guys can chat arnd...if theres no topics, its nice to still at least haf each other's company n see how he feels abt being alone with u onli</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal">Well... I am facing the same issue too, but from the guy angle. I like a girl who is more capable then me, but don't dare to make the move cause she treat everyone the same.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Put yourself in the guy shoe also. Maybe he's not making the move cause you are his colleague? So it will be extremely awkward if you reject him. Perhaps you should drop some hints that you like him so he can be more sure of your intention.</p>

              <p>just start slow. Know the guy well first before even you start a relationship. Without a good start the relationship will soon fall apart.</p>
              <p>You can try this few steps to help you know him better</p>
              <p>1) ask him for msn, and try chatting with him ( very usefull for shy guys like him)</p>
              <p>2) Sms him as a friend</p>
              <p>3) Talk crap with him</p>
              <p>4) ask him out in a group for example group dinner</p>
              <p>3) slowly ask him out for a moive with him alone </p>

              <p>I think if you don't know this person well at all yet, then for your own sake and his, just get to know him first. How do u get to know a friend? Smile, be friendly, ask how's your day, bla bla small talk ma. Don't let the whole idea of your attraction put you away.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Who knows, after you do the small talk chit chat, you realise, actually he is rude uncouth and boring, so you don't like him anymore?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But let's say you do, then cultivate the friendship slowly loh. Cannot  rush one lah. Organise grou activities, invite him along as one of the colleagues etc.</p>
