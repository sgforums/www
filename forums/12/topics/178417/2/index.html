            <div class='col-md body'>haha me second batch and therse is about 7 girls out of the whole aerospace course. Should be happy that there are 3 in my class. It makes my class somewhat civilised.<br><br>Btw...you wun become gay. But you may find yourself turning into a multicolour werewolf.<br><br>And one more thing...if you are think that this course allows you to design aircraft, you are wrong. It teaches you on how to maintain aircrafts. Hence the 14 caas exemptions. if you wnt to design aircraft you better go and get a degree.</div>

For most TP people i heard that they have to pay to for their own caas examinations. But if you are talking about degree, both are about the same. They are just stepping stones.</div>
