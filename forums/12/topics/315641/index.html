            <div class='col-md body'><p>There was once a princess who had a small eye problem that she felt was really bad. Being the king's daughter, she was rather spoiled and kept crying all the time. When the doctors wanted to apply medicine, she would invariably refuse any medical treatment and kept touching the sore spot on her eye. In this way it became worse and worse, until finally the king proclaimed a large reward for whoever could cure his daughter. After some time, a man arrived who claimed to be a famous physician, but actually was not even a doctor.<br><br>He declared that he could definitely cure the princess and was admitted to her chamber. After he had examined her, he exclaimed, "Oh, I'm so sorry!" "What is it?" the princess inquired. The doctor said, "There is nothing much wrong with your eye, but there is something else that is really serious." The princess was alarmed and asked, "What on earth is so serious?" He hesitated and said, "It is really bad. I shouldn't tell you about it." No matter how much she insisted, he refused to tell her, saying that he could not speak without the king's permission.<br><br>When the king arrived, the doctor was still reluctant to reveal his findings. Finally the king commanded, "Tell us what is wrong. Whatever it is, you have to tell us!" At last the doctor said, "Well, the eye will get better within a few days - that is no problem. The big problem is that the princess will grow a tail, which will become at least nine fathoms long. It may start growing very soon. If she can detect the first moment it appears, I might be able to prevent it from growing." At this news everyone was deeply concerned. And the princess, what did she do? She stayed in bed, day and night, directing all her attention to detecting when the tail might appear. Thus, after a few days, her eye got well.</p></div>

              <p>I'm sorry to hear about your loss but don't you think it is also time for you to move on with life ?  </p>
              <p>One day when you're long over it, you'll find these memories again and you'll most likely be able to look at them and think of fond memories or experiences that you've been changed by. You can always take something positive away from it so that you can apply into the next relationships to come.</p>
              <p> It is okay to let it all out but don't take it too far and for too long.</p>
              <p>I have also taken a yr plus to get over my grievance of an emotional loss. It is normal for a human being to feel that loss for a period of time. Take care ok :)</p>

              <p>So your ex-bf has got a few gf. He's probably happy hanging out with his gf now. So why are you still crying? The guy you love is happy, aren't you suppose to be happy for him too?</p>
              <p>Perhaps you have to seriously and truefully ask yourself this question: do you truely love him, or do you just yearn for him to be by your side? do you rather he stay with you and be unhappy, or be happy with other girls?</p>
              <p>Love, my dear, is about selflessness.</p>

                  have not moved an inch. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">You merely delay resolving the outcome until
                  a later date. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Now that that second verdict is out (first is
                  when the both of you broke up), it seemed that you have reiterated this crisis a
                  second time, like rewinding the entire episode once again within your psyche. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Then problem doesn't lies with the time that
                  has passively passed you by; rather, it's the inability to accept your
                  situation that is causing you great misery. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">You have two choices: to continue with denial
                  tactics or to dissolve this pain through higher understanding.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Until the day you become gain acceptance,
                  only then, recovery can begin its work. </span><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="icon_exclaim.gif"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> </span></p>
