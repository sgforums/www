            <div class='col-md body'><p>no lah, in fact i got more gals in my life than men, my nunnery got some many females, and we sleep, bathe and work together, it is not that I intent to remain singles, i also got dates every now and then, however, it is indeed quite awkward for a young gal like me who know so much about life to fall in love. For my age, most guys and gals are still in their dreamland and fail to see the essence, unlike me, so it kind of like i am unable to gel with people of my age due to my maturity mindset or simply, better understanding of life</p></div>

              <p>I thought about this topic long and hard.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think the reason why we ask this question is because we are Asians after all. We still have a lingering culture based very much of moral values.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I myself am brought up from a traditional family. Back in primary school, we were taught moral eduation (å¥½å…¬æ°‘) on how to really be a good citizen, a decent person, a responsible gentleman.. I was among the top 5 of my class back then, so i strived hard to set an example of a positive image. So with all these values infused in me, I naturally grew up to be a very decent person, follow rules, join the queue, wait my turn, dont drink, dont smoke, dont take advantage of pple ..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now a decade later everything has changed. Any moral values are practically non-existant in this society. There is virtually no more social responsibility from people. I dun even know if they teach moral education in school these days. But right now, all those moral values I've learnt lead me to a dilemma, rather than it is a clear cut of right and wrong.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I got some friends who always change gfs and anyhow sleep around. IMHO they are really scums of the earth and i pray that they will get HIV someday and die a long agonzing death. That said, these bastards would mock at pple like me say why I dont go flirt around with women and sleep with them whenever I get the chance. They will laugh and say : 'Sure you cling on to your moral values, but you will lose a lot in life and live to regret it when you are old'.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Are they really right? I felt myself even questioning those moral values I had been taught all these years. What exactly have they benefited me with? Nowadays u nice and courteous to pple, pple cut your queue, take yr seat, rob your credits and push responsibility and blame to you. So now i really zek tao give these selfish assholes a piece of my mind when they dare cross my path. But ask me to turn into a creep like them and anyhow screw around? How can... I cant bring myself to do that one leh.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sometimes i think the real decent pple have to suffer now due to the actions of those immoral, miserable excuses for human beings. Dont you think so?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Right now I've known a girl and we are already talking about marriage. But yeah you guessed it, she is not a virgin any longer, (sian 1/2) and she was co-habiting with her ex-bf somemore until they broke up some time ago. (sian 1/2 to the power of infinity, where can i find a voodoo doll of that guy?)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If say love her shouldnt mind and should accept her past, what over is over, what is important is the future. Haha, mai talk cock. Many pple mouth is say like that, but how many is really can 100% dont mind one?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Not that i am gracious enough to accept wife / gf is no longer virgin loh. But what can i do? I wish to get married le and I am not getting any younger ler wor. Right loh, there is Not a Damn Thing i can about it.</p>

              <p>I thought about this topic long and hard.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think the reason why we ask this question is because we are Asians after all. We still have a lingering culture based very much of moral values.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I myself am brought up from a traditional family. Back in primary school, we were taught moral eduation (å¥½å…¬æ°‘) on how to really be a good citizen, a decent person, a responsible gentleman.. I was among the top 5 of my class back then, so i strived hard to set an example of a positive image. So with all these values infused in me, I naturally grew up to be a very decent person, follow rules, join the queue, wait my turn, dont drink, dont smoke, dont take advantage of pple ..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now a decade later everything has changed. Any moral values are practically non-existant in this society. There is virtually no more social responsibility from people. I dun even know if they teach moral education in school these days. But right now, all those moral values I've learnt lead me to a dilemma, rather than it is a clear cut of right and wrong.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I got some friends who always change gfs and anyhow sleep around. IMHO they are really scums of the earth and i pray that they will get HIV someday and die a long agonzing death. That said, these bastards would mock at pple like me say why I dont go flirt around with women and sleep with them whenever I get the chance. They will laugh and say : 'Sure you cling on to your moral values, but you will lose a lot in life and live to regret it when you are old'.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Are they really right? I felt myself even questioning those moral values I had been taught all these years. What exactly have they benefited me with? Nowadays u nice and courteous to pple, pple cut your queue, take yr seat, rob your credits and push responsibility and blame to you. So now i really zek tao give these selfish assholes a piece of my mind when they dare cross my path. But ask me to turn into a creep like them and anyhow screw around? How can... I cant bring myself to do that one leh.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sometimes i think the real decent pple have to suffer now due to the actions of those immoral, miserable excuses for human beings. Dont you think so?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Right now I've known a girl and we are already talking about marriage. But yeah you guessed it, she is not a virgin any longer, (sian 1/2) and she was co-habiting with her ex-bf somemore until they broke up some time ago. (sian 1/2 to the power of infinity, where can i find a voodoo doll of that guy?)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If say love her shouldnt mind and should accept her past, what over is over, what is important is the future. Haha, mai talk cock. Many pple mouth is say like that, but how many is really can 100% dont mind one?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Not that i am gracious enough to accept wife / gf is no longer virgin loh. But what can i do? I wish to get married le and I am not getting any younger ler wor. Right loh, there is Not a Damn Thing i can about it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Like we go army we sing, We Lan Lan Have to Serve, Have to serve ... yahhh ~~</p>

              <p>I guess i will rather still pick my gf because her heart and her soul are pure regardless, as compared to someone who claims to be pure but carries a tainted soul and a corrupted mind.</p>

              Even if gt gf must wait until marry le then can have sex.
              
              U know why I am confident of guarding ym virginity even if I gt gf.
              
              I am very shy. I will blush when talking to opposite gender.
              
              Shy ppl wont tend to have sex easily.
