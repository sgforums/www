Please help me, i really don't want to make a silly decision and regret for the rest of my life. I really love her a lot.</div></blockquote>It's not advisable to celebrate monthly anniversary. Give her some space.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>have a heart to heart talk with her. tell her how u really feel, why are you feeling this way, what you hope that she can do for you, basically just tell her EVERYTHING, don't hide a single thing in you.<br><br>then, see how she reply. if she loves you, and treat you as her boyfriend, she'll understand your pridicament. find out from her what she thinks of whatever you told her, why is she treating you like this etc etc.<br><br>if she say she'll try to change, give her some time.<br><br>if she still give you the same "you're just being oversensitive" answer, then the best way is to just give her up. she's not your type of girl. you're those kind that wants to see her as much as you can, but she's not like this; she can do perfectly well without you.<br><br>find someone else who needs you as much as you need her.<br><br>don't give up a forest because of a flower.</div>

How old are you? I suspect she might be too young to hold a good chance at being mature and appreciative for this relationship. If she's not, probably she's just into a 'being pampered' mode.
