            <div class='col-md body'>sounds exactly like my predicament now.<br><br>well, just remember this: never treat ur gf more important then everything else.<br><br>that was where i went wrong.<br><br>its not wrong to love wholeheartedly, but sometimes the girl is either to immature or too spoilt to realise that ur doing this for her, not because u have to, but rather because you want to, because you love her.<br><br>for now, tell her how you feel. most likely she'll give u comments that don't help, e.g Not happy then don't talk, etc. but rmb, communication is the key. don't give up now, its been so long<br><br>if both of you need time alone, there's always friends and family, who will always be by your side. just rmb, if she doesn't appreciate this, sometimes it takes alot more courage to just end your suffering.<br><br>she may not be the one, yes, but don't stop loving her. just try your best to salvage this relationship. take it a step at a time. its hard to change a person's personality, but do it for your own sake. no point in a one sided relationship, you deserve to be loved too<br><br>take care, and all the best, brother</div>

I remember every month of our anniversary, ..........<br>..........<br>But now i feel that i'm tire, i'm tire of keep trying but she just don't do anything. .............<br>I really can't bear to give up this relationship but i really don't want this loop sided love to carry on.. Please help me, i really don't want to make a silly decision and regret for the rest of my life. I really love her a lot.</div></blockquote>It sounds to me that you are over-doing love. No two individuals are identical, have the same needs, outlook, temperament, drive, desire, etc. Age difference plays a small part. It is the personality, maturity, and a lot of mutual accomodation.<br>I really wonder how you do anniversary every month ..... and your doing everything for her is not her asking. Unless she is an invalid or handicapped, you should allow her to do her own things, plan get-togethers, etc. If she couldn't be bothered now, she wouldn't be bothered later or in whatever future life the two of you may get into. Don't kid yourself, human nature takes a long long time to change. Better to find the right fit then to hope for change. Many foolishly think that people can change or will change when they get married, etc. The change is seldom for the better, usually for the worse. This sounds pessimistic but it is reality that many are embarassed to admit.  Who would ever admit to their family, relatives and friends that they married a dude?<br>Try to go slow a little, talk a little more. If she can't see your point and you can't see hers - then better to call it quit. I never advocate hanging on just because one is afraid to lose love.<br>You are tired. Take a break. Kick whatever bad habits you have. And remember this: one-sided love is unrequited love. You will always feel being lopped. And whatever you choose to do, there will always be an element of regret.</div>

More often than not, we will probably circled a few rounds before we achieve that ideal path in love.<br><br>You are in that sort of situation: wondering what went disarray, despite giving a world to your love. Such circumstances often coerce a man like yourself into retrospection that leads to befuddlement because it makes absolutely no sense why. (It can be explained via Classic Conditioning, but I won't go length with it for now).<br><br>XenStar made an interesting point in this post - coming from similar situation - but the gist of this whole drama centred on a one notable cosmic lesson: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">[b]the need to readjust your definition of love and understand the concept of 'Moderation'.</span></strong><br><br>Too much of anything is a bad thing, therefore it goes the same for 'good behaviour'. But that doesn't mean you have to employ a negative value to balance the equation like what XenStar has advocated. Ironically in love, when you have a figure of 3 and you need to get the sum to 2, it doesn't mean minus 1 will resolve the entire issue. In theory yes, but not in reality.<br><br>II) The wide gap in chronological age poised one typical issue affecting our definition of love - phases in love and life. A woman ten years your junior is likely to view romance, love and relationship vastly different from a man like yourself.<br><br>You dated with the intent to marry and she dated with the intent for romance, and self exploration.<br><br>Love is not about looking each other; it's about looking at the same direction - the same definition of love.<br><br>Would you be able to educate your woman to share this sentiment? Or would she influence you to share hers?<br><br>Perhaps you might want to do REAL communication (not sugar-coated chats, fear-imbued talks or even not-getting-to-the-point conversation) to check out the discrepancy and decide how you are going to patch the chasm from there.<br><br>Loving her a lot is one thing - making it work is another. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers[/b]</blockquote>Wha! u very chiong hei!!! keep it short and sharp ya</div>
