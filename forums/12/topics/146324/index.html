            <div class='col-md body'>To start with, I think u current generation of young people have changed from what  i notice it is not the olden times any more in the 80s. Girls tend to look at a guy's economic situation before falling in love is the current complaint now. to say, i dont agree on this fullheartedly nor disagree. it had existed since the days of the merdeka but was not widespread because the society was different back then. In my time, people were rather simplistic in thinking. A few with different ideas made it big.<br><br>U have enjoyed the fruits of labour your forefathers who helped shape up singapore.  I can understand the current economic climate but do not let it induce a paradigm shift- a change from one way of thinking to another. It's a revolution, a transformation, a sort of metamorphosis. It just does not happen, but rather it is driven by agents of change. There was one from the 80s to 90s. During the 80s and before people lived in kampongs and were the ones who migrated to HDB estates. At the time the thinking of te majority was to grab the opportunities of a rising Singapore. Everyone had equal chances. During the kampong days , people were not so well to do and as a result ties with friends and relatives were stronger. But we also had problems in society like drug addiction among youths and gangsterism. In those days u could survive with O levels and educate your children by working as a taxi driver. We didnt have internet and most of us stayed at home. We had more chances to socialise around in the correct way unlike now where socialising involves clubbing and other activites. In those days entertainment meant playing soccer ,sepak takraw , watching WWF on TV  or meaningful activities inthe neighbourhood CC. A select few who chose to stray got entangled in the void deck culture secret society/KTV trends. They were very active in those days.<br><br>Somehow in the 90s people tend to think differently. Thats the golden decade when more and more singaporeans became richer  quicker, became more fashionable and old ideas were dying out. Remember the property boom in the mid 90s? Selling of HDB flats can land u as much as 50K in the bank account. More people started driving cars and quality of life had improved dramatically especially in the early 90s. The clubbing and corporate scene was vibrantly emerging. By the mid to late 90s most people could afford to go to tertiary education. the mass introduction of the personal computer and the internet  during this period have impacted both personal and business environments, and is a catalyst for the next  Paradigm Shift in the  millenium .But along comes with the paradigm shift some first signs of mild negative effects<br><br>It was also during this time that economy started to come into problems. After the 2000 things changed to what u find in the current time now. I dont know<br>why this happened or why the Singapore government had changed. gone were those days when Mps would walk with residents. What i see now from some websites where singaporeans air their views, there is widespread discontentment and resentment towards the governtment particularly among males. But it is good to know that people now are more open minded unlike before. this is the paradigm shift that u wish to see but not the expense of love and moral values.  But as always have faith, love  and conviction always in your hearts and importantly be truthful to yourself and others around u.<br><br>John<br>San Francisco, USA</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Do not let the illusion of the internet fool you. Most people who whine about the govt on internet are losers themselves who have no other avenue to voice thier discontent except on the internet or they are young rebellious teenagers who listen to the so called internet discussions that they try to form their own agenda against the society. Fortunately they only form a minority of the society. Life is very simple in singapore. Work hard, yr life will enjoy its fruits. Dun work hard, then you have only yrself to blame. Just because u sucks at monopoly, dun blame the rules of the game but rather yrself for not understanding the rules.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am a PR here since 1983. Now in my late 20s . But i dont think life in singapore is simple now like love_story said it was better in the 80s and 90s<br><br>if u been to to other countries , life is more cosy and simple. I travel a lot due to my dad's business. As far as my dad is concerned , he thinks it is better to stay overseas for now. I think  Love_story is a 36 year old who migrated out of singapore in another thread.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Accordng to me the difference between the current generation and the passt is that nowadays young people are not in tune with the economic culture. They prefer to take a narrow minded approach.<br>Back in the 90s if u notice we had mild form of wall street culture in Singapore. pople trading in shares, property market or other ways and landing fast money.The economic factors of the time were different and more fair giving equal chances to every man , even the common man living HDB. If u knew how to play the cards right, u could have accumulated wealth. And there are people if i can recall that CPF loophole thing where u can actually draw out the cash.  We had real "business"people back then.</div>
