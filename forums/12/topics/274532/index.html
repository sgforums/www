Worse, I feel the love slipping away. She's a nice girl, but I just can't bring myself to throw everything into the r/s again. Basically, now, I dun care as much, but she's really doing all she can to keep the r/s up and really doesn't want a break up.

Funny, but we're both worried that if there's a seperation, there might be no way back even if we wanted to. I brought this up just last night over the phone to her...got us nowhere.

            <div class='col-md body'>I think it is because of the distance between you? How often do you meet with her? Love without physical touch every now and then(hugs, kisses, the feeling of knowing she can be there physically when you need her) will cause a drift between the couple, even though this might sound shallow to some, but it is true.<br><br>Or it can also be caused by the fact that you have been with her for quite a while now, I think every couple will go through the period when the love settles and the initial passion fades away. I remember one of the quotes I read somewhere, If you want to stay for a long while with someone, you just need to keep falling in love with that person over and over again.<br><br>Now that she is willing to change, I think just give her a chance and see how it goes for a while. Try to do some things together, try out some new activities to bring the spark back and to remind yourself why you have fallen in love with her in the first place <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> If all else fails, if you really can't see her as being the one for you, do let her know as soon as possible, in the gentlest way...</div>

How often do you meet with her? Love without physical touch every now and then(hugs, kisses, the feeling of knowing she can be there physically when you need her) will cause a drift between the couple, even though this might sound shallow to some, but it is true.<br><br>Or it can also be caused by the fact that you have been with her for quite a while now, I think every couple will go through the period when the love settles and the initial passion fades away. I remember one of the quotes I read somewhere, If you want to stay for a long while with someone, you just need to keep falling in love with that person over and over again.<br><br>Now that she is willing to change, I think just give her a chance and see how it goes for a while. Try to do some things together, try out some new activities to bring the spark back and to remind yourself why you have fallen in love with her in the first place <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> If all else fails, if you really can't see her as being the one for you, do let her know as soon as possible, in the gentlest way...</div></blockquote>I don't know if it's the distance. I call her everyday, and when I'm back in Sg, a good deal of my time is spent with her. I'm just beginning to worry that the reason I'm feeling this is because the love has gone and I didn't realise it.<br><br>That I spend time with her and call her because she wants me to and it's become a mechanical habit. I mean, it's not that I'm being cruel now that she wants to change, but I don't know if I can change to accept that she has changed. I know it doesn't make much sense, but I don't wanna lead her on if there isn't much chance of the r/s still surviving.</div>

Or the thought of that has become intolerable?<br><br>I am thinking that maybe you are tired of her old ways, and when she said she wants to change, you are not sure how successful she would be at that. When she showed you her bad side (when both of you quarreled, you have started to become unsure of being with her...you feel as if an ideal image that you have of her has been smashed?</div>

The question is, are you willing to overlook her weaknesses, and emphasises on her strengths?<br><br>If everything seems like a chore, it's because you are tired of giving in (refusing to argue or say anything that leads to a quarrel). In a healthy r/s, you want to be heard, but not put down.<br><br>Maybe a good way is to sit down and have a heart-to-heart talk with her. No excessive finger-pointing though. The 10min rule may work here. Basically each of u sit down and talk for 10min about what you like, don't like about the situation, and NO interruption from either side.<br><br>Try it.<br><br>You sound like a good guy, when you say you don't want to mislead her.<br><br>Hope everything works out well for you.<br></div>
