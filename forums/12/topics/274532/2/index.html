            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, one can run out of love for someone when they give out too much and receive nothing in return. You are worn out.<br><br>Your gf was taking you for granted and didn't appreciate you and your effort. She has bleed you dry until you are at the point of no return.<br><br>If you know deep down you are not that in love with your gf anymore make a clean break don't drag on. By dragging on is giving her false hope that she might have a chance to save this relationship. And I think seriously deep down you know she is not really suitable for you. Break it completely or else your short-term agony of now will turn into big agony in the future should you get into another forumner situation 'Frustrated' where the wife kept threatening to divorce when a quarrel erupted. DON'T LET THAT HAPPEN TO YOU!!!<br><br></div>

So much so that right now, your inner self is asking if you should continue your gamble because you can now opt to exit safely, since clarify has returned to you.<br><br>It's very much an innate fear; asking you to accept her whole heartedly once again with more 'investments'. This is a blatant reminder of the pain you went through previously. Most people are fine with not winning or scoring victories, for as long as they can avoid disappointments and failures.<br><br>Once you have cleared your spiritual debts (via a karmic relationship); through our higher consciousness, there's often little meaning to remain anymore and we feel the need to 'graduate' from our circumstances. Graduation doesn't necessary means departure - it could also mean shedding the old skin of your relationship by breathing a new life and renew the entire structure of your love.<br><br>Your always have the freewill to decide the outcome of your relationship.

Worse, I feel the love slipping away. She's a nice girl, but I just can't bring myself to throw everything into the r/s again. Basically, now, I dun care as much, but she's really doing all she can to keep the r/s up and really doesn't want a break up. I'm really afraid that I might just have run out of love for her.<br><br>Guess I just wanna hear ur views on this. </div></blockquote>IF you feel that you don't love her anymore and your love for her is fading away, tell her.<br><br>IF you feel that you still love her a fair bit whenever you think of living your life without her, tell her.<br><br>IF you feel that she might be using you as a temporary buffer before she finds another guy whom she likes, tell her.<br><br>IF you feel that you cannot imagine a future together with her in it, tell her.<br><br>IF you feel that she's trying to love you and not really loving you and you feel dumb and stupid just living your relationship this way everyday, tell her.<br><br>IF you feel that you're trying to appreciate her efforts to salvage this relationship and you feel trapped by her, tell her.<br><br>If you feel you're unable to leave this relationship even though you know that you want to leave this relationship but for GOD knows reasons...you can't do so, tell her.<br><br>Whatever you feel, whether it is the truth or your own illusions or your imaginations....believed in what you feel cos they are derived from all your five senses + your brain....and those feelings cannot be wronged. You need to tell her the truth about what you're experiencing and feeling and troubling you.<br><br>Just tell her, cos whatever happens...you still get to keep a piece of yourself even if the whole situation shatters.<br><br>Good Luck...and it's true that you can run out of love for someone, cos mine just did and I realised that I'm not good enough to love and Love is going to kill me eventually if I do not accept my destiny.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My pity fren,<br><br>At least u n her been together for 2 years.. me only 5 months...<br><br>And i got tired too giving too much... and seems she's more to infatuation to me than pure love.. shes broke up with me cuz she need to futher her studies overseas..<br><br>i know she might be practical bout possibility of LD r/s but i trust myself n her can still love each other . but she doesnt thk so... i guess i really love her but she dont feel the same to me..<br><br>At least your gf is trying her best now.. she is aware of situation whn you did your best.. she now appreciate it .. if she really wan to change.. why dun u give her a chance... your feeling of not caring her anymore is probably ur already tired of giving too much and now u dun expect anything from her again . Its normal..<br><br>Dun break 1st.. just give her a chance... later your love to her will bloom again.. Just think back how much u love her that time, and now she realised she cant live without you,, i think she noticed how different u treated her now, so she realised that shes been taking thigns for granted and treated you bad...<br><br>Think bout this.. if she really dont love you, u both would have break up..<br><br>Just like my condition.. 5 months of giving nothing..and shes like treating me a stranger .. firstly , very sweeet, then treated me like a stranger... sigh only me know this feeling<br><br>IM worse than you, why dun give some chance to her and see how things go..<br><br>At least this proves that she loves you too instead of infatuation ? her action speaks louder isnt it?<br><br>but my advice just observe how things go 1st..<br><br>Mayb she needs your money ? mayb she just need company instead of love?</div>
