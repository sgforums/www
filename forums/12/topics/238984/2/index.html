(i dun get it..)<br><br>and recently her frens keep asking me if i like her (and this is the most bugging part). and when 3 of us conference, her friend would just directly ask if i like her. i dunno how to response. and guess what. i was being retarded and i just kept quiet on the phone. like as if i wasn't there....<br><br>keep denying very tough leh...<br><br><span style="color: red;">actually it's quite obvious that i like her n stuff because i alrdy gave a v-day present. PLUS i msg her good night msg every night n sometimes i will take the initiative to call her. whenever her friends tease her or tells her that it's quite obv that i like her, she wouldn't admit it and always complain to me that her frens are talking crap...<br><br>the reason y i keep denying is because i dun think she's ready for a r/s mainly. and....im scared of losing this frenship. u know nowadays...r/s come n go very quickly. like 2 months n boom, nomore. or at most a year or smth.</span><br><br>i dun mind waiting or just stalling or remainding in this "state of courtship" for very very long. is there a problem with going very slowly? because i feel that her friends are already like rushing an ans out of me n claiming tt "she is helping us to get together"...<br><br>im confused..<br><br>and denying has become very very xin ku for me.</div></blockquote>Scared yet do things to lead people on.<br><br>You may think you're matured enough and can 'reason'.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"> When you're confused, it simply tells that you're not able to handle it.<br>You don't have to be too concerned about her, you should be worried about yourself.<br><br>People let you eat, you don't eat.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> Give all kinds of reason, denying and drag on.<br><br>Hai.
