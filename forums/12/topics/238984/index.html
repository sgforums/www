Show much care and interest but need not be pushy... Go mild but don't back down... Of course... You'll need to be mentally prepared to face some of the incoming obstacles if you are to bring this relationship slowly to the next level..? The 1st would likely to be her parents.... The 2nd would be to help her cross the phobia and mental blocks... (if she's really interested in you lah.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> ).....

            <div class='col-md body'>She's definitely too young for a steady relationship. It really might be just a crush or puppy love that you have for her.<br><br>Whatever it is, make sure you think it properly through and discuss with her if she's also interested in going steady with you.<br><br>You are just at the age where many confuse or mistake certain feelings as "love". Things will be very different when you become bf/gf.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sorry to sound bad but there're many factors that the relationship (if you do get into it) will not last.<br><br>1) She's too young<br>2) You just knew each other for 2 months?<br>3) It could be just your raging male hormones at work.<br><br>At 16-17, it's common for many to want to "experiment" with BGR.

            <div class='col-md body'>lol . take it slowly man . the main problem i see here is the part about her friends . talk to them . tell them they should stop asking all those qtns in front of both of you . explain to them if they really mean the best for her , they should just stop at it and not create pressure on the both of you .<br><br>as for her , why not try talking to her . let her know your feelings for her , and try to know what she's thinking about . respect her decision , and let her know you understand . if she doesnt want to go into a r/s , accept it and move on . if it's meant to be , the both of will get together eventually yea .</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>omg i just read the age part . she's so young ! -.- why are you interested in such a young girl in the first place . okay nvm that . but i really feel that she's too young for a r/s . if you really mean good for her , then you should really stay by her as a friend and be there for her . at her age now it's easy to get cheated by boys =\<br><br>at least wait until she's abit older before considering about a r/s alright . she should be focusing on her studies at 12 . PSLE year you know . =\</div>
