            <div class='col-md body'>Hello to all. This is my first post. Hope some one can help me with my problems.<br>I am a guy. Age range between 18-22. My gf is one year younger than me.<br>My problem is that we are having frequent quarrels. She is very hot tempered person. Other than that she is very nice person.<br>I have done my best by tolerating her even to the point where i feel i get humiliated in front of strangers; as in she scold me in front of them or show me cold face in front of the strangers...so meaning the strangers all know that we are having an arguement etc. I spend all my time with her. Buy her alot of stuff whenever i got the money. She also do likewise. Send her home everyday without fail. Sometimes starve myself because we quarrel or because i got no money to eat after spending all my money on the bus fare to send her home. My gf does not know about this "starving" issue. I always am very concerned about her. Always remind her that i am there for her always even if she fails in somethings that she do.<br>But i feel she take me for granted. Always dun care about my feelings. Always whenever she angry she hurt me alot. Dun talk to me etc. I feel very heartbreaken. Our relationship turns 6 months old today.<br>Yesterday she received her result for a paper where she expected to score more than 90 marks. In the end she got disappointed but still got an A grade. She feel very unhappy cause she aim high always but score low. As for me, i aim low but score high. She feels that she put in alot of effort to study but then the results dun reflect her efforts. After the results, she cry and i go to her house to console her. She tell me she duwan see me etc. So after awhile i left the house very sad.<br>When i reach home, after some time at night she sms me saying that TODAY she going to her fren house to play games. I was thinking "today our 6th month and every month u celebrate with me. now just because of a result you want to go fren house". i then thought never mind, let her go as it might cheer her up. Then today when she came to school she told me that she not going to her friend house. So i happy thought that she will spend the day with me. Unfortunately, after school she want to go home. I ask her if she wants to go out later in the day but she declined. I feel so hurt man. She can go play games with her friend even when she feels low.. but cant go out with me. Really feel very heartbroken.<br>Where did i go wrong?<br><br>GALS: if u were my gf shoes, would u rather i leave u alone since u got disappointed with ut results?<br>Also what is the meaning of u going over to you rfriend house but cant go out with me?<br>Also will you people celebrate every month/ year togerther with your stead?<br>I feel so sad.... dunno why i feel like i am being taken for granted. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>

As a couple, being together is secondary - looking at the same direction is primary. If you expect certain improvements (the 6 months anniversary, etc) or some points from her, do communicate and TELL her instead of thinking that she will know what you want. Not everyone couple is imbued with couple's telepathy (known as Xing ling xiang tong in Mandarin), so don't assume.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You have been very compromising - to a fault. Its important to compromise in a relationship, however, do you know feelings must be exchange and be understood? Whats the use of showing someone how much you love her, but she don't even realise and appreciate? You have to tell her all these - not as in how 'great' you are treating her, but as in to let her know, you do love her and thats why you all doing all this.<br><br>When she score lower marks for her test, in any aspect it totally crazy to vent her anger on you. You feel hurt everytime she does that, don't talk to you over small mundane stuff - TELL HER. Next time before you even question her about her result - ask her if she needs the time to be alone, if yes, then let her be alone for a moment in school, with her friends, etc. Anyway, you would be there for her if she needed you - I believe you will.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>The problems lies within you actually. Its not that you want her to change for your sake , etc - but rather you want her to improve and make this relationship better. Many a times when guys/girls get too compromising, this relation start to waver because they themselves are blind to their own faults.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Originally posted by heartbreaken:<br><br>]Hello to all. This is my first post. Hope some one can help me with my problems.<br>I am a guy. Age range between 18-22. My gf is one year younger than me.<br>My problem is that we are having frequent quarrels. She is very hot tempered person. Other than that she is very nice person.<br>I have done my best by tolerating her even to the point where i feel i get humiliated in front of strangers; as in she scold me in front of them or show me cold face in front of the strangers...so meaning the strangers all know that we are having an arguement etc.<br><br>I spend all my time with her. Buy her alot of stuff whenever i got the money. She also do likewise. Send her home everyday without fail. Sometimes starve myself because we quarrel or because i got no money to eat after spending all my money on the bus fare to send her home. My gf does not know about this "starving" issue. I<br><br>always am very concerned about her. Always remind her that i am there for her always even if she fails in somethings that she do.<br>But i feel she take me for granted. Always dun care about my feelings. Always whenever she angry she hurt me alot. Dun talk to me etc. I feel very heartbreaken. Our relationship turns 6 months old today.<br><br>Yesterday she received her result for a paper where she expected to score more than 90 marks. In the end she got disappointed but still got an A grade. She feel very unhappy cause she aim high always but score low. As for me, i aim low but score high. She feels that she put in alot of effort to study but then the results dun reflect her efforts. After the results, she cry and i go to her house to console her. She tell me she duwan see me etc. So after awhile i left the house very sad.<br><br>When i reach home, after some time at night she sms me saying that TODAY she going to her fren house to play games. I was thinking "today our 6th month and every month u celebrate with me. now just because of a result you want to go fren house". i then thought never mind, let her go as it might cheer her up.<br><br>Then today when she came to school she told me that she not going to her friend house. So i happy thought that she will spend the day with me. Unfortunately, after school she want to go home. I ask her if she wants to go out later in the day but she declined. I feel so hurt man. She can go play games with her friend even when she feels low.. but cant go out with me. Really feel very heartbroken.<br>Where did i go wrong?</strong><br><br>brudder, your gf also quite problematic one ah..<br>thnik if you really love her, the take up the courage,<br>get her to have a serious heart to heart talk.<br>whenever me and my gf quarrel we also do that.<br>ask her why she's doing this to you,<br>let her know she's hurting you so much.<br>brudder, my heart goes out to you...<br>my previous gf also like your gf, anyhow scold me on the street one.<br><br><strong>GALS: if u were my gf shoes, would u rather i leave u alone since u got disappointed with ut results?<br>Also what is the meaning of u going over to you rfriend house but cant go out with me?<br>Also will you people celebrate every month/ year togerther with your stead?<br>I feel so sad.... dunno why i feel like i am being taken for granted. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> </strong><br><br>brudder, communication brudder.<br>talk to her. make her talk...<br>but dun be too aggresive.<br>take care brudder...</div>
