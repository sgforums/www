            <div class='col-md body'>i have a bf and we have been together for going to be a year. he's 19 and im 17. But i still cant forget the fact that he lost his first time to his ex when he's 16. It was only after we stead for a few mths that he told me that he have had sex once with his ex<br><br>I cant accept the fact at first. It was a terrible torture for me. In my mind I cant forget it. I keep thinking about it. Its really mentally torture. It been about 6 mths since he told me the news and im still trapped by it. Although im slowly accepting it now, but whenever i saw the words sex or anything relating to sexually intercourse, i will start thinking about it again.<br><br>Can anyone tell me what can I do pls? I have tried telling myself that its all in the past but up till now I am still troubled by it. The reason that I dont wanna break off with him is because I feel that its not fair to him if I do that.<br><br>by the way, he is my first bf. And how do u all define virginity for guys?<br>he said he and his ex only did it halfway because he was scared.  Does it counted that a guy already lost his virginity the moment he put his "thing" in?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Trapped:</div><div class="quote_body">i have a bf and we have been together for going to be a year. he's 19 and im 17. But i still cant forget the fact that he lost his first time to his ex when he's 16. It was only after we stead for a few mths that he told me that he have had sex once with his ex<br><br>I cant accept the fact at first. It was a terrible torture for me. In my mind I cant forget it. I keep thinking about it. Its really mentally torture. It been about 6 mths since he told me the news and im still trapped by it. Although im slowly accepting it now, but whenever i saw the words sex or anything relating to sexually intercourse, i will start thinking about it again.<br><br>Can anyone tell me what can I do pls? I have tried telling myself that its all in the past but up till now I am still troubled by it. The reason that I dont wanna break off with him is because I feel that its not fair to him if I do that.<br><br>by the way, he is my first bf. And how do u all define virginity for guys?<br>he said he and his ex only did it halfway because he was scared.  Does it counted that a guy already lost his virginity the moment he put his "thing" in?</div></blockquote>Hey trapped, at the age of 16, i think it's most prob due to 'fun' or some peer pressure thingy. But it's all in the past already, do u really mind about this guy's virginity or how much he loves u now. Is he really serious into this relationship or is he still in his play mode. It's really something u should look into. If he's really serious, i think u should at least give him some chance, even an ex-convict gets his/her chance. And yeah, try not to get involved sexually with him at this stage, it's not safe. Wait till u are engaged or married to that guy. This kind of thing is really a prob to both sexes..</div>

As long as he did it with his exs..and not some prostitutes or whatever girls he noe in pubs?  At least, did it with the one he loves?  Well, it might not be the truth..but still..honestly, if you can't accept it at all..whether it is the truth or not doesn't matter..you still can't accept.</div>
