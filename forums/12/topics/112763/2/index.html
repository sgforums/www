He's SCARE of YOU. WAKE UP. If you CAN'T ACCEPT him, have BETTER LUCK finding a VIRGIN BOY. The WAY YOU'RE GOING, it probably WON'T BE A LONG HAPPY RELATIONSHIP even if both of you are TOGETHER.</div>

But i still cant forget the fact that he lost his first time to his ex when he's 16. It was only after we stead for a few mths that he told me that he have had sex once with his ex<br><br>I cant accept the fact at first. It was a terrible torture for me. In my mind I cant forget it. I keep thinking about it. Its really mentally torture. It been about 6 mths since he told me the news and im still trapped by it. Although im slowly accepting it now, but whenever i saw the words sex or anything relating to sexually intercourse, i will start thinking about it again.<br><br>Can anyone tell me what can I do pls? I have tried telling myself that its all in the past but up till now I am still troubled by it. The reason that I dont wanna break off with him is because I feel that its not fair to him if I do that.<br><br>by the way, he is my first bf. And how do u all define virginity for guys?<br>he said he and his ex only did it halfway because he was scared.  Does it counted that a guy already lost his virginity the moment he put his "thing" in?</div></blockquote>i think your bf decide to tell you because he dont wan to keep it from you, he wan to be true to you. It better to let him tell you now then let you find out yourself, maybe that time you will be more hurt.  What is past already past.. no point keep on thinking about that, what the most impt is .. how he treat you now.  I think is not reali fair if you decide to break off with him jus becos of this. Give yourself sometimes.. try to spend more times with him.. maybe you will find out more of his gd points and forget abt he having sex with his ex before.</div>
