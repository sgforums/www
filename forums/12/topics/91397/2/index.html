I kept bumping into both of them... it has come to a stage that even when we bump into each other, we pretend that we are strangers.... sometimes I wonder... how on earth things became this bad....<br><br>Anyway, I'm happy with my current life.. and I hope all the best for my ex-bf....<br></div></blockquote>good thing u found out what kinda guy he is...</div>
