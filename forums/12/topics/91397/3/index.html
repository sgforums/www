I've came to realise that some things would just appear at the unexpected moment. SO DUN FRET! I've sort of stopped "FINDING LOVE". heee... Coz I guess if someone's mine, he'll be mine. I'm just waiting for that unexpected moment to occur. You will too... heee... no harm continuing your little dreams as long as you don't pin too much hopes on someone that you think MIGHT be THE ONE.
