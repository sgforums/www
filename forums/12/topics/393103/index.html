              <p>Its been more than a year since my ex and I broke up but till now, I would say that I havent gotten over him. Although I'm able to live life without him, I still think about him everyday, and wondering how I could have made things better for the both of us. Right now...My ex is pretty sad because he got dumped by his ex-gf (the girl after me). It breaks my heart to see him this sad and I feel like cheering him up. But then again...I dont know if I will be making the right choice. I dont deny that I wouldnt mind forgetting the past and starting afresh again with him if there's a chance but I also know that he's very much over me already.  </p>

              <p>If u have nothing to share of u - don't bother lah, cos if u do know that there is a motive n as to what it is (motive or ...) only u are privy to your emotions and thoughts.</p>
              <p>Having said that, introspection is an utter waste of energy. Playing or chewing on the ghosts of the past (euphemized by  many  as memories/sentiments) is merely ''real'' in the head. That is all there is to it, meanwhile what is rite <strong>in front</strong> is unappreciated or at most an adulterated expereince.</p>

              <p>Its been more than a year since my ex and I broke up but till now, I would say that I havent gotten over him. Although I'm able to live life without him, I still think about him everyday, and wondering how I could have made things better for the both of us. Right now...My ex is pretty sad because he got dumped by his ex-gf (the girl after me). It breaks my heart to see him this sad and I feel like cheering him up. But then again...I dont know if I will be making the right choice. I dont deny that I wouldnt mind forgetting the past and starting afresh again with him if there's a chance but I also know that he's very much over me already.  </p>
              <p>Any advices? Should I or should I not? :/ </p>

              <p>I suggest u move on..no point going back to the same person..there are so many potentials out there..just go out have fun, date as many guys, get into many relationships (but never sexually)..after all, dating and relationship is about being happy and having fun..</p>
              <p>Showing concern for him is great..it shows that u are magnanimous and not petty but starting afresh again will make one guy feel like "wow i must be pretty something to make her still wanna come back to me, so screw it, however i treat her, she'll still come back to me" kinda attitude = not showing respect and taken for granted to an individual, which will result in u getting hurt in the end. Like u said he dumped u, and if ur to get back to him, he'll prolly dump u again for the same reason he dumped u a year ago someday.</p>
