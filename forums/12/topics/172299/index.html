            <div class='col-md body'>ya noe man...girls are really complicated people...but one thing i am sure...it is that they are emotional people too...<br><br>most probably...the girl just wanted an emotional pillar to stand by her when her boyfriend is not around..be it physically or mentally...like you said...her boyfriend tend to ignore her and just carry on with his gaming...and since her boyfriend is serving ns...most probably she will get lonely on weekdays...she will need someone to talk to...thats when she thought about you...<br><br>my guess is she lacks a sense of security right now...really...thats what alot of girls go through when their boyfriend is serving the nation...now u noe why got so many girl like to "bing bian" ? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>on her part...she chose you because you were once her emotional pillar...thats why she thought about you...and bringing up past issue can only mean one thing...she is lacking in an emotional pillar...she is insecure...she wants someone to give her that emotional security...its not love i am afraid... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>on your part...you must have thought that love has rekindled...its perfectly normal for you to think that...simply because you have not had anyone to love since her right? you just need someone to love...and the someone you once loved is her...naturally you wanna love her again...am i right? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>i think what you can do is to maybe just keep on being her friend...and nothing more...you have to keep reminding yourself...you are no longer her boyfriend...you cannot do things that normal friends don't do...it won't be fair to the boyfriend...<br><strong>BE A GENTLEMEN...</strong><br><br>but on the bright side buddy...you can continue to be her friend...which is the door to many opportunities...when she once again find that you are the sweetest guy on earth...she will automatically fall in love with you...and when that happens...dun let the chance slip away again okie?<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

You think you love and care for her more than her boyfriend so she will be attracted to you more?<br><br>Sounds logical but thatÂ’s not how it works.<br><br>She said her boyfriend plays games and donÂ’t really care about her.

She may need you to 'do' something before she could leap ships (Relationship).<br><br>Regardless of either side, you have failed in your previous lesson and will serve to face the reiterated consequences.

I totally understand how you feel. Although in my case, my ex was more passive. I know she has feelings for me, but she just isnt willing to leave her bf. Like you, i dont have the money to compete with him, another thing is time. Now he's serving police ns, he can spend all the time he have with her (she works long hrs), while i have to carry on my internship till march.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>it's obviously she's fcuk-up. if you seriously want her, make use of the vulnerable position she is in - break-up their relationship, then thrust yourself inside her life. a woman's insecurity is the best weapon. she also invest quite a lot of trust in you, so I reckon you are in a very good position to achieve what you want.<br><br>It is very easy to trace her boyfriend, especially when he's in BMT. All you need to know is his company (coy) and platoon. I am sure you can syphon this information from her easily. You can extract more personal information on him if you know NSF admin clerks who are based on Pulau Tekong, eg. address, NRIC, blood type, academic records, etc.<br><br>What better way is to start a rumour in his platoon about you and his gf? If he's the jealous sort who is unable to accompany her when she needs him, his jealousy will fuel his rage and his inability to meet up with her will only compound his anger.. He can destroy himself and his relationship. All he needs is a catalyst.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hiyahs.<br><br>In the circumstances your facing, its actually one simple yet sophiscated problem.<br><br>Firstly, i see that your a sensible, considerate and devoted guy. I would recommand you to wait and see how it goes.<br><br>Who knows she might be taking you as a substitude since her current bf is in NS. If she really cant forget you in the first place, she would have contacted you long before.<br><br>You got to make sure its not just an unrequited relationship that only you is putting your love into it wheras shes simply making good use out of you.<br><br>Anyway no girls can tolerate doing such torturous chores for guys when they dont even have the slightest feeling for him.But sad to say, the girl that you love deeply is doing it for him.<br><br>Just wait patiently and you will see light one day, i assure you.<br><br>PS: im not here to flame that your girl is bad.. Im clearly stating facts.</div>
