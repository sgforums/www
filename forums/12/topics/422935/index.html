              <p>She is saying yes to what you are giving her, the attention, the conveniences and the good stuff you are trying to bait her with.</p>
              <p>BUT she is saying no to you the person.</p>
              <p>She wants to continue receiving, as long as you keep giving.</p>
              <p>Give yourself a dateline, and stick to it. By one/two weeks time, if she is still lukewarm to your advances.. it's time to let this one go.</p>

              <p>LittleMissBonkers: Pure Bitch.</p>
              <p>Acid: Guy or Gurl?</p>
              <p>2) U neva know, only trying will give u the result</p>
              <p>3) Neva know for sure. Keep her in KIV, while u approach others. So when u fail, at least u got back up plan.</p>

              <p>I'm have been pursuing a girl for the past few months. I sense that she is giving me some mixed signal, I could be wrong so I needed some help here.</p>
              <p>1) Normally if she is not interested, a girl will avoid a guy  whenever she sense that the guy is courting her. I've tried to court and did some sweet things for her and she did not avoid me but each time when I tried to ask her out she turned it down.</p>
              <p>2) Even after she turned me down for dates each time, she would still gives me "signals" like smiling at me whenever I talk to her, smiles each time when we made eye contact, walking close to me, not rejecting my calls or messages and playfully touch my arms sometimes.</p>
              <p>3) Gave her a letter during valentine's day and she thank me for the letter. Had a chat after that, she told me she felt pressurized because I was too nice to she at times and she wants me to treat her like a normal friend. </p>
              <p>So how should I approach this situation ? Do I still stand a chance or is she really not interested at all ?</p>

              <p><br>yalor, you know we gals lah, already attached but still want to seek attention, which gal dun like attention, if you gives me flowers and expensive gift, sure I want lah, even tho I got 10 bf outside, sure I smile at him, in fact, I smile at every guy and touch them too when they crack jokes, but that is our behavior and emotion, the problem is that most guys take it as serious and start to have wild dream. You dun expect me to show a sour face everyday at guy right, and sometime you may not know, some girls smile at a guy because he looks stupid and behave like a nerd.</p>
