              <div><br></div>
              <div>I met this lady,X,during one of the events held in

              <div>Then after that event,probably the whole
                  school(through rumours) knew that X was currently dating someone

              <div>Few months past and I'd developed a liking for
                  Y,another lady who is much more independent,more stunning in
                  looks(not the main point though),smart and many other good traits I
                  can think of.This is someone that I'd yearned of in my life,the

              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;"><img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif">Â You know what you want for a partner - that's highly personalized and relative. Your ideal partner probably fits this picture in your quality world, but on the reverse, others may not have the same picture of you in their quality world. (Anyway, many people would appear to be ideal... until the day they somehow get together).Â </span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">My sense is that the reason why you hold reservation towards pursing either one of these ladies is likely due to your fear of rejection. Somehow, it seemed to me that though you are 'picking the cherries' to decide who should you be with, but when your targets have shown interest elsewhere, you hastily back off and rationalize with yourself this that is 'morally wrong' - so let's move on. Â </span></p>
              <p>Let me clarify something: the desire to move on isn't wrong; it is the logic behind the usage of these quotes, masked as reasons, that are fundamentally flawed.Â </p>
              <p>There is nothing fundamentally or morally wrong with liking someone. In fact, it is almost an involuntary urge or response that one has little control over.Â <span style="line-height: 1.231;">Hence, when you claimed that you can't force anyone to like you - that's essentially correct. But it is puzzling on how you could claim this premise to be true for your situation when you haven't even started doing anything for her to even response to you in a manner where the statement is applicably true (e.g. like she has rejected you and shared that you and her are impossible).Â </span></p>
              <p>It is akin to entering a restaurant and expressing that you are not dining here because it probably looks expensive. My point is that you haven't even ask/check about the price to make any informed decision.Â <span style="line-height: 1.231;">Hence, your behavior is probably a result of intra-personal issues that you have problems to deal with (e.g insecurity, fear of rejection, etc) and not likely because of the reasons you have stated in your post.Â </span><img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="icon_exclaim.gif"></p>
              <p>***</p>
              <p><img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif">Â I find your question puzzling: who should you choose: X or Y?Â </p>
              <p>Unless you are saying that these two girls fancy you and you have a reasonable chance of entering into a relationship with either one of them - if not, I don't see why you are implicated with the 'burden' of choice.</p>
              <p>What you are probably asking is who you should consider chasing. However, if this question even pops out the way it does (and would sound a little absurd) - then the likely answer is none.</p>
              <p>I will give you an analogy: if I go to the market and buy a fish, I would choose based on its freshness and price. Then I will proceed to cook and eat it. There is no need for me to get feedback or response from the fish. There is no requirement to build rapport and develop relationship with it. It simply fulfill my survival need. I do not need to consider fulfilling the fish's needs as any attempt to fulfill the latter would automatically make me sound absolutely absurd. Likewise, love isn't going to a market place to buy fish, cook and eat it - you kind of need to get feedback, response, develop rapport and relationship and on later stage, fulfill certain mutual needs.</p>
              <p>It is not a linear relationship. Â Â </p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">In addition, there are no immediate backup plans in genuine love. Such intricate systems to formulate backup plans are purely psychological mechanism</span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Â to deal with our own deeper issues (fear of rejection, fear of loneliness, delusion, fantasy, etc).</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Perhaps you are probably more in love with the notion of having a relationship, than being in love with the figure that you mentioned. You might want to figure out if this is something you want to resolve within.Â </span><img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="icon_exclaim.gif"></p>

              <div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Yunhaier:</div>
              <div class="quote_body">
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;"><img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif">Â You know what
              you want for a partner - that's highly personalized and relative.
              Your ideal partner probably fits this picture in your quality
              world, but on the reverse, others may not have the same picture of
              you in their quality world. (Anyway, many people would appear to be
              ideal... until the day they somehow get together).Â </span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">My sense is that the reason
              why you hold reservation towards pursing either one of these ladies
              is likely due to your fear of rejection. Somehow, it seemed to me
              that though you are 'picking the cherries' to decide who should you
              be with, but when your targets have shown interest elsewhere, you
              hastily back off and rationalize with yourself this that is
              'morally wrong' - so let's move on. Â </span></p>
              <p>Let me clarify something: the desire to move on isn't wrong; it
              is the logic behind the usage of these quotes, masked as reasons,
              that are fundamentally flawed.Â </p>
              <p>There is nothing fundamentally or morally wrong with liking
              someone. In fact, it is almost an involuntary urge or response that
              one has little control over.Â <span style="line-height: 1.231;">Hence, when you claimed that you can't force
              anyone to like you - that's essentially correct. But it is puzzling
              on how you could claim this premise to be true for your situation
              when you haven't even started doing anything for her to even
              response to you in a manner where the statement is applicably true
              (e.g. like she has rejected you and shared that you and her are
              impossible).Â </span></p>
              <p>It is akin to entering a restaurant and expressing that you are
              not dining here because it probably looks expensive. My point is
              that you haven't even ask/check about the price to make any
              informed decision.Â <span style="line-height: 1.231;">Hence,
              your behavior is probably a result of intra-personal issues that
              you have problems to deal with (e.g insecurity, fear of rejection,
              etc) and not likely because of the reasons you have stated in your
              post.Â </span><img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="icon_exclaim.gif"></p>
              <p>***</p>
              <p><img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif">Â I find your
              question puzzling: who should you choose: X or Y?Â </p>
              <p>Unless you are saying that these two girls fancy you and you
              have a reasonable chance of entering into a relationship with
              either one of them - if not, I don't see why you are implicated
              with the 'burden' of choice.</p>
              <p>What you are probably asking is who you should consider chasing.
              However, if this question even pops out the way it does (and would
              sound a little absurd) - then the likely answer is none.</p>
              <p>I will give you an analogy: if I go to the market and buy a
              fish, I would choose based on its freshness and price. Then I will
              proceed to cook and eat it. There is no need for me to get feedback
              or response from the fish. There is no requirement to build rapport
              and develop relationship with it. It simply fulfill my survival
              need. I do not need to consider fulfilling the fish's needs as any
              attempt to fulfill the latter would automatically make me sound
              absolutely absurd. Likewise, love isn't going to a market place to
              buy fish, cook and eat it - you kind of need to get feedback,
              response, develop rapport and relationship and on later stage,
              fulfill certain mutual needs.</p>
              <p>It is not a linear relationship. Â Â </p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">In addition, there are no
              immediate backup plans in genuine love. Such intricate systems to
              formulate backup plans are purely psychological
              mechanism</span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Â to deal
              with our own deeper issues (fear of rejection, fear of loneliness,
              delusion, fantasy, etc).</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Perhaps you are probably more
              in love with the notion of having a relationship, than being in
              love with the figure that you mentioned. You might want to figure
              out if this is something you want to resolve
              within.Â </span><img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="icon_exclaim.gif"></p>

              <p>Totally agree...</p>
              <p>Jango, personally I feel that you have to wait till the other party reciprocate in order to "continue to like" that person.. If you already knew what kind of person you r looking as a partner, you have to work on it. To be able to express yourself appropriately about your feelings and the sincerely probably would be and aid to move her heart.. Even if things might not work out for you, you knew you did your best. Loving someone is not just you stop caring and concerning when she told you she don't feel the same way as you. If you are unsure who you really likes, probably just put the thoughts aside of who u really like and let your emotions settled down before you decide to do anything to anyone of them.Â </p>
              <p>Loving someone isn't simple. However, no one could say what you do is right and what's wrong. Follow what you think it's right.</p>
