            <div class='col-md body'>For years I have so many questions regarding life especially on the concept of Love. That was until I found sg forums and so bit by bit , I hope my questions can be answered one by one. As such , I will be posting certain questions which I hope you guys can answer or at the very least , try your very best to answer.<br><br>Okay so here comes another situation....<br><br>This happened 2 years ago when I was in sec 3....<br><br>Met this girl at some holiday camp. Kinda like "love at first sight" , got to strike up a conversation with her during camp. After camp everybody were so bonded together so much so that we had so many informal outings as a group after the camp and I so happened to be part of that group.<br><br>Well I had this thing for this girl , maybe the reason why I was kinda attracted to her was because of her great smile. I just treated her like any other friend and I did not want to tell her I liked her so soon because of the possible consequences that might arise should a thing like this happen.<br><br>On Valentine's Day last year , I decided to write a song for her (it was already 2 months after the camp). I did the entire recording in a professional recording studio with the help of my musician friends of course. The next day once the entire recording take was done , I decided to pass it to her. Obviously I was sooooooo freaking shy (puppy love AGAIN) that I kept on waiting for the right moment to pass the CD to her as I was confessing my affection for her in that disc. Actually every moment was the right moment but due to my freaked out attitude , it was of the direct contrary. I just had to pass her that disc on that day itself no matter what. Finally , I just could not take it anymore , this over nervousness just consumed me whole that I passed the disc to my friends and told them to pass it to her. Upon giving them the disc , I went home.....<br><br>From this moment on , everytime I see her , it isn't the same as before. I tend to avoid eye contact with her , stop talking to her although my heart is telling me ,"Strike up a conversation with her dammit!!!!"<br>I really wanted to do that but I just could not. It was as if something was repelling against me from striking up a conversation with her. This went on and on even till now....<br><br>Usually she is the one that strikes up the conversation with me but that is considered as "once in a blue moon". Most of the time I see her , I ignore her although once again my heart is telling me , "Go talk to her dammit!!!!" If she were to strike up a conversation with me , I would just answer in a few word sentences and smile at her...that's all.<br><br>A year later when I was in secondary 4. Basically her school is just opposite my secondary school. She comes from an all girls school while I come from an all guys school. Our schools are seperated by a bridge (some of you might already know what school I use to come from). One day it was raining cats and dogs in the early morning. The bus stop opposite my school practically crammed. I was getting a bit late for school and if I did not make a quick dash to my school , I would be late. So yeah , I made a quick dash to my school , crossing the overhead bridge first. Before I made it to the overhead bridge , I was already drenched and to make things worst , raindrops were getting into my eyes obstructing my vision. Just then as I was running the steps , I saw her on the bridge. She's a prefect in her school and her duty was to shelter the girls to school from the bridge. At that time , I decided to give up on her and cause of my shyness towards her. Then she sheltered me towards the end of the bridge and from there I dashed into my school front gate.<br><br>I was really appreciative by her act and you know lah , that same old feeling starts to come again. But just that everytime we see each other , both parties decide not to strike up a conversation.<br><br>Before that thing happened , I noticed that among the other guys we hang out with , I was the only one whom she paid most attention to. She likes to check my wallet for whatever mysterious reason , hit me when I crack a joke about her even though if my other guy pals can crack funnier jokes than me and even get a bit close to me....<br><br>Okay fashback to a week after Valentine's Day this year. There was this outdoor movie event and as usual my friends and I were just helping out that the event. Since the event was in conjunction with V day , there was this love dedication thingy at the DJ console station. You write some note for your love ones and request a song from the DJ. Your message and song would be flashed on the WIDE SCREEN. So yeah lah , my friends kinda saboed me , go put my name and her name. Then they called her and told her about it. Surprisingly , she said "Thank You" to me for "putting up that dedication". I was really taken aback by it. I mean which girl would ever say "Thank You" to a guy who puts his and her name on a love dedication list whom she has never dated or been in a relationship before? let alone even talked to her.....<br><br>I heard that whenever she bumps into my company of friends and usually I'm always not around when they bump into her in public. She keeps on asking my friends , " So how's John (NOT MY REAL NAME)?". I mean it's been 2 years since I last had a decent conversation with her and why is it she always ask about me when I'm not around?<br><br>Basically this problem has been bothering me even till now. But for 4 months or so , I managed to forget about it mainly because that was the period when I got to know my ex....<br><br>Why is it I'm so shy towards her especially after what happened in sec 4 when I passed her the disc confessing my feelings for her in a form of a song?????<br><br>I think it's about time I do something about it and I need HELP!!!!!!<br><br>I don't intend to chase her now.....I'll wait till she finishes her O levels at the end of this year before I make my move. She is in sec 5 now by the way.....<br>Which hopefully I can forget about my ex and move on.......<br><br>Cheers to those who managed to read everything word for word<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div>

A true fact is that shy guys have almost negligible fight chance against guys who take more initiative and muster their guts. In this era of competitive arena in dating, especially if your woman is a hot pick, you just have to remove the 'Oh...I am so shy... I dare not... I dare not...'<br><br>Love and let Love flow. You probably have some plans of your own - this is good. Hope everything goes according to what you had plan, but this time, use more of the inner cum hidden guts you have, but never thought you did have. Zero communication is utterly silly; there is NO chance without communication even if you got the best dating moves, the best you can reach is probably hestitation. Don't avoid talking, start somewhere small first.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Okay here comes part 2....(Which I forgot to include)<br><br>I have a friend who also has a thing for her. Apparently he developed this thing for her during the camp when I first got to know her. So in laymen terms , He started off at the same time as me. Whenever there's an outing with her in it , he's always there. His body language says it all.<br><br>I overheard my friends telling one another discretely that he confessed his love for her but she rejected him. Upon hearing this I was like , " Yeah man , the road is clear!!!!" I don't know what got into my mind so much so that I confessed my love for her through that CD which I recorded about 2 weeks later which I deeply regret doing even till this day.....<br><br>He is a friend to me although not as close as my close buddies but nonetheless I still consider and treat him as my friend. I know so well that he knows that I like her but you see , he just acts as if he does not know and me on the other hand knows that he's after her but I choose to act as if I don't know anything. It's like mind games in the making. We are on friendly terms with each other but what I fear that one day our friendship would turn sour since both of us like the same girl and I don't want that to happen.<br><br>One thing I noticed about is her is that she is very open minded. After she rejected him , she just acted as if that thing never happened and as such still hangs out with him on certain occasions.<br><br>Right up to this day , I know very well that he likes her judging by his actions. He has been on good terms with her close friends to the extent that one of her friends has even fallen for him. He sends her home on rare occasions , attends her school drama night , waits for opportunities to get a picture taken with both of them in it....<br><br>Basically to sum it all up , He's still chasing after her and still going strong after 2 years.....<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> How can I chase her "peacefully" without souring the friendship we have between him and me?<br><br>Cheers<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>"I don't know what got into my mind so much so that I confessed my love for her through that CD which I recorded about 2 weeks later which I deeply regret doing even till this day....."<br><br>1)  I believe you should not regret what you did, cos you had done your best for your love for her. I did even worst I confess to her  in public and kena slapped in return but I know in my heart I did my best and she had the right to reject me. We are still friends till now.<br><br>My point is if you want to confess to the one u love please do not regret it cos she had the right to reject you. Get ready for her rejection, learn from the guy who is able to accept her reject and try again until the day she told you in an angry tone that she never love you at all  and u do not have a chance in this life time.<br><br>"Basically this problem has been bothering me even till now. But for 4 months or so , I managed to forget about it mainly because that was the period when I got to know my ex...."<br><br>2) You can find another girl to love and she cannot have a guy who is willing to chase her ?<br><br>Your ex comes along your life and falls in love with you and you confessed your love for her and both of you were together until the day you break. How hurt will this girl be if she knew you had gone steady with your ex?<br><br>3) If you really love this girl and do wish to go after her, I suggest you sent a "do well in your studies" card or sms for the time. Support her in any way as a  friend if the girl really loves you she will be very happy in her heart. I know cos I still remember the girl I once loved and the support smses she had given me to support me in times of my exams.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>agreeing, yeah.. shyness is a very big mental block to overcome..<br><br>and since shes studying for O levels, why not use this opportunity to be closer to her? you can study the exams with her together, or help her in the preparations for the exams.. aint it a great chance?<br><br>and i dont think she may reject you, aft reading your story.. so many positive signs already.. more like waiting for you to make the first step..</div>
