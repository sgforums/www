              <p>I think u need to seek help from therapists who are properly trained. </p>
              <p>Your wife is probably having the same sentiments as u do now, but for the family she too kept her loneliness to herself.</p>
              <p><span style="-webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.296875);  ">What is lonely to you ? Why are you lonely ? How can u feel unlonely? If your wife feels lonely , how will you help her not be lonely ? </span></p>
              <p>Are u seeking someone to fill that void ? You can't rely on another person to make you whole... Or happy. You can only rely on your self.</p>
              <p>If you can't fix your self, your next relationship will end up the same as the one you tossed away. </p>
              <p>Its better to work on what you already have, than to run away and hope to find something else that cannot be broken, only to find out the new one is no better. </p>
              <p>Figure out why your current marriage is not working out. Resolve the issues , make amends, hope for the best. </p>
              <p>Give yourself plenty of time for old wounds to heal and new feelings to foster.</p>
              <p>Some times you know the answers to your questions, but you just don't wish to acknowledge it. </p>
              <p>When u are busy seeking, u are not giving. When u cannot give, u can't be receiving.</p>

I dont know if its good or bad action but i know its my destiny/fate that things happened and its beyond my control.
              
              Finding a shrink does not help to solve the boredom. I oso have no answer to the problem. Just let nature takes it course.

              <p>Touch wood first.</p>
              <p>If your wife is suddenly killed in an accident today, would you feel the aloof, or would you cry and shout out you love her.</p>
              <p>It is not you don't love her anymore, you lost your zest for life, maybe your wife too feel down.</p>
              <p>Look in the mirror, how do you look? Glum.</p>
              <p>Kick yourself, and smile, and think of a way to make your wife smile.</p>
              <p>Alternatively be a couch potato, maybe you are right.</p>
              <p>Love is growth.</p>
              <p>See a plant, grow from seed to seedling, to sapling, to full fledge plant.</p>
              <p>See a baby grow, from helplessness, to clingy, to crawling, to toddling.</p>
              <p>You see growth, and you'll feel love.</p>
              <p>Look at a picture of your wife, how do you feel?</p>
              <p>Go and do something for her.</p>

              I cannot go out anywhere without my bf's permission. Many years ago, I went out with my galfriends one night and he scoulded me like I am a slut. Since then, I never go out with friends anymore.

              <p>She was my wife's good friend. Well to do, pretty and I believe a nymphomaniac. She was on a business trip here and un/fortunately my wife went back to vietnam. One thing leads to the other... *skips explicit sexual details*</p>
              <p>That was an one off affair and I thought would remain closed. Somehow she blurted out our affair during some dispute... *skips pathetic details of how I beg my wife t stay*</p>
