                      <p>I didn't know we can reach this stage when I met her. I didn't know that I was such a bastard until I was forced to realized that all this could be gone. I may never understand the hurt i caused but i can imagine what if the roles were reversed. I repent, and will till i die, repenting with love not guilt. I don't deserve her or the lovely kids I have, with this I will cherish them with all I have.</p>

              philosophy of a good relationship includes many planes of
              communication. Verbal, non verbal. Explicit, implicit. Words alone
              dont account much in communications. So dun pretend to be an expert
              here.</p>

              <p>erroneous! but anyway, like i give a rat's behind how your relationship works out. i was giving you my 2 cents. you cheated, you're doing what you can because she gave you a chance, then so be it, it's fine. do whatever floats your boat. what did you expect, a pat on the back and a medal for repairing a relationship no one but you screwed up? or people around here to comfort you and tell you you'll be fine, she's hurt but time heals all wounds and shit like that? no experts needed here man.</p>

              <p>Vietnamese are just human like Singaporeans lah. </p>

              <p>They are hard working, humble, family oriented and tight knit community.</p>
              <p>And yes, the women will divorce a cheating spouse. No different from a Singaporean or Ang moh. Because like any , they have pride and dignity.</p>
              <p>Aneslayer probably married an ex sex worker, that's why she is so forgiving. There's a lot in Vietnam and child prostitution is very rampant there..</p>

              <p>Smart women don't just give trust and declare their husband loyal and faithful, these men need to EARN the trust and show loyalty through their actions. Not just mere promises.</p>
              <p>Stupid women however, believes in empty words.... That's why there's so many broken hearted wife's out there... They are not very smart... And they believ in blind trust. </p>
