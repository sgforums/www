How are you going to grow tall enough &amp; get your shoulders broad enough?  Is she looking for someone to love, or a Hollywood Adonis to idolise?<br><br>There will be someone for you who will be able to treasure you for what you are.

            <div class='col-md body'>I want to add my two cents. I recently knew a guy for a month, and I think I hurt him. I never meant to hurt anyone. But I did not have the capacity to return the feelings, not to the level he wanted. I connected to him emotionally but I was not physically attracted to him. I know I am shallow for saying this, but then again, I guess the emotional connection we had was not strong enough to overcome this physical problem. And I had just lost my job. Financially I was not secure to start a relationship. What if I cannot find a job for two years? I don't want a guy to feel obligated to maintain relationship with me out of pity. Sometimes, Wulus, it is not about you. The girl may have personal issues to resolve before she can think about other things. In my case I wanted to be secure financially before I can think about getting a partner. Otherwise it wouldn't be fair on him. I guess it is a matter of personal pride.</div>

However, they nv take a look at themselves if they are really that good.<br><br>In a r/s, both shld be supported by the each other and not being put down. Even with the hope that she says u have, u will not be on ur peak, u will feel hurt in the r/s, lack of confidence etc. Most likely nothing much positive unless she changes her way after accepting u...<br><br>Good Luck</div>
