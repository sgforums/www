              <p>Hi people, I'm 20 this year. Badly screwed up in life. I've been failing in everything i do. I need some guidance from you people. Let's cut the chase. I'll fill you guys in with some of the things I've fucked up with.</p>
              <p>Everything went bad since I'm 17. I did badly for my O levels thrice. My determination to put in effort didn't stick with me till the end that is why I'm screwing up my O levels. It seems to others that I wasn't taken aback by my lesson each time I retook my O levels &amp; in fact I deserve it. I tried going into ITE, I'm doing quite average in the first quarter of the 2 year course but nevertheless I lost interest in the course &amp; I dropped out. I've always wanted to do architecture but I never knew when to start till I've been reading some articles recently that actually I could do civil engineering with structural design higher nitec in ITE to progress further. Question is I've yet finished my army, by the time I'm done with army I am 23 years old. If I were to go on to pursue my ambition that will eventually cost me 11 years of my life which includes diplomas, masters degree etc where my friends are earning big bucks. By then I'll be 33years old. I know it would not be wise to go into the work society with just my O levels. Well really, this pile of shit I've done totally screw me up. I need some guidance from you people, should I be going all out for my ambition? or start work after army? I am totally in a mess right now, I've no idea what to do. I don't wanna fail my parent's expectation towards me again &amp; neither do I wanna fail myself anymore.</p>

              <p>1) try to defer your NS as late as possible</p>
              <p>2) Check the costs for the 11 years and how you will support yourself through those times</p>
              <p>3) Make sure those 11 years are spent in something worthwhile, most private institutions are money makers and their qualification dont count for nuts.</p>
              <p>4) Good Luck!</p>

              <p>it would be better to fail now than much later....the 11 years are important and u will definitely be behind your peers who may already being owning their own condos or even landed properties....of course if they had good networking and career luck....</p>
              <p>u really need to seriously sit back and reflect what u really want...but u cannot have everthing in life...no one does unless u were born with golden spoon....</p>
              <p>btw...architecture in NUS may not be easy to get in...unless u have good grades for A levels....and many have gone overseas to do on campus for years....in fact most great architects are hotly demanded with overseas experiences...</p>
              <p>another way to find out is what do architects really do every day.....can you accept the life of getting screams from clients who keep asking you to change designs after designs until they are absolutely satisfied? and hold you responsible for any liabilities arising from your designs? can you start off as a project manager, instead of thinking to be the like of I M Pei who sits in a big office and directs the architects and throw off your months of designs into the rubbish bin with a simple "no standard"?</p>
              <p>perhaps you would like to network with some intern architects to find out more before u decide what u really want.... </p>

              <p>architecture is an admirable discipline and offers great career satisfaction if you are really passionate about....the Pritzker Prize (often known as the Nobel Prize for Architecture) awaits the next da vinci....good luck bro!</p>

              <p>I think you are being too hard on yourself young man :) .. why be so negative when things don't turn out what the way <span style="text-decoration: underline;">u want it</span> ? at the age of 20, its a x-road junction to start finding out more about yourself and discovering or understanding whats around u. it Is prefectly alright to 'fail and fail' and feel lousy about it now.. not to forget its through failure and set-backs that one truly learnt the meaning of success and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">appreciate the lessons behind every journey</span> n steps we take to reach the end destination. </p>
              <p>How u preceive failure and success ??? What is your strengths and weakness ?? </p>
              <p>I don't think that you are 'in a mess'... maybe alittle lost and disheartened but if you were to sit yourself down and look at your life from a different perspective again, you will realise that you 'do' have a cue to what YOU want in life...  for sure you might not see it when you said " i have no idea what to do.." cause by you writing out to seek advise and sharing your feelings and thoughts here is in a way 'doing something'... Bring out the <strong>self-belief</strong> in you !! Only <span style="text-decoration: underline;">you</span> can make a difference to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">YOUR</span> life... and its never too late unless you telling me you days are numbered !!?? Don't let anyone tell you what's right or wrong ... or 'you hv no vision... no goals... ' or ... as everyone has their way of thinking and values that guide them well, but may not apply to everyone. Its okie to listen wht others think... but don't forget to <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>'hear' the voice inside YOU !</strong></span>! </p>
              <p>so.. you can doubt all i have said above... but Trust me on this- " Trust yourself !!! "</p>
              <p>n you be surprised when you look back 20..30yrs later in life and said : " why did i actually sweat over it anyway ??? " hee...</p>
              <p>relax... enjoy simple pleasure in life wherever you are and in whatever you do.. its not about doing big things , its about <span style="text-decoration: underline;">doing small things in a BIG way</span>. ( like going to ur parents and showing your gratitude towards them for being with you and loving you for these years when u are down down and hardest-hit... <span style="text-decoration: underline;">somethin are more important</span> in life ) </p>
              <p>All the best ... Inshah Allah my prayers goes to you :)</p>

              <p>Do you really want to slog like hell for 12 hours a day earning $1k a month with no chance of getting out this cycle or work hard to get a degree which at least  give you the starting salary of $2.5k a month and possible to earn higher? </p>

              Start from where u are now - every single decision, every single thought will transform and that is very freeing and one might just get to realise what one deems as future

              <p>You screwed up because you have no vision in life. You don't have core beliefs which you can hold onto. You don't know what you want, so called "goals" are weak and hence, nothing to pull you towards.</p>

              <p>You should have thought of what you want in life while still on Parents' scholarship.</p>
              <p>Nevermind that now. Have your goal fixed first.</p>
              <p>For the time being drop everything and serve NS, with a clear mind, no negativity, like it is useless and a waste of taxpayers money etc. Serve NS whole heartedly. It will set you with the right foundation for living life. Hopefully while serving NS you will discover what your life should be all about. Then go for it.</p>

              <p>Hi people, I'm 20 this year. Badly screwed up in life. I've been failing in everything i do. I need some guidance from you people. Let's cut the chase. I'll fill you guys in with some of the things I've fucked up with.</p>
              <p>Everything went bad since I'm 17. I did badly for my O levels thrice. My determination to put in effort didn't stick with me till the end that is why I'm screwing up my O levels. It seems to others that I wasn't taken aback by my lesson each time I retook my O levels &amp; in fact I deserve it. I tried going into ITE, I'm doing quite average in the first quarter of the 2 year course but nevertheless I lost interest in the course &amp; I dropped out. I've always wanted to do architecture but I never knew when to start till I've been reading some articles recently that actually I could do civil engineering with structural design higher nitec in ITE to progress further. Question is I've yet finished my army, by the time I'm done with army I am 23 years old. If I were to go on to pursue my ambition that will eventually cost me 11 years of my life which includes diplomas, masters degree etc where my friends are earning big bucks. By then I'll be 33years old. I know it would not be wise to go into the work society with just my O levels. Well really, this pile of shit I've done totally screw me up. I need some guidance from you people, should I be going all out for my ambition? or start work after army? I am totally in a mess right now, I've no idea what to do. I don't wanna fail my parent's expectation towards me again &amp; neither do I wanna fail myself anymore.</p>

              <p>Everyone like to ask, why like this, why like that, why it happen to me or how come it turn up like this etc etc etc...then many go into saddness and depression when things do not work out and keep asking question on why, how etc etc.</p>
              <p>One thing for sure, as an Angel, let me spread the truth of life in your human nature, life is not make to be perfect, human are not make to be perfect, they are born to make mistake and from mistake, improve on it to seek perfection, by seeking perfection, it does no imply perfect. The world knows, perfectionist died early, because once human reach perfection, this human world will cease to exist. Does not mean if you are a PhD, you are a perfect person, or that you are a priest, you are prefect, these are all merely searching for perfection which most cannot do it in their whole life.</p>
              <p>In understanding the above on life and perfection analogy, i hope TS can understand and better enlightened to answer his or her own question. Mistake is what human race to strive on, the forever searching and learning and changing is what churn the human mind and race. If everyone of us reach a perfection state, all get Phd, all behave very well, this world will cease to end. Make failures a part of your life, recognise it as a way to improve or change rather than keep asking why this and that, which by 80yo, u also cannot find the answer.</p>
