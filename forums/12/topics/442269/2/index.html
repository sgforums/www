              <p>I have said it before, since you don't know what to do, hang everything and serve NS first. Since its coming soon, things are going your way.  But how you take is another matter, you can take it as 'hey thats great' or 'shit its totally fucked up' its all up to you.</p>
              <p>You want to be a chef, be a chef. Being a chef is not all about cooking. You also need to know about nutrition, diet, etc. and the Army, Navy, Air Force has a place for you too.</p>

              <p>I'm good in drawing, maths, chemistry, food and nutritions and languages during my sec school days. I came to a conclusion to be a chef or architect. Was inspired by some of the professionals out there as well but recently it came to be known to myself that I wanna be in a career that would be respected, fulfilling, satisfying and a career that could let me express my creativity in. Then came reality knocking in, to be an architect, it would take me quite a while and the fees for uni is too costly but I wouldn't have to worry about that. The thing is when I got that piece of paper to realise my dream, a new obstacles comes in which is I'm old and have no experience but a sheet of paper, will anyone hire me? To be a chef, route is short, it fits in everything but is it a stable career? &amp; I would like to work overseas though. Singapore is way too chinapore to be. With high increments in properties and cars, am afraid this island would have scare me off haha.</p>

              <p>Kemper had a close relationship with his father, and was devastated when his parents divorced in 1957, and had to be raised by his mother in <a title="Helena, Montana" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Helena,_Montana"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Helena, Montana</span></span></a>. He had a horrible relationship with his mother Clarnell, a violent woman who would constantly belittle and humiliate him.

              <p>In the summer of 1963, Kemper ran away from home and hoped to seek his father in California. Once there, he learned that his father had remarried, and did not want anything to do with his son; the senior Kemper placed his son in the care of his paternal grandparents – Edmund and Maude Kemper. His grandparents lived on a 17-acre (69,000 m<sup><span style="font-size: x-small;">2</span></sup>) ranch in the mountains of <a title="North Fork, California" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/North_Fork,_California"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">North Fork, California</span></span></a>.

              <p>On August 27, 1964, Kemper shot his grandmother while she sat at the kitchen table writing the finishing pages of her latest children's book. When his grandfather came home from grocery shopping, Kemper shot him as well.<sup id="cite_ref-Biography.com_0-1" class="reference"><a href="http://sgforums.com/forums/12/topics/#cite_note-Biography.com-0"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></span></span></a></sup> Then he called his mother, who urged him to call the police.<sup id="cite_ref-Biography.com_0-2" class="reference"><a href="http://sgforums.com/forums/12/topics/#cite_note-Biography.com-0"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></span></span></a></sup> When questioned, he said that he "just wanted to see what it felt like to kill Grandma," and that he killed his grandfather because he knew he would be angry at him for what he had done to his grandmother.</p>
              <p>At age 15, Kemper was committed to the <a title="Atascadero State Hospital" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Atascadero_State_Hospital"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Atascadero State Hospital</span></span></a>, where he befriended his <a title="Psychologist" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Psychologist"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">psychologist</span></span></a> and even became his assistant. As a result of testing conducted on him, he was revealed to possess an <a class="mw-redirect" title="I.Q." href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/I.Q."><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">I.Q.</span></span></a> of 136.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="http://sgforums.com/forums/12/topics/#cite_note-5"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></span></span></a></sup> Kemper was released from prison in 1969, after serving less than five years. Against the wishes of several doctors at the hospital, he was released into his mother's care. Kemper later demonstrated further to the psychologists that he was well — and to have his juvenile records expunged.</p>
              <p>He worked a series of menial jobs before securing work with the State of California's Department of Public Works/Division of Highways in District 4 (now known as <a title="California Department of Transportation" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/California_Department_of_Transportation"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Department of Transportation</span></span></a> or <a class="mw-redirect" title="Caltrans" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Caltrans"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Caltrans</span></span></a>). By that time, his height had reached 6'9" (2.06 m) and he weighed about 300 pounds (140 kg).</p>

              <p>Between May 1972 and February 1973, Kemper embarked on a spree of murders, picking up eight female students hitchhiking, taking them to isolated rural areas and killing them. He would stab, shoot or smother the victims and afterwards take them back to his apartment where he would have sex with their <a title="Decapitation" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Decapitation"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">decapitated</span></span></a> heads and bodies and then dissect them.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="http://sgforums.com/forums/12/topics/#cite_note-6"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></span></span></a></sup> He killed five college girls (four students from <a title="University of California, Santa Cruz" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/University_of_California,_Santa_Cruz"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">UC Santa Cruz</span></span></a> and one from <a title="Cabrillo College" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Cabrillo_College"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Cabrillo College</span></span></a>). He would often go hunting for victims after arguing with his mother.</p>
              <p>Kemper had managed to stay one step ahead of investigators by virtue of his being friends with many Santa Cruz County police officers. Edmund was a regular at a bar called The Jury Room,<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="http://sgforums.com/forums/12/topics/#cite_note-7"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></span></span></a></sup> which was a popular hangout with local law enforcement officers. None of his friends had any suspicions and freely discussed the case with him. However, his mother's death changed all of that.</p>

              <p>On May 7, 1972, Kemper was driving in his car near the UC Santa Cruz when he picked up two 18-year-old hitchhiking students, Mary Ann Pesce and Anita Luchessa, who wanted to go to <a title="Stanford University" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Stanford_University"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Stanford University</span></span></a>. After a one hour journey he went to a secluded, wooded area near Alameda, where he stopped the car and choked and mortally stabbed his victims. Kemper brought the corpses to his mother's house and then in his own room, there he took some pornographic photographs of the dead naked bodies. After this, he tore the corpses apart with a knife and put pieces of flesh in a bag, which he later abandoned near the mountains. Kemper had oral sex with Luchessa's severed head and then threw the pieces of her body in a gorge.</p>

While keeping her at gunpoint, he stopped his car at the side of a road and strangled her to death. He placed her body in the trunk of his car and drove back to his mother's house. In his room, he proceeded to <a title="Rape" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Rape"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">rape</span></span></a> and dissect her body, as well as conduct several experiments on her corpse.

He placed her body in the trunk of his car and drove back to his mother's house, where he dissected her in a bathtub.

According to Kemper, Thorpe entered his car first, which apparently reassured Liu to enter after her. Right after leaving the university grounds, Kemper fatally shot Thorpe and Liu with a .22 caliber pistol. He then wrapped their bodies in blankets, and placed them both in the backseat of his car.

              <p>Call me an asshole but 11 years of <strong>continuous</strong> top success is required to reach Masters level and if 'O'-level is difficult, the requirements for a Masters is on an entirely new scale. Sec. level maths are not even the tip of the iceberg, especially more so when it comes to civil engineering standards.</p>
              <p>I'm not trying to put down anyone's dreams but it's much more realistic to set incremental goals and focus on them, such as first aiming to finish NITEC and Higher NITEC, then Diploma, and take things from there. As others have mentioned, age should never be a factor for success and I hope you realize that determination, without hard work, accounts for nothing and bid you success after your NS.</p>
