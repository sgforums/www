              <p>As said, if your goal is business, forget about academic, O levels with some soft courses will do, but if you goal is to be a slave manager or MD whose decision affect people life, then go for Master, but master is also no guarantee, many master on the road cannot perform like me, a diploma holder only. If really want to go for master, do a civil servant job, govt no doubt had said that they had changed their way of working in civil servant job, but still, the rigidity of their red tape remain, that is why u see civil servant less innovative and creative, cannot go poor, yet cannot go very rich, half dead type all their life.</p>
              <p>Typical asian people like singaporean or the region around us are still very much look up on westerners, even a poor ang mo is better respected here than our average singaporeans, matter will be worst if you are a local chinese working as a french chef, no one will patronise you, people tends to looks at the ang mo chef doing western stuff, so, my suggestion is that if you want to be a chef, be a chinese chef or local crusine chef, go to europe and sell your skill, bak chor mee or mee rebus also can, best is nasi lemak</p>

              <p>To be a simple cook you can work in the hotel kitchen or set up your own eatery. As a master chef, you can be employed by the royalties, super rich, celebrities, top hotels and restaurants.</p>
              <p>You don't aspire to be a millionaire, when you go into the cooking line. If anything you would be an incidental millionaire, by becoming a celebrity chef, in your own right.</p>

              <p>I don't think they look down on the poor, but the poor cannot affort their fees. Don't twist that around and say they serve only the rich.</p>
              <p>I am trying to find out who is the local fellow that have worked as a chef for Michael Jackson. I think President Clinton also had a Singaporean or Malaysian for a chef. Not sure, and on internet unable to find out.</p>
              <p>Most chefs are jolly people, they listen to people, and pick up tips. Sometimes they get a small tip from ordinary people and they create a award winning dish. And they will always tell how they got their ideas.</p>
              <p>So try not to boast of your grandmother cooking to chefs.</p>
