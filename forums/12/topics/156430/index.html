            <div class='col-md body'>hi babyreyes thanks for sharing...<br><br>i will list the problems to your relationship ..<br><br>1) you love your bf a lot to the extend of gripping him so hard that he had no personal space .. sorry hor from your passage i can feel the heat from u too... and i understand waht your bf is going through...<br><br>2) love is about trust, not about holding him so close by your side all the time...if he wants to run he can run anytime but if you can change your mindset and trust him a little more then maybe your relationship can be saved,<br><br>3) he is still young and do not wish to settle down with you yet he still wants to play..he thought he could have the same kind of freedom he have when he is with you...but soon found out that relationship is too much work to maintain.<br><br>4) i understand u love your guy with heart and soul. i am willing to vouch for that. But you totally forget a few things which make a good relationship<br><br>a) freedom  - you never give him the space he needs for his friends.<br><br>b) trust  - you never trust him that he is with his friend and you are always thinking that she is with another gal.<br><br>c) understanding - when he told u that his hp has low batt means he really have low batt.. i also kena this myself before and i know how painfull it is not to call my love one...<br><br>d) independance - he expects you to lead your own life style and not constantly sticking so close to him... you should plan your life ,like studies, dreams and outing with your friends....<br><br>Can u ask your self honestly if you can change your mindset and not grip him so tightly? Ask yourself why your bf should return to you? Can you seriously say that u can change and trust  your bf more and not cling on to him so closely?<br><br>if you can change then my advise for you is to go back to him say you are sorry and show to him that you are willing to work hard to prove it to him that you can change.<br><br>If you still cannot change your mindset then you had better let him go. I know your heart feels hurt but is better then to see him suffer and betray u in the end.</div>

But you totally forget a few things which make a good relationship<br><br>a) freedom  - you never give him the space he needs for his friends.<br><br>b) trust  - you never trust him that he is with his friend and you are always thinking that she is with another gal.<br><br>c) understanding - when he told u that his hp has low batt means he really have low batt.. i also kena this myself before and i know how painfull it is not to call my love one...<br><br>d) independance - he expects you to lead your own life style and not constantly sticking so close to him... you should plan your life ,like studies, dreams and outing with your friends....<br><br>Can u ask your self honestly if you can change your mindset and not grip him so tightly? Ask yourself why your bf should return to you? Can you seriously say that u can change and trust  your bf more and not cling on to him so closely?<br><br>if you can change then my advise for you is to go back to him say you are sorry and show to him that you are willing to work hard to prove it to him that you can change.<br><br>If you still cannot change your mindset then you had better let him go. I know your heart feels hurt but is better then to see him suffer and betray u in the end.</div></blockquote><span style="color: darkblue;">I did give him space. The only thing i wasnt happy about is that he makes plans with his frens and didnt let me know until the very last min. Most of the time i wld leave my wkends free for him.<br><br>And if he is going out with his frens, he could kindly let me know earlier and not wait till the day itself to let me know.I feel very upset especially when our r/s hasnt been gd and i really wanted to meet up with him to rekindle our love.<br>Its not that i m dependent on him. I do have my own circle of friends.But he is my bf so naturally i gave him the priority. Even if my frens ask me out, i would let him know a day or two earlier so he can plan wat to do for his wkends.<br><br>Its not that i do not trust him. I do.I know he wont be hte kind who will cheat on me. I dont really know his army frens well. Not sure what htey do all the time too. He didnt feed me any information at all. And never liked sharing with me wat they do during their outings. I just casually asked what htey do all the time and he just said chit chat. Sometimes he just didnt say anything.<br><br>I often misudnerstood him especially when he likes to keep mum about everything. I told him that if he has anythign that he wasnt happy with, he could let me know. But usually he kept quiet and most of hte time i have to tell him how i feel if he does this this this that that htat. But still he kept quiet. And his silence drove me crazy.<br><br>he is a very very quiet person. haix.<br><br>He never lets me know wats bothering him. So sometimes i just have to guess here nt here. Never really shared his thoughts with me. Then i just have to try to cheer him up all the time not knowing wats wrong with him.<br><br>I know i have my flaws too. But hte recent months, i have changed myself. but still....<br></span><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well you have to face the fact that he is no longer with you and move on in life.... life can still move on without him in your life... if you truely love him pray for him that he can find his true happiness and be happy for him when he finds one... love is about watching your loved ones find happiness...<br><br>The forest out there is so vast you too have to move on.... only if you move on and your dream tree move on can both of you bump into each other and start a new life and a new love together...<br><br>So i would advise you to forget him.... you can't hide yourself in the shadows of time... forget him and move on in life... i'm sure there are other better guys out there... when you grow older and find your true love, you will come to understand that it's a part of life sometimes...<br><br>Just a quote for you by Jean-Jacques Rousseau 1712-1778:<br><br>"If you do not open your heart, others heart will always remain closed to you"</div>
