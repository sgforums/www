              <p>haha.. i think topic has gone kinda wayward.</p>
              <p>Firstly, i am not trying to cheat my mum or brother.</p>
              <p>Jojobeach: Mum wants to have a house to live in…and with her <span>CPF</span> and profits of the house , it does not even entail to 10% of the new hourse purchase price. How is she going to enjoy if she does not even have a roof over her head? That is why i will provide a house for her – if my brother does not come into the picture.</p>
              <p>To all those who think that my brother deserves another chance just because he is my blood, oh well.. i do not agree at all. I sweat my blood to work, i leave money in my wallet say 1k, i go to have a shower, 5 mins later i see only 700 bucks is left. When some shit goes missing in the house, he ransacks the whole house to find it, and my poor mum needs to clean up the mess. When the arse is sleeping in the afternoon, we are not allowed to watch TV as the sound will wake him up from the sleep. If we do, he just wakes up and <span>BREAKS</span> the tv. of course he would, coz its not from his own money. Whereas, when we are sleeping after 11PM, he has the cheek to blast his radio loud from his room but we cant do anything about it. He might have his own reasons for doing so but i believe living a tyrant life does not deserve any sympathy when u get caught or go down.</p>
              <p>And from the sale proceeds of the very first house (matrimonial), my brother burned the house down and so we sold for much lesser of the actual price it was worth. even then my mum set aside thousands for him but he chose to buy the illegal dvds and resell them at interchanges etc. Gd money he made but my mum pleaded with him to stop and he holds her for losing money even till now. didnt make much from house A and so whatever <span>CPF</span> we had went into house B. House B was fully financed by my mum’s <span>CPF</span> (25%) and the rest by me. Brother eats the food cooked by my ailing mum, whenever she does cook. He turns my house into a zoo, bringing all kinda insects, animals in. (snakes n scorpions included).</p>
              <p>Never gives us peace.. all i need is some peace in the next house. But i must say my brother is criminally smart because i find that he has got no shame whatsoever to forcefully claim a share in the next house that i will be financing for. He didnt say he wants a claim but he wanna be an occupant and from what i see in this house where he is listed as an occupant, everyday is a torture.</p>

              <p>Sounds like u got a handful. Yer brother is bleed you guys dry. He got a drug conviction? No wonder he stays at home, probably can't find a proper job. He steals yer money? Perhaps to pay for his fix.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The best you can do is to tell him to come clean and change his ways. Or else, cut him off, give him some starter cash and rekomen him to a halfway house. Then you tell him, you n mom refuse to have anything to do wif him, until he change. Tell him, any job will do fine, work in Seven Eleven (btw, I know the Seven Eleven boss, he can help you). He always say TImes r Bad, but he is nice to hire him.</p>

              <p>Yes I understand. I've heard these kind of stories before. Yours isn't the worst yet.</p>
              <p>However, his bad behaviors do NOT give you the right to gobble up his share. As long as you continue to roll the money from the first home sale into your new purchase.. your brother will feel entitled to be part of the investment. That's why it's better to give him back what he is owed and be done with it.</p>
              <p>Given his propensity to blame everyone other than himself for his own failures. It's best to tell your mom not to interfere with his life ever again. If he needs to be sitting in jail.. so let him.</p>
              <p>Based on what you described of him.. I've a nagging suspicion your brother may have Bi-polar disorder or manic depressive disorder. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder</a></p>
              <p>It is indeed unfair for you ( the good son) to take on the burden your mom choose to carry.  Perhaps you should cut YOURSELF out of the family picture instead.</p>
              <p>Your mother and brother can go live together.. you don't need to be there with them... you can always support your mother from afar.</p>
              <p>This way.. your mother don't have to feel forced to abandon her younger child. You can go live a happier life too.</p>

              <p>alternately, TS's family will HAVE TO assume that the bum is not
              mentally healthy since u believe that the bum has bipolar disorder.
              Can he be thrown into IMH like a garbage this way? I can tell u,
              that bum will never go see a shrink on his own accord. Can he be

              <p>IMH is a rehab facility.. not a prison.</p>
              <p>You can't lock away a person against his will..citing Bi-polar unless it's severe and it's possible he may cause harm to other people.</p>
              <p>Depression can be treated with medication .</p>
              <p>So as a family member, you can only observe him and advise he seek professional help.</p>
              <p>If he has another run ins with the law.. you may request the police send him for psychiatric evaluation. I'm not sure how this works.. I just heard rumours they can.</p>

              <p>haha.. i think topic has gone kinda wayward.</p>
              <p>Firstly, i am not trying to cheat my mum or brother.</p>
              <p>Jojobeach: Mum wants to have a house to live in…and with her <span>CPF</span> and profits of the house , it does not even entail to 10% of the new hourse purchase price. How is she going to enjoy if she does not even have a roof over her head? That is why i will provide a house for her – if my brother does not come into the picture.</p>
              <p>To all those who think that my brother deserves another chance just because he is my blood, oh well.. i do not agree at all. I sweat my blood to work, i leave money in my wallet say 1k, i go to have a shower, 5 mins later i see only 700 bucks is left. When some shit goes missing in the house, he ransacks the whole house to find it, and my poor mum needs to clean up the mess. When the arse is sleeping in the afternoon, we are not allowed to watch TV as the sound will wake him up from the sleep. If we do, he just wakes up and <span>BREAKS</span> the tv. of course he would, coz its not from his own money. Whereas, when we are sleeping after 11PM, he has the cheek to blast his radio loud from his room but we cant do anything about it. He might have his own reasons for doing so but i believe living a tyrant life does not deserve any sympathy when u get caught or go down.</p>
              <p>And from the sale proceeds of the very first house (matrimonial), my brother burned the house down and so we sold for much lesser of the actual price it was worth. even then my mum set aside thousands for him but he chose to buy the illegal dvds and resell them at interchanges etc. Gd money he made but my mum pleaded with him to stop and he holds her for losing money even till now. didnt make much from house A and so whatever <span>CPF</span> we had went into house B. House B was fully financed by my mum’s <span>CPF</span> (25%) and the rest by me. Brother eats the food cooked by my ailing mum, whenever she does cook. He turns my house into a zoo, bringing all kinda insects, animals in. (snakes n scorpions included).</p>
              <p>Never gives us peace.. all i need is some peace in the next house. But i must say my brother is criminally smart because i find that he has got no shame whatsoever to forcefully claim a share in the next house that i will be financing for. He didnt say he wants a claim but he wanna be an occupant and from what i see in this house where he is listed as an occupant, everyday is a torture.</p>

              <p>Your mum has discharged her obligations to you and your brother years ago. Whether she did a good job or not is moot. But she did not fail.</p>
              <p>The matrimonial assets she got were hers at that point of time and for the circumstances at that time. She has expended the matrimonial assets reasonably. Buying House A and housing and bringing up the two children. She has no obligation to save any or part of it for the future of the children. Not even to invest it wisely.  Her obligations ended when the children came of age and are adults.</p>
              <p>Those circumstances where your mum was accorded the matrimonial awards no longer exist. House A was sold and the proceeds was used to acquire House B which is jointly financed by you. This spells the complete evaporation of the original matrimonial assets.</p>
              <p>All your younger brother has now is emotional blackmail.</p>

              <p>Let's say you own a house next time. And you let your parents live with you. Are you going to charge them RENT and collect utilities from them ?</p>
              <p>If you let them stay without charging them anything first.. then stake full claim to all their assets later.. is that not in essence charging them for living with you albeit through "credits" accrued over the years ?</p>
              <p>When you entitled yourself to their assets because you let them stay with you without paying anything up front... is that truly taking care of them for free ?????</p>
              <p>You want to take care of your family, yet you feel they owe you stuff later.. is that truly done out of filial piety? It's nothing but a delayed business transaction. I give you this now.. you pay me back later. no ?</p>
              <p>If TS is truly a filial son, and he is taking care of his family with his sweat income, he would give his mom back the money so she can go enjoy her life, whatever is left of it.</p>
              <p>So please don't use taking care of his family as reason to stake claims on assets that belong to others.</p>
              <p>If TS had intention of making his family PAY for the care he provides.. he shoulda made it clear from the very beginning.</p>

              <p><br>Well jojo, the original matrimonial house was paid for by the mother and the father. Yes, the father gave up most of the house to the mother on the basis that she had to take care of 2 sons. But since when does that entitle both brothers a share of the house? The mother had the sole discretion of what to do with those proceeds alright? She could have splurged it, invested it, gave it away, or bought another house in her own name, sharing name with another son, that is all her choice, neither you nor I has any say in that.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Besides, in another thread, arent you an advocate of a foreigner is welcome to live in your home, provided that he abides to your rules and contributes his share to your home. So why are you contradiciting your stand here? Just cos thats a blood related brother and that absolves him from whatever hes done?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The brother's aint working, hes been leeching off the family for years, and TS has accounted that the brother even burnt down the house once. As far as i'm concerned, the brother had already leeched and burnt away any share he had of the home, if there was any.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You know, stubbornly making remarks just to defend your own standpoint is good from your angle in cementing your pride. However, take a pinch of salt for TS' plight, your comments here were mostly insensible and very insensitive.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I do not believe if you had a brother like TS', you would be here lamenting about what rights the brother should get.</p>

              nor I has any say in that.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Besides, in another thread, arent you an advocate of a foreigner
              is welcome to live in your home, provided that he abides to your
              rules and contributes his share to your home. So why are you
              contradiciting your stand here? Just cos thats a blood related
              brother and that absolves him from whatever hes done?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The brother's aint working, hes been leeching off the family for
              years, and TS has accounted that the brother even burnt down the
              house once. As far as i'm concerned, the brother had already
              leeched and burnt away any share he had of the home, if there was
              any.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You know, stubbornly making remarks just to defend your own
              standpoint is good from your angle in cementing your
              pride. However, take a pinch of salt for TS' plight,
              your comments here were mostly insensible and very
              insensitive.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I do not believe if you had a brother like TS', you would be
              here lamenting about what rights the brother should get.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> So, just cut it.</p>

              <p>If only life is as simple as you make it out to be...</p>
              <p>While I 
              would very much like to side with TS ( the good son).. ,who doesn't, I 
              also cannot ignore the fact that his brother and mother does have a 
              point in not accepting what TS wants to do.</p>
              <p>There is TS's story, his brother's story, his mother's perspective, and then there's the TRUTH.</p>
              <p>Of cors TS will present the story that puts him in favorable light.</p>
              <p>Now...</p>
              <p>Under
               what kind of circumstances the brother agreed to live with the mom ? He
               coulda go live with his dad. Perhaps he agreed to live with his mom 
              because he understood that by doing so.. he can help prevent the family 
              home from being sold off during the divorce.</p>
              <p>Now.. if only his 
              brother go live with his dad.. the matrimonial home will be sold and 
              split between his father and mother.. today..this problem wouldn't 
              exist.</p>
              <p>Did the sale of the home.. and the subsequent 
              arrangements to systematicly exclude his brother out of the title.. 
              caused resentments and triggered his atrocious behavior ? Smells like 
              betrayal to me.</p>
              <p>Now, if the proceed of the matrimonial home was given back to the
               mother for her to spend as she please... not used as deposit to pay for
               the new house...,which included TS's interest and excluded his 
              brother's interest.., there wouldn't be any arguments now would it ?</p>
              <p>Did
               the brother burn the house down as revenge ? or was it an accident ? 
              Revenge for what ? Can't count accidents against the brother , yes ?</p>
              <p>After they sell the house... the proceed accounts for less than 
              10% of the new house ? Wow.. either the old house is worthless.. or the 
              new house is damn expensive leh.... ??? wonder why har ? Like that .. 
              why bother to sell the first house just to get into bigger debt ????</p>
              <p>Please don't be so gullible lah... look beyond the good son 
              trying to discredit the bad sheep.. and you will see the underlying 
              sinister ploy.</p>
              <p>You can argue until the cow comes home.. the best solution is give back what was taken.. and be free from bondage.</p>
              <p>Regarding that foreigner thread... really dude... are you acting cute?</p>
              <p>The
               foreigner is paying rent.. he does not own my home nor have any vested 
              interest in it.. understand ? If he paid my deposit or help me purchase 
              the house.. I cannot kick him out so easy OK ? Good.</p>
