            <div class='col-md body'>I'm a simple Sydney guy living in Australia. I think Singaporean girls are the most charming and intelligent in the world. I'm a pretty shy guy at times and pretty outrageous at other times. I find Singaporean girls easy to relate to... can speak well in English &amp; Chinese (which is a bonus!) and may know another language. There's probably quite a few similarities.... like my asian ancestory and looks.... plus there is that mystery factor.<br><br>During university, I bumped in to one or two by pure luck.... somehow they have all disappeared or mysteriously gone back to Singapore.<br><br>I'm curious to know how to meet a cute Singaporean girl here....... especially a happy go lucky kinda girl that has personality.<br><br>Any advise anyone? Or better yet! Anyone know of any Singaporeans here....? ^^<br><br>Question 2: Are Singaporeans the type who like to travel or willing to live abroad? or does it really depend on who you meet?<br><br>Question 3: Do you actually have to go to Singapore to look...... and if so..... where can you meet one interested in Asian Australians?<br><br>Email me: happycutepuppy@telstra.com<br><br>I need your help!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>^^ Serious? Where is Mondai?<br><br>I was thinking of visiting Singapore on holidays near the end of the year again.... but I think.... it is hard to find someone who would be willing to have a long distance relationship even at first unless you can somehow really connect to the person... although nowadays you can travel anywhere in the world within 24 hours. It's ok when you're studying perhaps and you can live in one place for a month and another place for another month. I think ideally, in the long term one person will have to be willing to move, when both start working...<br><br>I always had this dream of working temporarily in Singapore for fun....but that is thinking a bit too far in to the future and a 1/2 pay cut in salary... and live in such extreme weather... plus I am happy with my job... and it's a bit early to make such a brash decision... (also the theme park there is so sososo small I can throw a rock to the other side of the park) - (and there is no way! in real life people should have to queue up to go to McDonalds!!!!! WhaT ThE ?!? -  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"> and the softserves icecream should still cost 30cents!! - what kind of scam is that - if everything else is almost the same price?)<br><br>For KyoAd and Jewel:<br>I hear a lot of Singaporeans go to Melbourne? Instead of Sydney &gt;.&lt; I am just curious where all the good places are to meet them and how...  intro me someone nice and I'll send you presents &amp; $$$ (just kidding!)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"><br><br>By chance, I met Singaporeans there, who used to study in Sydney when I was walking around the city. But they were returning home to work after their studies. &gt;.&lt; Here, if you walk around... girls won't approach you. You'll be walking around forever!!! &gt;.&lt;<br><br>I think Singapore is a great place... as everyone is so friendly! Couples seem so romantic there. Plus their accents are so cute. When I was on holidays there december, I was asking directions for the famous night safari. By sure luck, it was also holiday time in Singapore and they wanted to come as well. I remember there were people who also liked to camp out in the stars too. (not that there were many you could see there! hehe) - Also any time of night -  ether 2:00am... 4:00am.... even when you wake up - it is always warm. *I'm freezing here!* It's also nice to see big rain drops too... (we only get that if there is a tropical cyclone)... actually the rain there is kind of scary... yet warm...!<br><br>*eeek* Singaporeans are so damn nice and cute. They were kinda popular at Uni, along with the Malaysians... so that is why it was hard to meet them I think... or they stayed in their closed groups.<br><br>If you guys meet Aussie girls... you will see what I mean! I know there are a few of you who like western girls right? haha Actually, it's quite easy to meet them. They are reallly fascinated by you. I remember in Uni, out of the 10 prettiest European/American/Aussie girls... 4 of them seemed to be going out with Asian guys. (one of them my Japanese friend who barely spoke English and I always had to translate for him!!!)<br><br>There is a Singaporean Uni party... but I don't think it's an ideal place to meet girls in nightclubs right? If you met girls like that in Sydney, no matter how nice they seemed... you would think twice before following them anywhere. I remember It's kind of cute how they always introduce you to their mum when you enter a house. If I did that here... my mum would freak out - even it was just friends I met the same day.<br><br>"Singapore gals are damn ugly"? - I don't think so! I think they were actually quite cute and charming. Also, I think they have some of the best dancers around the world. (although the moves can be repetitive). I think they are pretty sexy too. Or the ones I have met anyways. (except for that one in that movie my friend lent me called "Chicken rice wars"). Her younger sis was cute though! ^^ And Singaporeans are a lot of fun cause they can speak English, and you don't have to be looking up some dictionary for the words!<br><br>I really should have asked my Singaporean friend out when she was here.....  ^^ I think even my parents loved her so much. I can't believe that when I had the chance..... I missed it because of the "just be friends when you study... don't get serious! story".....  I think it's the same advise with a lot of families that have asian heritage around the world. But if you are reading this..... and are still single! contact me..!! Cause I am way to shy to make the first move with anyone I know already.<br><br>Actually....... if you are single or coming here for studies or to work.... contact me!!!!! (I wish I could spend time with someone special...cause right now, I'm writing this long boring monotonous complaints letter - when I could have been playing soccer or tennis, or going out!! Can you imagine that???? WhAt tHe?!?.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"><br><br>So.. if you want to stop these long winded letters.... you better email me! ^^ I'm serious!!!!!<br>Actually... hit the reply to button right now! You'll feel a whole lot better knowing that you have successfully allowed someone nice to go out with their friends!!! Can't promise you I will be the man of your dreams... *but I will reply*<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>--------------<br>Sydneyguy</div>

And as a singapore gal , i dun think not all gals are ready to make the first move . Usually what the most they will do is to make their existence known , and i guess u will have to make the first move. Actually quite alot of my friends are over there in Aust. And yes , more are In Mel. Coz it was said that Sydney practices more racial discrimination. Well, i'm too sure abt that myself. And alot of my friends are not coming to singapore , they are staying there to work , so you need not come to Singapore to work in order to know singaporeans girls.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>haha, sydneyguy, you sound so awfully cute in your ideas of singaporeans. singaporeans are not all that cute, maybe you've never lived in singapore before. it must be the stressful and the meritocratic kinda society that drives people out of singapore into places like australia to look for a place that doesn't have their entire population being so complacent.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> how old exactly are you?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>anyway, it's mandai. that's a zoo, where you see all the animals.. that you can actually see in australia. i've been sydney before, it's a wonderful place, nice scenery and all, but a little too much like singapore.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>maybe you could mail me and i'll tell you more about singapore and stuff happening around here. (besides, i'm not craving for company or anything, just thought it would be nice to expand my cyber circle.)<br><br>-- do1cev1ta@yahoo.com.sg<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by sydneyguy:</div><div class="quote_body">^^ Serious? Where is Mondai?<br><br>I was thinking of visiting Singapore on holidays near the end of the year again.... but I think.... it is hard to find someone who would be willing to have a long distance relationship even at first unless you can somehow really connect to the person... although nowadays you can travel anywhere in the world within 24 hours. It's ok when you're studying perhaps and you can live in one place for a month and another place for another month. I think ideally, in the long term one person will have to be willing to move, when both start working...<br><br>I always had this dream of working temporarily in Singapore for fun....but that is thinking a bit too far in to the future and a 1/2 pay cut in salary... and live in such extreme weather... plus I am happy with my job... and it's a bit early to make such a brash decision... (also the theme park there is so sososo small I can throw a rock to the other side of the park) - (and there is no way! in real life people should have to queue up to go to McDonalds!!!!! WhaT ThE ?!? -  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"> and the softserves icecream should still cost 30cents!! - what kind of scam is that - if everything else is almost the same price?)<br><br>For KyoAd and Jewel:<br>I hear a lot of Singaporeans go to Melbourne? Instead of Sydney &gt;.&lt; I am just curious where all the good places are to meet them and how...  intro me someone nice and I'll send you presents &amp; $$$ (just kidding!)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"><br><br>By chance, I met Singaporeans there, who used to study in Sydney when I was walking around the city. But they were returning home to work after their studies. &gt;.&lt; Here, if you walk around... girls won't approach you. You'll be walking around forever!!! &gt;.&lt;<br><br>I think Singapore is a great place... as everyone is so friendly! Couples seem so romantic there. Plus their accents are so cute. When I was on holidays there december, I was asking directions for the famous night safari. By sure luck, it was also holiday time in Singapore and they wanted to come as well.
