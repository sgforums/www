              <p>Hey.</p>
              <p>What the other forumers are saying is quite true. IF she can do it to her current spouse, she is able to do the same thing to you.</p>
              <p>But, if this is a situation of her meeting him before you and she really loves you, i say go for it. Everyone deserves to be loved and love.</p>
              <p>My advice is talk it out with her. Find out if she is in the same place u are at now.</p>
              <p>Good luck, J</p>
              <p>ps  - got children anot? if have very complicated.</p>

              <p>many woman want to believe whatever they want to believe. If you are a guy, you have a wife and you have a woman on the side, who is seems in love with you and is willing to sleep with you. Basically, as a guy, its the best of both world - having a cake and eating it.  But its not fair to his wife or yourself. And You know you will not ever be happy forever. You also know that you have started destroying their marriage cause you have been selfish.</p>

              <p>Love is the most over-rated thing in this world. Don't use love as an excuse for doing the wrong thing even if it feels damn right.</p>
              <p>Have you really understood why she is seeking external company? Usually that's a sign of trouble in their r/s and in my view, you are just adding complication to the issue ... ie  she's using you as an escape.  from what I observe of people, they tend to avoid bad situations instead of take responsibility and solve it and grow from it. So who is to say the same behaviour that she is doing in her current marriage will not port over to your r/s with her. Unless things really turn sour and she is taking proper actions to solve her issues. Therefore, if all she is looking for is a person to get "love" from... she's not looking to solve her problem, but just shifting her focus elsewhere and maybe make you a solution for the predicament.</p>
              <p>Now, my 2cents: It seems you just started this R/s, and its more like a crush. If I were you, I would not be so quick to declare "love" and I would have to think twice about carrying on about the r/s and with this woman. Not that she will do the same thing but to really examine the feelings and to understand all the motive behind behaviours. Marriage is not so easy as what people say, divorce is not so smooth as people like for you to think. So don't be too quick to jump in eagerly thinking you are the hero. A lot of women are just seeking attention they are not getting at home. </p>

              <p><br>In the 1st place, being together with a married gal or guy is wrong. As most of us know, but why can't we stay away from this temptation?</p>
              <p>I had love a married guy once, i fell for him becos he is a caring, soft temper n hardworking guy, but i managed to stay away from him, quit my job, change my contact just to avoid all contacts from him.</p>
              <p>Have you ever thought of why this gal fall for you? Just becos both of you have lots of time interacting with each other?</p>
              <p>I hope that that you can consider her family when you want to be with her, especically if she has kids. It is v unfair for the kids.</p>
              <p>If you feel that she is the right one, then perhaps you have to sit down, talk to her n ask her what she wants.</p>
              <p>Dragging will only make things worse. If she can't decide what to do, then perhaps you will have to give her up. She is not the strong type to stand by you.......  </p>

              <p>Have you examined what makes you fall in love with her in the first place? What are her qualities that has attracted you and are those qualities easily lost (e.g. looks) with the passing of time or will they stand the test of time much like how some wine taste better with age?</p>
              <p>What about yourself? What is it in you that made you like a girl like her?</p>
              <p>You mentioned that you initiated a clear break. I guess apparently, you also do realize that it is difficult to have a future involving someone still in a marriage.</p>
              <p>Your questions:</p>
              <p>i) Make it even clearer to her that I wan her and be with her?
                                                  (this is to show her that I am true to her and is sincere)</p>
              <p>Like you said in your below question: you do not want her to leave her marriage using you as an excuse and an escape. As much as you do love being with her, I would suggest in a situation like this, <strong>love her from a distance </strong>(don't meet if possible) or in a more layman term (just to simplify things), love her like a very good friend. Give as much as you can as you would do for a very good friend but keep the <strong>physical </strong>distance. Try to meet up in more public places or even if you need isolation (so that maybe she feels safe to talk), meet at places that are less crowded (maybe a quiet cafe).</p>
              <p>If you really do love her, want the best for her and respect yourself, in my humble opinion, love her as a friend for now. <strong>Let her know the reasons why </strong>but more importantly, tell her that you would only say this <strong>once </strong>and then <strong>honour </strong>your words. <strong>Encourage her to find other friends to talk to</strong>, show her <strong>other alternatives</strong>.</p>
              <p>This would show you as a man of your words and you <strong>DO </strong>stand by what you say, rather than contradicting your stand of a break and then going back to her again.</p>
              <p>ii) know that she wan to be with me too (since she say she is in
                                                  a dilema, i guess it should be me, the guy, to ensure her, however,
                                              <strong> I wan to make sure she is not just wanting to be with me to escape
                                                  from her current relationship</strong>)</p>
              <p>If she really do want to be with you, ask her to ask herself, how much is she willing to go through for you. Then again, it's rather <strong>contradicting </strong>if you were to ask her (or even subconsciously <strong>expect </strong>her) to do that. Why? As stated in your question above, you do not want her to be with you as an escape from her relationship, but with her current situation right now, <strong>she do need a strong pillar</strong> to be there for her should she muster up the courage to leave her relationship.</p>
              <p>Therefore, you should not be the sole reason for her to walk out of her troubled relationship. The main pushing factor should be that it is not in her interest to continue a flawed relationship. She should be able to realize that it will not be in her best interest nor happiness, to live the rest of her life in a troubled marriage.</p>
              <p>Yes, as a guy (and a friend too), you need to look after her interest. Instead of assuring to be around her as a lover (because no one ever knows what will truly happen in the path of love), give her <strong>encouragements as a friend</strong> and if her relationship is really troubled, get her to <strong>open up her own eyes</strong> to see and ask her if she wants that for the remaining days of her future. That said, you need to take everything in stride if she chooses to give her relationship another chance and tries to salvage her marriage once more (this is something however hard you will need to face up to). Even if she chooses to wallow in her futile marriage, that is also <strong>her choice</strong>. <strong>Let her know her <span style="text-decoration: underline;">options</span> and tell her that she is not trapped, in fact, there are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">decisions</span> that she can make.</strong></p>
              <p>For yourself, in order to stand by your principle and respect yourself, tell her <strong>gently but firmly</strong> that there are limits to what you can do for her, for <strong>you need to protect your own heart too</strong>. Tell her that it would be best for the both of you to begin all over again once she's done with her issues, not that you are heartless in the first place (I think this is a very important point to be made clear to her, <strong>she needs to know this</strong>) to want to shrug her off while she is facing problems, but <strong>in order to begin <span style="text-decoration: underline;">a healthy relationship</span></strong> with you (let her know that you are interested in a relationship with her but only a healthy one at that), <strong>she will need to learn </strong>how to tackle her own issues. That is why it is important to <strong>point out to her all the other alternatives</strong> she has in perhaps her folly blindness and single-mindedness fail to see, in the midst of her relationship woes.</p>

              <p>Have you examined what makes you fall in love with her in the
              first place? What are her qualities that has attracted you and are
              those qualities easily lost (e.g. looks) with the passing of time
              or will they stand the test of time much like how some wine taste
              better with age?</p>
              <p>What about yourself? What is it in you that made you like a girl
              like her?</p>
              <p>You mentioned that you initiated a clear break. I guess
              apparently, you also do realize that it is difficult to have a
              future involving someone still in a marriage.</p>
              <p>Your questions:</p>
              <p>i) Make it even clearer to her that I wan her and be with her?
              (this is to show her that I am true to her and is sincere)</p>
              <p>Like you said in your below question: you do not want her to
              leave her marriage using you as an excuse and an escape. As much as
              you do love being with her, I would suggest in a situation like
              this, <strong>love her from a distance</strong> (don't meet if
              possible) or in a more layman term (just to simplify things), love
              her like a very good friend. Give as much as you can as you would
              do for a very good friend but keep the <strong>physical</strong>
              distance. Try to meet up in more public places or even if you need
              isolation (so that maybe she feels safe to talk), meet at places
              that are less crowded (maybe a quiet cafe).</p>
              <p>If you really do love her, want the best for her and respect
              yourself, in my humble opinion, love her as a friend for now.
              <strong>Let her know the reasons why</strong> but more importantly,
              tell her that you would only say this <strong>once</strong> and
              then <strong>honour</strong> your words. <strong>Encourage her to
              find other friends to talk to</strong>, show her <strong>other
              alternatives</strong>.</p>
              <p>This would show you as a man of your words and you
              <strong>DO</strong> stand by what you say, rather than
              contradicting your stand of a break and then going back to her
              again.</p>
              <p>ii) know that she wan to be with me too (since she say she is in
              a dilema, i guess it should be me, the guy, to ensure her, however,
              <strong>I wan to make sure she is not just wanting to be with me to
              escape from her current relationship</strong>)</p>
              <p>If she really do want to be with you, ask her to ask herself,
              how much is she willing to go through for you. Then again, it's
              rather <strong>contradicting</strong> if you were to ask her (or

              you as an escape from her relationship, but with her current
              situation right now, <strong>she do need a strong pillar</strong>
              to be there for her should she muster up the courage to leave her
              relationship.</p>
