              <p>Those who will not agree with you, doesn't nec mean that they are not respecting yr situation. Because we only live once, live it without unnec burden and guilty. <br><br><em>I am in love with a married woman. She told me that she love me and is in a dilema. She do not know what to do.<br><br></em>She can be married now and she is in love with you. How can you be sure that she will not behave the same way after she divorces and marries you, ie develop feeling for other man after you marry her?.</p>
              <p><em>I initate a clear break up thru sms but when we met up the following days, we still ended up together as there are still feelings for each other.</em></p>
              <p>If you are sincere in initiating a clear breakup, you should <span style="text-decoration: underline;">never</span> see her again - no matter what.</p>

Never force or pressure her to be with you. <br><br>Not only irrational decision can arise from her but it can bring about to a host of future mental, emotional and health issues upon her. <br><br>My question is <br>do you care for her more than you or<br>do care for yourself more than her?<br><br><br> </p>

              <p>Where love is concerned, it is always difficult to say who is right or wrong. I'm sure you know that the society frowns upon the third party in a relationship.</p>
              <p>What you should ask yourself is, are you ready to face the challenges that society will place on you?</p>
              <p>Secondly, is she willing to brave through the challenges together with you?</p>
              <p>If your answer is no, I suggest you walk away.</p>

              <p>I  do not agree that once a person who fall in love with another party other than the spouse, cannot b trusted &amp; shld be condemn.  There are many reasons why the person is married to his/her current spouse, it may not be necessarily be love</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now Stuck,</p>
              <p>i) &amp; ii) There is no other ways to show her how much u want to be with her except than to give her <em>(&amp; urself</em>) more time to make decision (<em>if any</em>), &amp; perhaps some space too..  U have to think in her position that she's a married woman, she cant be possibly seen behavin intimately with another man in public. </p>
              <p>By also givin urself the time to think if she's really the one u want to be with or it's just hots for her is good for both parties.</p>
              <p>However, I hope u know her long enuf to know tat she is not lying to u.  She <em>might be</em> feelin lonely or neglected &amp; ur appearance may be just the right timing for her to <strong>rely on temporary</strong>.  She might leave u once her husband gives her the attention &amp; love that she craves for. </p>

              <p>A relationship like this is frowned upon because cheating in a marriage shows that vows weren't taken seriously. But I think you know the stakes already. And my advice is, eventually love alone is not enough. Takes a lot more than that to make a relationship or marriage work.</p>
              <p>If I were in your shoes, I'd reassure her of my feelings then tell her unless she makes a clean break with her husband, it isn't fair to both him and me. Then see what she does.</p>
              <p>Maybe this is not the answer you want to hear but it sounds like she's playing both sides of the fence while you're taking in all the confusion. If you love her, then root for her and be there when she finally makes a clean break from an unhappy marriage.</p>
              <p>If you're simply happy in her company, then don't think so much, don't demand a divorce from her. Forget all the heavy love problems lah. Live for the moment because life is short.</p>
              <p>Like RediAlertz, I think there's a very high chance she has no intention of leaving the marriage. If she did she would've done so long ago.</p>

              <p>When she is free of encumbrances, will you still view of her the same? Will her view of you still be the same?</p>
              <p>Make sure your's is not a situational relationship, i.e. the relationship is intense because of a situation. Remove the situation, and all feelings fall flat.</p>
              <p>Couples are known to be lovey dovey during courtship, because marriage hasn't been attained yet. After marriage, its what the heck!</p>

              <p>Dear you have to ask yourself what you want out of this eventually. At least his conscience is clear because he already told you he will never leave his wife.  If you are happy with status quo then no problems. If you want more, then just pack up and leave.</p>
