              <p><br>if you need to test if she is geniune, shows you are not worthy of her.</p>
              <p>have you ever considered what she needs?</p>
              <p>A roof over her head, a hassle free security to say that she can rely on you in the event she needs you.</p>
              <p>She will need a new place to stay to break away from her hub.  She will need assurances that you can provide for her when things happened.</p>
              <p>have you those reserve of $$$$ to do so?  if not, whats wrong with her having her hub and you on the side?</p>

              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"> For every love triangle actualized through the decision of the central figure, which is then linked to two or more partners through his connection, it is but a tacit acceptance to bore the karmic debts fashioned by his/her cosmic lesson in Love. <br><br>I do not disagree with the fact people could still be subjected to falling in love outside their primary intimate partners despite being married. And seriously, there are a myriad of reasons why this happens. Most people dismissed it under the general façade of Love to justify their opendus modus, but across several hundred dimensions of Love, the ones that brought about the most misery are the ones that often seen, felt or tasted like the real thing in one’s context and reality in life, created entirely by their own perception or disillusionment. <br><br>Anyone could have claims to love all three at a go, however, when you probe deep enough to reach the core, this façade of Love always acts like a canopy of vegetation that shields real underlying reasons from surfacing. Some even lionize or glamorize this canopy and incorporate certain falsation into their belief system, as they taught themselves to see it as part of their reality, and in turn, manifest this preconceived reality into their reality. <br><br>It’s interesting to note how people formulate aspects of the media and certain histrionic qualities found in protagonist/s of fictional tales, in explaining various decisions they make in life, which the individual have come to believe and find self-perceived striking resemblance in both the character and themselves.   <br><br>It’s not the act of falling in love that matters to me – it’s the bondage to uncommitment and unavailability of another that is critical. If this was a common scenario in your life, then very likely, the cusps of problem would revolve around the condition of your life, your developmental years and your spiritual account in Love.   <br><br>I am not a moral police – falling in Love with someone unavailable, to me, is not wrong: it’s just karmic. <br><br>Hence, if you have already decided upon your route, then you must be open to your outcome, even if it’s negative.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="icon_idea.gif"><br><br>Cheers<br></p>

              <p>if you are asking if he is in love. I can tell you NO. He is taking you as a play thing. I can tolerate alot of rubbish from play things cause I know anytime I can walk away not feeling guilty.  I wonder if you truly know love at all or you are just throwing tantrums, being spoilt, being difficult and high maintenance. If a person truly loves you, he will not put up with your rubbish cause he knows he will be staying long term with you. You are also unlikely to behave badly cause you know behaving so immaturely is going to kill any r/s faster than swallowing poison. Have you ever examine your negative behavour is perhaps a reflection of your need to be in a stable r/s and yet is you are suppressing it by choosing to be with a married man where you know you can never be happy with.</p>
              <p>So does he really love you? If you don't already know, why are you already sleeping with him? Are you not wasting your own life and happiness away on this guy who is never going to love you but is just using you for his own selfish wants while destroying his marriage.  There are consequence to everything you choose, maybe not now, but things have a way of catching up.</p>
              <p> 1 final word: its your life, its your choice. No matter what everyone in this world say, if you choose to live in this manner, we can only wish you happiness.  I persoanlly hope you do not destroy their marriage and family and also you do not come back with loads of complains later.  You made your choice.</p>

              <p>Think carefully, put yourself in her shoes. If you're really sure, go for it, no regrets. If you believe it's really love, then i don't see anything wrong. But be prepared, cos there will be alot of ups and downs for the both of you. I can guarantee, the relationship won't be a stable one.</p>

              She will choose to stay with her husband. What both of us are chasing for in life is very different. It is a valuable experience for myself. We have talked and closed the chapter. I am ready to move on.
