            <div class='col-md body'>I have a relationship with my bf of many years. All along, I thought our relationship is the most perfect one, that he is the one for me.<br><br>I love him a lot...always believe that he is the right one for me, that no any other guys can replace him.<br><br>I thought our love is a 'jan dan ai'........as long as our hearts are closely knit with love, care &amp; understanding is all that is enough...<br><br>I thought I know him very well........but...........<br><br>Then............eventually, I found out that he flirted behind my back with another girl...he said there is no strings attached to it, that it was all merely for fun.........that he does not like her, she is not his type...<br><br>I forgave him but deep down in my heart, I am crying.......I start to ask myself...do I still trust him? The thing is, I do not know the answer myself........I feel very insecure at heart......I do not know what may happen in future again.......I somehow have lost confidence in this relationship...feel that it is slowly killing it.......<br><br>sometimes, I will wonder what he has been doing (since he lives in the hostel &amp; I only meet him during the weekends)......feel so unsafe.<br><br>I feel like treating him as nice as before..........but I am fearful, I am scared to get hurt again........I do not dare to......I have now reserves for myself........I want to protect myself........<br><br>He sensed that I am starting to treat him very cold...and he kept reassuring me that he still loves me a lot...that I am very important to him...<br><br>Now that things are so unstable for both of us, at times, I really feel like telling him how I feel..want to sort things out...but it seems as though now the only thing that I can do is to keep quiet about it because he is going to have his exams soon...and he said a slightest thing will make him very stressed...<br><br>whenever he is stressed, he wil seldom message me........most of the time, left me wondering what has happened.....<br>nowadays, because he is very stressed over his school work, feels that he is starting to ignore me again..........as his gf, I feel that no matter how stressed he is, or how unstable and unsmooth things are, I hope I will always be the first one he thought of and confide in......but how come it's the other way round??<br><br>I am really very upset...........I start to think what have I done wrongly??  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>Why have things turn out this way??<br><br>nowadays, I have been living in misery.........I do not know exactly what I should do.....<br><br>pls advice...........  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To sister CuTiE~~,<br><br>Communication is the key to all relationships. Until humans developed a telepathic ability, you'll have to keep talking to each other.<br><br>1~3 Years, depends on couples is an average timeframe of the honeymoon period of stable couples. After which, questions creeps into the relationships. Questions which if left unanswered will become doubts on your relationships.<br><br>Each couple's relationship is unique, so i am not in your shoes, i wont know what actually was the problem, but try to answer your own questions, once you have settled your own questions, mabbe you can reach out and answer that of your bf's.<br><br>Hope my reply helps.<br><br>Best Wishes,<br>R.@.Y</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, when going thru times of difficulty in a relation, one tends to keep having weird tots. some of which maybe thru but most of the time it's juz imagination.<br><br>one should try to learn to see the situation from an outside point. juz like when yr friend comes to you wif a love problem. you notice tat they somehow can see things in a different light. therefore maybe it's becos you are afraid and insecure which makes you wanna keep pressing him for an answer to every lil doubt you have and this can lead the guy to feel that you are choking him.<br><br>on the other hand, in the worst case situation, the guy might be really sian already and therefore keep giving you the cold treatment until you can't tahan any more and ask for a break up. in this way, the guy can say it's you who wanted the break up.<br><br>since you've come this far in the relation, why not slow down and ponder before making a rash decision. i believe to come this far, the both of you must have indeed loved each other very much and place quite an amount of effort to bring things to where they are today.<br><br>like you said, talk it out wif him. sometime you need to get him into the mood to open up and tell you wat he is acutally tinking. it's not tat simple to say, come let's sit down and talk. try to understand why he's behaving like this before pointing an accusing finger at all.<br><br>Gd luck.</div>

U should never start to think "what have u done wrong". u didnt do anything wrong. he was the one who did u wrong and its not your fault. so dun blame yourself.<br><br>nobody is perfect and everyone makes mistakes. as long as he doesnt do it again, then perhaps u slowly let matters rest. tell him that he lost your trust and thats the reason u treating him differently. let him noe that trust must be earned. actions speak louder than words.<br><br>hope that u are feeling better <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  take care and all the best for your relationship</div>
