              <p>Recently I went out on a blind meeting with this girl. My friend recommended us.</p>
              <p>She's like 29 and I am now 37. Our age gap is huge.</p>
              <p>During our conversations I found that she is outgoing, adventurous and like contemporary stuff. As for me, I am conservative, analytical and old fashion. She works in a very high powered position at a progressive MNC (very popular and highly demanding company that pays well). Whereas for me, I am just an average executive, hardly making ends meet. She is attractive, open minded, like discos and dye her hair blonde.</p>
              <p>I found that during our conversations, we really differ a lot. She likes certain musics and I like different kind of music. Even the destinations we like to go is different.</p>
              <p>Then it hit me, when halfway during our meeting, at a restaurant, she told me <strong>not to put my hopes too high and she just tell me to enjoy the meet as friends. </strong></p>
              <p>Also she ask me what I do during weekends. I was afraid to tell her that I go to church because she's a buddhist. I do a lot of church activities so instead I told her I do housework. While she said she usually likes to dance at night clubs till the next morning with her friends. I don't think I have that much energy to join her.</p>
              <p>So would this mean that she is not really interested in me? <strong>Do I have a chance at</strong> <strong>all? Should I ask her out again?</strong></p>
              <p>Also do you think I should find people my age? <strong>Do girls in their late 20s like older guys like me?</strong></p>
              <p>Next week, my friend is recommending me with a mid 20s girl. At first I was shock because thinking that she may not be matured enough. But hey, what the heck? Its not as if I have anything else to do during the weekend, mind as well get to know her better. Besides, sheis in the same religion as I am (mid 20s girl, not the 29 year old one). So maybe we can click on that.</p>

              <p>Babies are not cheap. How are you going to afford the added expenses ? </p>
              <p>You want to marry a woman, if she wants to be a house wife, can u support her financially ? housewife does not equal no expenses. She still need her clothing, accessories, body care, and entertainments, travels, grooming sessions etc.</p>
              <p>As friends' there's no expectations.</p>
              <p>A relationship is filled with expectations. If u cannot meet her expectations, she will be disappointed. In the end, u will be dissatisfied too.</p>

              <p>prob, try another 5-10 years for true love of yrself, thereafter, renounced if can't click anymore. adventurous and conservation, these are pure nonsense, there is no purely adventurous and purely conservation, you can only find this super class of both conservation &amp; adventurous such as Zen masters, like sixth zen patariarch master huinen or Hsu Yun among others</p>

              <p>I am not concealing anything. Its the truth, I do a lot of housework during weekends. Well at least part of it. I am not revealing the part where I go to church because I wanted to avoid talking about religion.</p>
              <p>On the first meeting, its quite heavy to talk about religion and politics. To me, its a big no no.</p>

              <p>Yes it is true, babies are not cheap. Perhaps I downgrade myself too low. I was just saying comparatively to her. I may not be rich but I fulfill some requirements. I have a car, I have a flat (I stay on my own) and I have credit. She on the other hand, have a bigger and nicer car, live in luxurious condo and her family is rich.</p>
              <p>I am talking about expectations. I don't know her that well, but from what I gather, she seems to be in the upper echelon class. She tells me that she loves to shop for furniture and those furniture ain't cheap, those are boutique furniture, not those you find in IKEA.</p>
              <p>I can support her financially. Just that not the financial level she may want.</p>
              <p>Yes, since she wants to enjoy as friends, should I ask her out the second round?</p>

              <p>like the ABBA song, take a chance on me (you)  give it some time she told you not to wait with abated breath, So brother, go and make your world, no harm, you need to gamble and find your match, love has no barrier or bounds, it is we the actors who fell prey to the demands of vanity and society scorners.

              <p>Be thankful she didn't laugh and tell you that you are too much of a nerd for her. She was nice though and mature, and tell you that you can be her <strong>acquaintance </strong>(she use the word  friends because acquaintance is too big for casual conversation).</p>

              <p>3 day rule ? Whoever gave u that was a bad dater himself. </p>
              <p>At the end of the first date, you should be asking if it's ok to ask her out again. If she likes u, she will say ok . Then ask her when is a good day to call. Respect the lady and let her decide. </p>
              <p>If she don't really care for the next date, it's time to bow out. Graciously,Thank her for an awesome evening. Send her home if she has no personal transport. Tell her she is most welcome to call u if she need someone for a cup of coffee next time. But don't hold your breath for her to call, if she does, it's a bonus, if not...it shouldn't be a surprise.</p>
              <p>Be a gentleman no matter the outcome. At the end of day, even if things don't turn out as u like, at least you feel good about a strong finish.</p>
