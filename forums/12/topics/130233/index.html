To be hurt once is bad enough and through your post, you mentioned that you have forgave her 3 times. It really goes to show that you love her alot and really have faith in this r/s<br><br>Sad to say, she decided to walk away and choose the path of hurting you again... I do not know what are the previous encounters of you forgiving her, but right now it dosen't matters.<br><br>You gotta think what mae her want to hut you not once but THRICE... Couold she have some reasons of her own... Example: She tried but still find that no more feelings..??? You have to tell us alittle bit more so we can help you best.<br><br>I just got "ditched" as well... going through difficult phase also.... We have to try to overcome everytime we face it ok??<br><br>Looking forward to your posts...<br><br>Meanwhile.... take care...</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Take care but remember not to be soft hearted again.<br>Never ever look back!!<br>I was once like you, I thought that by just forgiving her and give in to her sad face she will come back to me.<br><br>But sadly I was wrong in the end I found out this girls are only using you to feel better for themself. Their tatics is this when the her bf is sianz or mad with her she runs to you and ask you for help. This is only tempoary, she just playing with you until her bf comes back to her. She will then dump you for him again.<br><br>Think carefully if she says she loves you how come she is not with you now? You are just a small toy to her. Her feelings is not real is just us who suffer the worst.<br><br>I do not wish for you to suffer the same fate I had to go through in order to realise this.<br><br>Your love for is not worth any effort at all. Why waste so much time on her when they  are much more better girls out there. Please do not tell me she will change cos is just bullshit crap that we say to ourselves to keep the so call " hope" alive.<br><br>SHe does not love you at all, she is using you like a toy.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear William,<br><br>There's a saying, although by now I'm unsure of the words, but it's something to the effect of:  Hit me once, shame on you.  Hit me twice, shame on me.  You've been hit the 3rd time, who else is there to shame?<br><br>Why subject yourself to such emotional torture?  Please don't end up like this guy friend of mine.  His girlfriend cheated on him SIX times.  He's now so messed up emotionally, it really hurts to know......<br><br>Everytime she ended a relationship, she would go back to him, but once she found someone else, she'd ditch him.  Is this what you want for yourself?  Before you end up scarred for life, like my friend probably is, please cut yourself loose &amp; forget about her.<br><br>Sever all contact once &amp; for all.<br><br>FeowFeow<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by tan_william:</div><div class="quote_body">hi all..thanks for your replies..me will be fine by tml morning..now me only abit sad..maybe because my feelings are quite numb already..the 1st time she left me is hell..but now is already the 3rd time..what more can i say..hm..just wanna forget this person and find my life back..hope malcom can also recover from his heartache..</div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi tan_william,<br><br>remember me? I remember your advice and I am doing fine, not as in 100%  recovered but your advices really helps me alot. I am sorry for what you have suffered. If you still recall what I have suffered through, there is one more thing which I thought would impact me greatly but to my surprise, I didnt feel much of an impact cos everything is a history. When I know that she has engaged with her bf , I just want to look forward and move on with my life, seeking for a new love and a new future.<br><br>I start to look at things from a different perpective. By turning back and look at how is she and whether is she doing fine, you are holding yourself from moving on. Good luck.</div>
