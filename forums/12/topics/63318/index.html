(we quite open, -one party say nothing to talk and want to hang up, other party gets upset or angry - may lead to quarrels)<br><br>But come to think of it, is impossible to have different topics everyday with ur bf/gf going for many years and each call last for more than 1hr.<br>is easier to talk to a friend....i often talk to other friends over the phone and normally we just utter rubbish..."suaning" each other, we do it in fun way....(topics include suan friend's fav soccer club or even fav singers etc...and also discuss latest gadgets).<br><br>my suggestion,<br>1) maybe try to talk abt 15mins instead, (note any interesting happenings during the day, which u may share it with ur bf/gf -even if is problems with friends, family...but be tactful, dont let ur emotions carry away which may affect your bf/gf)<br>2) talk a few times per week instead.<br>3) you do not need to talk everyday to keep a relationship going, it is really the "communications" that helps. (note:communication refers to understanding of each other's needs and tries to accept and accomodate each other)<br>so maybe, every weekend go out to "pak tor" and really cherish that moment and enjoy it.....both of u will then look forward to the next date.<br><br>Good Luck</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmmmm imho i think it depends on how your gf think..... i used to get upset when my bf didn't call me to chat on the phone as much as he was courting me and that when we do chat it doesn't seem as interesting.... but after some time i came to think of it in a positive light--- that when he calls me but even though there's nothing to talk about but just some plain happenings at his workplace or some other random stuff it's actually becos he's thinking of me or that he's missing me and i'd think it's really sweet of him to just call and say bo liao things although i'd find it a bit 'fan' sometimes when he keeps calling....<br><br>sometimes you don't have to say a lot of things to keep a relationship burning, sometimes a simple sms "i miss you" will speak for itself a thousand times over but of course you have to let her know that you're a man of few words but some thoughtful sms will normally keep a girl contented...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You said both you and your gf ain't good communicators, then probably you gotta open up more to her.. There's not really a need to chat with each other everyday, depending on each other. If you're not the one to talk everyday, and she likes to chat with you, then probably you got to let her know, or drop subtle hints about it.<br>I, don't really like to chat over the phone, and one of my ex loves to chat over the phone, mostly about himself... so sometimes when he calls, i didn't bother to pick up the phone, and shuts off the cellphone sometimes.. and i guess he thought i wasn't interested and this'll strain the relationship.. so whatever you do, don't try the avoidance method, it'll be best to talk through things.</div>

U get tired of living? Yr heart gets tired of pumping? U get tired of eating? Wat if 1 dae U decided to stop? or da heart decide to stop? U decide to go on DIET?! Ok... dis is a bit off, but da theory is da same. No matter how "boring" or mono it seems, U go on. Unless U decide to end it... dat I nth to sae...<br><br>U sae U need help? communication doesnt have to go thru da mouth... actions do help too... like wat Bear said, pick a hobby or get an activity to do... thru it, U 2 can communicate oso... U dun have to "chat" daily, even seeing each other without "toking" is good enuf.<br><br>Everydae we r learning &amp; we shld be glad we r blessed wif MANY luxuries b4 us. Cherish them...
