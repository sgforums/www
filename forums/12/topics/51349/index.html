(Of cos, it includes his ex). These sort of guys only treat the other party whos not with him as a spare tyre. He will only think abt u when hes alone again. So its not worth the effort and all the things u haf done for him.<br><br>I hope ur cut is getting better. I noe it hurts. My advice to u is to forget him. There are plenty of guys out there who are much better than him, guys who will ont let u cut ur wrist for them cos they treasure u and will not let u come to any hurt. (Ty guy u mentioned let u cut urself and hurt u, so its not worth it.)<br><br>Take ur time to forget him. But dun go soft hearted cos it may cause u more hurt. And cheers up bah!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> U will soon forget the matter and who noes, mayb then u will get to noe a better guy le!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
