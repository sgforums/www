After all, you two don't see each other very much right?<br><br>Her actions shows that she's very posessive (And dare i say, violent?), and this is the ugly side of her that she'll show when you get married to her(Unless you can somehow curb that).<br><br>She doesn't trust you, that's why she does all the things like looking through your contacts, your HP, and questioning you about them.<br><br>And regarding the fact that 'what she can do, you cannot do' ... I think its time to stand up for yourself. Do not defer to her all the time. You're a Man! How could you let her slap you for no reason?<br><br>Love is love, but sometimes people can be too much.<br><br>She IS holding you on a leash. What you need to do is to talk to her. A serious talk. Tell her that you cannot stand her looking at your stuff anymore. Tell her what you told us. And if she just throws a tantrum... perhaps a brief separation would do the both of you good.<br></div>

Though is our neighbouring country.. but the time you spend together and see each other is less than the friends you had in your own country..<br><br>Well.. after 6 years.. and she still behaving like this.. She's over-protective and signs of possessiveness..  But anyway.. you should have a talk with her.. telling her all these.. you both have your own freedom.. own privacy.. own friends.. that's nothing to sms.. or talk to anyone of them.. Is also pretty common that friends will spread rumours about you and another girl.. Cos your gf is studying in KL not in SG.. Definitely such things will happen...LIke i say the time you both have together is limited.. Even when you can go out with her.. it should be happy and treasure the times together.. but somehow.. it doesn't..<br><br>Tell her how you feel.. and see what can you both compromise.. Communication is important.. but both are lacked of this.. Everything can be solved.. if jus that whether you wan it anot..<br><br>Cheers..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></div>

Both your AGE.. Frequency of meeting... That's why I said chances are SLIM...<br><br>Getting yourself PREPARED doesn't necessarily means that you'll have to source for another gf and break up with her...<br><br>It MEANS UNDERSTANDING that she's gonna CHANGE quite ALOT. As I understand that she's your 1st official gf, accepting such changes won't be easy at all on your part. Especially for this 'natural extremes'...<br><br>Talk more often with her and communicate... Negotiate for the sake of your relationship... How is she viewing all this? And just to remind you, KL is not a rural area in Malaysia... Under that kinda exposure, two of you would have LOTS of 'MAINTENANCE' to do....</div>
