I can understand why you didn't.<br><br>I don't think I can give any advice (base on the fact that I am not in your situation), so I can only offer a few point for you to think about:<br><br>1) Is this the type of relationship you want? considering she's a partner who sleeps around, one whom you can't trust, both families violently objecting, etc...<br><br>2) Do you feel responsible because she's pregnant again?  (I'm presuming because you didn't explicit state it) Think for a moment, the unborn is not yours, would you still love her (assuming you do in the first place)?<br><br>3) Is it the life you want?  I presume you're young (&lt;30 yo), with 2 kids.<br><br>4) If the kid is yours, can you still be responsible for him/her, without being together with the mum?<br><br>As Donald Trump would say, "It's a no brainer", but that's just my prejudiced views. I am not you and I didn't go through what you've been through. Think about it.<br><br>Perhaps I can give one piece of advice. Go communicate with this woman, ask all the questions you need to ask and get all the answers you need to answered.  Judge for yourself whether or not it's the truth and then make a decision.<br><br>I'm new to this forum, but think that some of the comments here may be valuable, most of them are quite trashy.<br><br>All the best!</div>
