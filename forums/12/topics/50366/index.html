            <div class='col-md body'>Hi. I am in the army now and work as a mess boy. Well since I finished my bmt i have put on like 12kgs. I m very upset with a low morale. Whenever I begin a diet or exercise regime, something comes in my way. I have since given up and keep on putting on weight. i m very upset and getting into a minor depression. I looked very good and cute when I was slimmer and I know I have the capability of looking good. The only thing here is my weight. By the time I finish work Im tired and stuff and dont know how to include exercise in me diet. I am also very hungry at work so I have normal cookhouse food and stuff. People please advise me or email me directly at lyvlier25@yahoo.com<br><br>I hope someone out there can give me some practical and helpful advice.</div>

Oh well..carbos make you gain weight than meat and stuffz. So,why not run around the camp early in the morning? And one round in the evening? Take in more chilli as they're said to increase your metabolism rate. Ask one of your friends to train with you..so that you won't give yourself excuses. Good luck!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah, there is a easy way out man, but it will cost u like $150 per month if u follow what i say... i lost 10 kg in 2 months. Ok, you gotta just eat MEAT and VEGETABLES AND FRUIT, strictly no CARBOHYDRATES, no rice, no noodle, no bread. Just eat what i tell you. I have a cousin who sells "Enzymeal" which is a meal replacement thing, you shake powder in water to form a shake (u can add fruit in with blender) and u drink it as meal replacement... i drank it to fill me up then i eat meat and veggie... i did this for 2 months and lost 10 kg without much exercise.  If you like, i could tell you where to purchase enzymeal here in Singapore. Each tin costs like $150 around there, but i think it is worth it. I used to be 90kg but now i am 80... i think 78 kg now after 3 months. I shed 2 kg in the 3rd month btw.<br><br>SO relax! THERE IS A WAY! And i am sure you can lose more than I did cos i am sure you got encouragement!</div>
