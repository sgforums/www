              <p>Grandma told me that when she was a young teacher in village
              primary School, She had scolded a young child harshly for
              misbehaving and not paying attention in class. Unknown to her, the
              mother of the child -a egg seller auntie was watching the episode,
              behind a pillar.<br> The next morning this egg seller auntie came to the class with 6
              hugh eggs wrapped in some old newspaper and greeted grandma giving
              her the eggs in gratitude. She then identified herself as the
              mother of the child who had been reprimanded for misbehaving and
              thanked grandma for being a caring teacher. Grandma was of course
              afraid of taking anything from any parent in case she gets accused
              of taking bribes, declined to accept the eggs, but assured her that
              he son will be given special attention to make sure he passes his
              exams.<br> The egg seller implored: ” sinseh you beat him if he doesn’t listen
              to you, or is naughty, beat him as you would see fit, to see that
              he succeeds, as I am myself not educated I want his life in future
              to be better, than mine” This egg seller’s son later became a
              school principal in his later life.<br> In today’s scenario, teachers cannot use corporal punishment on
              kids as their educated parents will accuse the teacher of child
              abuse and complain to the <span>MOE</span>. Kids must be
              psychologically counselled and managed with tender loving care even
              if they should simply be punished! Undoubtedly we are breeding a
              generation of horrific brats!</p>

              <p>Physical punishments are never the way.</p>
              <p>It's not feasible for psychological development. Even if the child grew more educated for being punished, the child will have flaws. Studies have already shown that physical punishments make the students more dumber, not smarter.</p>
              <p>Ever heard of "brainless musclemen"?</p>
              <p>There're meanings behind it. If the person developed through pain, the child will be developed by narrowing his thoughts into a singular point. This causes the child to be less productive and unable to be creative. He may pass his school but he'll not be a productive worker. Employers seek workers who are able to give selling ideas. Selling ideas are ideas that others never thought about. A child who grew this way will become too practical towards every perceptions.</p>
              <p>People can see singaporean males who went through NS. In terms of economy productivity, explain why they are inferior than local females and foreigners. "Pain" may have benefits but it sacrifices many important traits.</p>

              <p>I agree with this. Staying-back punishments are more effective. It can be more beneficial when the students do extra paper works during their stay-back period too.</p>
              <p>It also helps them to prepare for the future because many jobs have overtime when there're extra workloads.</p>

              <p>It's possible, but it can be very hard. It's because the brain develop the most between ago of '1 to 21 years old'. After age of 21, the brain is already set. Usually '21-23' is the age where everything in the brain gets very structured.</p>
              <p>I read up psychology development books on this before. It's also the reason why children learn and catch up in languages faster than adults after 21. Language is part of creativity line too. After that prime age, everything gets structured and difficult to change.</p>

              <p>Depends the severity of the result from such behavior. Not all children understand your intention of punishing them.</p>
              <p>Say if you have a shy kid or an introvert as your child and he's hardly socialising like a normal kid would do, and he does something unacceptable (e.g. he retaliates when a classmate assaults and you only witnesses the part where your child hits someone and not the prior incident which explains his 'unreasonable behavior'), and you start punishing him by caning him without really caring what he says; you only care about showing him "the consequence".)

              <p>Also, depends what punishment you are talking about.</p>
              <p>Caning AND slapping on the face - to me - are punishments meant to humiliate the thickest of hide. A young child who doesn't have much life experiences hasn't grown a hide thick enough to receive such treatment, much less to understand your idea of "wrongdoings". You mean to say: to discipline someone "effectively", we use physical punishments? Isn't that's a forced practice much like rote learning this society concentrates on? Physical scars from such administration heal easily, but the scars.. the mental scarring is harder to forget.</p>

              I would not say that corporal punishment is absolutely no no. Generally  it would be good to reprimand  a kid if he is wrong( not reward him) and then explain to him the consequences to others in terms of his misbehaviour. e.g when a child openly shouts and screams and creates a ruckus whilst  the lesson is going on distracting other students and acting up smart. He need to be punished. Failing ot do so , will end up this kid growing up thinking the world owes him a living and others must always give allowance to him for all his nonsense!
              Oh and by the way scolding a kid harshly for being stubborn or rude  is certainly not  violence.

                  <p>Caning AND slapping on the face - to me - are punishments meant
                  to humiliate the thickest of hide. A young child who doesn't have
                  much life experiences hasn't grown a hide thick enough to receive
                  such treatment, much less to understand your idea of "wrongdoings".
                  You mean to say: to discipline someone "effectively", we use
                  physical punishments? Isn't that's a forced practice much like rote
                  learning this society concentrates on? Physical scars from such
                  administration heal easily, but the scars.. the mental scarring is
                  harder to forget.</p>

              It depends on the child, not all children should be physcially punished . BUT there are some hardcore youngsters who only understand  best when they are given a good thrashing. Better a good thrashing when they are young , then  ten strokes of the rotan by Daljit Singh  when he is older and commits a crime! Too much molly coddling and you get brats who are really spoilt and absolutely a pain to others in society in later years!

              <p>no point.  instead, school should adpot "with holding

              <p>my current school is effective in its disciphline, like you

              <p>It's not feasible for psychological development. Even if the
              child grew more educated for being punished, the child will have
              flaws. Studies have already shown that physical punishments make

              <p>Ever heard of "brainless musclemen"?</p>
              <p>There're meanings behind it. If the person developed through
              pain, the child will be developed by narrowing his thoughts
              into a singular point. This causes the child to be less
              productive and unable to be creative. He may pass
              his school but he'll not be a productive worker. Employers
              seek workers who are able to give selling ideas. Selling ideas
              are ideas that others never thought about. A child who grew
              this way will become too practical towards every
              perceptions.</p>
              <p>People can see singaporean males who went through NS. In terms
              of economy productivity, explain why they are inferior than local
              females and foreigners. "Pain" may have benefits but it sacrifices
              many important traits.</p>
