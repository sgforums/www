              <p>if my child is going to misbahave and affect other people, and
                          my wife actually thinks there's no need to discipline and were to
                          go as far as to stop me by "ripping out my balls",  that means
                          she's a horrible mother and a  lousy wife. if she's such a
                          person she's not fit to have children in the first place.</p>
              <p>and it's extremely unlikely I would marry someone like that.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and yes , the actual term is "discipline" not beat up your
                          child. the aim is to set boundries and teach a moral lesson. but
                          with your narrow negative thinking it's little wonder you cannot
                          accept other ideas apart from your own.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>you're not negative? then what? you were attempting the decorate
                          the forum with your wonderful nick with every post?</p>
              <p><br> the threadstarter is stating his/her concern regarding a negative
                          issue, that and being negative just so happens to be 2 different
                          things. In fact you can say that he's/she's trying to take positive
                          steps to understand the issue before your issues started</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and I have yet to find out whether he's/she's male or female, so
                          your brotherhood claims don't apply as well.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>well, and as for not being able to take the disagreement well,
                          going back 6 pages apparently the disaggreement's all against you
                          and not against sparing the rod. disagreement's with the rest have
                          not produce the same results.</p>
              <p>if we don't know better it's like you have a fetish to get
                          people to shower attention on you . </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and</p>
              <p>"<span>Yawwnnzzzz... Are you done yet?</span>"</p>
              <p>you're still here right? don't pretend to yawwnnzzzzz us and yet
                          keep coming back for more. just admit you have issues and start
                          your own thread. don't hijack this thread with your petty insults
                          and name calling.</p>

              <p>Dude, do u suffer from selective reading? Go read my first few posting in this thread. U are only repeating what I had already posted about rod = discipline, guidance, teaching.. Not rod= beating . </p>
              <p>And to finding that woman . I'd be very amused if u can find one at all. If u really think a mother is gonna let her husband hurt her child for long....lol .. U'll need a lot of luck, or find someone as stupid as u <span style="-webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.296875);  ">are...worst yet, u won't know what kind Of woman she will become AFTER she becomes a mother... U hav been warned.</span></p>
              <p>It'll be interesting to know what you will do when your wife fights u on child discipline, whatcha gona do? Send your kid to the returns department and divorce her ? Discipline her, send her to the caning station? Lol ! Get over yourself moron.</p>
              <p>How old are you kiddo ? So much teenage angst..the real world is out there...and u are just slobbering all over rose tinted windows.</p>

              <p>Something sick is going on in NS. If anything u guys should stop
                  the vicious cycle. Yet all u pussies just wanna repeat history
                  simply because u went through shit before, so why shouldnt anyone
                  not have to go through the same ? Misery loves company , yes?</p>
              <p>Look at Mah bow tan, he keep telling people he had to share a
                  tiny 3 bedroom with 7-8 family members.. It was rough.. So what he
                  do ? When he ruled HDB, He made it rough for others too.. Get the
                  drift ?</p>
              <p>Personally my parents werent easy on me when I was young, but I
                  have no desire to exact the same level of thinking they did eons
                  ago.</p>
              <p>Old school thinking makes no sense to new generations, move on
                  with the times !! </p>

              <p>that something sick is called society, it's what you face outside as well. you think that 18 year old girl who move on to work wouldn't get bullied?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Mah bow tan is a political issue.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>whether your parents were easy on you or not doesn't mean your kids don't need disciplining. this is not old school thinking but applying the solution to the correct situation.</p>
              <p>if you can talk to them by all means do so,  but if need be why shy from the rod</p>

              <p>Dude, do u suffer from selective reading? Go read my first few
              posting in this thread. U are only repeating what I had already
              posted about rod = discipline, guidance, teaching.. Not rod=
              beating . </p>
              <p>And to finding that woman . I'd be very amused if u can find one
              at all. If u really think a mother is gonna let her husband hurt
              her child for long....lol .. U'll need a lot of luck, or find
              someone as stupid as u <span>are...worst yet, u won't
              know what kind Of woman she will become AFTER she becomes a
              mother... U hav been warned.</span></p>
              <p>It'll be interesting to know what you will do when your wife
              fights u on child discipline, whatcha gona do? Send your kid to the
              returns department and divorce her ? Discipline her, send her to
              the caning station? Lol ! Get over yourself moron.</p>
              <p>How old are you kiddo ? So much teenage angst..the real world is
              out there...and u are just slobbering all over rose tinted
              windows.</p>

              <p>if you've read what I've posted, you would have known my age rather than spew this teenage angst crap here much less about selective reading.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px;">And to finding that woman, is she's like you said, willing to spoil the children into brats and fight over this issues, why would I want to marry her in the first place.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and the hell , aren't you criticising your parents this way in a public forum? is this part of your plans for upbringing </p>

              </p><p>since you can bring that up why don't you back off?</p>
              <p>why would you think that the person responding is fishing for attention and not the person provoking the exchange.</p>
              <p>I only back off with people who are reasonable</p>
