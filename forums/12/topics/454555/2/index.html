              <p>Ok. So u dislike western teachings, then tell me, where in Eastern/non-western teaching does it says you should beat the crap out of your children ?</p>
              <p>U seem to equate hitting a child to disciplining. That's wrong.</p>
              <p>If u hit a child when he does wrong, he only learns that it's ok to hit another person if he perceived wrong doing.</p>
              <p>If a child thinks u r wrong, he should hit you , right? </p>
              <p>Parents claim they beat their children out of love, then if their child love them back, they should also resort to beating their parents ? No?</p>

              <p>You think u can beat the devil out of your little brats ?</p>
              <p>Sorry, to disappoint u. You can't.</p>
              <p>Children respond better to encouragements and inspirations -The
              harder way than beating your defenseless kids.</p>
              <p>U may think you are doing them good when you inflict pain and
              fear.. Maybe.. Just maybe your children will work hard and become
              successful... But they will not be sharing any of their life with
              you when they leave the nest.</p>
              <p>They wil resent you , the way you Ill treated them until the day
              you die. Is that what you want ?</p>
              <p>Bratty behaviors r emulated from their parents. You are a
              tyrant, your own child will be no different than you or your
              wife. </p>
              <p>You treat them with disrespect, they will learn this disrespect
              from you and treat you the same when they grow up.</p>
              <p>corporal  punishments r no way a means to a sucessful end.
              It's just a mean to end YOUR personal frustrations. </p>
              <p>Instead of demanding your children understand you, why don't u
              try understanding your children?</p>

              <p>a brat's a brat.... usually hopeless by the time they turn into one, no amount of beating will help, I've noticed usually horrible people don't change unless they face a relevation in a personal disaster. </p>
              <p>so by all means end your personal fustrations on them, at least that way you'll have a bit of personal sastisfaction. </p>
              <p>personally I do not believe in being nice to a kid and teaching them the right stuff( for brats), if the kid's ok with teaching they would have done it in the first place once you speak up, by the second time it happens the kid's usually testing the "system"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>they'll behave in front of you if they realise shit's gonna happen. and that's pretty much all you can hope for. </p>

              <p>Affluence, small families ( due to earlier two children is
                  enough policy) , and western influences of “understanding your
                  child ” have all resulted in the increasing number of “brats” we
                  see today. It is not a matter of just using reward and
                  encouragement all the time. Kids must be taught that certain things
                  are wrong and cannot be done e.g being rude to parents spitting and
                  beating up the parent is a definitely <span>NONO</span>!
                  If parents tolerate a young brat hitting them all the time when in
                  tantrums…and yet does not discipline the child, then be prepared to
                  be continuuous beaten even when the child has grown up!</p>

              <p>that's just crappy parenting, nothing to do with western thinking of understanding the child, there's no point in understanding what's going on and yet not correcting. I see crappy parents all the time these days. giving me that crap about children "cannot beat one"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>fark, I'm not touching you kid out of conquences since it's my workplace, or else I'll wack the parents as well for creating such a brat. </p>
              <p>your farking kid stole and you defend the kid saying there's a mistake , she don't know what she's doing. she accidently took her classmate's stuff(HA! yeah right! like the whole bag of stuff was acidently taken and she hid it so her parents won't know.)</p>
              <p>where I've work, a brat broke something and I glared, next day the mum came back and demanded I apologise to her kid for scaring the kid..</p>
              <p>just yesterday, a kid pick up and threw something at my workplace, then cried her heart out(like she got slapped) when the mum lightly told her "you can't do that"</p>
              <p>and it ended with the mother hugging and comforting the kid</p>
              <p>fark, what about the stuff in my shop? that one also brat in the making.</p>
              <p>the parents are so fark tup already how to teach the kid using love and understanding?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>please lah just name your left hand love and right understanding then use those</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>for god's sake beat your kids if they're crap, don't leave it to the society</p>

              There were plenty , but the earth was less populated back then, we
              just don't see much around us due to more personal space between
              families.</p>
              <p>In crowded cities, u see more nasty people around relative to a

              before ? No.</p>
              <p>Perhaps your child is a brat, because u are a brat yourself. A

              <p>we have a whole generation of parents who grew up and not beat their children despite enduring their parent's "swordplay" so the beatings actually had an opposite effect.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>beyond that it's how the parents conduct themselves and the child will follow. so if you're crap and not discpline your kid when he/she's wrong, you'll get the current results.</p>
              <p>and coming back drunk then beating your kids in a drunken stupor while holding their hair in your fists is not considered discplining.</p>

              <p>I can still recall a time when we left a friend at an outdoor table at McDonalds to take care of our stuff.</p>
              <p>two 14-15 year olds came and wanted to take our chairs but when told they're occupied decided to kick them away.</p>
              <p>when I realised these two kids happened to my friend's wife when we came back,  I farking kicked their table back, sit down infront of them and wait for it to start but the little bastards decided to walk off.</p>
              <p>dare to start but when people strike back don't dare to end</p>
