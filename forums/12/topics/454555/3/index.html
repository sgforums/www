              <p>Spare the rod and spoil the child is an old phrase written in
              ancient texts, but was severely distorted by modern
              interpretation.</p>
              <p>The phrase was written to describe King Solomon's parenting
              style. But had a negative result...</p>
              <p>If u read about Solomon's son Rehoboam, he became vicious and
              hated by his own people.</p>

              12:13-14: "And the king [Rehoboam] answered the people roughly, and
              forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him, and
              spake to them after the counsel of the young men, saying, My father
              made your yoke heavy, but I will add to your yoke: my father
              chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions."

              <p>The rod should be interpret as discipline, guidance, correction
              and teaching. </p>
              <p>"increasing number of brats " ? What made u think there were
              less brats during your time ? Or the time during our ancestors ?
              There were plenty , but the earth was less populated back then, we
              just don't see much around us due to more personal space between
              families.</p>
              <p>In crowded cities, u see more nasty people around relative to a
              suburban setting. Does it means there's less nasty people on earth
              before ? No.</p>
              <p>Perhaps your child is a brat, because u are a brat yourself. A
              person cannot teach what he does not know. </p>
              <p>Your father probably never impart u good parenting style, that's
              why u believe beating a child is acceptable and seek justification
              for your foul thinking.</p>

              Eh serious you know! Many parents  bring these kids  to restuarants so that they can sit down and rest whilst their kids give others ( patrons as well a swaiters and waitress) a bad time! But  why should other patrons like me suffer the din  and their churens running in circles  whils the parents pretend nothing is happening? Surely  I am entitled to enjoy my food in  peace and comfort.

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">A bunch of people with no children talking shit about other people children.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Yes hor, karma is a bitch indeed. U wait till u have your own, then come back here again, and see if u will bitch about the same. Better yet, don't breed. Child rearing is not for you. A vasectomy is highly recommended.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Funny how u all seem to think u were such a well behaved kid. Have u asked your own parents ? They'll probably tell u , u were just as shitty when u were young. Except last time u had bigger places to go nuts in, instead of crowded restaurant n shopping centers. even playgrounds r over crowded nowadays..</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">I agree, children running amok in a busy restaurant is a hazard, I personally hates it too when I go restaurants in Singapore. In USA, the kids don't do so, because the restaurant manager will promptly tell the parents to control their kids. Same as in other public places.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Do not attack the children, always ask the child where their parent is, then speak directly to the parents in a calm manner.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">When u attack the child, parents will instinctively become defensive n will attack u back.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Yes, we tend to give the child what they want in public, not because we want to spoil them, on the contrary, we want to shut them up. Because people start staring and they want parents to shut their kids. </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">at home, they won't get their way, because we'll let them cry their eyes out. If the public don't mind prolong crying of a child, then parents won't need to buy that toy n seem like they are spoiling their child.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">So, it's damn if u do, damn if u don't.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Yes I agree, those of u too stupid to understand what parenting is about, please get sterilize or those already too old to have one..get a dog, please make sure they don't annoy thy neighbors n clean up after they poop on the street. Ok? Good.</p>
