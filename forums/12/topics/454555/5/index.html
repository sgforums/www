              <p>children aren't smarter, they just argue better and parents are more lenient.</p>

              <p>but they have access to more knowledge, but the judgment is getting atrocious..</p>

              <p>Sound familar right? usually the bratty kids mouth words like these and grow up with the same view. Children aren't that expensive, children are expensive if you want to enjoy life and have kids at the same time. Just met an 80yr old lady who was abandoned by her husband at 30 with 6 kids, sent them to University all by herself.</p>
              <p>what would happen to her kids if she thought like you?</p>
              <p>first time I'm just dropping a random comment, now I'm really wondering what kind of parents you have.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My memories extend to around 4years old? never cried in public.  I ask and if rejected I accept the decision. all the way back then never knew how they did it.</p>
              <p>anyway when I was a kid, you don't see bratty kids crying for stuff so often, no one's rude to their grandparents.</p>
              <p>I see parents defending kids being rude to their parents by saying yeah no choice times are like these.</p>
              <p>fark lah</p>
              <p>your kid spoilt liao , either you love your kid and smack them now or they get smack by society later.</p>

               Although generally I tend to agree with you . BUT there are some kids that seem to be very difficult to manage whilst others are simply delightful  even from infancy. Nevertheless the nurture indeed is very important. Also at a extremely young age some kids do not really understand  right from wrong and  even if you explain until you turn blue, it ain't going to work. But a light smack is very quickily understood, even though Palovian!

              <p>Genetics or parenting style, no one can control the outcome.</p>
              <p>We can only try our best. </p>
              <p>Example.. In a family of 5,, each child will behave differently.</p>
              <p>Even the best parents may produce criminal, or professors , or plain o joe. </p>
              <p>I think it had a lot to do with environmental factor.</p>
              <p>Kids in Singapore live in a much higher stress environment. It's no wonder they tend to act out. </p>
