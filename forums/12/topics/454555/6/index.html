              <p><br> Although generally I tend to agree with you . BUT there are some
              kids that seem to be very difficult to manage whilst others are
              simply delightful even from infancy. Nevertheless the nurture
              indeed is very important. Also at a extremely young age some kids
              do not really understand right from wrong and even if you explain
              until you turn blue, it ain't going to work. But a light smack is
              very quickily understood, even though Palovian!</p>

              <p>I find people everywhere the same, either they can do it, or they can't . if the character is fixed there is nothing you can do.</p>
              <p>same goes for kids, if you don't teah them the good values before 3-5 it'll be too late.</p>
              <p>by then you can only smack them enough to hope they'll understand society has boundries before society smacks them harder.</p>
              <p>kid's are smart enough from infancy to know how to push against their boundries, you have to set it then. if you let them get used to it as an infant, they'll expect the same during childhood and onto adulthood.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>just like co workers, if you hire a good employee, they'll work and motivate themselves. if you kenna shitty people, no matter how you motivate them, they can only work when you're around or when they feel your "eyes"</p>

              <p>Genetics or parenting style, no one can control the outcome.</p>
              <p>We can only try our best. </p>
              <p>Example.. In a family of 5,, each child will behave

              <p> I beg to differ, from what I noticed, families with strong family ties tend not to have children turning out poorly.</p>
              <p>excluding some where they really are hopeless in studying, when kids have a stronger family back ground the eldest would help the next one and so on.whether it's advice on handling situations to homework.</p>
              <p>the ones less academically inclined ones can improve this way and while you may not get professors this way, at least chances of getting criminals are much lower.</p>
              <p>you would think about your family and not make choices that would hurt them.</p>

              The asumption of some people here is that corporal punishment is administered brutally without any couselling or thought given to the type of misdeed or the age of the child or the particular personality make up of each child. True enough every child is  different in some way.
                      When you ask any teacher publicly  what they think of corporal punishment , chances are he or she  will toe the official line to say: " oh it's to be done according to process and minimally etc etc . " But the realities  in quite a few schools are that ,  the students get really out of hand where their discipline is concerned."  A teacher told me: "You can do just so much , depending  on the type of school,  whether you get the support of the school admin as well as coperation from the parents of the child." She  added: " when a child is really disruptive in class because he is used to having his own way at home,  these days ,you can't tell the parent , your child is really disruptive because, he is bloody talkative  and doesn't pay  attention to lessons."  If you do that, the parent becomes defensive and say  you are a lousy teacher who cannot sustain her child's interest in the classroom! SO you got to first tell the parent , how wonderful the child is - such a alert and intelligent child etc etc exccept that he may have a bit of attention deficiency issue which needs to be addressed. Oh and these days  you cannot "shame the child publicly " even if she or she steals  from classmates or engages in school vandalism!" So the child doesn't learn what shame is! And grows up having absolutely no qualms about doing whatever is wrong!

              public when they misbehave, that's your personal choice lah...I
              ain't gonna stop you. Likely your wife is gonna rip out your balls

              <p>if my child is going to misbahave and affect other people, and my wife actually thinks there's no need to discipline and were to go as far as to stop me by "ripping out my balls",  that means she's a horrible mother and a  lousy wife. if she's such a person she's not fit to have children in the first place.</p>
              <p>and it's extremely unlikely I would marry someone like that.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and yes , the actual term is "discipline" not beat up your child. the aim is to set boundries and teach a moral lesson. but with your narrow negative thinking it's little wonder you cannot accept other ideas apart from your own.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>you're not negative? then what? you were attempting the decorate the forum with your wonderful nick with every post?</p>
              <p><br>the threadstarter is stating his/her concern regarding a negative issue, that and being negative just so happens to be 2 different things. In fact you can say that he's/she's trying to take positive steps to understand the issue before your issues started</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and I have yet to find out whether he's/she's male or female, so your brotherhood claims don't apply as well.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>well, and as for not being able to take the disagreement well, going back 6 pages apparently the disaggreement's all against you and not against sparing the rod. disagreement's with the rest have not produce the same results.</p>
              <p>if we don't know better it's like you have a fetish to get people to shower attention on you . </p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>And you are now defending Alex ong ? Holy macaroni ! Why don't he go push the bus driver too ? The auntie cannot use mind power to stop the BUS. The driver decides where to stop the bus.</p>
              <p>I watched the video, that auntie is small in stature, if it had been a big person, he wouldn't have dared. </p>
              <p>That farker got bullied in NS by his officers, now he can only push small aunties, then claim insanity.</p>
              <p>Something sick is going on in NS. If anything u guys should stop the vicious cycle. Yet all u pussies just wanna repeat history simply because u went through shit before, so why shouldnt anyone not have to go through the same ? Misery loves company , yes?</p>
              <p>Look at Mah bow tan, he keep telling people he had to share a tiny 3 bedroom with 7-8 family members.. It was rough.. So what he do ? When he ruled HDB, He made it rough for others too.. Get the drift ?</p>
              <p>Personally my parents werent easy on me when I was young, but I have no desire to exact the same level of thinking they did eons ago.</p>
