Fireice is right, have more confidence, and trust in her that she won't do anything about them. there's nothing much she can do when some guy likes her right? and it's worse when it's her friend, because you can't expect her to completely break ties with her friend just to pacify your jealous thoughts? put in another way, if the reverse happened to you, i'm sure you'll appreciate it if your gf trusts you and not think too much into it. be confident, your gf is not with you for no reason, and won't be swayed by such "advances". and the fact that she told you tells you that it is indeed so.<br><br>of course it's another case if your gf encourages such activity. but put it in another way, some girls are (not saying yours is, but just consider it) flattered by such msgs, but they won't do anything serious about them.<br><br>bottomline, it shows how desirable your gf is to others, and that you're the envy of other guys. so take it in your stride and show her the gentleman you are!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey ... remember about the ... "If you love her, you don't have to own her, you just want her to be happy" ? It all comes down to your gf's attitude. You can ask her to ask the guy to stop, (and hopefully he does). Or you can confront him together with your gf. Confrontation doesn't mean a fight though ! If he's serious about it, then, let him be. I'm sure if you treat your gf well, she'll stick around with you and not the new guy. Trust is an essential thing in a relationship.</div>
