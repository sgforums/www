You can only guide?<br><br><strong><br>cos it may mean one has failed as a mentor, or it may also mean the person is a tough nut to crack. </strong><br><br>Understand that it's not about ego? It's not about 'cracking a case'.... But 'helping someone'...<br><br>Failures are inevitable parts of life... As long as you've truly put in your efforts and sincerity, the issue's not really there anymore. Of course, you can try to upgrade your 'skills' to hold a higher chance of helping someone?<br><br><strong><br>and how does a mentor feel when, after all that he has done, the mentee still chooses to go down the deep end? its like watching someone drown while not being able to do anything about it...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"> </strong><br><br>If you wanna save someone from drowning, 1st of all you'll need to know how to swim? And probably, you'll need to be a good swimmer?<br><br>From that on, you'll probably need the person's cooperation too? If the person struggles so that you can't him, it'll be difficult? And even if you're so fantastic and managed to save him from drowning, if the person's intention is to drown himself or 'allow himself to drown' every time he swims, you cannot always be around to save him?<br><br><strong><br>i guess i just have to learn to accept this as a possibility. </strong><br><br>As much as I have to say that the person you're counselling's mentality is important... Usually it's a vital part of your duty to cultivate a certain form of mentality or belief into this person... Or through other means of changing his / her belief or mentality if you have to? Especially when it comes to a young individual or someone who's largely 'misguided' or 'delusioned'.<br><br>Another method you can try is 'cross-counselling'. Though it's always better for focus that one counsellor should be assigned to an individual. When you feel that you're really at wits... Rather than giving on on an individual, you can expose him to your peers and take a look at what are the chances of them guiding him? Because usually different people would have different capabilities in handling certain types of people.... In a more organised community, there'll usually be a 'overall' or higher in-charge to run through the 'runaway cases'....<br></blockquote></div>
