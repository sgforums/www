Basically Business, Accountancy, Banking and Law.  I believe there are more now, since poly keep starting up new courses.<br><br>U think poly is unfair, coz u can only choose courses related to ur study.  But to those people who got in poly straight from O Level, they will think it's unfair to them, coz usually ITE graduates top the polys, and got exemptions, quite a number of lecturers also like ITE graduates more.  </span></div>
