(coz he'll be taking part time studies soon on top of full-time work,and don't wan things like that to affect him)<br><br>i felt devastated. so much for all the "i love u"s.. so much for the "i-love-you-so-much-how-can-i-give-up-on-you"s..<br><br>i'm traumatized by what happened. i tot he really loved me. but i didn't know he could just let me go like this. though we've cleared up the mess and we're still together, (me promising to share with him in future) it really breaks my heart to hear his "i love you"s or "i miss you badly"s again. coz i duno how to handle it. i really really love him and wish that the relationship can work out. but now it drives me to tears everytime i recall this incident and the possibility of him wanting to let me go so easily.<br><br>heart pain.<br>help.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>
