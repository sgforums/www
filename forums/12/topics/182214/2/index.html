I think everyone has a problems, and these seems familiar.  Haa..<br>Humh, i guess he is possesive to the core of wanna know what is in and out of your life happening.  Especially when you are down.<br>It can be caring for him, but in another words its processive to the core.  SUch ... kill relationship too...<br><br>Your characters ... Humh...<br>Guessing again.. You ain't those so called "dnt know how to share" its just that you need longer time period for 'ice breaking" dealing with sharing of feelings.  Try to make him understand if so..<br><br>Good luck..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

I am a guy too so let me explain why your bf reacted this way. He loves you deep down in his heart. How to prove it? let me show you.<br><br>He cares for you. When he saw you are upset he wants to know why and hopes sincerely to solve your problem and make you laugh again.<br>As a guy who love the girl so much I know, I know his pain for not solving your problem. Imagine your friend so upset but your friend refuse to tell you what is the problem.<br><br>A guy who true loves a girl a lot will put in the effort to make her happy no matter what how busy he is. Imagine his effort he put in asking you but you keep rejecting it. Ask until so tired and he cannot do anything to make you happy. He got to work and study at the same time. Is very vexing for him.<br>To any girl who read this please share your problem with your bf. He loves you thats why he ask. Do not wait till the day he decided to give up asking. That is the very day when he gives up everything.<br><br>Hope that you can understand from a guys point of view.</div>

That's why I'm asking about the <span style="font-style: italic;">details</span>...<br><br>In situation like such, it's sometimes not to 'imagine things' before much truth has surfaced... Like you've mentioned, it could be the guy getting very impatient and keep forcing the girl to speak... But it could also very well turns out to be a very different picture..?<br><br>I often do not encourage topic starter to be in a victim's role... Especially when the contributors start to make the person himself / herself believe it is so when in actual fact, more factors are involved... Giving a 'one hand push' for the problems to be over to the other party is not a wise choice especially when the whole picture really isn't so.... If it's a person in agony and crying out for empathy, I actually won't quite mind that... But for a party involved in a relationship.... Distorting facts probably won't help us in assessing the problems... Hence, unltimately it's difficult to help on his / her relationship....</div>
