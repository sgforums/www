            <div class='col-md body'>hi guys i haf another problem, to mani it may seem childish n stupid, but no matter how insensitive this post might be i hope not to get booted or boo-ed at. so heres the problem..<br><br>i'm a guy btw. sorry if the story iz kinda long/draggy<br><br>since i reached puberty, which was like last year when im goin to be 15.  i have been kinda concerned about my looks. well my parents say i'm overly concerned but it's just natural for guys nowadays to gel their hair n style it the way they want before they go out. i don't do that every morning, i mean just whenever i go out, (outside of school) or sometimes when im at home n nothing to do.<br><br>now the problem is, i have some weird features. for example, a long face, slightly protruding cheekbones (some say look more manly wif it?) , ears that r sticky out by abit and a head that is not small. hmmm kinda hard to paint a picture using words but i hope some pple here might get the picture. i rely on my hair alot to mask up these " unsightly " features. the side burn makes my ear not so "sticking out", my fringe makes my head look less long, and the hair on the back (when long), doesn't make it look like i have a big balloon on the back of my head. (usually that happens when i cut it short).<br><br>therefore, i hate cutting my hair. i don't mind average lenght hair, like for example, normal sideburn, up to school standard fringe, not too long back (but not short either), but the problem is whenever i go to a salon the "hairstylist" always removes EVERYTHING from me. yes, side burn.....back, EVERYTHING. i have visited some here and there, and when they heard i'm still schooling they dare not to leave the hair still average. here i don't mind goin to trim once like every 2-3 weeks, and whats the problem with them? always taking away all my hair every now and then...........so i have come to a conclusion, not to trust these hair stylist anymore.....at least when i'm schooling....<br><br>okie so last sunday. becoz my hair have been touching my ear already...my dad insisted i cut it to abide by the school rules. he wanted to trim for me, but then later he denied. saying that i will make a big fuss if he cut wrongly. okie so i took up a pair of scissors and started cutting it MYSELF. and guess what happened? i made a BIG hole at the side of my head....i told myself "damnit".<br><br>i was forced to go to a salon and they "tidied" it up. it looked quite ugly to me. i mean i dun even dare to look at the mirror nowadays. my head looks oversized, the cheeks look like some fat asshole (well in my eyes). okie now the problem is, at the side my hair is totally BOTAK. to paint u a picture, image u noe the LIU MANG, u noe those punk type hair where on top leave some hair then side cut until can see skin. now both my sides are like that.......<br><br>and to my horror when i heard from one of my teacher that if the dm sees it i have to cut BOTAK, which i won't wan. since my other fren (hu cut botak b4)....told me it took him 2 months to get it up to normal lenght. 2 months is LONG to me. i have functions, parties and sometimes outings to go to. i mean, hu wants to go BOTAK and attract all the attention..? i'm even skeptical about wearing a ca[ now.....i feel so lost..<br><br>for the past two days, no one has caught mi yet. i mean, i din come face to face wif the dm, i din even see him. so my plan now is to stall for like 1 1/2 weeks before the side grows back some hair. probably not to the lenght of the hair on top of my height or the usual hair pple haf but at least it wud be black not grey (or from fair, skin color)...<br><br>so may i know how long does hair usually take to grow. hmm in inches or cm i dun realli mind. some internet website says a man takes like 1 month to grow half a inch of hair. thats really a long time..i hope my hair grows faster or im one of those that have really hairy heads..<br><br>right now life has been miserable. goin around wif a stupid haircut, and might be even get caught ( in the past when my hair was long ,like touch collar i din realli mind since if i looked beta that way i felt that it was like kinda worth it ). but now looking stupid.....might get caught..and somemore the sides to my head are shaved to a different color..it looks weird. but its a better solution ( at least to my perspective) and wait 1 week till the hair colour settles down.....<br><br>well so my qns<br><br>1) how long does hair normally take to grow..? for guys at 15-16 years of age....the salon auntie told mi 1 week will be sufficient...anyone had such experience, or anyone kept track of how fast hair grows?<br><br>2) what shld i do now.<br><br>right now my choices are<br>a) forget about the whole thing n just dun think of it and 2 weeks will just past.<br>b) go n shave botak, patiently wait 2 months n dun attend anything. mug for exams...go crazy about studies......and "enjoy" the fruits later on.<br><br>right now i'm<br><br>c) not getting over it, feeling sad. wished i did not make that stupid mistake of cutting the hole. depressed.<br><br></div>

I see that your main problem is hair, since you have alreadly cut it, there is no point brooding over it.<br><br>i cant answer your quesion A as you know the answer better than any1 of use here, hair on the average grow 3 cm per month.<br><br>As for your answer B, there are always more choices...<br>you don have to shave botak until you are told to do so, don worry, your friend just frightening you...even if you are caught by DM, bring out your courage, just sincerely explained the situation to him, if not, you can find your form teacher to vouch for your conduct, it is an accident.<br><br>and like you say..how can you stop thinking about it for 2 weeks if you are feeling sad all the time, don kid yourself, every house have mirrors..<br><br>no point feeling sad now..learn from your accident. just to let your know, most girls like boys with short hair, don believe? ask around..<br><br>cheers and stop thinking..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Since you only have a small botak patch , I'm pretty sure your school DM will not mind at all. The reason why your school DM picked on your friend was because he shaved his entire hair botak. Unless of course having half botak "hairstyle" is the latest trend in town , then I think you should have no problems with the DM concerning your hair.<br><br>Shaving one's own hair was a sign of defiance according to a newspaper report 1-2 years back when a group of guys who were always picked by their school DM for spotting long and unacceptable hair. So much so that they all decided to shave their hair bald to "solve the problem once and for all". Unfortunutely , the school DM saw this is an act of defiance and punished them. When I was in secondary 4 last year , I had a classmate who spotted a skinhead "hairstyle". The school did not have a problem with that but now I was told by a close friend of mine who is currently studying in my secondary school that shaving bald is not allowed.<br><br>I think this is stupid because if you are always getting caught for long hair and decide to shave your hair , it only means that you are complying with the school rules by cutting your hair. Isn't shaving somehow similar to cutting?</div>

Not many guys look good with long hair, and those who do usually aren't the ones who use the long hair to hide their facial features. So if you already didn't have confidence in your looks, the long hair is just going to make things worse, especially if you're still schooling and may run into discipline problems.<br><br>Anyway, glad to hear that you've gotten over the matter. Don't be too self-conscious of your looks -- almost everyone feels insecure at some point while growing up. Why not divert your focus on... (wanted to say "studies", but I'm not your mother)... perfecting your Yu-Gi-Oh! strategies instead?</div>

Whether you like it or you don't. Whether you take it easy on yourself or rather be 'miserable' or be filled with moments of 'frustrations'.<br><br>Except that this gentleman here is young.

            <div class='col-md body'>hey wait what does this have to do with self esteem..? no one has ever said that i have low self esteem, but whats wrong wif feeling down when you dun look like what you used to be..? i mean, there are people that look very different with different hairstyles. take for example, i bet if you take one stranger with very long hair and then shave him bald. show you the before and after, it's sometimes kinda hard to believe that they are the same person..<br><br>a person's image, looks can be changed by the hair, soley the hair. of coz, one must find a hairstyle to suit their personal facial features. which i believed r found by some trial and error and some time infront of mirrors.<br><br>i dun think i haf a problem with self esteem, i mean i'm just having no confidence with this haircut. i mean it looks stupid, i admit to the fact. thats it. what has this gort to do with self esteem?<br><br>weakness? yes probably till my hair grows back i will feel kinda weak and no confidence whereever i go, but by saying i have a weakness with self esteem is kinda passive. how do you know if i also haf no confidence when i haf hair on my head?<br><br>sorry i became abit too anxious to defend myself.<br><br>again, thanks everyone for their advices. my hair has been doin fine. today's the fifth day. the fringe has already grown 1 cm and the sides look more black now, the skin colour isn't that visible anymore.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Scape_Goat_Token:</div><div class="quote_body">hi guys i haf another problem, to mani it may seem childish n stupid, but no matter how insensitive this post might be i hope not to get booted or boo-ed at. so heres the problem..<br><br>i'm a guy btw. sorry if the story iz kinda long/draggy<br><br>since i reached puberty, which was like last year when im goin to be 15.  i have been kinda concerned about my looks. well my parents say i'm overly concerned but it's just natural for guys nowadays to gel their hair n style it the way they want before they go out. i don't do that every morning, i mean just whenever i go out, (outside of school) or sometimes when im at home n nothing to do.<br><br>now the problem is, i have some weird features. for example, a long face, slightly protruding cheekbones (some say look more manly wif it?) , ears that r sticky out by abit and a head that is not small. hmmm kinda hard to paint a picture using words but i hope some pple here might get the picture. i rely on my hair alot to mask up these " unsightly " features. the side burn makes my ear not so "sticking out", my fringe makes my head look less long, and the hair on the back (when long), doesn't make it look like i have a big balloon on the back of my head. (usually that happens when i cut it short).<br><br>therefore, i hate cutting my hair. i don't mind average lenght hair, like for example, normal sideburn, up to school standard fringe, not too long back (but not short either), but the problem is whenever i go to a salon the "hairstylist" always removes EVERYTHING from me. yes, side burn.....back, EVERYTHING. i have visited some here and there, and when they heard i'm still schooling they dare not to leave the hair still average. here i don't mind goin to trim once like every 2-3 weeks, and whats the problem with them? always taking away all my hair every now and then...........so i have come to a conclusion, not to trust these hair stylist anymore.....at least when i'm schooling....<br><br>okie so last sunday. becoz my hair have been touching my ear already...my dad insisted i cut it to abide by the school rules. he wanted to trim for me, but then later he denied. saying that i will make a big fuss if he cut wrongly. okie so i took up a pair of scissors and started cutting it MYSELF. and guess what happened? i made a BIG hole at the side of my head....i told myself "damnit".<br><br>i was forced to go to a salon and they "tidied" it up. it looked quite ugly to me. i mean i dun even dare to look at the mirror nowadays. my head looks oversized, the cheeks look like some fat asshole (well in my eyes). okie now the problem is, at the side my hair is totally BOTAK. to paint u a picture, image u noe the LIU MANG, u noe those punk type hair where on top leave some hair then side cut until can see skin. now both my sides are like that.......<br><br>and to my horror when i heard from one of my teacher that if the dm sees it i have to cut BOTAK, which i won't wan. since my other fren (hu cut botak b4)....told me it took him 2 months to get it up to normal lenght. 2 months is LONG to me. i have functions, parties and sometimes outings to go to. i mean, hu wants to go BOTAK and attract all the attention..? i'm even skeptical about wearing a ca[ now.....i feel so lost..<br><br>for the past two days, no one has caught mi yet. i mean, i din come face to face wif the dm, i din even see him. so my plan now is to stall for like 1 1/2 weeks before the side grows back some hair. probably not to the lenght of the hair on top of my height or the usual hair pple haf but at least it wud be black not grey (or from fair, skin color)...<br><br>so may i know how long does hair usually take to grow. hmm in inches or cm i dun realli mind. some internet website says a man takes like 1 month to grow half a inch of hair. thats really a long time..i hope my hair grows faster or im one of those that have really hairy heads..<br><br>right now life has been miserable. goin around wif a stupid haircut, and might be even get caught ( in the past when my hair was long ,like touch collar i din realli mind since if i looked beta that way i felt that it was like kinda worth it ). but now looking stupid.....might get caught..and somemore the sides to my head are shaved to a different color..it looks weird. but its a better solution ( at least to my perspective) and wait 1 week till the hair colour settles down.....<br><br>well so my qns<br><br>1) how long does hair normally take to grow..? for guys at 15-16 years of age....the salon auntie told mi 1 week will be sufficient...anyone had such experience, or anyone kept track of how fast hair grows?<br><br>2) what shld i do now.<br><br>right now my choices are<br>a) forget about the whole thing n just dun think of it and 2 weeks will just past.<br>b) go n shave botak, patiently wait 2 months n dun attend anything. mug for exams...go crazy about studies......and "enjoy" the fruits later on.<br><br>right now i'm<br><br>c) not getting over it, feeling sad. wished i did not make that stupid mistake of cutting the hole. depressed.<br><br></div></blockquote>Shave your head bals and be a monk.
