            <div class='col-md body'>hmmzzzzzz.. What can i say ? IF you want to wait for him ... then go ahead ... though i feel that ... that would be most naive of you. Why wait for someone who's going to jail ? As they say ... Why give up a whole forest for a currently wilting tree ? UNLESS of course... you feel that the person likes you alot to the extent where he would do anything for you, Or Vice Versa. Then it would be considerable to wait ... do try and see a trained counciliar ... we're just normal humans with some views after all. Not all our advice is feasible. Take Care!</div>
