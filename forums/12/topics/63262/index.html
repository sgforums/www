            <div class='col-md body'>on the other hand, besides going to the bank, look at the expenses of the different schools. Some are cheaper because they are state universities, whereby it's subsidised by the nation or state. It will mean that you might have to compromise with the reputation of the reknown schools. Might need to work a few years before going or be taking up a job when you're there to cover the last few year of your education.<br><br>Sometimes the cost of living specified by the school is not a good representation of your actual spending. For me it's a lot cheaper than the school stated. That is, you got to cook your own meals and look for cheaper housing when you're there.</div>

Show it through your good work performance and get them to send you over. Furthermore, you will have to sign bond with company, so sure got job waiting for you when you return (if you do return at all).<br><br>I know this is the tough route but at least you won't come back ladened with debts. It's not wise to take loan and come back with debts esp the economy is not good. Not forgeting, as you age, there's more debts coming in.... e.g. marriage, house, car, utilities bill, baby etc and you better pray you don't fall sick overseas either coz the medical fees will bankrupt you if you have a terrible illness whatever on top of having to pay for school fees and accommodation, meals and transport. In 4 seasons countries, you have to fork out money for warm clothings too which will add on to your cost.<br><br>Think carefully.....is it worth it??? At the end of the day, is the degree/diploma really that good??? would you turn out as any other local grad in terms of chances for a job?<br><br></div>
