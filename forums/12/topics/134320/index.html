It accomplishes nothing.<br>You can't make someone love you just by virtue of your loving them.<br><br>When one has intense feelings, one seems to always want to know in advance how the other will react; you want to possess some grand psychic channel that will tell you what you should do, what she will think.<br><br>This is probably evidence enough that you should walk away from this whole affair and never look back.<br><br>Failing that you take this advice, simply ask her out and see how it goes. Go somewhere neutral. Have fun. Keep your cool. Keep that feeling inside. There will be plenty of chances for confessions later. Do keep in mind that it takes weeks even months sometimes even years for people to grow closer.<br><br>..... chances are you couldnt do that with the appropriate attitude, and most probably try to rush things.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by twenty47:</div><div class="quote_body">i am already her friend</div></blockquote>You can ask her out anytime (not graveyards hours okie?) as a friend. If she's willing to go out with you for a valid reason, then let things happen naturally from there on. No need to be really savy and impress her intentionally...well...no need to do so until you're 100% sure that she's comfortable being with you when you're out with her. If you're sure that she's comfortable being with you after more than once or twice outings, perhaps you can tell her that you really enjoyed your time with her and would like to 'better' friends with her. The moment to tell her this can only be after you have attracted her to your attention. How to attract her to your attention...well...you could discussed something of an importance with her...and it better concerns her or else you're probably not the one for her cos she didn't tell you nuts about anything happening around her. Catch her attention and afterwards there will be a common weird silence after the conclusion has been reached or agreed...that's probably the good time for you to tell her that you've enjoyed her accompany and would like to be 'better' friends.<br><br>Well...try it out at your own risk. I can say success rate is only 1% or 0.0000000001% after deducting all the rest of the girls who are not interested or attracted to you. So don't come to here and KPKB if it doesn't works out for you.<br><br>Good luck. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>
