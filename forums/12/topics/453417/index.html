              Hi, I'm a 18 year old guy and I've a problem and I'm looking for help.
              
              I've a thing for crossdressing as a girl. It actually started last year, when I start to have feminine feelings and wanna be a girl. I started wearing female jeans, and once i.accidemtally enter the female washroom, as I'm a cleaniness freak, I started using the female washroom when I'm out late at night or early in the morning, to prevent myself frm being caught, I would behave as a female would in the toilet.
              
              Things got worse when once my family was out, I started by trying out my mum's and sister's lingerie, then as time passes I started trying dresss, heels, pantyhose and even wore make-up (which I learn via YouTube). Then my confidence grew and one day while they were out, I combine everything together, I got to admit I look quite pretty in it.
              
              Knowing the dangers, I tried controlling my urge. I was able to.control it for one month before my feelings return. I then started shaving parts where a female would shave and play dress-up occasionally.
              
              I've told some of my friends, all but one was disgusted by it, and the ine was impressed by it and wanted me to show her one day in her.clothing
              
              I am a totally straight guy and I'm still single, but I have a feeling for lesbians and girls who crossdresses as a guy. Also its my dream to marry a girl of my dreams, however, I'm the one to wear the dress while she wears the suit. However, I am curious to know wheather girls are ok if their boyfriend are like this, would they accept a guy like me?
              
              Also many of many friends have comented that my build n size is something that a girl would dream of. I'm very slim(waist size 25) and only weights 45 kg. Plus my size is small for a guy .
              
              I didn't take any.photo as I fear that I would be caught.
              
              Can anyone help me...will be glad if its someone similar to me, better if its a girl. Would anyone like someone like me?
              
              Also if i.continue doing this will I turn gay? However, I don't rlly like guys at all. I also have not enlisted for NS yet, should I let the officers know about it when I go for my medical check-up? I would be rlly glad if they would allow my habit and give me the female uniform.
              
              Ps. I semd it via my phone so sorry for any

              <p>There was also a story on channel 5 called " behind close doors" where he the husband has 2 children with his wife. Then, one time the wife thought the husband having an affair cos got lip stick on his face. The husband started eating female hormones, to the point where his features looked more feminine. Eg, hairless, smooth face all this lah. The wife couldnt understand. She was confused and stressed. Finally, he left the house and the family for a sex change operation in Thailand. The wife went crazy i think.</p>

              <p>You look at naked girls and naked guys, then you see which one you are attracted to.</p>
              <p>Could it be just a fetish?? Or you like musculine girls?</p>

              Hmm..I don't have any intention to change my.sex. I want to live as a male at the same time being sble to be a woman. That's why I want to marry a woman of my dream...but I m the one wearing the dress instead...
              
              Also, it could probably be due to my small built thus provoking my female side, as I find it hard to get a clothes that fit...

              I am attracted to the girl...as for the fetish part I'm unsure as I prefer blouses, dresses, skirts and all female clothing as compared to guys clothing...I actually even tried wearing a pad for a day and I can get use to it.
              
              As for girls...I get interested in lesbians and girls who.crossdress as guy...I actually wanted to get close to them...but fear that they may think badly of what I do...

              <p>Hmmm. Then i wanna ask you what is it that you like about lesbian tomboys? </p>
              <p>How they dress, they talk? What they wear? </p>
              <p>For me, the way i see is that you admire them because they have musculine characteristics that maybe you dont have? So thats why you look up or wanna be friends with them. I think you have to do some soul searching. Always follow what you like. </p>
              <p>Say, i put you into a scenerio, you like to be the girl and she( tomboy ) be the guy, then  who is gonna do who? You understand? Haha.</p>
              <p>Also, it is very hard to find a girl that likes her man to be her wife instead. Your situation sounds very complex. Again, you'll do a little soul searching to really understand your situation. All i can say is, only you can understand the feeling you own. </p>

              <p>Hmm...I don't know...is like seeing lesbians tomboy gives me some sort of feelings like I'm interested in them...hmmm...I aren't quite sure i.had thought bout it for quite simetime and I don't think that its cos they have masculine characteristic...I just had a feeling like I'm suppose to be a girl...in fact I was thinking of buying sime makeup.for my own use and maybe a skirt and wear it in secret...at one point I was also tempted to wear a pantyhose to school.
              Hmm...for that I know cos no matter how tomboy a girl mayb...wearing a white dress is still her dream...but idk why its also my dream.
              I did thought of it a lot and whenever I'm crossdressing I felt the most comfortable in it..and feel not out of place...
              But then, it.could be just that I'm rlly like this cos I seen a doctor and she suspected that I have more female gene in me</p>
