              <p>I symphatise with ur situation.. i think you should try to talk to her and find out why she is doing this to you. But personally i feel that you should consider <strong>calmly whether u want to continue this relationship with this woman anot. </strong></p>
              <p>If you choose to continue, does it bring peace, contentment and happiness to you? If it doesnt, then u haf to make an amicable choice to settle this matter calmly. Think of other things that are important to you in your life. Such as ur family. If you continue to feel upset over this woman, is it fair to the ppl around you?</p>
              <p>The ultimate answer lies with urself.</p>
              <p>Just my 5 cents opinion.</p>

              <p>You mentioned about breaking her from this old man. What prevents her from cheating on you again? Its like a endless pit, you dig further, it only goes deeper.</p>
              <p>No point forcing her. If this is so, you should accept and move on with life. Treat it as an experience.</p>
              <p>As for the money given to her, treat it like charity to help her as a divorced woman. I know its much harder to do than what said, but thats the only good way i think you can let go of the money.</p>

              First of all, I think hiring a PI reflects more about the lack of trust in the relationship. When there's a lack of trust, seriously, the relationship is no longer worth pursuing. 
              
              Secondly, you're only guessing if the lady is sleeping with the other guy. Sometimes when we're worried, we tend to bias our thoughts towards the direction that we want to believe, and it could be far away from the facts.
              
              Then also, if you have to give money to a lady for her to love you, then as far as I'm concern, this relationship is more of a farce than true love.
              
              My suggestion is to forget it. I don't understand certain things about guys. If it's just about looks, I can guarantee plus chop get a blonde girl with busty boobs to be my girlfriend and wife as long as I have the money. Problem is, what happens when my biz or career go down the drain, will the girl stick with me? The thing is, if you find a girl who is money-oriented, whatever she say about true love, you can forget those lies. Action speaks louder than words.
              
              You deserves a better girl with genuine inner good.

              @DailyFreeGames
              I hired PI as I wanted to know the truth. Every tue and thus she would dissappear after office for few hours. When I asked about part time work place,she would chicken out. Later told me she the shop she worked closed down.
              Initially when we started , money wasnt involved. Slowly she started to tell her problems, even told me need to pay 30K to ex hubby to settle the house. PI was greedy and ask for more and more money,which i didnt give. When we initially met, I always see her carring gifts specially from Japan, taka vouchers and other stuffs. 
              
              @NoahTay
              I do love her and want to bring her to normal life.Thats the reason i start giving her money, so she can solve her problems. I told her if your ex boss pays you 500, I can give you 1K but dont to his place. Maybe she thinks I will get bored with her and run to another women.
              
              @Middleway87
              I did try to talk to her, try to explain I wont leave you, but she feels her job is not so stable and if she lose her job, her ex boss will help her as he is starting some business here. 
              She loves me but she doesnt trust me as much his ex boss( 15 years) Vs 1.5 years.
              This guy was asked to leave and he came back to start some business here.

              Hi Varatare,
              
              I know where you are coming from.............
              
              I will not dump her.
              
              I will not dump her as I dont love my ex anymore.
              
              After my first major quarel with her on her part time, she told me just allow me to work and i will treat you like a king and i love u very much. I told her if give you the same amount of money but dont go to his house. I know that man only ask her to go his house once a week. She mention to about her mother gambling habits and how she has to pay every time, and she might be paying now also. I only tried to help her as i love her,nothing else
