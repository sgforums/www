I am too! You said you have seen many people jump into love blindly and turned out bad. Did you hear both sides of the story or just one? Normally, when a relationship/marriage fails, both sides have to take responsibility. The normal case is usually one for being so wilful, the other for failing to see the problem and asks for separation instead of tackling the problem.<br><br>Bear in mind that guys and gals have completely different mindset. It is usually good during the dating part, but as time goes, more and more ugly side of the person is revealed. Does one call it 'quits' after they realised the ugly part, or just accept and work on it?<br><br>Unfortunately, social and peer pressure has molded us into "certain expectations" of what love is and what to expect from it. When we don't have what other couples have, we give up trying. Love is always between 2 persons and always will be. Don't compare. Anyone ever seen a couple in their sixties still holding hands? That's because at their age, nobody is around to tell them what to do, their friends would be too few to compare notes, their expectations are few and lastly, they realise they will be there for each other until the end. That is what love is.</div>

But personally, L.O.V.E, to me is a very very strong word.  It HAS to be comin from my heart.  Otherwise, i wont say it.  The most i'll say "like".

Well said<br>"Before we tell other people there's no such thing as love, perhaps we should look at ourselves if we can give or are deserving of such love"<br><br>Many times, we blame others, when we never look at ourselves. <span style="color: red;">Its like the selfish male that goes around sleeping with gals, and expects his future wife to be a virgin</span>.</div></blockquote>EXACTLY!!

Love is always ard, it's jus not as aggressive as hatred which happen daily &amp; affecting every pple, forcing them to believe love is fake, it doesnt exist.<br><br>On the other hand, love is not an aggressive force, it's gentle &amp; warm.
