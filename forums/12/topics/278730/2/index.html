            <div class='col-md body'>First post... normally lurking around but this topic touches my heart somewhat.<br><br>I used to be like that too - as in believing that I could love my (now ex-)GF "without reason". My ex-GF is the possessive and manipulative type (fortunately the r/s lasted just 6 months. Phew!).<br><br>Brainwashing is THE word - she'd say things like "if you loved me you would do ______ for me" and the soft part of me would convince myself that "yes, since she is indeed my GF I should love her and therefore do _____ for her, so that she will be happy", even if some of her demands were indeed unreasonable.<br><br>Of course, in retrospect, the above is plain blackmail. But it might not be so easy to see it when you're deep in the relationship, when you put your partner as more important than yourself.<br><br>Hence I believe that there's no such thing as true unconditional love - in the context of an abusive relationship, it only means that the ability of one party to give willingly in the relationship is being abused to satisfy the other's demands.<br><br>All those couples that live "happily ever after" claim to love each other unconditionally - but I believe it's because both parties are first able to provide what their partners needed before their partners are able to reciprocate. Hence it's nowhere near unconditional either.<br><br>My 2.14 cents inclusive of GST. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
