Yep, everyone has different way of showing love. And when it comes, you will like it(don't only think of sex)! Although arguments are ugly, it's the improvement or positive 'aftermath' effect that binds a relationship even stronger. My wife, who always likes screaming divorce, has stopped doing so(I hope it's permanent). Even when we had a very bad fight, she does not mention it liao.<br><br>Nowadays, people say there is no love. How much of that is influenced by other people? Television, Internet, "screams of freedom and liberty" from other cultures. All these seem to transform us into impatient, speedy self-gratifying, materialistic animals. Before we tell other people there's no such thing as love, perhaps we should look at ourselves if we can give or are deserving of such love.<br></div>

Thanks, its an interesting idea of controlling one's own destiny.<br><br>However, I would like to highlight then, that there is no particular need to put your love down in words and in clear terms, when all you need to know is that feeling of happiness and joy in your heart.

In fact, logic is derived from reasoning)<br><br>Sometimes, language limits our feelings, just as Science limits how powerful our brain can become.</div>
