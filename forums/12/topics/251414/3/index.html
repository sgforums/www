For once, to be able to 'assume' the role of a lead, nobody else can tell him otherwise because only inside his world of delusion, he could appear larger than life as it critically inflate a small part of his inferior self worth.<br><br>When the masses tell him 'go-get-a-life' - effectively, it's like telling him to wake up from his delusion, deflate his temporal boost in self worth and hurl back to reality... leading that insipid life, job, love and everything else once again.<br><br>Why return being ordinary when he could feel 'extraordinary' dwelling inside this delusion?<br><br>One defensive mechanism employed by the mind is Idealism and interestingly, Idealism also belongs to a Neptune's phenomena, which is the same influence I spoke of in my earlier post.<br><br>Enuff said - last post for this topic. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>
