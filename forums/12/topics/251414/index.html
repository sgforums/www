That is not love.   if love works that way, how easy, aint it?  Then love is not longer as sacred as it is anymore aint it?<br><br>Love is not cruel.  It is beautiful and sweet.<br><br>You are the one being cruel to yourself, by loving someone who does not love you.</div>

Let this be the end.<br><br>You made your first mistake when you paid to talk to that tirak to fill up that void your ex-gf left behind.<br><br><strong>That emptiness feels familiar doesn't it?</strong><br><br>If you revisit GL, you are likely to repeat the same mistake again.<br><br>Life is short, you don't need all these drama in your life.<br><br>There are plenty of other things you should focus on.
