            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by ahish:</div><div class="quote_body">this story goes back a long way.<br><br>(edited) to the US and of course, T and W broke up. That was in June.<br><br>T was devastated of course, although the anguish took away some of the pain. Maybe he saw it coming, that's why he didn't feel as much pain. He hated W for letting herself grow close to that scumbag, and for allowing herself to change into someone she wasn't anymore. T felt empty, but fortunately he still has good friends around him, and sports to occupy his time with.<br><br>This is when Y comes into the picture. As we already knew, Y and T were classmates. They were good friends even when T and W were together. Now that T was single, both of them grew closer. Y accompanied T through all those painful days when he was trying to forget W, soon they were doing almost everything together. Words started to spread that they were an item, judging by the way they were behaving, it's hard to deny. But it was never official.<br><br>Days, weeks, months passed. Both of them seemed satisfied with their current status, enjoying each other's company. They were, afterall, happy with the status they were at. Or at least that's what T thought. Y's friends were asking T why wasn't he making his move. T asked himself the same question too, but he wasn't sure if it's a rebound. He wanted to make sure too, that the feelings were mutual. Maybe they were just super good friends? T was not willing to risk destroying the bridge between him and Y, although her friends were telling him not to worry. T opted to wait, maybe awhile more he told himself.<br><br>In the end awhile more proved too much. Despite constant hints from Y herself, T still opted to wait. It was a mistake. Eventually, finally, suddenly, one fine day Y told T that her ex has patched up with her, her ex from her secondary school days. She was smiling, i smiled back, wished her luck.. we had that if by 25 we are still alone we'll just marry each other(this joke was some time ago).  i said,'good luck and all the best to the 2 of you.. well if it doesn't work out we still can afford to wait till we are 25!' Both of us laughed, but there's sadness in the eyes. I could see it, or maybe Im wrong<br><br>Time passed by. The hurt from the days since Y 'left' remained. The wound was deeper than any other. To T, Y was perfect, she had all the qualities that T wanted in a gf. She was nice, sensitive, caring and really really thoughtful.<br><br>Soon J came into the picture. J was T's first gf, not really counted, considering out age at that time(sec sch). It was more of puppy love and at that time it ended the way all puppy love relationship ends. Hurt as T was, he welcomed any form of encouragement. J never knew about what happened between T and Y, T never said a thing. To him, the days with Y are just really memorable days that should be kept in the corner of his heart. Time passed, T never recovered from the pain of 'losing' Y, but (fast forward abit) he was willing to give it a try with J since.. well.. J initiated.. For some reason T dived head-in into a new relationship with J, thinking that hey, what didnt work out a few years ago in sec sch could actually work now! It was a nice feeling, for reasons my limited vocabulary can't describe.<br><br>To be fair, days with J were awesome. T and J were stuck together 24-7, like siamese twins. Everything they did, everywhere they went, they were together. If not for NS, there won't be any chance of them not seeing each other for more than 1 day! However, they were not without problems. J was a control freak( i know it sounds bad but i don't know how else to put it). T never had time to meet up with his friends/ do things on his own. J wants to see T everyday, wants to make all the decisions, perhaps the closest known example(to T) of a FCP( u know? opposite of MCP) T didn't mind at first, but soon it became obvious that there's no democracy in this relationship. She could do certain things, but T couldn't do the same things because.. to quote.. "i don't like u to do it". T reeeeeeeally didn't mind at first, but of course, he's human after all, there's a limit to how much one could take.<br><br>T resorted to telling lies so that he could meet up with his close buddies, his friends, and Y too when she had serious r/n problems. Late nights were common, cause in the day he had to attend to J. How long can T tahan?<br><br>3+ years went passed, T and J are still(currently) together. Y had since broken up with that guy 1 and a half years ago. The thing now is this, (long story cut short  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> ), T STILL thinks about Y all the time, because to him, Y is perfect( as mentioned earlier). They go out on supper dates and stuff occasionally(getting more and more often now), without the knowledge of J of course. J and T nearly broke up because of her character, but on the basis that she's willing to change they patched back. However, there's no improvement. Although T can and will tolerate, T really see no future for the 2 of them. Instead, he loves it every single time when he's out with Y, they are almost just as close as last time. Y haven't changed a bit( in terms of character), T definitely will love it so much to be able to tell Y that he really likes her, if not the presence of J now. J and T's relationship has deteriorated so much, not because of Y but because their characters simply don't match. As much as they are happy together and as much as they REALLY have feelings for each other, T really cannot stand J's FCP nature.. as much as he can tolerate.<br><br>T's at a lost now.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>Choices...</div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Your first brush of cosmic lesson repulsed your soul so ghastly that your journey in love started going wayward from then onwards. This rancorous taste that lingers in your emotions crystalized into certain perspective-of-hatred which affected your following encounter with other women in your life.<br><br>The wounded protagonist healed by his angel; classic case of falling in love in that manner. When gentleness beset harsh reality like myriad of butterflies surrounding one hornet; we often surrender ourselves to such tenderness. We find ourselves easily drawn towards the ones that took good care of us.<br><br>You spoke about your need to make sure that this ain't a rebound; but all you need is to make sure that you disinfect every fragment of your past BEFORE you step into a new relationship, that's all that is required of you. If you can be fricken certain that you are not retracing your route even if W begs you to return, why is there a need to stall time? This is not calculated wait, in fact, to me, this deliberate wait probably suggested a subconscious-effect from W when relationship is concerned - probably appear in your mind like <span style="font-style: italic;">'love-is-fleeting-not substantial-and-needs-a-little-more-observation-because-past-experience-tells-me-that-I-must-play-safe-to-prevent-myself-from-getting-hurt-once-again'.</span><br><br>And when she got hooked up by some guy, you started regretting.<br><br>Then when J came, immediately, your mind reminded you of your deep regret. It probably goes something like <span style="font-style: italic;">'Although-pain-is-terrible-but-regrets-are-much-worst'.</span> Therefore, as you can see, you readily accepted J.<br><br>Rebound is valid here and the reason why I would say that you are taking J as a substitute for Y is because you have never left your past BEFORE you got onto J. In fact, this 'regret-is-worst-than-pain ideology' became rather strong over time- you even managed to sustain the relationship for three years plus.<br><br>How many 'wrong' choices can you afford to make before the lessons become too costly to bear?<br><br>Think about it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>
