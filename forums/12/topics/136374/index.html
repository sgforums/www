            <div class='col-md body'>It seems so easy to get attached these daysÂ… I see more couples almost everywhere.

I feel especially envious when I see other guys with very pretty &amp; nicely dressed GF. Not only are the gals beautiful &amp; dolled up, they also appeared devoted &amp; loving to their boyfriends.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey dude... let me judge u by wat u've written here, <strong>u r one god-damn boring guy u know tat??</strong><br><br>Now tat I've caught ur attention, please hear me out b4 u start blowing ur top at me, but if u think I sounded unreasonable at any point, please do feel free to flame me.<br><br>Letz turn back the clock to the time when u were with ur ex. Watz ur mindset like at tat time?? Watz makes u attracted to her?? Y didn't u join her when she go clubbing?? Wat makes u break up with her??<br><br>If my deduction is correct,  u didn't spend enuff time with her. U should be the one accompanying her when she go clubbing so u'll get to understand more about her lifestyle. She wore casual clothes when she go out with u because she feels comfortable with u, she even drag herself out of the bed even if she's dead-beat, just to go out with u. But, touch ur heart and ask urself this... will u do the same for her? If not, (no offends but) I believe u chase her just to get the free sex, or some kick from the ego thingy like, "Yo look, I have a gf, and u doesn't have one, sucka!!". Yes?? No??<br><br>Now, turn the clock back to the present time, r ready to<br>1)accept another stranger into ur life??<br>2)Or u wanna get a gf because all ur friends got 1<br>3)because ur lonely<br><br>If itz 2), I suggest u can forget about it _|_ *shows middle finger*, cos u sound like me when I was 10-years-old who wants a multi-button pencil-box, "because all my friends got one, y not me??".<br>U really need to ask urself, do u really need a gf?? Someone who u can speak casually to, someone who can share ur woes, someone who u r willing to dig ur heart out just to show it to her bcos u loved her, despite of her looks.<br><br>Ok, letz now look at the quotes in <span style="color: red;"><strong>RED</strong></span> below. Yeap, I too think this way, but tat was in the past. I asked around, and found out, y. This is wat the gals told me, "They know how to have fun". Yeap, itz tat simple. But besides tat, u have to do some self-observation, "y r they so fun? Wat attracts those babes to them?"<br><br>This is wat I've observed from these so-called J-E-R-Ks(u can also add-in ur own):<br><br>1)They r bold - they dare to do anything for their chicks, without the fear of loosing their ego/face, they protected their gf fiercely and almost always know wat to do in difficult situations.<br><br>2)They know how to have fun - they r playful, but not to the extreme, and they know WHERE to go to have fun<br><br>3)They know how to play dress-up - which means, they know how to impress them at the 1st impression, which counts, bonus points.<br><br>4)They look confident - yes, LOOK confident, but not OVERLY-confident like some ego obsessed freak. The way they talk the talk, walk the walk, the way they carry themselves, they way they make themselves at home/feel comfortable, well tat doesnt mean u can dig ur nose infront of the gals.<br><br>So those jerks ...to us.... are actually very loving bf(not all though) to their gf. As for "devoted gf" they got, tat is only the surface, but u do know it whether they r dating another guy behind their back?? Or they go out with them because of the money? Likewise to the guys.<br><br>ok ok... I'll stop here... getting long-winded. Doubt all of u have the patience to read everything if I write anymore longer.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Prince Cumming:</div><div class="quote_body">It seems so easy to get attached these daysÂ… I see more couples almost everywhere. The moment I leave home, from on board the MRT or bus to the food court for a meal by myself, there is hardly a chance where I wonÂ’t see some loving couples displaying public affections. Not only are there more couples everywhere, the ages of couples are also getting younger, some teenagers around 13-14 holding hands &amp; kissing in public has become a common sight..<br><br>I have long avoided going to Orchard road &amp; most shopping areas, Â‘cos I feel uncomfortable &amp; inferior around all these couples. I feel especially envious when I see other guys with very pretty &amp; nicely dressed GF. Not only are the gals beautiful &amp; dolled up, they also appeared devoted &amp; loving to their boyfriends. A far cry from most of the dates I had so far--- my GF are mostly some plain lookers &amp; most importantly, I feel they hardly love me.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>My last ex was a perpetually busy person--- juggling work, going clubbing till the wee hours with large group of friends every weekend. Everytime she meets me, she would look dead beat, dead broken (usually carrying less than $10) &amp; dressed casually. Am I supposed to feel blessed &amp; proud to have such a GF?? I donÂ’t knowÂ… some may criticize me for having high expectations or not understanding enoughÂ… but I feel rely shortchanged in such a relationship.<br><br>Except for one ole friend who shares some of my sentiments, practically everyone else I know is attached. My classmates, my peers, my cousinsÂ… everyone seems to be attached. I feel so infuriated &amp; desperate sometimes. I really feel desperate now, thinking I should shed all my integrity &amp; kindness , lie &amp; cheat, do whatever it takes to achieve the success long eluding me. Anyway, <span style="color: red;">it seems like the biggest jerks always have the most pretty &amp; devoted GF</span>, at least IÂ’ve seen several such occurrences.  Am I psychotic to think this way??!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br></div></blockquote></div>

Watz ur mindset like at tat time?? Watz makes u attracted to her?? Y didn't u join her when she go clubbing?? Wat makes u break up with her??<br><br>If my deduction is correct,  u didn't spend enuff time with her. U should be the one accompanying her when she go clubbing so u'll get to understand more about her lifestyle. She wore casual clothes when she go out with u because she feels comfortable with u, she even drag herself out of the bed even if she's dead-beat, just to go out with u. But, touch ur heart and ask urself this... will u do the same for her? If not, (no offends but) I believe u chase her just to get the free sex, or some kick from the ego thingy like, "Yo look, I have a gf, and u doesn't have one, sucka!!". Yes?? No??<br><br>Now, turn the clock back to the present time, r ready to<br>1)accept another stranger into ur life??<br>2)Or u wanna get a gf because all ur friends got 1<br>3)because ur lonely<br><br>If itz 2), I suggest u can forget about it _|_ *shows middle finger*, cos u sound like me when I was 10-years-old who wants a multi-button pencil-box, "because all my friends got one, y not me??".<br>U really need to ask urself, do u really need a gf?? Someone who u can speak casually to, someone who can share ur woes, someone who u r willing to dig ur heart out just to show it to her bcos u loved her, despite of her looks.<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>First of all, I wld like to say a <strong><span style="color: red;">BIG THANK YOU </span></strong>for ur controversial but helpful, thoughts-provoking comments.<br><br>After the break-up, I did went thru a deep reflective process---  In fact, she mentioned some of the stuff u said, like how I shld appreciate her efforts for meeting up with me despite her hectic schedules. Why she dressed casually Â‘cos she was tired after the week of work.<br><strong>Now, am I willing to do the same for her? My answer is a honest YES</strong>Â… if anyone wld believe me. The reason I felt Â“shortchangedÂ” Â‘cos IÂ’m one who is willing to do a lot for my partner. Maybe thatÂ’s why I have high expectations towards her as well.<br><br>Put urself in my shoes, do u think u or anyone wld feel <strong>HAPPY</strong> in such a relationship. All the talks wonÂ’t change the fundamental fact that she is a busy person who can gives very little to the relationship.<br>When IÂ’m outside alone or with my frens, I canÂ’t help but wonder why I canÂ’t have a fulfilling &amp; carefree relationships, like the many couples whisking past me. Most of my peers have very free, accommodating girlfriends, nice ppl who wld dressed up &amp; make an effort for their boyfriends.<br><br>Maybe I sound superficial with above wordsÂ… but IÂ’m just being unpretentious abt my feelings.<br><span style="color: #444444;"></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>it's okie to have no gfs becoz u can always tell ppl u are unable to committ in a relationship, or u are no the relationship kind of guy. But dont ever ever tell ppl u are still a virgin, coz that's not okie. it explains why u have no gf. but if u r not a virgin an u got no gf, that's cool.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Guess what, recently at my younger brothers (he is 14 btw) birthday party, he introduced me to his galfriend! Some chirpy convent gal.. He cheekily asked me what I thought of her.<br><br>"Well u guys get things started really early these days", mustering some humor to cover my shock/embarassment.. I dun know what I was feeling then, I guess it's just a confluence of emotions. It was a horrible night, the fact that it was a party pack with 14 year olds didn't make things any better.<br><br>The next few nights actually got me thinking abt myself; a self-examination of sorts. Was it just me? Or pherhaps I haven't met the right person yet or worst I'm destined to be single all my life. I just slept through it all and woke up the next morning likes if nothings happended. Such is life.<br><br>So.. I think U should just let things run its course. I feel if you push the issue, you'll just end up hurting yourself. I'm sure sometime soon some gal will come knocking at the door.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br></div>
