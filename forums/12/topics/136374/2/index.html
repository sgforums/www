Why she dressed casually Â‘cos she was tired after the week of work.<br><strong>Now, am I willing to do the same for her? My answer is a honest YES</strong>Â… if anyone wld believe me. The reason I felt Â“shortchangedÂ” Â‘cos IÂ’m one who is willing to do a lot for my partner. Maybe thatÂ’s why I have high expectations towards her as well.<br><br>Put urself in my shoes, do u think u or anyone wld feel <strong>HAPPY</strong> in such a relationship. All the talks wonÂ’t change the fundamental fact that she is a busy person who can gives very little to the relationship.<br>When IÂ’m outside alone or with my frens, I canÂ’t help but wonder why I canÂ’t have a fulfilling &amp; carefree relationships, like the many couples whisking past me. Most of my peers have very free, accommodating girlfriends, nice ppl who wld dressed up &amp; make an effort for their boyfriends.<br><br>Maybe I sound superficial with above wordsÂ… but IÂ’m just being unpretentious abt my feelings.<br><span style="color: #444444;"></span>[/b]</blockquote>By the way, have you considered that maybe you would be a happier person being single?

            <div class='col-md body'>Jeezez Christ.. lol! Mr Prince Cummings.. first of all i would just want to point out a few things. No doubt some things u say maybe true, but somethings u just gotta sit down..think about it n just get on with ur life man. I am sure u are not the only guy that is thinking these things ya? Well, u cant compare man.. if u keep comparing u will never be satisfied with what u got.. what about those other ppl who got not so pretty gfs...i didnt hear u say anything about that ? What if a girl puts u in the topic n starts bitching n moaning about u..n u are not exactly super hot too rite ? man...   i got nothing to say , all the dudes above have pretty much summed up what i wanted to say..but yeah , with a gf its gonna cost u more.. n kiss ur freedom goodbye... imagine chained to the big iron ball... ur passport needs chopped..u go figure it out  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">  be happy when u got something..or u gonna get bupcus..</div>
