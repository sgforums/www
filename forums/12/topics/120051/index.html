You will most likely end up being implicated in a lot of unwanted problems if you develop anything with your colleague.<br><br>Remember, the problem is between you and your boyfriend so you have to speak up to him. It is inevitable that one party may be too busy and neglect the other. Ask yourself, there are times when you are just too preoccupied with so many things on hand to bother about him too.<br><br>Try to be understanding and talk things out. Meet up with your own circle of friends, preferably girls, and watch some movies, drink some coffee or something. At this point in your life now, it is very dangerous if you start meeting up with strangers of the opposite sex because you just don't know what you may get yourself into.<br><br>Good luck! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Have a heart-to-heart talk with your boyfriend. Tell him what's on your mind - that you feel neglected. At the same time, show concern for him. Understand that as much as you want it to be true, his life does not solely revolve around you. He also has parents to care for, a job to do, and in general, a life to live.<br><br>Meanwhile, if you're thinking of being the third party in another relationship, I have a one-word advice for you:<br><br>DON'T.<br><br>You'll end up hurting a lot of people. You'll hurt your boyfriend by cheating on him, you'll hurt the guy's wife by cheating with her husband, you'll hurt the guy's children by showing them that papa has loose morals and you'll hurt the guy by straining his relationship with his wife.<br><br>In the end, you're going to end up really hurt with the realisation that you had hurt so many people.</div>

I have my best friend, always lamenting about not being able to find the right mate. She have everything a guy would seek and when potentials floods in - everyone were eliminated mentally.<br><br>Deep down inside, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>it is her who cannot commit and she knows it</strong>. </span>Her past relationship wound her deeply and she prefer to keep things this way.<br><br>Next thing? An affair with a married man.<br><br>***<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Learn to remove obstacles in a manner where it wouldn't leave regrets and marks on your life forever. Since you are in relationship, until the day it fails you, you ought to upkeep what is neccessary in your relationship as a girlfriend. You can pursue for the kind of relationship you want, even if he is married, but terminate whatsoever bonds you have first.<br><br>Or if you have persisted in your relationship and earn insight in how to make them better - you would have level up your relationship to the next level.<br><br>P.S: Never choose alternatives by leaping ships. Always attempt to repair damage first. Of course, unless you chose to abandon ship.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>
