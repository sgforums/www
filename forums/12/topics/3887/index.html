            <div class='col-md body'>you want the scientific explanation or not?? anyway doubt you will reply this soon might as well give it to you.<br><br>Psychologically, all of us enjoy being touched.. and we have to be touched. When we are babies, we have to be touch, carried, cuddled, play with, if not we will be kind of anti-social and will not developed fully.<br><br>There was this experiment that they put a toy for a boy to play, and not to bother him anymore. then a girl is given all the hugz and touches, all the physical stuff. the boy is happy with the toy, but later shows result that the boy is kind of anti-social and not fully developed up to the stage that it should as a baby.<br><br>Then there was another case of 2 groups of babies from an orphange, one is a slightly smarter, and the others are a little bit slow.. So 2 psychologists put the groups of 13 babies in the care of some mentally  retarded 'mothers', who didn't do a good job of taking care, but provided play, hugz and love. Left the other 13, who are considered smarted in the hands of the normal hands of the people in the orphanage, which has limited attention and stuff other than being fed, and clothed. 2 yrs later, they were tested of their IQ, and the supposed to be mentally retarded children gained 28 pts in IQ and those supposed to be smarter ones lost 30 pts. further research shows, the supposed to be mentally well children have only average of primary 6 education and only 2 got married. The other supposed to be retarded group had 5 in the uni, one even went for graduate school, and 11 of them got married. MOst importantly, these 13 people are more self-supportive and hold higher paying jobs than the other group.<br><br>Coming back to our discussion, many of us love to be touched, but we don't get it esp in the lonely isle of sg. Our parents don't hugs us much anymore, don't kiss us much anymore, even simple words like "I love you"s from parents also no longer exist. What we get is non-expressive ways of love, so we tend to look for outside people to get some physical attention. furthermore, boys being the supposed to be more independent kind loses the parental touches than girls, so may lead to more wanting to be touched by people, esp by girls.<br><br>Besides, experts say we need a healthy dose of 14 hugz each day on an average to be developed fully and psychologically satisfied even as an adult. Not saying you must find a gf/bf and hug. It's a sad thing that the sg doesn't have this practice, but even amongst guys and guys, it's considered a hug and is healthy, but passer-bys and the framework that we have in our minds had turn off that idea. the fault of society...<br><br>Talk too much liaoz. like written essays for my psych/soci exam.. hahaha~ sorryz if I have bored you.<br><br>------------------<br>()""()     ************************<br>( 'o' )     Barely Bearing Berry Belly Bear<br>(,) (,)   =======================<br>(.)_(.) Beary Bear *Huggiez*...<br>~.~.~. For you, I care and love.</div>
