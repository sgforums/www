Imagine the fuel meter in a car -people who wants to commit suicide will gradually increase this meter through 'anyhow' thinking, agitation occurs from the girl in the picture, etc. Such events will add the fuel and increase the meter and when this meter reaches the limit, the victim will be momentarily blinded consciously and do something that he will not have the courage to do before. When that happens, the meter will fall and they will immediately regret what is happening but its too late - wham~ death door waits for him. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>If you want to prevent him from killing himself - you have to prevent this meter from rising. There are several ways to do it, but everything has to be tackled psychologically, not emotionally - because he is emotionally unstable, so more emotional statement will add fuel instead of decreasing it. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Handle psychologically, you have to force the rational mind to overpower the emotional mind - hell of a difficult (emotions are 24 times stronger). People who always threaten to kill them because it *SEEMED* effective and it is a unhealthy form of wanting attraction -both people around and the person involved. Deep within them - there is a gnawing sense of inferiority hidden. People like your friend locks himself in a mental prison and practise selective preception (only listen and believe things he WANTS to believe or listen to) - you have to destroy this defensive wall and shock his conscious about his stupidity, ignorance and ultimate lamest. This wall will reconstructure itself every now and then whenever helpful words/people aren't around and try to increase the meter. But as long as you keep it below the limit level - he won't kill himself. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>P.S: To people who wants to commit suicide because of a girl/guy - go ahead if you want to regret. Know why? Because you will come to discover after your pitiful death that your absense does absolutely NOTHING to his/her life and eventually YOU WILL BE FORGOTTEN. Understand it now - don't exchange your life for such mundune life lesson. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Copy and past from another thread<br><br>Saw this in another forum. True a not I dunno,<br><br>Deaths from suicides are classified as 'sudden deaths' or suspicious deaths and the dead body is subjected to a compulsory post mortem ordered by the state coroner.<br>In a post mortem, the totally naked exposed body is first photographed many times then opened up with an incision from the top of the neck extending vertically down to the level of the pubic bone. All the internal organs are removed, photographed, weighed, sliced and diced for samples sent for further microscopic examination. The skull is sawed open and the entire brain removed and subjected to the same. In matured female bodies, the sex organs are examined as well. Finally, the rest of the sliced and diced organs including the brain is put back into the body cavity and sewn up.<br><br>Another one. Also from another forum. This is what before the wake.<br><br>the UPS (undertaken parcel service) will deliver the body to the wake. and they will then cordon off an area and start the embalming and light make up for the body.<br><br>what they do is they will make an incision at your neck and another incision near the collar bone. Two tubes will be inserted into the incisions. After the incision, to prevent it from closing in..a piece of flesh of the windpipe or throat will be pulled out and twisted and held in place by a pair of tweezers.<br><br>One is connected to an empty platic bag and another is connected to bottle of chemical (the embalming chemical). after that, the mortician will start pressing on your body lift your hands and whatever...and the fluid of life(blood) will be slowly drained from your body...due to the siphoning effect, at the same time the embalming chemical will be pumped into the body.<br><br>the effect of seeing blood flowing out into the bag feels awfully strange and a sense of sadness dawns on you...yeah..life is fragile...<br><br>once that's done...he will proceed to stiching up and closing your incisions. next step would be make up for the corpse. and its very very hard to do make up for a corspe. you would need a very very strong and bright foundation and blusher and all...<br><br>after that, its time to prop up your facial features to make it look more lifelike. double sided tape is stuck behind your ears, your eyelids, underneath your lips to make it smile. before he sticks your lips together,<br><br>here's the buddhist/taoist phase of the process:<br>he inserts a pearl into your mouth under your tongue..cos the pearl is suppose to shine a light on the path for the soul in the underworld. it is so that the soul would be able to make his/her way to the reincarnation cycle.<br><br></div>
