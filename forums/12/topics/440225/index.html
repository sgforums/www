              <p>I have this problem.</p>
              <p>"The girls whom I like, always stay far away from me. However, the girls whom I don't like, like to stay close to me".</p>
              <p>Here is the start of my problem. I started to have feelings for this girl, A. Miss A gives me the hot and cold treatment. She sometimes, want me to go out with her. When she calls me out, I am either sick, busy or out of the country. When I call her, she is always busy or having meetings.</p>
              <p>I am tired of Miss A's hot and cold treatment. Then during one time when Miss A ask me to come out with her friends, she didn't turn up. Instead, Miss B, turns up.</p>
              <p>Miss B seem to show an interest in me. She always ask me to accompany her back home and want me to take her around. I have nothing against Miss B, she is a nice person. I like Miss B to be friends. However, I have known Miss B for 2 years, I have thought a lot about it, I just don't have anything in common with Miss B. Furthermore, I have no feelings for Miss B, no chemistry. I only like to be friends with Miss B. I have given all the opportunity to go out with Miss B but I still don't have any feelings for her.</p>
              <p>The problem is how to shake Miss B off, without being rude to her? Should I wait until she confesses her feelings for me, then I let her know that we are just friends?</p>
              <p>I am tired of these games. It seems everytime I like somebody, she would stay far away from me, and the person that I am not interested in, always want to be with me.</p>
              <p>I am just tired, I have nothing in common with Miss B. I like to go play board games like Catan, etc. I tried to take Miss B to play board games, but she is not interested. Miss B is interested in kids, she keeps on talking to me about her students (she is a teacher), but I am just not so keen. However Miss B is a nice person, I like her kindness and caring personality, its just that I have no feelings for her except as friends !</p>
              <p>Please HELP ME, ADVICE ? I don't want to offend Miss B nor do I want to lose her as a friend. However, I am tired of not being able to get Miss A's attention.</p>

              <p><br>You are so right. I believe Miss A doesn't want to hurt my feelings, so she is trying to push to Miss B.</p>
              <p>There can only be two reasons:</p>
              <p>a) Miss A could be secretly going out with another guy</p>
              <p>b) Miss A is not interested in me</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now, I am trying to wriggle myself out of Miss B. I don't want to offend her or the friends around us, so I want to do this nicely. Perhaps I should lay low for a while and avoid some social activities. However, next month, one of my friends is having a wedding, I got a feeling Miss B is going to ask me to give her a ride to the wedding.</p>
              <p>I think by laying low, quickly give a big message to my circle of friends that I can at least have the decency not to fool myself and realise the truth that Miss A ain't interested in me. However, I am afriad Miss A may try to push hard Miss B on me, as she doesn;t want to feel the guilt of rejecting me.</p>

              <p><br>I don't understand, the marriage institution must be going on for thousands of years since the dawn of mankind. There must be a matching equilibrium ! You understand the power of demand and supply? Eventually my demand will drop until it reaches the same supply. That is the price !</p>
              <p>Why is it so hard to find a life partner? Frankly speaking, Miss A is not a Chio Bu, definitely not. I got interest in Miss A because she likes to joke and she is a nice person. My circle of friends always call Miss A, teasing names because she is known for her clumsiness.</p>
              <p>My taste is not high ! I am seeking a simple person who is not materialistic. Miss A is one such person. I just don't understand why. Am I so bad? Perhaps this is the reason: I am 5 years older than Miss A. But I am same age with Miss B.</p>

              TS,
              Love is not a business, it feels that you seem to be comparing, weighing the pros and cons like it is an investment.
              One may calculate and hedge one's bets in a business but when it concerns the heart, no such thing unless it is one's mind pretending!

              <p>"The girls whom I like, always stay far away from me. However, the girls whom I don't like, like to stay close to me".</p>
              <p>Here is the start of my problem. I started to have feelings for this girl, A. Miss A gives me the hot and cold treatment. She sometimes, want me to go out with her. When she calls me out, I am either sick, busy or out of the country. When I call her, she is always busy or having meetings.</p>
              <p>I am tired of Miss A's hot and cold treatment. Then during one time when Miss A ask me to come out with her friends, she didn't turn up. Instead, Miss B, turns up.</p>
              <p>Miss B seem to show an interest in me. She always ask me to accompany her back home and want me to take her around. I have nothing against Miss B, she is a nice person. I like Miss B to be friends. However, I have known Miss B for 2 years, I have thought a lot about it, I just don't have anything in common with Miss B. Furthermore, I have no feelings for Miss B, no chemistry. I only like to be friends with Miss B. I have given all the opportunity to go out with Miss B but I still don't have any feelings for her.</p>
              <p>The problem is how to shake Miss B off, without being rude to her? Should I wait until she confesses her feelings for me, then I let her know that we are just friends?</p>
              <p>I am tired of these games. It seems everytime I like somebody, she would stay far away from me, and the person that I am not interested in, always want to be with me.</p>
              <p>I am just tired, I have nothing in common with Miss B. I like to go play board games like Catan, etc. I tried to take Miss B to play board games, but she is not interested. Miss B is interested in kids, she keeps on talking to me about her students (she is a teacher), but I am just not so keen. However Miss B is a nice person, I like her kindness and caring personality, its just that I have no feelings for her except as friends !</p>
              <p>Please HELP ME, ADVICE ? I don't want to offend Miss B nor do I want to lose her as a friend. However, I am tired of not being able to get Miss A's attention.</p>

              <p><br>You are so right. I believe Miss A doesn't want to hurt my feelings, so she is trying to push to Miss B.</p>
              <p>There can only be two reasons:</p>
              <p>a) Miss A could be secretly going out with another guy</p>
              <p>b) Miss A is not interested in me</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now, I am trying to wriggle myself out of Miss B. I don't want to offend her or the friends around us, so I want to do this nicely. Perhaps I should lay low for a while and avoid some social activities. However, next month, one of my friends is having a wedding, I got a feeling Miss B is going to ask me to give her a ride to the wedding.</p>
              <p>I think by laying low, quickly give a big message to my circle of friends that I can at least have the decency not to fool myself and realise the truth that Miss A ain't interested in me. However, I am afriad Miss A may try to push hard Miss B on me, as she doesn;t want to feel the guilt of rejecting me.</p>

              <p>I am thinking the same thing too. There is this guy, always seem to follow her around.</p>
              <p>This is why I am deciding to lay low and not contact my circle of friends for awhile, so I can avoid Miss B. I know Miss B would take any opportunity to ask me to take her out in our friends outing, if she ask, it be very hard for me to say no, because its like very rudely rejecting a girl, and people don;t like that.</p>
              <p>Also avoiding everyone for a while, would tell them the message that I am not interested.</p>

              <p><br>Cannot do like that. I cannot tell Miss B that unless Miss B expresses her interest in me. All Miss B did was to pester me to give her a ride back home, follow me around. All these are indications but not 100% confirmation.</p>
              <p>A girl would feel insulted if I tell her that I am not interested in her. She will surely deny that she like me.

So I am not going to go out and entertain Miss B, instead I try to be nice to Miss B but emphasis that we are just friends.</p>

              <p>The best diplomacy is to stop hanging out with this circle of friends, or hang out less. My absence will make Miss B sense that I am not interested and that I have more important things to do than to hang out with Miss B and her friends.</p>
              <p>The point here is to try not to be hostile or diplomatically tell miss B you're not interested. Some women tend to misread this kind of diplomacy as "trying to play harder to get or pure ignorance", so they become ever more aggressive.</p>
              <p>Moreover, to these circle of friends, they will gang up with Miss A and Miss B to force me play this silly game of cat and mouse: Me chase Miss A, Miss B chase me. In the end, I grow exhausted until I learn to accept Miss B. Its an unfair game that is designed to Miss A and Miss B's advantage.</p>
              <p>I shall not fall into this silly games. That is why, I intend to lay low and cut down my social contacts with Miss A &amp; B and their circle of friends for several months. Making myself not available will tend to frustrate them.</p>
