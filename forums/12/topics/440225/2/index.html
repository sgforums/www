              <p>I have this problem.</p>
              <p>"The girls whom I like, always stay far away from me. However, the girls whom I don't like, like to stay close to me".</p>
              <p>Here is the start of my problem. I started to have feelings for this girl, A. Miss A gives me the hot and cold treatment. She sometimes, want me to go out with her. When she calls me out, I am either sick, busy or out of the country. When I call her, she is always busy or having meetings.</p>
              <p>I am tired of Miss A's hot and cold treatment. Then during one time when Miss A ask me to come out with her friends, she didn't turn up. Instead, Miss B, turns up.</p>
              <p>Miss B seem to show an interest in me. She always ask me to accompany her back home and want me to take her around. I have nothing against Miss B, she is a nice person. I like Miss B to be friends. However, I have known Miss B for 2 years, I have thought a lot about it, I just don't have anything in common with Miss B. Furthermore, I have no feelings for Miss B, no chemistry. I only like to be friends with Miss B. I have given all the opportunity to go out with Miss B but I still don't have any feelings for her.</p>
              <p>The problem is how to shake Miss B off, without being rude to her? Should I wait until she confesses her feelings for me, then I let her know that we are just friends?</p>
              <p>I am tired of these games. It seems everytime I like somebody, she would stay far away from me, and the person that I am not interested in, always want to be with me.</p>
              <p>I am just tired, I have nothing in common with Miss B. I like to go play board games like Catan, etc. I tried to take Miss B to play board games, but she is not interested. Miss B is interested in kids, she keeps on talking to me about her students (she is a teacher), but I am just not so keen. However Miss B is a nice person, I like her kindness and caring personality, its just that I have no feelings for her except as friends !</p>
              <p>Please HELP ME, ADVICE ? I don't want to offend Miss B nor do I want to lose her as a friend. However, I am tired of not being able to get Miss A's attention.</p>
