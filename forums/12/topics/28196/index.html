            <div class='col-md body'>I need real help...<br>I'm 15 years old and I am really badly in love with someone who is much older than me. He was a teacher at my school and he left around 2 years ago due to student problems or something. I know what you're already thinking and how teenager hormones tend to mess up around now and make you think you are in love but I really do like him. Not because I'm physically attracted to him, its more of a mental thing. He just reminded me of me when I was younger for some reason and I found him incredibly amusing and I really liked him. We got on quite well with each other and sometimes I get the feeling he liked me a lot too.<br>When he left I was seriously depressed, even now I haven't got over him and I think about him everyday and I keep wishing to be with him because out of all the people in the world, hes the only one I can really trust. I've never been a social person so I never really told anyone my troubles and if I was to I'm sure they'd laugh. Even my parents aren't that close to me and I just want to spend the rest of my days with the person I love. During half term a year ago, I got really depressed. I have asthma and I had to go into hospital a few times because I couldn't breath. It made me realise how he didn't know what I felt and I didn't want to die without him knowing how much I cared for him. He was at least 35 and he wasn't that popular with anyone, he had lived alone most his life and was always very lonely and had been through life alone like myself. I didn't want him to carry on thinking no one cared about him so I wrote him a letter telling him about my feelings. I don't know if he got it but I never got a reply...<br>Despite the amount of people who frown on such a thing, I know I'm supposed to be with him for the rest of my life. Its a gut feeling. I don't care about the age difference. He has made me happier than I ever thought I could be and I like to think its the same his way too. We haven't seen each other for so long that it makes me depressed and I dunno what to do. I can't tell anyone but I'm so lonely and confused. I just want to see him. What should I do?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thunderbug,<br><br>Hahaha...ur post reminds me of my younger days when i had a serious Crush on my music teacher for 2 yrs!!! Heheehe.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> Those were the days....but anyway.....it'd prefer to look at ur problem this way.<br><br><strong>1) U mentioned tt u r not too close to ur parents<br>2) He's living alone most of the time......juz like u</strong><br><br>Hmm...these r 2 impt pts to note <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">By u/standing them, u'll realize tt the kind of feelings u have for him is "REAL" but not exactly "LOVE". </span></strong>It's highy possible tt u have taken a liking to this teacher due the FACT tt ur parents arent close to u. Well, it is proven tt teenagers who have crush on the Older Guys r lack of attention fr their parents, usually the father. At the same, maybe u'd like to know tt whether or not it's men or women, we tend to look for traits tt r found in our father or mother. <span style="color: darkred;">Similarly, umany actually fall for this teacher bcoz of tt.....either he resembles ur dad or may be having a certain trait in him which u hope tt ur dad will possess but yet not <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> </span><br><br>Another thing is tt u may need to try toking to ur parents abt how u feel, not necessarily abt this Crush but in general, like u guyz need some communication.....they r missing out on a lot of stuffs in their daughter's  Life.....tell them u want their attention. Why did i say so? <span style="color: darkred;">U r actually "sympathizing" ur teacher coz he's in the same plight as u. U feel lonely for the lack of attention &amp; emotionally-deprived of care &amp; concern......U r having this Crush for many reasons coz he "seems" to u/stand ur situation.......u want someone to share ur Life......someone who has gone thru the same thing. </span><br><br>Thunderbug, there's nth wrong abt liking someone who 20 yrs ur senior, as long as Love exists. However, in ur case, i dun wanna make any comment tt u r actually be fooling urself abt this Crush or watsoever....i'd like u to know tt there r in fact other factors tt lead u to experience this Crush...it's not a "pure" Crush....How do i explain tt?...<span style="color: red;"><br><br>Imagine u r early for afternoon school but u dun wish to arrive in sch tt early, so u went to the nearby Mac to sit ard bfe time's up for sch. When u r there, u'd be buying a some fries + drink to pass ur time away. Ur intention isnt to get the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">fries + drink </span>but u still get them bcoz u dun wanna go to sch early. </span> Now, u may be having having an <span style="text-decoration: underline;">"unintended" Crush </span> coz u r not able to receive the kind of attention u need at home, so u place the Focus on him.<br><br>It's perfectly normal feel this way, even older "teenagers" like us make us silly mistakes......we laugh at ourselves sometimes....hahahhaa <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Why dun u cheer up abit, try toking to some counsellors in ur sch who can listen to ur story &amp; be helping u? Update us k? Gd Luck! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
