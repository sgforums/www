            <div class='col-md body'>Live in terrace house, near the corner of the street where it's a dead end. Structure of these houses means great acoustics, echos. E.g from inside my house, I can hear toilet flushes, phones ringing, showers running etc in the housees opposite or diagonal (of course, the houses beside mine also lah).<br><br>Some people moved in recently, just days ago. Into the house opposite. Today is the 3rd day running(mon-wed), that there are sounds coming from that house starting around 9am. The sounds will be on and off(4-5 outbursts every hour), intensifying around evening, and finally dying off around 11pm-this is true for past 2 nites, so I believe it won't be any different tonite. Sounds include singing, talking, laughing, shouting,clapping,guitar,basketball. If I pay attention, I can sometimes make out lyrics of what they're singing, and what their conversations are about. Most of them are young people, maybe secondary school to uni-age.<br><br>Make no mistake, I'm not against social gatherings that take place within your home. But this is the 3rd day in a row, from 9am til 11pm (which is normal waking hrs for most pple) !! So for while I'm awake, I gotta listen to this everyday?!! It's ridiculous!! I've lived here over 10 years. These pple haven't even been here a week!! I mean, be considerate!! Close your doors and turn on the air-con or something.<br><br>I haven't approached them cos I might lose control of my temper n blow up in their faces. But I'm not sure I can take this much longer.<br><br></div>

Like just a friendly visit or something?
