Siblings get jealous all the time.<br><br>U have to think what caused her jealousy. Is it simply about family money? U said u r the only male. Think whether ur parents have shown more attention to u. This might be the root cause of her jealousy. Or some other reasons?<br><br>Y am I saying this? Coz if ur older sis truly loves u and has no issues in her heart, she won't show black face or get jealous about u spending the family money......in fact the opposite, she'll even might want to help u herself too.
