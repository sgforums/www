No biggie, everyone has their limitations. But what makes you crack to that point? Would it be too much criticism from the people you love? Consistent reminders of your bad past (if you had one)? Always told your incorrigible, never-changing? etc? Share.</div></blockquote>Hmm...most of the time it happens when one cannot see or bear to live tomorrow's life with their current sadness/depression. Sometimes, it happens when people watched too much movies and they subconsciously reacted to this form of behaviour to appease their own sadness/depression. But, nobody will have the courage to actually kill themselves unless they are already at their most desperate ends of their mind, and sometimes they preferred to kill others if they do not have the courage to take their own life.<br><br>Yes, it's true that everyone has their own limitations to their own sadness/depression. Everyone has their own sad experiences in their lives that they cannot overcome the grief with and still griefing over it. And this is the cracking point that they don't allow anyone to make fun of or criticised or reminded of. And nobody should ever even try to find out each other's cracking point and take advantage of it. Unfortunately, in this world...there are alot of sick people around us that will not hesitate to take advantage of each other's weakness to lord over each other. To be frank, this includes a lot of people in our lives including those we grew up with, friends, colleagues, and even people very close to us. So beware and never trust your cracking point to anyone but yourself...unless you have confidence in that person. And never to trust those to whatever counsellers or psychiatrics or social workers, cos even if they're trained to advise and absorb and work in that line of field, cos ultimately they're STRANGERS.<br><br>Taking own life is never the ultimate solution to any trouble/situation/sadness/depression, it is just the best way of escape from life itself. It requires more courage to wake up everyday and face the life in our future than to end it all within 20 seconds. (Heard that a person still possess 20 seconds of consciousness before going to see their maker <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">)<br><br>Funny thing is, people never die for themselves. Examples like dying for love, money, work, school, pets. So think first before you really take your life, cos you could easily laugh it off and live another day. When you think that all hopes in this world has failed you, the remaining uncertaincies that you haven't thought of will definitely overwhelm it and you will begin to see life after it if you just hold onto life itself for one more day. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Good luck all, take care and have alot of fun being alive. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>

It's a 'release' with a high price to pay for. Everything you've got. Imagine having to suffer all this while and end your life from there. Then your life would be nothing but sufferings... Carrying on buys you a chance at something which could be so very different.... Sort of like your life paying back to you...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
