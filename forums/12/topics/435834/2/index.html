              <p>There's a saying like: "Don't do shit at the workplace". I don't
                  mean to say that what you're doing is but it's true, keep conduct
                  at the workplace professional. And affairs can seriously mean a

Not worth it if anything happen. You get boot out and that is the end of your salary. For her, still ok, she's still young and can work any company. Unlike you. So think carefully, as what other forumer said: Dont shit at your company backyard.</p></div>

              <p>First of all, I would like to take this opportunity to thank all of you for your time to read this thread and provide me valuable advice and comments.</p>
              <p>I'm sincerely grateful to all of you and your strong comments have saved me from further drowning myself.</p>
              <p>Well, you may not trust my word but please believe me, don't condemn me at this point of time. I need to talk to someone about this but I have none to tell. So I come here for help. I am trying my best to keep myself away from the temptations.</p>
              <p>Though it's difficult to stay clean, I will definitely make sure I don't cross the thin line.</p>
              <p>I will always re-visit this thread and update for any progress. It won't be bad news, I strongly believe.</p>
              <p>I'm going to distant myself from this girl.</p>
              <p>Communicate only on work related issues.</p>
              <p>I will always come back to read the comments here so as to keep myself afloat.</p>
              <p>Times will tell. May God bless and help me.</p>

              <p>i also agree with all the other posts about focussing and not putting your job on the line.</p>
              <p>Me think if the communication with your wife improves, then you emotional gaps will be more occupied leaving less room for the chiobu at work. The remaining urges will just have to be controlled.</p>

              <div>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">I posted but it didn't show up so I re-post it. Moderator please remove it for double posting.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">I really feel shameful and sorry for what I'm going to describe in the following.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">My company recently employed a female staff to be my assistant.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">She is cute and friendly.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">The first time I saw her, she caught my attention. Most of the time I did not dare to look into her eyes directly while talking to her, worry that I might not be able to carry on with my points. Sometimes I too noticed that she tried to avoid my eyes during conversation relating to work.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">Sooner I knew I have a crush on her. I'm also aware that I should NOT even have such feeling towards a young girl like her (she's 20 yrs younger than me) in the first place.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">She is the reason I go to office daily.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">I'll miss her whenever she's out of office.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">I feel like a kid looking for candies.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">I want to know more about her.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">I want to take her out for dinner.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">If she rejects me, end of the story, period. Carry on with my life.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">Otherwise I'll be sorry for what I did.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">I'm sorry because I'm already married to a lovely wife. I still love my wife as much as she loves me. However I must agree that we communicate very much lesser than before.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">I think my mind is going haywire, something in there not right. I'm sick!</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">Am I terribly crazy? Am I wrong to fall for a young girl? Is there any way to cure my sick mind? Is it evil for me to have such thought of loving another girl beside the one I should love?</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">Is there anyone who read this thread had the same situation as mine? Please share with me your story and how did you handle it.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">I don't want to hurt anybody.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">I want to know how should I overcome this crisis.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">I worry that the lack of concentration on my work will affect my performance.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">Thank you so much for the advice. Be it bad or good. Very much appreciated.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">Sorry if I have asked too much.</p>

              Ts,
              
              ""I'm sorry because I'm already married to a lovely wife. I still love my wife as much as she loves me. However I must agree that we communicate very much lesser than before"
              
              The aforementioned suffices to that the marriage has become a ''jaded'' affair for u. That seems to be the predicament That gal in your office has brought out what has been repressed within you. Probably, something that has been latent in your unconscious (most likely repressed) has surfaced. 
              As to what it is that is repressed/denied/ignored will not go away. It will surface and till you recognize, undestand and hopefully reconcile to that aspect .... u may stay in the marriage, u may ignore this gal, but it does not go away. Itr will sooner or later happen elsewhere!
              
              The problem is not being married or being in a relationship. The problem is that in the house just like the tv, sofa .... the human BEINGS in the household have also unconsciously become ''things''. Used and put aside and only to be used again. Of course, it is perfecly alrite to that with a tv or ... human beings need to relate and when that element is absent - ithe inexorable ''demise'' is bound to happen and the next thing is one feels trapped and one wants to escape.
              
              Escaping works but only for a while. No one can ''fix'' it and one is doomed to repeat the same old melodrama and disillusionment sets in.

              <p>To the thread starter, I sympathize with your situation. On one hand, I feel that you're a nice person because at least you understand that you have a wife and you're married and you understand all that you're doing doesn't seems right. On the other hand, you wanted to get together with that new girl.</p>
              <p>There is no right answer to your situation. Morally right decision is to focus on your work and your marriage, not that girl. But on the other hand, I know of so many husbands who strayed and have mistress outside so I'm not going to make you feel bad. I really sympathize with your situation.</p>
              <p>I think you need to weigh the pros and cons. What happens if the r/s cause you to lose your job, can you afford that to happen? What if your wife finds out and divorce you, can you afford that to happen? If all that doesn't matter, then perhaps, you should give that girl a shot and see if anything happens.</p>
              <p>Seriously, whatever you do, make sure your backside is covered.</p>
