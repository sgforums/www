              <p>I think the decent thing to do is to use your feelings and perhaps try and link that to why and whether u long for something you may not be getting from the partner whom u love.</p>
              <p>e.g. u may feel like holding the newbie's hand. Is that because you don't hold your partner's hand often and long to do so?</p>
              <p>So i think try and use it constructively and stay faithful to your wife. 20 years your junior.....treat her like a daughter and try and get rid of the creepy thoughts.</p>

              Ts,
              
              Be faitfhul to your ''self'' first really helps , otherwise being faithful to another cos u are married to someone is deluding oneself.  An obligation is an albatross around one's psyche! It is delibitating and energy-sapping.
              
              Reconcile to the conflicting emotions, the ''past'' baggage and it may avail u of ''Ã¡nswers.''
              
              One cannot give what one oneself does not have within oneself. 
              As for having a crush or what you will - it is perfectly ok, but to think that it is real, is utter folly. It is a projection of what is within oneself that has surfaced. It could have been somthing of the past (unreconciled/denied) and if not for this gal, it would still not go away.
              
              Circumstances dont make a person, it reveals what one is all about!

              <p>i would strongly encourage such passionate relationships at work...your daily attendance (even sacrificing annual leave and MCs) to come to work to see her is commendable....if i m the boss..i will doubly make her pressure u to perform better..hahahhahahahaa</p>

              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">I posted but it didn't show up so I re-post it. Moderator please

              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">I really feel shameful and sorry for what I'm going to describe in
                  the following.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">My company recently employed a female staff to be my assistant.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">She is cute and friendly.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">The first time I saw her, she caught my attention. Most of the time
                  I did not dare to look into her eyes directly while talking to her,
                  worry that I might not be able to carry on with my points.
                  Sometimes I too noticed that she tried to avoid my eyes during
                  conversation relating to work.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">Sooner I knew I have a crush on her. I'm also aware that I should
                  NOT even have such feeling towards a young girl like her (she's 20
                  yrs younger than me) in the first place.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">She is the reason I go to office daily.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">I'll miss her whenever she's out of office.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">I feel like a kid looking for candies.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">I want to know more about her.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">I want to take her out for dinner.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">If she rejects me, end of the story, period. Carry on with my
                  life.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">Otherwise I'll be sorry for what I did.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">I'm sorry because I'm already married to a lovely wife. I still
                  love my wife as much as she loves me. However I must agree that we
                  communicate very much lesser than before.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">I think my mind is going haywire, something in there not right. I'm
                  sick!</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">Am I terribly crazy? Am I wrong to fall for a young girl? Is there
                  any way to cure my sick mind? Is it evil for me to have such
                  thought of loving another girl beside the one I should love?</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">Is there anyone who read this thread had the same situation as

                  it.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">I don't want to hurt anybody.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">I want to know how should I overcome this crisis.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">I worry that the lack of concentration on my work will affect my

              <p>He probably never had so much control over a woman up till now.
              I'm sure his own wife hardly make him feel so powerful at home.</p>
              <p>As his assistant... she is behaving
              "<strong>submissively</strong>".. to her boss.. that's what is
              turning him into a tikoh pek.</p>
              <p>I've seen this kind of problem a lot.</p>
              <p>He gota know his place, learn quickly how to put his dick back
              into his pants and keep it zipped.. else... I forsee another idiot
              lose his job and his family.</p>

              <p>Why are you stereotyping a stranger and making assumptions based on what you think he is, and not what he said in one post? He's already feeling guilty about this and knows it's wrong. For someone who thinks she knows men too well, you haven't given a feasible solution.</p>

              <p>Dude.. this kind of problem is not unique. When you come out and work.. you'll know.</p>
              <p>We lost a few good management people the same way already. It's a shame.. but office scandals, we cannot manipulate as an outsider. We can only try to AVOID this kind of situation from becoming a horrid problem.</p>
              <p>He is guilty .. he is feeling ashamed... so what.. the problem is still there... everyday he go to work.. he will see her..his feelings will be there...</p>
              <p>When he goes home.. his behavior will change.. his wife will notice.. then the shit will hit the fan.</p>
              <p>The only solution is to remove her from his sight. If her skills are valuable to the company... transfer her to another department or another branch.</p>
              <p>He is a big boy.. he needs to exercise self control.. self restraint.. if he is rational.. he will make sure never to put himself in such a vulnerable state ever again.</p>

I don't mean to say that what you're doing is but it's true, keep conduct at the workplace professional. And affairs can seriously mean a sacking if it gets out of hand unless you're highly valued.</p></div>
