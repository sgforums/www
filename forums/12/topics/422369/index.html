              <p>Hi there,</p>
              <p>I understand the stress and anxiety under this circumstances.</p>
              <p>Be prepared for a long and bitter battle with these tiny blood suckers!</p>
              <p>Suggest you immediately get rid of both your bed frame and mattress. At once!</p>
              <p>Try those beg bug spray from DIY shops or scatter DE powder around those places you think those bugs are hiding. Very tricky because you don't see them.</p>
              <p>Baygon is useless, by the way.</p>
              <p>We engaged the services of Origin Exterminators. 2 treatments.</p>
              <p>So far my home is free from bugs until today :)</p>
              <p>I travel regularly for business so I'm extremely careful nowadays.</p>
              <p>Fully understand it is very worrisome and this is serious. My mobile is 98553067 and my name is Russ. Contact me if you need more info. Note I seldom log in to this forum.</p>

              <p>Hi Ben_Ng69,</p>
              <p>It really depends on the infestation level and the longer you wait, the worst it will become.</p>
              <p>Yes, you should try the spray first. If it works well, then very good.</p>
              <p>In the beginning I tried many different kind of sprays, they are not cheap by the way. But it did not help much in my case.</p>
              <p>Nobody want to spend extra money on expensive pest control services unless necessary. We have young children in the house so we decided to give this company a try after doing some research. Origin charged us S$588 for 2 treatments (2 weeks apart) I was also keeping my finger crossed that it will work. We are happy so far to say the least.</p>
              <p>Suggest you do some reading to asceratin your own situation. Different people has different requirement and belief. </p>
              <p>The bed bug egg is almost transparent and very very small, you really don't see them on your mattress.  The Origin guy actually shown me it was hiding in a very small gap in one of our bed frames! You need a torchlight otherwise very difficult to see.</p>
              <p>If you still see those ink-like or blood-like stains on your mattress / pillow, etc covers, after spraying for many weeks, they are still there and mutiplying. I urge you to engage professional help immediately.</p>
              <p>Please note these bugs don't just live in the mattress. They can be anywhere, except the bathroom since they hate water especially hot. Go randomly check your clothings in your wardrobe...do you see these stains? Especially those you seldom wear.</p>
              <p>For the record, I am very particular about hygiene and all my peers were very surprised that I had this problem.</p>
              <p>Anyway I hope my input can be of help in some way, and I wish you good luck.</p>
              <p>Just trying to help here.</p>

              <p>my bed was infested 2 years ago. my bed was 6 years old and my mattress was 10 years old so i immediately discard them both. even after doing so, i know they can be found within wall cracks and furnitures. lucky for me, my bedside desk and wardrobe wasnt infested.</p>
              <p>after disposing my mattress and bed, I paint my room and sealed all the cracks with an instant white cement. Lucky for me it was a mild infestation and I didnt hire any pest control. But it was bad enough to cause trauma to me.</p>
              <p>Knowing that they can hide in your bags, luggages, clothings and even wallets is really scary. So know I have phobia of staying over at places with high turnovers of people. I had a chalet few months back and was very very paranoid. They can hide in even new mattresses and beds. And they can survive for up to 18 months without a blood meal. Place like America are infested with them now.</p>
              <p>Even Baygon cant kill them. You can get rid of them totally but it wont be done in just one night. You got to keep vacuuming, washing in hot water, steam cleaning the mattress. If you still have problems getting rid of them, then I suggest you hire the pest control guys asap.</p>

              <p>Did you guys notice there are more and more pest control companies nowadays?</p>
              <p>The Origin guy told me they have 5-7 jobs daily and everyday there will be 1 job for bed bugs! It is really getting very common in Singapore.</p>
              <p>In USA, the bugs got immuned to the chemicals used by the pest control companies and some of these companies even got sued by their own customers because they cannot kill the bugs completely. So the current effective method is using hot steam to steam up the whole house. Let's hope this will not happen here.</p>
              <p>Do a google then you will know how serious the situation is in the USA.</p>
              <p>Also talk to any of those "anti bed bug" mattress sales aunties, you will get an idea.</p>
              <p>Yes, regular vacuuming is a must. That is why my wife also bought a Rainbow vacuum cleaner. This equipment is not cheap...</p>
              <p>I wish I can share more. I truly had a nightmare dealing with these bugs.</p>
              <p>Anyway I hope you guys are at least more aware now. Take care guys!</p>

              <div class="name">From the way you described your case, it is heavy infestation. Forget about what most forumites said, they never work. <br><br>Throw away your bed and bed frame wont work. For heavy infestation, they can also be hidding in you ceiling wiring!!! <br><br>Buy from NTUC bed bug spray wont work. The female bug can lay up to five eggs per day. How long your spray can last?   </div>
              <div class="name"> </div>
              <div class="name">NEVER NEVER EVER vacuum your house. At night they will crawl out of the vacuum tube and infest your kitchen, vacuum cabinet, rubbish chute area etc. Unless each time you vacuum, you want to disinfest your vacuum tube, vacuum dust bag etc with hot boiling water. What a chores. In any case, your vacuum plastic cover and inner linings will crack under hot water.<br><br>Dont throw away your bed or bed frame without FIRST wrapping them up with plastic wrapper. Why? they will infest your neigbour house. Yeah some of you laugh - your neighbour business and not yours. Beg bugs can crawl thru the cable wiring into your neighbour house, infest them. Over time, they can infest the whole HDB block. You get rid of the problem now and later the problem comes back to haunt you all because you didnt get rid of your mattress in the proper way. <br><br>NEVER NEVER EVER use Bygone or other household insecticides. They never kill them, instead they'll spread the beg bugs wider and further away from the epicenter of infestion. The more you use them, the quicker and faster they spread. In no time, they'll spread to your kitchen, toilet and into your neighbour house. <br><br></div>

              <p>For people with heavy infestation, here is the real solution.</p>
              <p>1) Throw away unwanted items. Wrap all your unwanted clutters in plastic sheet before disposing them.</p>
              <p>2) Wash all you clothing with thick detergent or hot water before storing them in vacuum bags or ziplog bags. Clothing, wooden areas and crack/nock are their favourite hidding and egg laying places.</p>
              <p>3) Buy the bed bug spray called SUPER BEG BUG SPRAY (the co. is in Ubi) and spray into nock and cranny.</p>
              <p>Which nock and cranny has bed bugs?. Do general tube spray into nock and cranny. Next day when you sweep the floor and if you see bug on the floor, you do a specific tube spray on the same area until the bugs in that particular area is gone. Use this method for the whole house and do it systematically.</p>
              <p>4) Go buy a 1 or 5 litre hand pump spray from pest controller and 1 litre of concentrated BUG insectide - FENDONA and/or CISLIN (yellow page). Dilute the content and spray your floor areas with it/them. (Follow strictly to the dilution instruction.)</p>
              <p>You need to do this otherwise when you tube spray your house, the begs will escape from one nock and cranny to hide again in another and all your effort is wasted. </p>
              <p>These bug are so potent that these insecticides will not kill them immediately but cause them pain and disoriention first. This is good otherwise without them these bugs can sprint in no time from one nock or cranny into another.</p>
              <p>5) All the methods I listed can only CONTROL the bed bugs. You have to control it. Otherwise, the bugs not only spread but also multiply quickly.</p>
              <p>Unless you can be at home everyday disinfect, spray, sweep your house, engage a pest controller.  NEVER EVER engage a pest controller without checking his credential or check out the pricing and chemicals of other pest controllers. NEVER EVER believe them when they say 2 treatments and your problem is solved.</p>
              <p>ASK THEM WHAT CHEMICAL THEY USE. CrackDown, Cislin, Fendona can only CONTROL and never eradicate a heavy infestation. General or haphazard gassing will not penetrate into deep nock and cranny.</p>
              <p>Also, make sure they use chemcial SPECIFICALLY for bed bugs.</p>
              <p>FINALLY, you need to follow all the above five steps in order to solve you problem. Miss any one and you can find the bugs back to haunt you again. </p>

              <p>I think you should call pest exterminator, they do a better job than these off the shelves insecticides and bed bug spray. With the insecticides you only target areas which you know are infested with the bed bugs. If there are bed bugs and eggs hiding in other places, you won't know and they will re-surface in another 2 weeks time.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>They have a safer method of killing insects these days. Think it's called IGR (insect growth regulator), it prevents the insect from molting, so if they can't molt they will soon die off.</p>

              <p>They are already using it in Singapore and USA. It should be safe since FDA has stricter guidelines regarding chemicals which can be harmful to humans. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Bed bug sprays contain more cancer causing ingredients, whereas IGR just targets the insects molting process. That is unless you molt. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>An insect growth regulator (IGR) should be used together with a product targeted at adult fleas.  The IGR affects only the flea larvae and prevents them from molting into adult fleas which do the biting.  The IGR therefore helps prevent future infestations while assisting in stopping the current problem.</em></p>

It is important to brush the powder on the bed and other infested area. DE powder is microscopic sharp and hurt the bugs but being natural with no chemical or poison is harmless to us.
