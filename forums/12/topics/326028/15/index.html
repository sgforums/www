              <p>Christians who insists that all of GOD's wisdom is found in the
                  Bible are dead follower of Christ. A living follower of Christ
                  listens and communicates with GOD daily apart from reading and
                  understanding the Bible.</p>
              <p>And GOD's wisdom was NEVER only limited to the Bible. Wake
                  up Christians! And be REVIVED!!</p>

              <p>Is that the best you can do? Call me a "clone" once you run out of credible points? Going by the common definition of "clone", that would mean my account would be new. Would you please care to look a little to the left and see when my account was created? I do not to have to own up to being a clone or anything, simply because <strong>I am not a clone</strong>.</p>
              <p>I did NOT condemn you as despicable; I said <strong>your contempt</strong> was despicable. Now, if you find yourself to be one with the tone of your message, then there is little I can say.</p>
              <p>How do I know you are a follower of Christ? Simple. Look at what you posted in the first few pages of this thread. I actually read most of what has been said in this entire thread before I posted.</p>
              <p>Indication in Page 2: "Gender difference exists for a reason and it's determined by
                                          GOD." Note the capitalization of the entire word. Most of the time, it is the followers of the Abrahamic religions who do so.</p>

                                          be grateful that I even bothered to reply you."</strong></p>
              <p>Neither do people who perform fantastic acts of hypocrisy within the span of one thread page. All the same, I am flattered that you decided to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">supposedly</span> "descend to my level" to speak to me and respond.</p>
              <p><strong>"And yes, your faith and relationship with GOD is DEFINITELY
                                          QUESTIONABLE."</strong></p>
              <p>Alright, since you play this game, then evidence, miss, please give me the evidence. I'm not asking for proof, but arguable evidence.</p>
              <p><strong>"Certainly this has proven that knowing alot about the Bible
                                          verses, certainly does not makes you a living follower of GOD, it
                                          only makes you a dead follower who thinks he know
                                          GOD, but GOD does not know you."</strong></p>
              <p>What has proven what? I see no evidence supporting that statement, and I'm not even sure what you speak of! Moreover, I do not have to demonstrate my faith to you, simply because there is no real way I can do anything to convince you. You can call me a dead follower all you want, but I know the truth in my heart. And that last bit, who are you to say that?</p>
              <p><strong>"Do you not realised that you have proven my BOLD points which you
                                                                  have quoted me?</strong></p>
              <p><strong>You need to be more positive in your life and DO not surrender
                                                                  to your own anger, cos that's clearly a sign of weakness.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>It's never too late to seek GOD again."</strong></p>
              <p>Proven? How? You can't just claim something is proven when you haven't demonstrated the process to us. How have I been weak, then?</p>
              <p>I'll be honest, I am growing to be positive in my life. What I have to say, however, is that I am not surrendering to my own anger. I am not angry at anything. I am simply in great disagreement with your less-than-moderate opinions. If you feel that I am, then I apologize for the passion in my argument (if that were a wrong in the first place).</p>
              <p>As for your last statement, again, I know where I stand with God.</p>

              <p>It is very funny you kept asking people not to make assumptions or generalization, but you kept making them yourself. It is like the pot calling the kettle black. We are all learning well from your example here.</p>

              <p>It is quite ironic how parn is calling SturmDerSchatten a 'loser clone', when any person moderately well-acquainted with feminist forums would immediately identify her as one of those 'loser clones' who like to bash the percieved lack of certain qualities in men to make up for their own inadequacy.</p>
              <p>Also, her definition of 'weak' does not seem to conform to any known definition. If she likes to reinvent certain words, might I suggest one of my own creation?</p>
