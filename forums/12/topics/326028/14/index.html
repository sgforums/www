              <p>That settles it. You lot should all go sign up for the VHEMT.</p>
              <p>I see feminism has not succeeded in any of its goals if people like parn still express that kind of opinion. Feminism was meant to bring women onto an equal footing with men in areas such as these. Now, idiots like you want to have your cake and eat it too, by claiming the privileges that were traditionally denied to women, AND still making men do all the work. Where's the justice in that, I ask you? You want to have equal rights, you have equal responsibilities, and that includes perpetuating the damned human race.</p>
              <p>And yes, I am depressed because these are the people that will be leading Singapore in the years to come. I shudder to think of the consequences should certain of the posters here manage to be elevated into positions of authority and power. I'd rather have one of my balls elevated to the position of Prime Minister.</p>
              <p>And please, would using proper tenses kill you?</p>
              <p>Back OT: It is perfectly acceptable to a girl to ask a guy out. In fact, I think the guy would be very flattered if that were to happen and if he was somewhat attracted to the girl. The only downside is that his friends might tease him for being emasculated if they get to hear about it. Also, since us males are <em>notoriously</em> bad at picking up subtle hints, quit dropping them. Just floor the accelerator, there's no need to pussy foot.</p>
              <p>We're MEN, any emotions have to break through a shield the size of the Death Star. I can't speak for <em>all</em> men, but most of the people I know have very strong personal shields regarding things like these. Whereas a female might take offence at perceived slights, we shrug them off.</p>

              <p>It all boils down to POV here right? Point - of - View. Some guys can handle rejection, some can't. Some girls can confess, some can't. AND some guys think its an insult if a girl confesses to them.</p>

              <p>It's chauvinist. C-H-A-U-V-I-N-I-S-T. Also, chauvinism in itself refers to the feeling of disdain you hold for other countries and the belief that your own is superior. In this context, I'll assume that you mean 'male chauvinist.</p>

              <p>@killtheink: Yeah, it's all POV. That's why parn doesn't have the right to impose her brand of 'intellectual' thinking on us, and that's why we're still talking about this. Wars have been started over less.</p>

              <p>  Gee, thanks for the clarification captain obvious.</p>
              <p>  And I wasn't trying to insult you before. I just called it as it is. You hate women? Well, I assume it's because the feeling is mutual (sorry; but if it makes you feel better, I also assume your a virgin and probably have a face only a mother could love). Oh and funny that you should mention "wars" and attack feminists at the same time. Last I checked, it was us men who started wars.</p>
              <p>  You obviously have a problem with women in more ways than one, so don't make this out to be an intellectual debate. It sounds more like a pathetic attempt to blame the opposite sex for your own inadequacy. It's men like you who appear on the news three years from now convicted for killing his wife (or more likely a sex worker; your obviously not getting laid unless you pay for it).</p>
              <p>  Watch yourself.</p>

Feminism has obviously failed in more ways than one if people still express the opinion that "it's a man's job to ask a woman out.", while still maintaining that men and women are equal in all aspects.That's right, <em>equal.</em> If men and women were equal, there'd be no debate here and I'd have mammary glands and female genitals. I believe in egalilatarianism, not some half-cocked theory about complete equality.</p>
              <p>I was never aware that this was an intellectual debate. I was always under the impression that it was me explaining in not-so-polite terms how you lot are mistaken. Men were usually the ones who started wars because we were the ones in charge. Look at Thatcher. Now, there's a woman who started a war. Before this devolves into semantics, she could have chosen not to fight. The fact that she chose to means she started a war. <em>It isn't a fight unless you strike back.</em></p>
              <p>Also, stereotype much? Last I checked, I get along fine with my female friends, and I've never been convicted of any sexual crime, which is more than I can say for you. The fact that you're so vehemently opposed to any slights on females leads me to think that this is the only way you can actually get laid, because (I quote verbatim) 'you have a face only a mother could love'. You have my condolences, my friend. I'd suggest forming a close acquaintance with a metallic object approximately .45 inches in width and with a rough hemispherical shape.</p>

              <p>  I'm not even a feminist and I think ExtraVehicular is a jack***. Good luck finding a girlfriend you shiit. How can anyone even defend him? It's so bloody obvious he has a problem. I joined the forums thinking it's going to be fun then have to read this kind of shiit comments from fugly girl-haters like him. It makes me mad!

              <p>See what I mean? Girls want 1) equal rights and 2) chivalry. Feminism aimed to eradicate the latter and obtain the first. It is obvious that it has failed if women demand the first and expect the second.</p>
              <p>Chivalry is far more indicative of male chauvinism than anything else. It implies that the man thinks women cannot take care of themselves.</p>
              <p>Also, reading comprehension for the win. I never insulted females in any manner. I was criticising what I perceived to be hypocrisy on their part. Bloody obvious that I have a problem? I think it's more obvious that you have one, namely, the lack of any discernable form of critical thinking and reading comprehension skills.</p>
              <p>Since when have I become a fugly bastard? I'm perfectly pleasant looking, if not quite in the league of Brad Pitt. I'd refrain from further baseless assumptions if I were you, it makes you look an utter retard.</p>

              <p>well please ExtraVehicular, send me your pic and I'll proclaim once and for all if you have what it takes to attract a girl (actually you know what, your picture would be a waste of space on my laptop). Brad Pitt? You wish. I doubt your even average looking. go ahead look in the mirror and prove me wrong. my evidence? you attitude. and you can argue its unsubstantial, but hating girls is an undesirable attitude and says alot about ur experience with them. which my female calculator defines to be 0.</p>
              <p>and yes, we want chilvary, we want to be taken care of sometimes but we still want to be able to vote. too much to ask?</p>
              <p>and since when was being zealous a bad thing StermDurSchatten? your actually more wrong that he attacked without provocation. ExtraVehicular's arrogance was more than enough of a provocation.</p>
              <p>but fine, whatever, i implied that you were defending him, my mistake.</p>

              <p>:rolls eyes:</p>
              <p>How about you send me your pic, eh? Then I'll judge. If you honestly think that people will actually send you a picture of theirs', without knowing you beforehand......well, that speaks mighty well of your intelligence, in my opinion.</p>
              <p>Note that I said that I'm NOT in the league of Brad Pitt. Is that <em>so</em> hard to comprehend? I'm average looking, not pukeworthy, and not stunningly handsome. I've a normal, unassuming face with typical Asian features. Good enough for you?</p>
              <p>As for the chivalry point, yes, it is too much to ask. When the guy gives it without question, you ought to be on your guard. If you actually read up on feminism, one of the points was that they wanted to abolish anything that is unfavourable to women (well, not exactly everything, but things within reason). Chivalry figured prominently in most of their diatribes. 'being taken care of' implies that the guy believes that you cannot take care of yourself. Asking for chivalry is invalidating everything that feminists have fought for in the past few decades.</p>
              <p>Pray tell, where have I stated that I hate girls? Find me a quote. As I've said, you ought to cut out the baseless accusations. Methinks you just hate being wrong, and are trying to cover it up with personal insults. Notice that I only posted a direct insult in my first reply to Lucas, where my temper got the better of me. I apologize to LucasStriker for that. You've been posting nothing but drivel for the entirety of your stay in here.</p>
              <p>If arrogance is enough provocation, is your belligerence not worse?</p>

              <p>  ok... *suddenly looking wary*</p>
              <p>  I actually thought I was just flaming ExtraVehicular off (which btw I do apologise for; was reading an online article about abusive husbands the day before) since when did I get promoted to the position of "Defender of Feminists"?</p>
              <p>  Don't get me wrong Kimmy, I am flattered, but the truth is I actually <em>don't agree with most hardcore feminists</em> distorted view of the world (I watch George Carlin for God's sake). I do hope your not the hardcore feminist you claimed not to be because they are just a few notches better than chauvinists in my books. I don't believe men and women can ever be equal in the way they suggest. I believe our inequality defines us, actually, but if equality is what you wish than we'll submit; for better or for worst.</p>
              <p>  And to answer your question ExtraVehicular, we can't make "not-so-polite" statements to feminists (shame on you) simply because we'r not as equal as we'd like to believe. I liken this to white people branded as racist for saying not-so-polite statements while black people can get away scot free with white people jokes =)</p>

              <p>When did it become a crime to tell the truth? I'm calling it as it see it: that I believe feminism has failed if women still express the opinions here. Also, hardcore feminists are definitely worse than chauvinists, some of them believe that men are inferior in evey aspect (!) and ought to be used only for breeding (!!!). I've yet to see any male chauvinist express that kind of opinion. These hardcore feminists also seem to believe that every man is a potential rapist, and that we're all walking time bombs. Hardcore feminism isn't just 'feminism', it's ingrained, organized and highly effective sexism against men.</p>
              <p>Yes, men and women can never become truly equal, which is why egalitarianism is the next best option. It makes no sense for women to proclaim 'What men can do we can do better' when they can't even piss standing up (joke!). Women will always be penalized by their physical inferiority, which is why men have always tolerated some inconvenience in order to allow women some concessions; but at the rate things are going, men are going to become second class citizens in their own homelands. It's already beginning in Scandinavia. As they say, it's now wrong to be a male, and even more so to be a white male.</p>
              <p>The reason I took offense was that you were implying that I was some sort of potential abusive mate. I've never treated any girl I <span style="text-decoration: underline;">know</span> without anything but the utmost respect and tolerance.</p>
              <p>However, I take umbrage at kimmy88's unjustified slurs on my intellectual capability, physical appearance and attitude. I have never said that I hate women. I'm a perfectly normal looking person, without any major physical deformities or other external unpleasantries.  As they say in certain less polite quarters: L2R. The consistent manner in which you have misinterpreted <em>every damned one</em> of my points suggests an obviously inferior intellect, but I believe that the words I'm using are simple enough for a person of average intelligence to comprehend.</p>

              <p>I see feminism has not succeeded in any of its goals if people
              like parn still express that kind of opinion. Feminism was meant to
              bring women onto an equal footing with men in areas such as these.
              Now, idiots like you want to have your cake and eat it too, by
              claiming the privileges that were traditionally denied to
              women, AND still making men do all the work. Where's the justice in
              that, I ask you? You want to have equal rights, you have equal
              responsibilities, and that includes perpetuating the damned human
              race.</p>
              <p>And yes, I am depressed because these are the people that will
              be leading Singapore in the years to come. I shudder to think of
              the consequences should certain of the posters here manage to be
              elevated into positions of authority and power. I'd rather have one
              of my balls elevated to the position of Prime Minister.</p>
              <p>And please, would using proper tenses kill you?</p>
              <p>Back OT: It is perfectly acceptable to a girl to ask a guy out.
              In fact, I think the guy would be very flattered if that were to
              happen and if he was somewhat attracted to the girl. The only
              downside is that his friends might tease him for being emasculated
              if they get to hear about it. Also, since us males are
              <em>notoriously</em> bad at picking up subtle hints, quit dropping
              them. Just floor the accelerator, there's no need to pussy
              foot.</p>
              <p>We're MEN, any emotions have to break through a shield the size
              of the Death Star. I can't speak for <em>all</em> men, but
              most of the people I know have very strong personal shields
              regarding things like these. Whereas a female might take offence at
              perceived slights, we shrug them off.</p>
