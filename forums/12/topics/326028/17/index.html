              <p>This seems to be an ongoing repetitive problem here in Aunt
              Agony...saddens me to know it everytime and so I would like to
              share my thoughts to y'all.</p>
              <p>Why do all guys strives to be cool and act like a MAN when they
              are not even able to confess their feelings to the girl that they
              have feelings for?</p>
              <p>Guys like these are not MAN, they are frightened insecure
              little boys trapped inside a MAN's body.</p>
              <p>If rejections is all it takes to destroy their soul, then maybe
              they don't deserves to be with the girl that they like. The
              girl would be so much happier and better off with a real MAN than
              frightened insecure little boys.</p>
              <p>How many of you actually got a really bad rejection from a girl
              after confessing your feelings to her?</p>
              <p>Speak up, be honest with your feelings and let the girl
              knows how you feel. We're already into the 21st century and yet
              guys are still behaving like the 18th century.</p>
              <p>Talk to her and ask her out if you like her and want to know
              more about her. Tell her you like her and would like to know
              more about her if she asked you why you want to ask her out.</p>
              <p>At the most she will say she is not interested and then you can
              move on to the next one, she's probably not the girl you're looking
              for anyway if she is not interested in you.</p>
              <p>Most girls will be impressed by your initiative if you tell
              her you want to know more about her. Most guys couldn't care less
              and yet still hope for the girl to like him by playing it cool.
              Ya....keep playing cool and keep dreaming on ok?</p>
              <p>First come, first serve, no good girls will wait for guys who
              likes to keep playing cool. Good girls don't wait for cool guys,
              they want to be with hot guys who cannot live without them....like
              their oxygen!</p>
              <p>So where are all the MAN? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>For my case, I never wear harsh designed clothes when I go out. At most my favourite ah beng looking leather coat from zara... With a jeans and just a cheap bata "leather" shoes to go orchard...</p>
              <p>Just be yourself, if you think you spoke too much when out with friends and girls think that you might as well be a pussy then stfu lor...</p>
              <p>In short, if you are broke and a girl still likes you and she looks like a thehappybunny then of course marry her la, but of course when u r financially stable le then have kids lor. If you are rich and a pretty girl clings on to you like a buzz, of course something is fishy la...</p>
              <p>*Btw I am meaning thehappybunny de dp that girl*</p>

              <p>Guys can get girls with $$$. So whether to confess a not, it
              doesn't really matter to some guys. If a girl likes a guy, she
              should take the initiative to drop hints for the guy. I kena once
              but was clever enough to reject the girl in a non-verbal way.</p>
              <p>Afterall, it is easier for girl to chase guy, than guy to chase
              girl.</p>
              <p>In some cases, guys like me tend to fall for love easily and so
              this distorts our emotions sometimes. That is, do we love for the
              sake of sex, family or do we love because we want to love that
              someone.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To confess is not a big deal, it is the aftermath that really
              matters to us guy. I kena four times and I swear never to repeat my
              stupidity.</p>

              <p><br>No apologies required, and I'm not upset at any of you anyway...ever. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p>I appreciate the role you all have contributed to my posts, with it....it would be boring to talk to myself wouldn't it?</p>
              <p>Life would be so borrrrring if people keep saying "YES" to me all the time, it sometimes makes my life more meaningful.</p>
              <p>People who have behaved true to themselves and were able to release their true self in sgforums have certainly gained alot of respect from me and I do respect them very much.</p>
              <p>Afterall, people are not comfortable to release their true self and stay true to their character in real life. So sgforums offers the best environment for people to interact with other people on an even more real manner. Of course there are also alot of bad eggs out there lor.....but nevermind, this is also the place where I can remain true to myself as I'm not allowed to do so in my real life anyway. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>I'm not upset, so there's nothing to forgive.</p>
