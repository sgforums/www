              <p>skythewood, thank you so much for standing up on my behalf.</p>
              <p>But we don't live in a perfect world with perfect people, so it's understandable that sometimes people need to reduce their stress by relieving their frustrations on others.</p>
              <p>It's not right no doubt, but since this is a forum, they are entitled to be what they want and who they want. It's their choice.</p>
              <p>If we shut them up and reduce them to retards everytime and make them lose their pride and dignity every single time, they would have left very little hope to live for in their lives.</p>
              <p>Sometimes we need to allow them to restore a bit of their pride and dignity first, then it's more satisfying to reduce them back to retard again. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p>They are just like scared dogs barking wildly in the background, and how can humans ever understand dog's language?</p>

              <p><br>Like I said, my original one to you was a half-hearted attempt at a joke that could be turned into an actual insult if the occasion called for it. Reading comprehension FTW. I was on her case long before you came in and posted some random stuff.</p>
              <p>Also, I don't mind <em>smelly </em>assholes, but when it gets so bad that it  reacts explosively with platinum from a hundred feet, something has to be done. Notice that the quote stated nothing about that. :P</p>
              <p>The only real troll that I see on this thread, and indeed the forum, is the OP. On most other decent forums, her argument would be shot down and ground into dust within an hour of posting. Here, I suppose a high post count (mostly consisting of one-liners in 1337speak or Singlish, without any actual substance) and a long history with the forum count for more than good sense and an argument that doesn't collapse like a house of cards the moment any pressure is applied.</p>
              <p>Also, I pretty much doubt her ability to prove any form of point, let alone 'reduce them to retards everytime and make them lose their pride and dignity every single time'.  I'm quite willing to bet that most of the posters here have an IQ that's at least 20 points ahead of the OP's.</p>
              <p><strong>EDIT:</strong> My bad. She can reduce people to retards. It's fucking contagious. You've got to be immunized with either a healthy dose of skepticism, or the actual ability to conduct a debate.</p>

              <p>To parn:</p>
              <p>You can't really heal a guy after rejecting him. Not immediately at least. The platonic relationship theory, between man and woman is not without it's flaws. (I'll come back to this later.) Most importantly, a male who is still feeling love lorn after a rejection, is most probably still having the feelings of hope and 101 questions as to why he is really being rejected by you. Face it, most the time the rejection is not direct and would not satisfy the male ego. Yes, we do have big egos to satisfy when we are reject because that's what make us males. An attempt at healing would most probably fan the flames of desires that are not douse properly with a lousy rejection. Unless you have already mastered the technique to reject properly and firmly, an attempt to heal would be most probably seen as another chance given. You will find yourself having to reject multiple times before you can actually be real platonic friends.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"True Platonic Friendship" between man and woman is not really possible or even if it is, the probability of the Friendship not ending in "When Harry met Sally" is unlikely Let's analyze the scenario. </p>
              <p>Tom and Jane are best friends. Tom is cheerful, intellectual and not too bad-looking. Jane is jovial, witty and used to be the school belle. Tom never felt anything special for Jane. Neither does Jane feels anything for Tom. They just enjoy spending a lot of time together. They have almost identical hobbies (Both love to watch movies, and sea sports.) They can tell each other secrets that they can never tell anyone else. They worry about each other when the other person is sick or having problems in their life. They are both willing to give their organs to each other should the need arises. (That's what real true friends should be like right?) They both have their own ongoing relationships. When Jane falls out of love, Tom is there to console her, when Tom finds out he's being 2-timed, Jane is there to encourage him. All is well and all is great but the 2 will never fall in love with each other. They are just great friends.</p>

              <p>it gets to a point where both man and woman knows each other too well, they are well aware of the strengths and flaws of each other. I think that its about complimenting each other's flaws and strengths, which Tom and Jane are unable to do, and alot  couples struggle to come to terms in this situation </p>

              <p><br>I got my own ways to heal the guys that I've rejected. It all depends on how well I know the guy and different guy requires different method of recovering.</p>
              <p>The problem with your story is that it is really a story. There is no correct ending or development in your story. You control how you want your story to turn out, so of course I am also smart enough not to waste my time and fall into your game plan. Maybe ultimately you wished to show me that you're right, but I also know that it is wasting my time to go confuse in your story later.</p>
              <p>So the answer is NO. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
