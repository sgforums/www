              <p>This seems to be an ongoing repetitive problem here in Aunt
              Agony...saddens me to know it everytime and so I would like to
              share my thoughts to y'all.</p>
              <p>Why do all guys strives to be cool and act like a MAN when they
              are not even able to confess their feelings to the girl that they
              have feelings for?</p>
              <p>Guys like these are not MAN, they are frightened insecure
              little boys trapped inside a MAN's body.</p>
              <p>If rejections is all it takes to destroy their soul, then maybe
              they don't deserves to be with the girl that they like. The
              girl would be so much happier and better off with a real MAN than
              frightened insecure little boys.</p>
              <p>How many of you actually got a really bad rejection from a girl
              after confessing your feelings to her?</p>
              <p>Speak up, be honest with your feelings and let the girl
              knows how you feel. We're already into the 21st century and yet
              guys are still behaving like the 18th century.</p>
              <p>Talk to her and ask her out if you like her and want to know
              more about her. Tell her you like her and would like to know
              more about her if she asked you why you want to ask her out.</p>
              <p>At the most she will say she is not interested and then you can
              move on to the next one, she's probably not the girl you're looking
              for anyway if she is not interested in you.</p>
              <p>Most girls will be impressed by your initiative if you tell
              her you want to know more about her. Most guys couldn't care less
              and yet still hope for the girl to like him by playing it cool.
              Ya....keep playing cool and keep dreaming on ok?</p>
              <p>First come, first serve, no good girls will wait for guys who
              likes to keep playing cool. Good girls don't wait for cool guys,
              they want to be with hot guys who cannot live without them....like
              their oxygen!</p>

              <p>Guys being guys are visual beings. Any girl, as long as she wishes, can go for plastic surgery, etc, doll up and she'd get her own "fan club" soon. Whereas for girls, im sure visually it does count but its not as impt for girls.(Any girls here wanna back this up or prove me wrong?) In my opinion, personality is what girls look out for in a guy. A guy who's confident, able to walk his speech and able of holding his stand in his opinions, without faltering the slightest in his confidence in his beliefs. How many guys CAN actually reach this point?</p>

              <p>If the guy is too afraid to confess his feelings to the girl he like then that is too bad for him.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'm sure in life we all will meet that 1 or in some cases more than 1 person that we will not be able to confess our feelings to be it if you're a guy or a girl.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And everyone will have their own reasons to why they are afraid, its that simple, human being are complex and each and everyone one of us are so different and we should know that we are not that great at following the rules.</p>

              <p>And I've read only the last few pages of this thread just personally I feel that waiting for the right time to do the right confession would be great, I'm more of a impatient guy, whenever I feel connected to a certain girl, and when we really can click etc. I'd do the confession in a bland manner at the same time giving her "warning" ahead. before the real confession happens she'd be so dam prepared for it, (though it wouldn't be as romantic as if it'd be from a surprise).</p>

              <p>If guys can be confident enough towards their commitment towards the girl, and lift up a little of their ego/pride stuffs, everything will turn out well, matters not how u look, just the way you treat them.
