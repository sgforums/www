              <p>I'm not saying that she isn't. That one is up to her and her guy to find out.</p>
              <p>All I am saying is don't just reject guys straight away because of their financial status, proclaiming that you will never fall for someone who isn't rich, because you never know where you might be able to find true love. Sometimes it occurs in the most unexpected place.</p>
              <p>But that is something you will only know once you have encountered it. In the face of true love, all pre-constructed list (as in the list of requirements ie the guy must be goodlooking, must earn 10k every month, etc) will be promptly chucked aside. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></p>

              <p>Heh, that's easy for you to say. Try being a guy for a day.</p>
              <p>The point some guys act cool, is perhaps someone they love/ have feelings for might be near them. Lol.</p>
              <p>I don't know about the other guys, but as for me. I just bury my feelings way deep inside. No matter if I tell that girl my feelings or not, I will get rejected. Why? This 2 reasons.</p>
              <p>-Not too smart/handsome/rich for her.</p>
              <p>-Different ethnic group</p>
              <p>It's also very rare to see girls who are sincere to one's heart, rather than considering those factors.</p>
              <p>Let me ask you a very simple question Parn, would you go for a guy, who's not smart/handsome or if he's from a different ethnic group, but who loves you very much?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I've pretty much see girls wearing all kinds of clothing[revealings], just because they want to look hot, keep up with the fashion, follow their friends or whatever.</p>
              <p>But there are modest girls, who are really beautiful, but they don't show it.</p>
              <p>What the point I'm making is, If you know you'll get rejected by the girl, why would you even want to propose to her? It'll make you feel even more worse, and hurts you alot. believe me, it does.</p>
              <p>But on the bright side, it makes me happy to see a individual like you bringing up a topic like this. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>Then he suddenly stops calling her or meeting up with her after a few months.</p>

              <p>He says somehow it confuses the girls and wrecks havoc on their minds.</p>
              <p>Some of these girls initially did not show much interest in him.</p>
              <p>After his "Woo and Run" antics, they began to pay more attention to him and show more interest.</p>
              <p>Apparently it works for him.</p>
              <p>And he's no Brad Pitt lookalike or possess Gates-like fortune.</p>

              <p><br>Ayah the point is, even if she has this view on the internet, who is it hurting? None of you are going to change her mind anytime soon, and she's entitled to her own views and opinions. We don't know what experiences she's had, none of us can judge her. Continued discussion will just make things uglier for everyone anyway, is it worth it?</p>
              <p>What I do know is, love alone isn't enough to make any relationship work. Nevermind the question of personal wealth. Things like personality and interest can actually make being in love pretty painful. And like you said, you never know where one finds love, so don't think that people who have nothing in common or clashing personalities can't fall in love. If love was that rational then it wouldn't be love. I personally don't care about wealth, but I do care about the other person's personality, and even then theres no guarentee I can be rationale and think:</p>
              <p> "this person isn't compatible with me, much as we are in love, we cannot be together as it is bad for both of us"</p>
              <p>If I was able to think this way I would have saved myself a heap of trouble lol.</p>

              <p>I've pretty much see girls wearing all kinds of clothing[revealings], just because they want to look hot, keep up with the fashion, follow their friends or whatever.</p>
              <p>But there are modest girls, who are really beautiful, but they don't show it.</p>
              <p>What the point I'm making is, If you know you'll get rejected by the girl, why would you even want to propose to her? It'll make you feel even more worse, and hurts you alot. believe me, it does.</p>
              <p>But on the bright side, it makes me happy to see a individual like you bringing up a topic like this. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>So when does this acting cool behaviour going to end? When the girl you like got taken away by someone else?</p>
              <p>Or when the girl you like suddenly realised "Hey...why I didn't noticed there was this cool guy here?". If that's what you are waiting to happen and wondering why it isn't happening yet, I can tell you that's because every guy around her is probably also doing the same thing as you...acting cool and cooler...and acting cool does not have any value left in it cos it has already became a normal behaviour for guys.</p>
              <p>Isn't it easier to let your feelings be known and fight over her openly?</p>
              <p>Even if she were to reject you, at least she will be aware of your interest in her and she will take into consideration the future stunts you will be deploying for her...just specially for her.</p>
              <p>Girls want to be fought over, and need to be fought over to feel wanted and cherished.</p>
              <p>But you can still choose to stand in line at the back of the queue like everyone else in this playing cool game. Who knows, you might just be lucky enough to be next in line.</p>

              <p>Heh, I dont believe in lucks or such.</p>
              <p>If I love a girl, I might as well tell her what I really feel about her. Even if she rejects me, I won't be heartbroken much. At least I got out that feelings stuffed inside of me.</p>
              <p>If by any chance, she accepts, and one day she feels that she needs to be fought over again and again, just to feel wanted or cherished, what more can I do?</p>

              <p>sorry hor i don need guys to fight over me to feel wanted or cherished. Somemore, only boys do that.</p>
              <p>consider putting "some girls" in statements such as "Some girls want to be fought over, and need to be fought over to feel wanted and cherished"</p>
              <p>your statements are too opinionated and its solely based on your own view.</p>
              <p>kindly don generalise all girls wants the same thing as you.</p>
              <p>Thank you, TS.</p>
