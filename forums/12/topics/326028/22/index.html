              <p>Hi Callan..Ya I know 9 months is a bit too long...but I girl leh!! I just wanted to give it a last try and let known my feelings so that I won't regret in future. I already prepared for any outcome..but this outcome is not what I expected..it's not even a yes/no ans..that's y I felt so foolish..hesitate so long for this kinda outcome...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But I think I much braver than those guys who don't even dare to confess..I got a fren who like me for I think almost one year too..until recently then I know he likes me..after a few times being rejected..he sort of given up..</p>

              <p>xD...........judging from the replies to parn's thread, it is apparent parn tends to sterotype men...</p>
              <p>Please, parn, stop this...this goes to show how little you know of men....</p>
              <p>some men they do not do so is because of <strong>either</strong> of the following:</p>
              <p>a) They want to be <strong>sure of their own feelings( it is not a crush or blind love)</strong> </p>
              <p>b) They want to <strong>retain the friendship.</strong> </p>

You either want to be friends with the girl or you want her to be your girlfriend. If they are greedy, then they deserves to fail/lose every single time they tried to go after a girl with that kind of greedy mentality.</p>

              <p>You may explain "A dog chases after every car on a freeway".</p>
              <p>But I hope you're not saying that guys are the dogs and girls are the car, cos if that's exactly what you mean, then congratulations to you for reducing guys to dogs.</p>
              <p>Whatever is it, I know I'm right and unlike you, I don't have to lie in order to sound right.</p>
              <p>Looking at your point number 1, it is wrong cos a crush or a blind love means the guy does want to care about the thoughts and feelings of the girl, but he does not know what are the thoughts and feelings of the girl.</p>
              <p>For your point number 2, it is also wrong because guys don't go back to seek help from the girls that they have confessed or faced rejection from. I also don't know why, but I know they just don't do that even though both of them may remained as friends after the confession/rejection.</p>
              <p>For the point number 3, it is also wrong because it depends on what the girl felt towards the guy. Girls just don't simply express their fondness for guys as obvious as guys would've dreamt, expected or imagined. So sometimes, you don't know until you have confessed to the girl that you liked.</p>
              <p>And that is the topic of this post! <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p>You may ask me to reflect on whichever blah blah assumptions you have already made upon me, but I would also like to ask you to reflect upon your own conscience and stop lying to yourself and think if you're really good enough to ask me to reflect upon anything.</p>
              <p>If you are lazy, I can tell you the truth. You're not good enough to ask anyone to reflect upon anything. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

Somewhere deep inside me, I know there is still hope for her, but it can only be proven by actions to her. There is no used shouting or repeating yourself if the person you are talking to is deaf.
