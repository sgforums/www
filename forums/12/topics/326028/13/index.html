              <p>This seems to be an ongoing repetitive problem here in Aunt Agony...saddens me to know it everytime and so I would like to share my thoughts to y'all.</p>
              <p>Why do all guys strives to be cool and act like a MAN when they are not even able to confess their feelings to the girl that they have feelings for?</p>
              <p>Guys like these are not MAN, they are frightened insecure little boys trapped inside a MAN's body.</p>
              <p>If rejections is all it takes to destroy their soul, then maybe they don't deserves to be with the girl that they like. The girl would be so much happier and better off with a real MAN than frightened insecure little boys.</p>
              <p>How many of you actually got a really bad rejection from a girl after confessing your feelings to her?</p>
              <p>Speak up, be honest with your feelings and let the girl knows how you feel. We're already into the 21st century and yet guys are still behaving like the 18th century.</p>
              <p>Talk to her and ask her out if you like her and want to know more about her. Tell her you like her and would like to know more about her if she asked you why you want to ask her out.</p>
              <p>At the most she will say she is not interested and then you can move on to the next one, she's probably not the girl you're looking for anyway if she is not interested in you.</p>
              <p>Most girls will be impressed by your initiative if you tell her you want to know more about her. Most guys couldn't care less and yet still hope for the girl to like him by playing it cool. Ya....keep playing cool and keep dreaming on ok?</p>
              <p>First come, first serve, no good girls will wait for guys who likes to keep playing cool. Good girls don't wait for cool guys, they want to be with hot guys who cannot live without them....like their oxygen!</p>
              <p>So where are all the MAN? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>If you can understand the term <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">"shopping for love"</span></strong> then you will understand why.</p>
              <p><strong>Simplify it, you don't buy something you cannot afford, and you won't go for someone who is beyond your reach.</strong> We are all shoppers for love in certain stages of our lives, we want more love from our parents when we're young, we want more love from our friends when we're at school, and etc till we want more love from our grandchildren.</p>
              <p><strong>We only shop or seek love from the people whom we know can afford to ask them for it.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>If you don't shop or cannot afford to shop but to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">wait</span> like a beggar then your love life will be as poor as a beggar.  </strong></p>
              <p>Life is not fair and is not supposed to be fair, and people who wants life to be fair to them are lazy, incapable but jealous people.</p>
              <p>Do you all really think the people in the generations above you became successful and envy of others because they sit back and relax and life became easy on them?</p>
              <p>Do not think about right now, think about what will happen in your future if people don't start to awake from their bubble dream.</p>

              <p><b>You think every lady is like you? Able to "heal" the guys they
              rejected?</b> You are right to say most of the guys are timid, but some
              ladies are timid too, and this is a cause for a vicious cycle.</p>
              <p>Just imagine, a guy likes this girl. But both the guy and the
              girl are shy and timid. Let's say one day the guy finally had the
              courage to ask her out, but even if they did go out on a date, I
              would bet the guy won't dare to ask because he knows the girl is
              shy. And he's afraid that after being rejected, they can't even be
              friends anymore because she's just too shy.</p>
              <p>And if that shy girl is not like you, able to "heal" him, that's
              it for their relationship even as friends if he was to ask her.</p>
              <p>Morale of the story: Not everyone is like you, so
              straightforward and honest. Most Singaporeans are timid and shy and
              introvert in some ways. It's our characteristics, and of course I
              know it's bad, and we should change.</p>
              <p>Added: I think you've yet to see girls that are so WTF. Tell
              them my true feelings for them, and they play MIA. You have to
              weigh both sides, you can't put all the blame on the
              guys. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></p>

              would this so-called 'healing' actually wound the relationship MORE because the females are under the impression that they are just 'friends' with the guy, and yet the guy is under the impression that he's getting the thumbs-up sign?
              
              wouldn't 'being just friends' egg the guy on, only to lead him to an even more painful rejection?!

              <p>Sure...girls can also confess to guys, but chances are there are more attractive girls than good-looking guys out there. So what kind of odds are we discussing about?</p>

              <p>Maybe guys doesn't realise it, but it's girls who actually subconsciously encouraged the guys to confess. Else, where do you think the guy got that much confident to confess if the girl don't provide any more than a normal/regular response to the guy?</p>
              <p>Girls who doesn't confess their feelings as what most guys desired, will still be able to become a woman. But guys who are unable to confess their feelings to the girls they desired, will NEVER become a MAN.</p>

              <p>  Sexist comment =(</p>
              <p>  Guys do not like all sort of girls. We appreciate all female bodies but not equally. For example, fat girls digust me, but I know some guys who are "chubby chasers" (wierdos). Even if it's not a physical trait like "fatness", maybe a negative personality, like jealousy, it will still annoy me.</p>
              <p>  And how do you know if the guy even <em>has anything to confess</em>? My friends (poly) always sabo me with my classmate saying I have a crush on her (i have alot of wierd friends). The girls friends would ask me to confess and I would deny it and the more I deny it the more they think I like the girl (average looking) even though she actually has really bad BO. So I just learn to roll with the punches and not care. Which isn't working...</p>

              <p><br> How often do you see girls confessing to guys?</p>
              <p>And is there a reason for guys to assume this will happen to
              them or were they hoping for girls to confess to them?</p>
              <p>Sure...girls can also confess to guys, but chances are there are
              more attractive girls than good-looking guys out there. So what
              kind of odds are we discussing about?</p>
              <p>Guys likes all sort of girls, but girls don't really like all
              sort of guys.</p>
              <p>Maybe guys doesn't realise it, but it's girls who actually
              subconsciously encouraged the guys to confess. Else, where do you
              think the guy got that much confident to confess if the girl don't
              provide any more than a normal/regular response to the guy?</p>
              <p>Girls who doesn't confess their feelings as what most guys
              desired, will still be able to become a woman. But guys who are
              unable to confess their feelings to the girls they desired, will
              NEVER become a MAN.</p>
