              <p><br>I thought you already know that? Cos you mentioned "guys not having the guts to confess their feelings to the girl they like"?</p>
              <p>If you don't think this is a problem with guys nowadays then maybe you are also one of them?</p>
              <p>And if girls still have to make the first move to go after and confess to the guys, then guys nowadays certainly have no value at all.</p>
              <p>It just makes them no difference from a cow.....a sperm cow. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p>Guys can always choose to remain as boys, since there is almost no difference between them already.</p>

              <p><br> I got my own ways to heal the guys that I've rejected. It all

              <p>The problem with your story is that it is really a story. There
                  is no correct ending or development in your story. You control how
                  you want your story to turn out, so of course I am also smart
                  enough not to waste my time and fall into your game plan. Maybe
                  ultimately you wished to show me that you're right, but I also know
                  that it is wasting my time to go confuse in your story later.</p>
              <p>So the answer is NO. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>I'm not here to prove anything right or rather wrong in your case. You do seem quite self-righteous online though I may not know you in real-life. Just give it a thought, have you ever really tried to agree with a point of view that might not be what you thought of from the beginning? It's just a thought that crossed my mind.</p>
              <p>Anyway, this story was told to me by a counsellor friend, a few years back. I did not give it much thought then after she gave me her answer as I found it more to be a joke than anything else.</p>
              <p>Here is what she said, "Damn those 2 idiots, the perfect one has been in their life the whole time but they just got to go around looking for "the one" without realising that they are just too afraid to venture beyond friendship for fear that they will lose this "Unique Friendship" should they develop further. Stabilty is the key obstacle to change. Without risk, there are no rewards, especially the most fulfilling ones. The are no absolutes in life."</p>
              <p>This story just crossed my mind when I was reading all these posts. The fear of change to the current situation or rather state of relationship, is most probably the biggest hinderance to a confession. It's like playing a game of "Pushing beer mugs on the bar counter". You want go the furthest (Closest) without going over the edge (Rejected). You can say that this mentality is develop from the simple fact that they actually treasure the current status of the relationship and would not want jeapordise it in any manner.</p>
              <p>Of course, I'm not saying that by not confessing it is a good thing, but I'm saying, most of the guys will hesistate to confess when they know that they might go over the edge and get rejected and maybe not be friends anymore.</p>
              <p>Parn, you might be exceptional in the way you handle a rejection, and not shy away after a confession from a guy. But I'm quite sure that for every one woman who is like you, there will be another 5 who would want to hide from the guy who confess to them previously. Maybe I'm too old to understand the new mordern young women, but in my day, the scenario is almost always so.</p>

              <p>This I would not agree unless you are only talking about yourself (But I'm not pointing at anything because I dun know you in real life and thus would not know). It seems to me that you are putting the respondsibilty of the woman's vagina into the hands of the guys.</p>
              <p>A man could want, but a girl could like a man but not give it, unless she is so innocent to think that by giving it to a man, it means she loves him. The decision to give is entirely up to the lady. Let's not talk about rape here in case you are thinking in that direction, because you dun need to confess to a man, for a man to want to rape you. It is a different scenario all together.</p>
              <p>If I were to agree with you, can I say that all sex predators will not confess to a girl under the pretext of wanting their body? And also, can I assume that base on what you said, a lady would not need to have sex with the guy, should the guy confess instead of the lady? If both are true, can I then assume that the girl must have sex with the guy should the girl confess to the guy instead? Lastly, can I assume that you, parn, would never have the risk of unwated pregnacy when you have sex because it is always the guy who confess to you?</p>
              <p>Again, the last question is not personal, I can only point this question at you
              because it seems that you are the only girl I know who actually thinks
              in this manner. Most girls I know will just tell that if they are to
              confess to a guy instead of the guy confessing to them, they actually
              lose pride and the bargaining ground in a relationship because the guy
              can say that they threw themselves at him. This I think would be a more
              rational arguement than what you have said, even though it is fill with
