I think society unfairly expects men to be more courageous about such things, but really, why? Both genders have the equal opportunity to confess right? Of course when it boils down to the individual some are more upfront, some are more introverted, its a personality thing. Why make it out to be gender specific when it isn't?</p></div>

              <p>Okie....all those who are happy with their current lives can continue to come up with excuses to cover their weakness and hopefully find a partner who shares similar values to complement them.</p>

              <p>Truth are words spoken directly and honestly from the
              heart. Take away the heart, words became lies.</p>
              <p>People who are unable to speak from directly from their hearts
              are dishonest people. They choose to deceive others and shut away
              their heart, hoping that nobody will actually uncover their
              lies.</p>
              <p>Action and time does not speak louder than words, they
              are incomplete without words. They are unable to
              convey the complete meaning of truth without words.</p>
              <p>Truth are the most powerful reason for people to utilise
              words. Hearts rejoices upon hearing the truth spoken in
              words.</p>
              <p>Actions and time are meaningless without words. If that is
              the kind of life you have been living in, you have been living your

              <p>Words are also meaningless without the action.</p>
              <p>Someone can say to you, "I love you" all the time. Morning, afternoon and evening he will keep saying it. But doesn't that sort of cheapen that supposingly sacred expression if no action is done to prove that the guy is really in love with the girl?</p>
              <p>I am not saying that words are not important. Both cannot survive without the other. Though I would prefer hearing less words than seeing them actually put into action. Because the more words you say, the more promises you make, the harder it is to act them out.</p>
              <p>And words without action to back them up...what are those?</p>
              <p>They are called lies.</p>

              <p>If you were to read one of my previous post carefully in this thread, I already mentioned "Action and time does not speak louder than words, they are incomplete without words."</p>
              <p>Maybe I should make it clearer for all, truth is completed when words are complement with action over time.</p>

              <p><br>Maybe if you have $30k, you would've someone better.</p>
              <p>Rather than taking a shot here, why don't you tell us your girl isn't worthy for you to give her a $30k proposal ring?</p>
              <p>Seems like when monetary terms comes up, people get agitated easily. Who cares if you cannot afford it? Who cares if you can? All that matters is what is the truth in your heart, and have you done your best?</p>
              <p>If you haven't done your best at anything, then take it like a man if things doesn't goes too well. You will only lie to yourself if you only know how to lift your hand and point fingers at another, don't do it...cos they are innnocent.</p>

              <p>the idea is not about the difficulty of doing it. but you don't have to force someone to do certain things to tell you he's ur whoever.</p>
              <p>it's not significant to you maybe. missing the golden word might result in questioning of your love or your activity which demands more attention than the word honey?</p>
