              <p>Damned if you do.. damned if you dont.</p>
              <p>Parn is setting in - motion some kind of ... feeding frenzy ideology
                  to the males out there. What you guys got to lose! Your dignity only ma
                  hor! And sure.. we should all not take rejections seriously. And yes..
                  we guys all have the same psyche , same values, same experiences and
                  same level of tolerence.</p>
              <p>I waiting for someone to actually do exactly as she advices,  which i mean, its not that bad. In terms of her pov. And assuming that most men' or should i say..'boys' fit under the category, AND on top of that, rejected by the women which also has similiar traits as above mentioned.</p>
              <p>What happened to die die must win ? or.. never say die. or.. wait for the right time.. or being opportunistic.  Its similiar to the theory of asking 100 women out, and statistically, at least la.. at least 1 u will be able to score. So why the complication.</p>
              <p>Rejections aside, once a guy believes in this philosophy, there wont be any problems with rejections. But anyways that is TS's view . he he.</p>
              <p>If someone benefits from the advice, its good. If not..  well..  lol..  u only lose ur face and dignity only right ? hahaha</p>

              <p>i dont think my statement was anything like an act of male chauvanism imo. in fact it was quite the contrary to be honest. neither am i saying that its an excuse for the above mentioned action, or inaction for that matter.</p>
              <p>what i am saying cannot be denied. pride is quite a large constituent of the male identity and that is true since eons ago. its nothing good or redeeming, but it is certainly the reason why guys do not confess their true feelings to girls.</p>

              <p>if a guy is truly interested in a girl, most of the time he will show it by action (eg. chatting her up, show care and concern, compliment and pay particular attention to the girl, date her out, sharing with her about his daily life)</p>
              <p>The girl will normally be able FEEL it. The girl can choose to reciprocate or not..its up to her....</p>
              <p>Some shy ones may not do all these at all, cos they just can't or believe that they have no chance with you. can't help much about this type...i think some also needs time to build up their courage to "chat you up" or wait for an opportunity to get more acquainted...</p>
              <p>alot of such things are at play...confidence, pride, timing, surrounding.</p>
