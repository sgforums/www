              <p>It's alright if you are not able to understand what I wrote. But at least you know I'm right, else you won't be so agitated over it.</p>
              <p>IT doesn't matters who is more right here, but it's up to each individual to take their own steps in life. People are able to judge for themselves which advice is useful for them.</p>
              <p>I have started this topic and posted my own opinions here, and that's entirely original and honest to what I felt is best to help guys with confession problems.</p>
              <p>I do not represent all girls, and neither do you represent all guys. You must be really naive if you think someone is enforcing their opinions on others. If that person really have to exist in here, then wouldn't that person be you?</p>

              <p>One of the FHM girl next door - Like guys who drop hint but act cool when asked if he likes her.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>How? Every girl got their own expectations. But you cannot simply condemned the whole male species just because they do not swing your way. Whatever wickle your waddle, whatever tickles your fancy.</p>
              <p>Your not the only one. Only Jade Seah can say something like that and get away with it.</p>

              <p>You mentioned...</p>
              <p>"Is that they always make it sound like EVERY female on earth THINK and FEEL in the exact same way as them and EVERY guy on earth should react in the same way according to them."</p>
              <p>Which is by the way, not true. Because we're not fembots.</p>
              <p>But you did not disagree with all the expectations that they have mentioned, be it your female friends, random hot blogger, fhm girl, some random hot girl on a magazine, and me.</p>
              <p>Why do you even seek or remembers the comments made by those girls if you do not agreed with them?</p>
              <p>Expectations are necessary because we are humans and our expectations clearly defines us as an original living individual.</p>
              <p>Nobody is condemning the entire male species, and you are still unable to prove your point. So do not assumed that the entire male species has been condemned.</p>
              <p>Unlike you, I have stated the truth unless you can prove me wrong, you don't really need to hide behind your clone. That's a cowardly act.</p>

              <p>If the person who has rejected you, allows the friendship to fall into the awkward zone, then this person doesn't even like you as a friend to begin with. Either that, or none of you actually took an effort to save the friendship. It's understandable to be passive and wait for each other to take the first step to save the friendship, but that passiveness is what really took away the last breath of whatever is left in the friendship.</p>
              <p>Friendship, relationship cannot be form by an individual alone. They all requires two agreeable individuals as least to form either friendship or relationship.</p>
              <p>Sometimes people confess their feelings to each other without a clear knowledge of which type of friendship they have or have not formed. So neither of each parties in the friendship has a clue on what to do next. Reasons is because they don't even know if they were real friends before the confession. There are of course many types of friendships and relationships out there, be it the hello-goodbyes, mutual beneficial, one-sided, back-stabbing, competitive, selfish, political, admire-type, real, and many more.</p>
              <p>If either person wishes to salvage the friendship after a bad confession, that person must take efforts to save the friendship from falling into the awkward zone.</p>
              <p>Have it ever occurred to you that if you have taken the initiative to save the friendship, things would've turned out a lot better by now?</p>
              <p>I know it doesn't make sense why one must be always the person to take the first step, but if a painter does not has the initiative to pick up the brush and start painting, how would the painter knows how magnificent their next creation would looked like? If you don't take the initiative to make the effort to salvage the friendship, how would you ever know if your life will be so much better with her in your future than not in your future?</p>
              <p>Our decisions in life paints our grand painting till the end of our life. Don't you ever wished you had made a different decision in your life?</p>
              <p>Life can be so much more beautiful than it is right now, and it's up to you to make it so. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
