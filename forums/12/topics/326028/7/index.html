              <p>Confessing your love to someone especially with the threat of rejection is not an easy thing to overcome, guy or girl. I think society unfairly expects men to be more courageous about such things, but really, why? Both genders have the equal opportunity to confess right? Of course when it boils down to the individual some are more upfront, some are more introverted, its a personality thing. Why make it out to be gender specific when it isn't?</p>

              <p>If you can understand the term "shopping for love" then you will
              understand why.</p>
              <p>Simplify it, you don't buy something you cannot afford, and you
              won't go for someone who is beyond your reach. We are all shoppers
              for love in certain stages of our lives, we want more love
              from our parents when we're young, we want more love from our
              friends when we're at school, and etc till we want more love
              from our grandchildren.</p>
              <p>We only shop or seek love from the people whom we know
              can afford to ask them for it.</p>
              <p>If you don't shop or cannot afford to shop but to wait like
              a beggar then your love life will be as poor as a beggar.
               </p>
              <p>Life is not fair and is not supposed to be fair, and people
              who wants life to be fair to them are lazy, incapable but
              jealous people.</p>
              <p>Do you all really think the people in the generations above you
              became successful and envy of others because they sit back and
              relax and life became easy on them?</p>
              <p>Do not think about right now, think about what will happen in
              your future if people don't start to awake from their bubble
              dream.</p>

              <p>Hmm...</p>
              <p>So you are saying that love is equivalent to money? That when you are looking for love, you are also looking for money, hence you are looking out for someone who is able to provide for you in a material sense?</p>
              <p>What is that person is full of love, but does not have a lot of money in his bank account? If you are truly shopping for love, you should be able to accept him right?</p>

              <p>Thanks for the answer.</p>
              <p>Well, if you read my question carefully, you will notice there is a keyword there.</p>
              <p>"What if one day you find someone
                                      who is poor, but he is deeply in love with you, he could offer you
                                      his care, concern and love but he does not have <span style="color: #ff0000;">enough</span> to provide
                                      for your material needs.."</p>
              <p>The keyword is enough.</p>
              <p>I am not saying that every girl should go and marry a guy who is totally penniless. I am not as hopelessly romantic as that. I do know that money is needed in this world in order to help us to survive, even more so in a country such as Singapore where the cost of living is high.</p>
              <p>But why do I stress on the word "enough"? Because we as girls can determine that. Different girls have different needs. For example, I am very happy with a simple life with a roof above my head, and with enough food to eat. I do not need extravagant gifts, extravagant cars that cost millions, etc. I know how to differentiate between my needs and my wants. And I accept the fact that a guy can't cater to my every wants, and that doesn't make him any less than the man he is.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If a guy can't provide for your "wants", it is not because he is not ready, it is not because he is selfish or so on. It might be because the demands are not not realistic to begin with. So if you have unrealistic demands, then be prepared to be disappointed because you have to understand that a majority of the men here belong in the middle class category, which means they are not earning 10k every month.</p>
