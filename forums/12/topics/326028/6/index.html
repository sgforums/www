              <p>If you can understand the term "shopping for love" then you will understand why.</p>
              <p>Simplify it, you don't buy something you cannot afford, and you won't go for someone who is beyond your reach. We are all shoppers for love in certain stages of our lives, we want more love from our parents when we're young, we want more love from our friends when we're at school, and etc till we want more love from our grandchildren.</p>
              <p>We only shop or seek love from the people whom we know can afford to ask them for it.</p>
              <p>If you don't shop or cannot afford to shop but to wait like a beggar then your love life will be as poor as a beggar.  </p>
              <p>Life is not fair and is not supposed to be fair, and people who wants life to be fair to them are lazy, incapable but jealous people.</p>
              <p>Do you all really think the people in the generations above you became successful and envy of others because they sit back and relax and life became easy on them?</p>
              <p>Do not think about right now, think about what will happen in your future if people don't start to awake from their bubble dream.</p>

              <p>If you can understand the term "shopping for love" then you will
              understand why.</p>
              <p>Simplify it, you don't buy something you cannot afford, and you
              won't go for someone who is beyond your reach. We are all shoppers
              for love in certain stages of our lives, we want more love
              from our parents when we're young, we want more love from our
              friends when we're at school, and etc till we want more love
              from our grandchildren.</p>
              <p>We only shop or seek love from the people whom we know
              can afford to ask them for it.</p>
              <p>If you don't shop or cannot afford to shop but to wait like
              a beggar then your love life will be as poor as a beggar.
               </p>
              <p>Life is not fair and is not supposed to be fair, and people
              who wants life to be fair to them are lazy, incapable but
              jealous people.</p>
              <p>Do you all really think the people in the generations above you
              became successful and envy of others because they sit back and
              relax and life became easy on them?</p>
              <p>Do not think about right now, think about what will happen in
              your future if people don't start to awake from their bubble
              dream.</p>

              <p>interesting concept on shopper for love.</p>
              <p>guys or girls alike.</p>
              <p>if you like something, you must fight for it. you wait for him, he wait for you. in the end the time flies past, moment lost.</p>
              <p>can afford, either can go anyhow buy or take your pick.</p>
              <p>cannot afford, still can window shop.. lol.. if not snatch with others during sale seasons lo.</p>

              <p>u don't understand what I saying.. make do is because in the first place u can't afford.</p>
              <p>it's not getting attached for the sake of it. for some people, maybe in their whole life nobody bothers about them or even looks at them.</p>
              <p>it's just about lowering your expectations and going for someone of your own level.</p>
              <p>not rich enough don't chiong high end goods. humble background can forget about those rich princess or what.. those dramas on tv are fake la.. Chinese saying, "men dang hu dui" meaning must match in a way in terms of background and such..</p>
