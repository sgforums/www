Every woman and man will always say they want to be different, because it helps in their ego.<br><br>Granted this is true. Every individual is different. But what they did not say is that, men and women are totally different in every way, biologically and psychologically. Why is it that women understand what women mean but men don't understand them ? Why is it that some girls prefer lesbians?<br><br>Clearly, men need more help than women. Women have the power in relationships. They will always want to be the chased. They always want to feel like a princess. Seldom do we see the females choose to be the aggressor. That's the universal rule and I agree with this. It's not about judging females as a whole or whatsoever. True, there are females with different personalities, ranging from pure selfishness to pure selflessness. This also depends on the girl's family upbringing and moral values.<br><br>However, there are certain common traits that women display such as some excuses and doing things by their emotions. This is not bashing women. Clearly, women behave much more differently than men as a whole. That's where certain books come in to help explain the differences so men know what to do. Experiences play the most important.<br><br>doko</div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> The irony thing about books is that most people ain't reading it objectively - especially books on love and relationship. Subconsciously, one would selectively picked and decides which point made the most sense to them, in reference to his/her experience, as the book reiterated and reinforced their own perception of love (or the opposite gender).<br><br>You will be surprised when woman read something about man and they go 'ya ya ya... it's so true...' but when I mentioned that their boyfriend isn't like that at all, they will be like 'most man la'.<br><br>Such phenomenon is widespread.<br><br>Do remember that our experience doesn't make up the experience of others because we all have different cosmic lesson. One's experience is not a good representation of entire picture of love, because that's probably an example of ONE lesson taught by love.<br><br>P.S: I don't think I would want to go the long and short of this debate again, since we have discussed this the previous round. I respect the fact that if having that belief works well for you, then I am glad to respect it's function in your life because I was taught to understand individual as individual. Probably due to my brush with astrology.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

I think whatever you have pointed out is what most guys are having trouble with. But, asking a guy to do all these may be, well, asking too much. Some how I feel that girls are always expecting this and expecting that whereas guys are more like anything will do. Sometimes, its the high expectations that the girls set for the guys that really stress/ tire them out.<br><br>Ok, not all girls are like that and I am not trying to generalise here, but you can't deny that there are girls like that too. So how do you suggest guys deal with girlfriends with lots of demands, in terms of emotional, mental, physical (not physical as in sex but being together always)?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think we should all realise that guys and girls are different species of people... they do and expect things differently...<br><br>Guys are more shui bian shui bian, and if their girlfriend treat them a bit more shui bian, they also wouldn't mind. They can't keep putting 100% of all his efforts solely on his girlfriend... they have to allocate time for their family, their work, their friends and their own personal enjoyment... Sad to say, men have much more activity that he want to do alone than with their partners such as playing games, going out with male friends, thinking of work etc. I think that there is a need for realising that men will definitely slip back in effort after some time. If one expect the other to keep making effort in maintaining the relationship, you are controlling him and really deriving him from happiness.<br><br></div>
