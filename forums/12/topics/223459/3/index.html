            <div class='col-md body'>Here are yr flaws<br><br>- Meet once or twice a week-&gt; maybe should start increasing what. LIke morning go work or school and things like that then meet in the evening for dinner and things like that<br><br>- Mostly, she calls (she's not happy that I didnt call much)-&gt; Since u know she likes talking to u then u should talk more to her. Take initiative to call. Haha. Same as my stead too. everytime is i call him one. Maybe its both of yr fault. She should be more understanding that u need space and u should be more understanding to her needs too.<br><br>- When she's troubled, she's unhappy that I didnt notice and didnt console her-&gt; This one is also both yr fault. Her fault because she EXPECT U TO KNOW and never tell u. BUt its also yr fault because u not caring enough and nver put in an effort to understand her body language better.<br><br>- She once impersonated a third person gal and pretended to befriend me. She's upset that I agreed to meet up and be friends with that "girl"-&gt; thats too extreme! Shes over doing it<br><br>- I keep a few pictures of female models-&gt; Lusting after some other woman's body when you are attached is a no no.<br><br>- I wrote in an internet forum about how the r/s was giving me stress at a period of time. (she found out and was not happy)-&gt; As long as u didnt include her name it should be OKAY.After all, we all need a little space to vent our frustrations<br><br>I think u should write a letter to her and analyse everything that went wrong in the relationship. Apologize for yr mistakes but request that she should make an effort to change for it takes two hands to clap. Send a gift to apologize liek flowers or collect a lot of saga seeds to put in a bottle or sth. If she doesnt want to patch back.. then... I think u should move on.</div>

For sure I am trying to understand girls. I am always reading and finding out more about the female species. I read so many books on Mars and Venus  and many other attracting and "playing the game" types of books. I can always tell people how to attract and sianz their admirers, but i always can't seem to help myself. I recently just lost a female friend whom I really liked a lot. The reason? I was too whiny, being like a wussy all the time and demand her attention when she wasn't even my girlfriend. I know all my problems but haiz, just can't avoid it when my heart gets "blinded". I know I can't get her friendship back as i know how girls think. Once they call it quits, it's game over. Thus, i'm now still getting over it. I know I can do it and it will be a matter of time before I start interacting with the opposite sex again. Cheers.</div>

There are many other things in life other than this area which I can work and concentrate on.

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't think you are to be fully blamed for this. I personally hate the part where she purposely set up a test to test your response. What is this ? Who is she to set up tests here and there one ?<br><br>It may sounds horrible that you call her lesser and lesser and treat her more and more normal etc, but it is really what most guys do. When you chase her, you give your 2000% from what you will do usually to a close person. When you succeed chasing her, you gradually drop to 100%. She have to face it... honeymoon period is over. Your father may have used up a lot of efforts to chase your mum then, are they as loving as they used to or more loving than you and your girlfriend ? If they are more loving than you and your girlfriend, you deserve a kick up your ass. If they just behave like ordinary father and mother, then it is a clear sign honeymoon period  is true. The only thing uncertain is how long it last... some people a year, some people a few months and some people many years... but she have to face it one day and accept u as it is... otherwise it is really time for a break up</div>

Every woman and man will always say they want to be different, because it helps in their ego.<br><br>Granted this is true. Every individual is different. But what they did not say is that, men and women are totally different in every way, biologically and psychologically. Why is it that women understand what women mean but men don't understand them ? Why is it that some girls prefer lesbians?<br><br>Clearly, men need more help than women. Women have the power in relationships. They will always want to be the chased. They always want to feel like a princess. Seldom do we see the females choose to be the aggressor. That's the universal rule and I agree with this. It's not about judging females as a whole or whatsoever. True, there are females with different personalities, ranging from pure selfishness to pure selflessness. This also depends on the girl's family upbringing and moral values.<br><br>However, there are certain common traits that women display such as some excuses and doing things by their emotions. This is not bashing women. Clearly, women behave much more differently than men as a whole. That's where certain books come in to help explain the differences so men know what to do. Experiences play the most important.<br><br>doko</div>

And she should let you know what she wants instead of flaring up at you.<br><br>So take this as a lesson. In your next r/s, if you sense that your girl is starting to cut off contact wif you, try to ask her out and ask her wats wrong. Communication is key in all r/s.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
