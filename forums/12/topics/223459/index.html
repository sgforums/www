            <div class='col-md body'>Today we just broke off and it was on rather bad terms as well.<br><br>Her main unhappiness was that I didnt respect her and that my heart is not with her. I am confused. Its true that i am shui bian but I didnt cheat or abuse her. I aso didnt disrespect her or what.<br><br>Below are the list of things which she's not happy about:<br><br>- Meet once or twice a week (she says its too few)<br>- Mostly, she calls (she's not happy that I didnt call much)<br>- When she's troubled, she's unhappy that I didnt notice and didnt console her<br>- She once impersonated a third person gal and pretended to befriend me. She's upset that I agreed to meet up and be friends with that "girl".<br>- I keep a few pictures of female models<br>- I wrote in an internet forum about how the r/s was giving me stress at a period of time. (she found out and was not happy)<br><br>The thing which happened today was the icing on the cake. She had a language exam today and I sms'ed to ask her how was it. The first part was ok and after the break, she sms'ed to say that the second part was difficult. Then she came to my place to borrow a book. I was tired and asked her to come up to my place to take it.<br><br>My impression was that she wanted the book and go straight off to photostat, so I just passed her the book and closed the metal gate. She flared up and accused me of being insensitive and not consoling her about the exam and treating her "like a dog" by not inviting her into the house.<br><br>I was very surprised. She has stayed over at my place the night before so its surprising that she flared up when I didnt invite her in.  Also, I thot that the difficult part of the exam was a minor part since it was only listening.<br><br>I'm not all bad. I also buy her things, sms her, provide advice and encouragement, drive her home if the family car is avaliable. Like today, she forgot her exam pass, so I drove her all the way to her house to collect her pass(which is quite far) and drove her back.<br><br>I would like to see opinions on which have I done wrong?<br><br>Ya, on hindsight, I should have been more attentive about her troubles but the thing is she didnt tell me. Things like buying of cinema tickets. Most of the time she buys the tickets in advance and she didnt sound displeased or what. But when we have our arguments, she'll bring up this matter and say I take her for granted. I mean......if she's tired or feel that i'm taking for granted, why don't she tell me in the first place..... I can buy the ticket. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>Its mostly these things which seem normal but somehow she takes it very seriously. Its confusing. Like sometimes when I am busy, i didnt reply to her sms immediately or soon enough, and she gets upset.<br><br>And I think she's unable to let past events go. Like sometimes when we are happily walking, she'll just say things like "you don't love me" or "you take me for granted".<br><br>Hai........its confusing. Which part am I in the wrong?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ok........thanks to all for the replies. Its encouraging.<br><br>I would like to carry on but i have my worries.

I am confused. Its true that i am shui bian but I didnt cheat or abuse her. I aso didnt disrespect her or what.<br><br>Below are the list of things which she's not happy about:<br><br>- Meet once or twice a week (she says its too few)<br>- Mostly, she calls (she's not happy that I didnt call much)<br>- When she's troubled, she's unhappy that I didnt notice and didnt console her<br>- She once impersonated a third person gal and pretended to befriend me. She's upset that I agreed to meet up and be friends with that "girl".<br>- I keep a few pictures of female models<br>- I wrote in an internet forum about how the r/s was giving me stress at a period of time. (she found out and was not happy)<br>Ya, on hindsight, I should have been more attentive about her troubles but the thing is she didnt tell me. Things like buying of cinema tickets. Most of the time she buys the tickets in advance and she didnt sound displeased or what. But when we have our arguments, she'll bring up this matter and say I take her for granted. I mean......if she's tired or feel that i'm taking for granted, why don't she tell me in the first place..... I can buy the ticket. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>Its mostly these things which seem normal but somehow she takes it very seriously. Its confusing. Like sometimes when I am busy, i didnt reply to her sms immediately or soon enough, and she gets upset.<br><br>And I think she's unable to let past events go. Like sometimes when we are happily walking, she'll just say things like "you don't love me" or "you take me for granted".<br><br>Hai........its confusing. Which part am I in the wrong?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> </div></blockquote>- Meet once or twice a week (she says its too few) ~~~~ meeting once/twice is quite little unless u really busy everyday else should've try give alittle more...<br>- Mostly, she calls (she's not happy that I didnt call much) ~~~~regarding calls u also should've take initiative more since u know she likes talking to u...<br>- When she's troubled, she's unhappy that I didnt notice and didnt console her ~~~ as for this its difficult to catch so cant help it, hv to take the blame...<br>- She once impersonated a third person gal and pretended to befriend me. She's upset that I agreed to meet up and be friends with that "girl". ~~~~ this one can argue since its only 'fren' but u lose when she say u can meet her but not ur own gf using the time....<br>- I keep a few pictures of female models ~~~~ she will get jealous so keep secretly...<br>- I wrote in an internet forum about how the r/s was giving me stress at a period of time. (she found out and was not happy) ~~~~ at least dun use the nic she knows la... wat are clones for?<br><br>by reading on ur story, u dun fail badly but still not good... more gentleman conduct would be better... so up to u if u wanna continue with this or start a new relationship...<br></div>
