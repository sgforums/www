              <p>all wrong. at the end of the day, it all comes down to lack of respect and self-control. if you have both, you will definitely have ways to fix the problems, initially by having heart to heart talk with each other, like unsatisfactoriness of sex. if not, no way to get out of it. sadly, there are people who enjoy the thrill of committing adultery.</p>

              <p>yes. that's why i talked about respect and self control. excessive nagging and accusation are basically lacking respect and losing self-control behaviors.</p>

              <p>yes. that's why i talked about respect and self control.
              excessive nagging and accusation are basically lacking respect and

              <p>i'm guilty of being a very highly sexual man with a past. my modest gf's libido is not close to my level but we always talked it out and tried the best way that both of us can be satisfied. if u just look for sex, marry a prostitute or a slut, but u will get bored in the end anyway. marry a modest loving girl, love her, treat her right, when she opens up, you'll be surprised.</p>

              <p>His clients get so lonely that they make a move on him. And it's
              not just the women.<br> <br> Mr John Vasavan deals with warring couples and unfaithful spouses.
              His job is to help salvage marriages which are on the rocks.<br> <br> And he knows a thing or two about why spouses stray, and what to do
              to avoid being trapped in an illicit affair.<br> <br> Says the 52-year-old, who has worked as a marriage counsellor for
              the past two decades: "Sometimes, they stalk us through e-mail,
              asking to meet up, asking us to come over to their place..."<br> <br> Happily married for about 20 years himself, he is very cautious
              about clients who get "touchy" during counselling sessions.<br> <br> In such cases, he usually makes sure they are properly attired
              before offering a comforting pat on the back.<br> <br> He explains: "Some women come for counselling scantily clad. So I
              make sure to pass them a blanket or jacket before any physical
              contact happens.<br> <br> "I also always sit facing the door or window, so that people can
              see us. You must learn to protect yourself, you know," says the
              father of three, aged 15 to 19.<br> <br> Before setting up his own practice a decade ago, Mr Vasavan
              enrolled for counselling courses and took on cases as a volunteer
              at the Singapore Planned Parenthood Association.<br> <br> He went on to pursue a Masters in Counselling at the University of
              South Australia.<br> <br> After 20 years of helping couples through tough times, he declares
              that the number one reason for marriages running into problems is
              not enough talk.<br> <br> Wives, for instance, can get so caught up with their kids, they
              stop communicating properly with their husbands.<br> <br> And when the children grow up and the women want to reconnect, it
              may be too late - the husband has already become engrossed in other
              activities.<br> <br> But the question remains: Why do people cheat on their spouses?</p>
