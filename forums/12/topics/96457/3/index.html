I dont even know you, and you dont even know me..and it touches me most to see that you're trying to help me.<br><br>Thank you everyone. You have my continued support in this forum.</strong><br><br>Good news..<br><br>I managed to solve the problem.  She whined (again) about "jumping down the block.. i'm at the rooftop.. it's quiet here i'm gonna jump.. " ok fine.. So i told her on the phone..<br><br>"I can't bear to see you die, I'm going first. Enough of you threatening me. I'm GOING to make u regret now."<br><br><strong>Fight fire with fire.</strong><br><br>Which I promptly turned off my handphone. <strong>Of course I won't jump</strong>, heh. I drove to the gym as usual... left my handphone at home. Silence really felt so good... I had the best workout of my life..<br><br>Great coordination with my dad as well.. <strong>I told him to call my girlfriend 15 minutes later, asking her why I went out barefoot and crying</strong>. Dad's acting was so realistic that even my sister came out of her room and gave him the stare.  LOL. My girlfriend got the biggest shock of her life... She even begged my dad to find me. Dad said he couldnt do anything much because I took his car out. But of course, dad knew what was going on.<br><br>I returned home around 11pm, with a naturally tired voice, called her.<strong> She was so happy to hear my voice she started apologizing for her foolish acts and that she wouldn't think about suicide ever again. </strong><br><br>Sometimes, the weirdest solutions do work.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">[/b]</blockquote>Good for you revvieee... At least now the problem is solved.. sometimes you need to use reverse psychology.. but anyway.. is a good ending.. at least noone is hurt..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi revvieeee,<br><br>I think it is time for you to have a good talk with her. Well, let her understand that suicidal is no joke and that you are being disturbed by her behaviours. The usage of a soft approach will be deem useful for such talks. Well you will be able to understand her better  but in additional shows that you do care for her. Well, In a relationship there are always ups and downs and there is nv a perfect match for the other party. Therefore, to be successful in relationship mutal interaction and understanding is needed.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Cheers.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi have u taken advantage of her? if u did, maybe she feel <span style="color: green;">physically</span> and <span style="color: blue;">emotionally</span> yours. she may feel neglected or insecure at all times. she might feel that u are accountable for what she is right now. she wants u to be with her every minutes.she wants you to <span style="color: brown;">FEEL GUIILTY </span>if something bad has happen to her. in fact, she is playing psychologically. BUT there is <span style="color: red;">NO WIN WIN </span>situation! its going to make matter worse.<br><br>first, i think there are some questions that you need to answer and you really have to BE <span style="color: blue;">HONEST</span> to yourself. you can fool the others but not yourself. so lets be honest after all we are here to help you rite. ok  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"> the questions are:<br>1) have you taken advantage of her? if yes, do you think you have a responsibility towards her?( what i am trying to get at is whether both of you do engage in any sexual intercourse?- are both of your opinons parallel before engaging in intercourse? this is really important as she might think after you have her body, you might ignore her and just dump her aside) if the answer is <span style="color: red;">NO</span>. Then, you have to answer whether you still LOVE her? if the answer is YES, then ask yourself WHAT attracts you  to her in the first place? <span style="color: blue;">ANALYSE ANALYSE</span>.....is it because of her personality? ( but from what u wrote, i guess both of you have different personalities) so what makes you and her an item in the first place?  if the answer is NO. i dread seeing her. i am tired of her threats. then is no longer LOVE. then you have to make a drastic decision. tell her in her face. tell her that u used to love her this way......(eg) but nowsdays you tend to be......(eg) WHY? now be a ACTIVE listener. see what she has to say.....DONT INTERRUPT. ( at times, you may be a help rather than a hindrance). if she chooses to remain quiet, then you have a make a cruel decision. DONT BE SOFT. she is playing psychologically with you. she wants you to submissive to her. this will never ends.... another alternative is <span style="color: green;">BEAR WITH IT </span>and breaks the news to her on the day you get enlisted in NS. maybe while you are incamp, her wounds can heal slowly....<span style="color: red;"></span></div>
