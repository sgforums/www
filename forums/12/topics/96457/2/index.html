            <div class='col-md body'>My friend what she's doing is a classic case of emotional black mail. It'll only work if you react to her threats.<br><br>There is only one person who is to blame for a suicide - that's the person herself. No one else. You might feel guilty, but you did not do it.<br><br>The next time you receive a call or sms from her with a threat like that, refer the case to the Police. It's an offense to attemp suicide. She'll be arrested and given proper treatment.<br><br>She sounds psychotic, and she needs proper medical attention, and reporting her threats to the police is one sure way she gets it.<br><br>Tell her you're through with the relationship and that you'll sic the police on her everytime she threatens to kill herself.<br><br>Now go out there and find yourself a nice sane chick.

They said they couldnt help me out because I'm NOT her family member. However, they urged me to come down, file a report and show the officer the sms or threat. Then they would visit her house to clarify things up. The officer responded very nicely to my request. He told me that frankly, nothing could be done until the person actually ATTEMPTS suicide.

In other words, <strong>he can't do anything.</strong><br><br>Devil, I understand that she's addicted to it. She has a tendency to take things further if they DONT work, therefore it will LEAD to her jumping.

She calls my house, my friends and even MORE threatening messages appear.<br><br>I need help... some kind soul please...[/b]</blockquote>Dear revvieeee,<br><br>Sorry to hear about your story.. I wold like to ask is there any major incident that ever happen to her before.. and causes her to react in such a way?? People who often talks about commiting suicide.. are those that they normally wont do it.. Is the psychology.. They use this as threat to make people believe and show sympathy that they will actually do it.. In many of this cases.. how many will actually do?<br><br>She needs many attention.. especially from you.. cos she knows that you don't love her anymore.. She jus couldn't accept the fact that you are leaving her for good.. She's a pisces.. you're a scorpio.. two water element sign people.. No wonder thinks always can solved.. Both know that each other are too soft-hearted.. She make use of your weakness.. that's why again and again.. she's using the same old threat.. Cos she knows you too well.. that you wont leave her alone.. She uses emotions to attack you.. On the other hand.. you said that you know that she will really jump.. If she ever did.. or this really come across her mind.. You wont here telling us this story.. She wont be still here threating you over and over..<br><br>You cannot based on your feelings to judge things.. This is too serious.. She won't have the courage to jump.. You must be firm and strong.. Not to let her go over you.. and step you down.. If she really decide to jump.. there's nothing much to think about.. and she'll jus jump off the building liao..<br><br>If you think that talking to her family or friends are of no use.. then you have to settle it all by yourself.. Its jus a barrier in herself.. something which she cannot let go.. She doesn't love you too.. If she does.. she wont be reacting this way.. Like i say be firm.. don't be too soft hearted.. its getting no where.. If you ever got chance.. talk to her.. you have to! But then again.. is talking.. please don't ever end up quarrelling.. Good talk will help alittle.. better than nothing.. Seek for a professional consultation.. it can help too..<br><br>Cheers..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br><strong>I have just checked the SOS hotline, it works.  Its just that sometimes all the counsellors are engaged so you will have to wait and try again.</strong><br><br>First for yourself, please seek some counselling to help work some of the issues and stresses that you have experienced (including witnessing the body of the suicide) out of your system.  That is important for your future!<br><br>As for the girl, its clear that she is unstable.  I admire you for the strength and tenderness that you exhibit and the kindness you have for a fellow person even though she has put you through a lot.  YOu have been careful not to do anything drastic to push her over the edge.  Yes she clearly needs help and you will need to seek professional advise on how to deal with her and get her some help.<br><br>You will need to be there just a little longer until either you can pass the weight on to the professional smoothly or when they intervene.<br><br>Which school is she from?  There are I believe counsellors in school.  Call the school, ask to speak to the counsellor personally.  explain the situation with or without giving her name (depending on thecounsellor).  ask for advise.  Perhaps the counsellor can do something or have some suggestions.<br><br>Essentially what is required is for some authority and stability to be restored back into her mind that she is answerable to someone else other than herself at this point in time.  Handling this sort of situation is tricky and needs tenacity and quite a bit of firm authoritative handling coupled with a certain amount of tenderness.  That is the job of the psychologist in helping her come round.<br><br>As to whatever it is that may have contributed to this unfortunate situation lets leave that aside for now.<br><br>In Singapore just like in many countries, a person who is deemed to be a danger to himself can be detained for medical treatment if a medical professional determines it so.  So when seeing a patient they assess the mental stability of the patient and if they deem that she is a threat to herself, she can be referred for treatment  even by force! I forget the source of this authority. As for the police, you are right that the police cannot really do much unless she is doing something that is an immediate threat to her own safety like doing something stupid etc.<br><br>check out this URL below for some basic info and also for some numbers to call.<br><br>http://www.imh.com.sg/patient_education/bereavement.htm<br><br>Hope everything will be ok soon.</div>

We've been together for a year already. We both have quite a temper. When fire fights fire, bigger fire. She demands 101% from a relationship, I take it slow and easy, preferring not to commit myself too much to a relationship.  I'm the outdoor kind of person, I love sports. She's totally opposite. We fight very often. No violence, only war of words. I hate to have my face thrown anywhere. If we argue while we're outside and I fail to calm her down, I return her handbag and go home myself.<br><br><strong>Straight to the point. I dont love her anymore. I want a breakup.</strong><br><br>But I can't. 10 minutes after I break up with her, she'd write me a message..<br><br>"I'm on the 12th floor now, its quiet here. I'm going to jump. I'll MAKE YOU F-ING REGRET! YOU CAN COME AND COLLECT MY BODY!"<br><br>This has happened 30 to 40 times already. I'm sticking to her because she'll commit suicide if I leave her.<br><br><strong>Some people say "go ahead! ask her to jump, she wouldnt dare". </strong>I know her well myself, she's the kind of person who "cries wolf" to WARN you, then DO IT. She will jump someday, its just a matter of time.<br><br><strong>I've had nightmares over this. I dream that she's critically injured in some accident, and I just stand there, watching her die, cos I would rather she die in an accident than to commit suicide. It's taking a horrific mental toll on me. I feel so stressed, so drained of energy. I feel like killing her myself to shut her up.</strong><br><br>I dont want to visit the mortuary. I dont want the police coming to my house. I dont want her to die and have me REGRET for the rest of my life. THIS IS SO DAMN FRUSTRATING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br><br>Silencing my handphone is of NO USE. She calls my house, my friends and even MORE threatening messages appear.<br><br>I need help... some kind soul please...[/b]</blockquote><strong>Post on behalf of <span style="color: darkblue;">Yunhaier</span></strong>  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Scorpio has intense relartionship at least once in a lifetime.

She call me to tell me her bf dumped her and she told him she taken 30 panadol. So I ask her ...how much panadol ...she says 30. When I got to the house , she was whining about killing herself....and I told her direct: take a 100 then it will kill you instantly rather than slowly and painfully. She told me to bring her to the hospital which I did.<br><br>People threaten suicide ,  I call their parents to tell them to keep an eye on that person. If too many times, I tell them to get it right the first time.  Usually it's the guys who kill themselves suddenly .....but girls usually - it's a cry for help.<br><br>However saying all these, your gf is placing psychological pressure and manipulating you as she sees fit. Frankly if I were in ur shoes, I tell her to do what she want and she alone is responsible for her decisions including jumping off the roof.  I rather if they commit suicide, they better get it right the first time or else they may  end up on a ventilator like a vegetable.<br><br></div>
