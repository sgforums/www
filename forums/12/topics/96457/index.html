            <div class='col-md body'>Morning everyone,<br><br>This post isn't about "how do I tell this girl I like her" or "help, my girlfriend just dumped me".<br><br><strong>Its about getting rid of my girlfriend.</strong><br><br>I'm 19, my girlfriend's 18. We've been together for a year already. We both have quite a temper. When fire fights fire, bigger fire. She demands 101% from a relationship, I take it slow and easy, preferring not to commit myself too much to a relationship.  I'm the outdoor kind of person, I love sports. She's totally opposite. We fight very often. No violence, only war of words. I hate to have my face thrown anywhere. If we argue while we're outside and I fail to calm her down, I return her handbag and go home myself.<br><br><strong>Straight to the point. I dont love her anymore. I want a breakup.</strong><br><br>But I can't. 10 minutes after I break up with her, she'd write me a message..<br><br>"I'm on the 12th floor now, its quiet here. I'm going to jump. I'll MAKE YOU F-ING REGRET! YOU CAN COME AND COLLECT MY BODY!"<br><br>This has happened 30 to 40 times already. I'm sticking to her because she'll commit suicide if I leave her.<br><br><strong>Some people say "go ahead! ask her to jump, she wouldnt dare". </strong>I know her well myself, she's the kind of person who "cries wolf" to WARN you, then DO IT. She will jump someday, its just a matter of time.<br><br><strong>I've had nightmares over this. I dream that she's critically injured in some accident, and I just stand there, watching her die, cos I would rather she die in an accident than to commit suicide. It's taking a horrific mental toll on me. I feel so stressed, so drained of energy. I feel like killing her myself to shut her up.</strong><br><br>I dont want to visit the mortuary. I dont want the police coming to my house. I dont want her to die and have me REGRET for the rest of my life. THIS IS SO DAMN FRUSTRATING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br><br>Silencing my handphone is of NO USE. She calls my house, my friends and even MORE threatening messages appear.<br><br>I need help... some kind soul please...</div>

She warned me that if I tell her family, she'll jump. She warned me too that if the police comes, she'll jump because she knows she is already in deep shit.  Yes I've told her everything you've suggested but I really dont want to see her body.. I'm real upset and troubled over this.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i seriously feel for you and admire your level of tolerance here.<br><br><strong>no doubt you have done the right choice by calling the hotline</strong>, below is my personal opinion to such incident.<br><br>people like to use suicide as a form of threat to hold on to their bf/gf as they find no other means to keep them by their side.<br><br>and most of them gives up once they find it no longer effective.<br><br>the more a person crying to kill themselves, the more they fear of death. at least this is how i see it.<br><br>as they are too used to people stopping them from dying, they have no idea where to start from when others react nonchalant to their threats.<br><br>even if they really go ahead and do it, i strongly believe that the world can definitely do better with bums like this.</div>

How old is she and what's both your horoscopes..? You really want me to lock this thread...? Reason being...?<br><br>The way I see it... She's either just doing a plain threat (meaning she probably won't do the real thing) or she's really serious about it... And according to you, it would be the latter (which perhaps we shall see about it again later..?)..<br><br>1st thing's thing... Anything if really as per described by you and is true would label her a serious psycho case... Which would probably needs her to be locked up....<br><br>Then I would urge you... To RELAX... Don't get too stressed up... Just play along for now... Don't take it too personally and too much to heart... Cause if she really happens to jump, you can't be 24 hours around her to stop it from happening.. Not that you even want that to happen...?<br><br>And... Understand right now currently at this point, she's probably 'addicted' to it... Real threats or not... The SENSE of 'control' she has OVER YOU by her method... She's probably ENJOYING IT... And hence the INCREASE in such frequency... It's a more disadvantageous fact to you as the more she practises such... Does she have ANY history of sucidal attempt before <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"><br><br>Methods you could be using should be a handful...? But due to the limitation of my time, I shall just suggest one for now... Think over the method CAREFULLY before you put it into use... Otherwise it'll be just a waste of your time and a plan....<br><br><strong>Advice :</strong><br><br>Not to dump her but to 'drift' from her.... Show disconcern and such... Focus on your own life... Appear stuck up and do little things which would irritates her a little from time to time (try to do make drastic changes for her to notice...)... The idea is to do it gradually... As time goes by, she should notice your slight chances.... And hence thoughts slowly drift away...<br><br>Try to limit her 'sucidal threats' by doing things like getting late to the scene and not to be in a hurry... Slowly let her get USED to it.... Her 'control' should be reduced in a sense with time....<br><br>Key things now... You and her horoscopes...<br><br>Does she has any serious personal or family problems etc.?</div>
