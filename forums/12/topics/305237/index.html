Simply trying to be sociable isn't good enough.<br><br>I used to be a very self-absorbed person, and was even aware of it. But it took someone to tell me that to wake me up and suggest that I empathise with others. Once I started opening my mind up and allowing myself to see things from others' perspectives I found myself being able to connect with them better, which in turn made me happy to step out of my skin once in a while.<br><br>Of course, just remember that as an introvert, socialising is naturally taxing on you so don't be too hard on yourself at first. You may want to try being with a smaller group too to practise.</div>

I heard of people joining public speaking to get rid their fear of making public speeches and it also helps them to overcome their fear. In addition, it will also definitely require you to read up so that you have things to speak on during a public speaking session. Try toastmaster..<br><br></div>

              <p>To practice your social skills, play this game.</p>
              <p>Set 3 things you have to find out from people but you cannot ask them directly. Like their name, their favorite food, their favorite color.</p>
              <p>Give yourself 10 mins to find this out, if you can't then move on to the next person and play the game with them.</p>
              <p>This works, it makes you less uncomfortable because you are not trying to make them like you, you only need to find out 3 things. Also no fear of rejection because you're only spending 10 mins each, no need for lengthy, deep conversations about life so it's less stress.</p>
              <p>When you master this game, you can set more difficult things to find out and extend the time etc.</p>
