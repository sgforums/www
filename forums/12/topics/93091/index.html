            <div class='col-md body'>What I can say is that sometimes the wife is devoted and tired from looking after the house and kids, and guys being guys start to itch below. The woman being tired just wants to sleep so the passionate side of the relationship starts to die off and the guy strays.<br><br>Seen too many of this scenarios. Of course, this applies to the woman too when her husband keeps on working and she gets bored and gets a lover outside.<br><br>The thing is that in cases like these, though wrong, usually the guy/woman have no intentions of leaving their partner its just that they feel that no harm is done if they are not caught. The consequences are often never thought of when it comes to pleasures of the flesh.<br><br>Just my thoughts.</div>

Some women think that love/marriage can change a man, hence they will plunge into any relationship in the hopes that their love for the man will be enough to evoke a 360 degree turnaround in the man's (bad) habits and behaviour.<br><br>I would think that some marriages fail because of unrealistic expectations of each other.  Women think they can change their men after marriage, while men hope their women don't change after marriage.<br><br></div>
