She's not the only one having this problem in this world I know, there are others as well suffering in silence.  What's the use of getting married in the first place?  Wasting time and money and effort, now our people just got scared of getting married and more and more people prefer to enjoy and look for a better career rather than settling down <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  some others got divorced or go separated ways after 15 years or more of married life which is true : (<br><br>I care for him, as a friend I really care but he's taking things for granted, I guess he misses his father's touch and love, I am sure and that's why now he's been misbehaving to any women out there.<br><br>I am married and I am scared of him but he's my friend too, sometime I feel like it's better not to see him at all, it's better that he's not there at all, it's so stressful when he's around acting weird and act young infront of others especially women, he's so "plastic".<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>

And I'm also trying to avoid his friend who is also just one year married acting weird-busybody and behaving just like him, exactly like him asking me this and that wahhh... in the end my other friend scolded him off "don't ask where we're going, you ask so much!!" why are there some guys, some nosy guys alive in this world???? behaving worst than a lady?? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br></div>
