            <div class='col-md body'>Well I think it really depends on how long you have been normal friends already. She might think that you are just asking her out on a casual outing and does not want to get too excited about it even if she did see you as a potential bf. Because taking time out a busy schedule to meet a guy friend whom she likes but thinks he does not have such feelings for her, it's not rationale. Not when there's loads of things to do.<br><br>On top of that, keeping the friendship is more important. So she may not want to think too much about it. Unless of cos you are clear that it's a date and not a platonic outing.</div>
