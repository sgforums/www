            <div class='col-md body'>I would like to clarify this here. People who are still 'in love' will definitely meet no matter how busy their schedules are. They will just dunk everything just to meet you. The less willing they are to meet you during this phase of relationship, the more careful you should be paying attention to your relationship.<br><br>However, if your relationship have moved on to the commitment period where the initial warm fuzzy feeling is gone, to meet or not to meet is a based on the choices the couple make. For example, if the guy would like to meet the girl and he found out that she is busy, he should have the common sense not to propose meeting her in the first place. So while your relationship have moved onto a different phase, this law does not apply. Applying this law will only cause serious strain on the relationship and you should review on which ground do you stand in the relationship</div>

It wasnt active. Just the usual Hi and Bye. Only after the test then we discovered that we were primary school classmates and it has been more then 10 years since we last met.<br><br>So i went to take her email instead of her number bcos i knew taking a number would definitely feel weird for her(and me). So i added her on msn. Surprisingly she took some time off and log in and approve my friend request and subsequently took her number online despite her busy schedule. It was like a "come online just to add u" kind of thing.<br><br>So i msged her twice today. there was no reply for a straight 8hrs. I know she was busy bcos of her schedule and her CCA training in sch(poly). I wasn't expecting a reply already as i thought this chance got to be a GONER. But just before she slept she replied.<br><br>This is wad she replied: Sorry i was busy the whole day and i didn't have much time to reply. But anyway, goodnight =).<br><br>Is there any meaning here? Do you think i might still have a chance bcos she still did take the time to reply...</div></blockquote>but some pple just dun hav the habit of checking their phone till the very end of the day.<br><br>haha.</div>
