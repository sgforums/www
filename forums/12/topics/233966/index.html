When she's down, spend time with her, when she genuinely needs help, never leave her in the lurch; give proper help. But if you need money to have this gf, a new handphone for this gf, then dump her. I've seen girls who want their bf to have cars... they dumped their bf when a bigger better faster car comes along.<br><br>So what type of gf? Your choice. Men without a gf won't die. Men without a career is merely a uesless person.</div>
