It is slowly built and takes time to develop. How should I put it, my feeling for my ex is like cooking fried rice, fast and furious, but my feeling for my wife is like cooking soup, small fire, takes time to perfect. Till now we are still learning something new from each other.<br><br>For example yesterday I realize she doesnÂ’t really like onions but IÂ’ve been adding onions in my cooking all these years.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br></div>

Of course after all these years we do feel strongly for each other or else we wouldnÂ’t be celebrating our 10th ROM Anniversary this year.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>Hey, why you guys keep talking about me?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>
