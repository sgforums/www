Is he "that worth it"? If he is, he won't be thinking of 2 timing his current gf and you.. That is a very very immature thinking both on his side and your side if you think that he will come back to you when you go back to him..<br><br>Yes, love is always there.. and you love him.. But the point here is that he does not have the heart for you anymore.. Its time that you should face the hard facts in your life and get on with it.. Loving some one does not mean you stick to him even when he is attached.. Its a matter of time you get dumped again. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

He might have told his current GF that his EX (which is you.) , wanna patch up with him. Too many possibility. Why not allow him to be alone for moment before you decide to go back to him. This way is to show that he still have feelings for you and not taking you as "spare tires". Don't be a third party, you won't find happiness. All the best.<br><br>Warmest Regards</div>
