Find another girl to chase if possible (might be hard for you now), but that is the best way to forget your ex.  But only time will make you forget about her.<br><br>I broke up with my ex 2 months already, and now I still think about her sometimes.  The more you love that person, the longer you'll take to forget her.   There's nothing much you can do seriously.<br>But anyway take it easy, positive thinkings from time to time are important.

It can be a 'no point' thing. It can also be a 'cons over pros' situation.

Too busy stuck with work and academic studies lately...<br><br>How can you be sure if he / she is 'the one'? Pardon me if I have this wrong... But in my own opinion... You can't. Love aside. For almost ANYTHING in this world, you can't be TOTALLY CERTAIN. How do you wanna define 'the one'? People DO change from time from time.. Very often he / she could be your 'the one' at this point but not at another... He / she might try to do everything just to PLEASE you... Does that make him / her 'the one'? If he / she does things behind your back but you never get to learn about it... To you, he / she might still be 'the one'. But is he / she?

People do experience pain from time to time, that doesn't mean it's necessarily the end of them. Just like obstacles and hardships you might experience in your everyday life, it's just a matter of whether you choose to stick on to it or to give it up?

No, there isnothing that can be done. What you feel now will consume you, it wil engulf you and make you an evil depressed oddball, as it did to me. Get used to it. Soon after lengthy periods of time, you will then get an aura, which will create aversion in everyone you meet.<br></div>

But worse..hereÂ’s my experience:<br>I am 25 years old..and I got to know my wife (26 years old) when I was 17. She was my 1st gf and whom I gave my heart to. I used to have lots of friends then..but after starting a relationship with her..I realized that I have neglected them and till date, only a few still stood by me. She was the perfect gf..taking care of all my needs and standing by me even in difficult situations. When I was 20, we got married and 1.5 years later, we had our 1st child. She was someone whom I felt I can be with for the rest of my life..<br><br>At age 22, I decided to pursue my Degree in the UK. I brought along my wife and child. It was shocking in a totally different environmentÂ….but wife ensured that I adapt it well. She took total control of the household and kidÂ…went to market daily in the cold weather (esp winter)Â…just to ensure that I can fully concentrate on my studies. She would often stay up late (4am+) to cook supper for me when I was burning my midnight oil. There are millions of things that she had sacrificed for me..but it cant be listed out in words..Maybe I was starting to take it for granted..Whenever IÂ’m stressed, I would lose my temper with herÂ…and even my beloved child...and sometimes said really horrible things which hurt her immensely..But I dare to say that after each time, I would feel a strong sense of guilt and immense pain..my love for her has never wane a single bit all these years..itÂ’s just that I canÂ’t control my temper and couldnÂ’t express myself..and thus leading to her thinking I do not love her. When I graduated, our second child was born last year. However, our quarrels never stopped, and I did not realise that I have neglected my children and Â‘pushedÂ’ a lot of things to her.<br><br>Many factors contributed to our waning marriage life: my temper, her relationship with my parents, financial, her stress of taking care of so many issues and kids etc..I never realized thatÂ…I was the complete beast and idiot..Early last month (Oct), we had the most heated quarrel yetÂ….I thought it was routineÂ…only when one Monday morning..I realized that my wife and kids are gone. I called them countless times..but she did not pickup. It was then I realized that I have lost themÂ….my whole world collapsed.. I went to see her..lost my dignity...crying (like a crybaby) and even knelt in front of her, her family and neighboursÂ…but she just gave me a cold laugh...each day, I waited for her..hours..but when I met her, she just told me to f!@# offÂ….then comes the knock out blowÂ…she told me that she had planned one week in advance on how to leave with the kids without me realizing itÂ…she said she acted normally for the whole week so as not to arouse my suspicionsÂ…each word seems to punch a nail into my bleeding heartÂ…How did she become like this? I asked myselfÂ….then I realized for the last timeÂ…it was ME..who turned her into this..<br><br>These days, I couldnÂ’t concentrate on workÂ…life is like living hell..saw couples with kids..as I longed to hold my beloved kids once more..I would have contemplated suicide if not for the fact that IÂ’m my parentsÂ’ only child..My parents and friend told me to forget her and concentrate on career and maybe will find another oneÂ…but I snapped back and said: She is not my gf! They are my wife and kids!! 8 YEARS!! How can they be substituted!! I tried my very best to concentrate on career and other thingsÂ…but till now, itÂ’s in vain..Life is really meaningless now..<br><br>To All: Please..please cherish all your loved ones while you still can..DonÂ’t engage in self-pity like meÂ….only when u lost them..<br></div>

Actions are more important..however the emotions and memories will just come back..cannot control..<br>Well I guess I will just have to move ahead and seek life day by day, even though how hard it will be. But it is also after this horrible incident, that allows me to see many things that I wasn't able to see before..it really opens up my perspective in life.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
