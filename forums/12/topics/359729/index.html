              Recently i have been feeling really low because of local uni application woes.
              
              I was shortlisted for smu lee kong chian scholarship but during the so called group interview the more vocal gal said i was the weakest and not suitable for smu. Because of that i was eliminated during the first round. I was hit pretty bad by it but i thought no scholarship nvm.. At least give me acct at ntu.
              
              I went for ntu acct interview and i received the rejection letter ytd. Its like wtf. 
              
              This yr i also went for smu acct interview and i was offered a place. But i kinda resent smu cause of e scholarship int. 
              
              I really hope to get into ntu acct. I keep blaming myself for not performing well at the interview. Previous year i was offered ntu biz but i rejected them and accepted nus biz. Am i an idiot?
              
              At the moment i have nus biz and smu acct. But i want ntu acct. What to do?
              
              Feel down and hate myself for the double rejection

              <p>Are u due to enrol this year or there is still a chance for next year?</p>
              <p>If no time liao, between NUS and SMU, i will choose SMU but that depends on whether you are more vocal etc anot cos SMU style of learning is not the lecture tutorial style that NUS/NTU uses even if i know NTU at least is changing the business school's courses to become seminar style instead of tutorial now.</p>
              <p>What pass has passed so don''t think about what you have rejected. Complaining or crying won't change anything so just face the fact that its over and look at your options now.</p>
              <p>Everyone faces rejections in different things throughout their lives, don't let such things affect you so much and learn to climb back up after failures regardless how hard it may be.</p>

              <p>from yr nick, and from yr tone, i can see why the vocal gal say u are the weakest</p>
              <p>it's not enough to have good grades, u must learn to project yr confidence. even if u graduate with ntu 1st class honours it's useless, u will still be 'eaten alive' by yr colleagues next time</p>

              <p>Reminds me of my experience during the smu interview...gosh so many wayang people and a whole lot of dumb questions. One girl especially went on and on. I didn't say anything during the entire process though, being thoroughly disgusted. dont be too disheartened. Confidence is key but abilities matter too. If you got what it takes, you will succeed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>esp in accountancy where skills really matter, not just wayang presentation skills. I personally think ntu acct is the best, and you shld try to appeal. also dont be discouraged - there may be a second wave of acceptance once ppl who were offered ntu acct places reject them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Good luck and don't be so down. The LKC scholarship isn't so exclusive as it makes itself out to be - had a few friends who were just offered the scholarship without interviews.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>u should have told her that u had no idea people would go comment out loud as if they are starring in some american talentime contest where the potential singers would be insulted by interviewer until they cry and go mental .u are there for an academic thing based on merit....!!!how horrid of those people to bully and comment!they dont even own the school they are just working there as monthly paid dummies!!goodnes smu having this kinda management..and they didnt even apologise for their coment.</p>
              <p>i suggest u complain to the rightful department head or admin head in charge!!!make them get hell for their unprofessional comment thats unbecoming for a school.why u want smu??its not really recognised anywhere.can u imagine yerself payin them to bully u in future?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>maybe she wants to imitate a nasty interviewing style like some hot hollywood interviewer in order to keep her job....too much reality tv shows!!!</p>

              Currently i am in the army. This june ord so i will be mauriculating in aug.
              
              I was totally disgusted with the way the interviewers/judges conducted themselves. (they were lkc student scholars). During assessment i saw one of them playing playfish games on facebook. And during presentation she was playing and twilling with her hair.
              
              During scholarship brief the prof mentioned that 75% of all applicants who had all 3 local uni offer chose biz at smu. I dont buy that. 
              
              Really upset and disappointed with smu as a whole. I will bring up the unprofessionalism of the lkc scholars and interview methods to them or to the media if i decided to give up my smu offer.

              Thanks for the replies. For now i need to appeal to ntu. But i guess its hard.
              
              Looks like its either nus biz or smu acct. Which is a better choice?
              
              Is there any other things i can do or should do to try to get into ntu acct?

              <p>Don't blow things too big through the media etc, it would give people a very bad impression of you.</p>
              <p>Whether SMU or NUS, consider what style of learning is better for you. Are you a person who can speak well and outspoken since thats more SMU style while NUS should be the more traditional lect/tut approach.</p>
              <p>It would be hard to get into NTU acct since its 1 of the hardest course to get admission to in NBS. Just try your best.</p>

              <p>be it if they are LKC OR LKY scholars,they have indeed missed out the point of being a learned,wise and educated society.</p>
              <p>from the way u just told me about the way they do things......its no better than people sitting at funan square in the good ole days selling pirated computer games........how they select people is dubious from way u describe their professionalism.</p>
              <p>they could all be big liers by calling themselves scholars too!that indeed would be bad for smu also.they could also be foreigners from way things are in singapore. they dont respect singaporeans too from the way they reacted to you.</p>
              <p>no system would let people be scholars and find thereafter that they dont have a serious attitude to everything by playing games during the interview,insulting you and what next?</p>
              <p>but a complain has to be made preferably after u have secured an admission .</p>

              <p>I think you should write a letter to SMU to let them know of your interview experience (SMU is supposed to be vocal right?). Also, if you don't get the scholarship this year, you can apply again next year, so don't feel so down!  =)</p>
              <p>Btw, I don't think it's necessary to be extremely vocal to go to SMU. I don't talk much in class either (sometimes not at all), but my grades are still pretty ok. I think it's more irritating when people talk for the sake of talking, and some Profs actually penalize you for spewing rubbish.</p>
              <p>In the meantime, if you're very keen on NTU, appeal!</p>

              <p>Currently i am in the army. This june ord so i will be
              mauriculating in aug.</p>
              <p>I was totally disgusted with the way the interviewers/judges
              conducted themselves. (they were lkc student scholars). During
              assessment i saw one of them playing playfish games on facebook.
              And during presentation she was playing and twilling with her
              hair.</p>
              <p>During scholarship brief the prof mentioned that 75% of all
              applicants who had all 3 local uni offer chose biz at smu. I dont
              buy that.</p>
              <p>Really upset and disappointed with smu as a whole. I will bring
              up the unprofessionalism of the lkc scholars and interview methods
              to them or to the media if i decided to give up my smu offer.</p>

              <p>No other institution with the right frame of mind would send a rejection letter with two pages of text. The moment I saw it I straightaway sent it to my double-cut shredder.</p>
              <p>I strongly recommend that you appeal to NTU or choose NUS. You will not want to stick with an insitution for 4 years that has for a start, has given you a poor first impression.</p>

              <p>Hahaha a two page rejection letter? Man. SMU and their ways...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I rmb SMU called me up to demand why I had refused their offer. I was completely taken aback at her tone - "Why did you reject SMU?" "So it is because of  _____ that's why you reject right, not because of SMU itself right?"</p>
              <p>I was like, ok relax darling.</p>
              <p>Ok in all honestly, I think SMU have branded themselves well...and definitely trains you to be more vocal. But there again, vocal isn't everything.</p>
