            <div class='col-md body'>My girlfriend's ex-teacher (a Maths teacher from <strong>Bedok South Secondary</strong>  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> ) has been harrassing her for quite some time - a few months perhaps. He confessed her feelings for her, but she rejected him outright. On and off he has tried to win her heart. He continues to SMS her even after me and her went steady, and she made clear that she was attacted.<br><br>Still, his advances did not relent.<br><br>He even had the cheek to tell her that he did not mind being a third party in our relationship.<br><br>Again, my girl had to ward off his advances.<br><br>I have asked my girl for his number but she refuses as she fears that in my anger I might threaten him bodily and hence get into trouble (later kena police report knn!).<br><br>Yesterday as we were out together on Valentine's Day he dared to message her.<br><br>Today was the last straw. He msged her telling how he will give her allowance money so long as she spent time with him physically (by that I suppose he wants her to sleep with him) and that she need not inform me of what's going on. My girlfriend was horrified and threatened to report him to the papers, to MOE etc etc<br><br>My gf has promised me that she will allow me to confront her should he contact her one more time.<br><br>Should I ready the parang?<br><br>I have kept this matter quiet for far too long.<br><br>He has shown my girlfriend no respect, nor has he shown respect for himself and his profession. He started "jio-ing" her while she was retaking her O Level's as a private candidate - he was her night class teacher. As an educator, his conduct is very unbecoming.<br><br>I can easily report the matter to MOE, just as easily I can wait outside the gates of his school with a parang slung behind my back.<br><br>Which course of action should I take? This has been a very embarrassing ordeal for my sweetheart.</div>
