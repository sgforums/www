People disapprove due to superstitions and upbringing and sometimes just pure stupidity. Many people like that. So it is up to you whether you are strong and am able to ignore them or you will feel down everytime they make nasty comments. Your girl also, can she take it?<br><br>2. Genetics. Like I said, if somebody mention that you can say no problem, we will go for genetic counselling everytime she is pregnant. Then nobody can hit you on that score.<br><br>actually that is all... I can't think of another oh wait...<br><br>3. If the 2 of you break up then it might affect your extended family... your parents become in laws as well as brother and sister... even if you divorce, the relationships does not stop like when other people divorce.<br><br>4. You might make your relatives womit if they see the 2 of you intimate unlike when they see you intimate with a stranger (non relative.) That will not make them womit. It is like you see a brother and sister kissing passionately it makes you want to womit but if they were kissing other people, you won't.<br><br></div>
