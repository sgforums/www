I understand your heartbreak and how awful it is to experience a break-up. As you mentioned that your break-up was recent, I suggest giving yourself more time to recover from this hurt. Don't fall into a relationship again too soon as your heart right now may not be stable enough due to the break-up. Try spending more time on yourself instead. Once you get over the hurt (I mean REALLY get over it), then you may start to allow yourself to have some chance.<br><br>However, about the woman you've mentioned, she's much too old for you. Okay, these days many would say that age doesn't matter. But think about this, when you marry her, she'll have difficulty bearing you a child as her age is the limit. There would be a danger in doing so, biogically. Okay, assuming that to you no children is alright, but then when she turns 60, how old are you only? 40 plus? Hey 40 plus is quite young compared to 60 odds. Are you going to waste your youth just like this? There're many things you can do.<br><br>In conclusion, this is just an infatuation. I suggest go give yourself some time to settle your emotions and stuff, then think about relationship. It <strong>is</strong> however, a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">serious</span> matter. You may choose to continue to be friends with your female colleague and know where to draw the line.<br><br>Once again, a suggestive advice: Go get a girl younger than you and then live happily ever after. Rather than having to suffer your remaining years of old age as a widower. Guess you won't want that right?</div>

Do you think you can give her what she needs? You have your career... you still can enjoy life and have fun..<br><br>Not saying that you cannot have older woman to be your gf.. you can if you can counter and bear all consequences behind.. Noone can stop you from doing it.. If you really think you can give her happiness.. and not to let her suffer another broken r/s like her previous.. then do what you think is right.. But if you can't.. then back off.. remain as good friends.. and colleague too..<br><br>Cheers  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

One or two years ain't that bad, three years.. is a little bit too old. Four years... I would say try not to (in my opinion).<br><br>As the topic here goes... 20 years!!!

You are NOT whole, you are NOT complete, you need to get yourself fixed first, so that the other party won't share your loneliness, your troubled emotions, and your baggages. I guess what most of us want is to share happiness, joy, and love. And if anyone here thinks that by marrying someone will solve a problem, neh...... think again.</div>

Now she avoids me by taking a different route to work. When I tokked to her at our workplace, she'd find some excuse to brush me off. This afternoon, she was so unfriendly tt we almost got into an argument &amp; I had to apologize even when it's not my fault. I really don't want to lose her as a friend &amp; colleague. Pls tell me how I can redeem our friendship...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Erm, having lunch/dinner with your colleagues is quite common.<br>Unless you made it seem like a date or said something to that effect which may have shocked her because she might not have expected it.  If she is uncomfortable with it, then you should just explain to her that it's just dinner, nothing more nothing less.  People need to eat right ???</div>
