The latter category includes certain plants, meat, meat products and products of animal origin e.g. hides, skin, poultry, eggs, milk and dairy products (however, 1kg per person of fully cooked meat/meat products, in cans or hermetically sealed containers, is allowed).<br><br>From countries outside the European Union you may bring in a maximum of 2kg of fruit and vegetables (other than potatoes), a single bouquet of cut flowers and a maximum of five retail packets of seeds.
