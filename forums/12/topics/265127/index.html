            <div class='col-md body'>AA Guideline.<br><br>I) Whenever possible, try not to post people's problem. If possible, introduce them to SGF AA and get them to post instead. Firstly, it's not very nice to post people's problems in a public forum like this? And even if they allow it, I believe that they are still the best person to relate their agony?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>TS, u said it in 1 of your paragraph that the guy is a divorcee? Could be the reason why he is so apprehensive about this new relationship this time round. 1.5 years, while not short, is not long either. Seeing the guy's parents means a committment. The guy probably needs to know the girl just a while longer before deciding if she's the one for him. If she feels that he is hiding something from her, or cheating on her, then maybe the girl and the guy should have a heart to heart talk.</div>
