I kept feeling sad about everything happening at work etc.  </div></blockquote>I see how it's affecting you quite badly....<br><br>Going for performance, movies etc. like this probably won't work much of a miracle for you at this point..<br><br>I believe this isn't the 1st time that you've faced such problems and sh|t at work... Though I won't know exactly how bad is this one compared to the previous ones... 1st thing you've got to let yourself know and understand is that... This is not the 1st time. Things had happened before. Been through and been over with... Very likely to be the same for this one too... Just requires that factor time and ease of mind...<br><br>You need to attend to your mind and heart 1st. My guess would be more of your heart 1st... Knowing that no matter what had happened... You're no longer in your job and no longer in that situation. Your physical presence has already give you the 'break', just that your mind isn't all that ready to let go... Perhaps you've been spending much time thinking through what had happened but still couldn't quite understand or accept the way things had happened or how people had reacted throughout... Perhaps it's just not the time yet...?<br><br>Sometimes we force things too hard on ourselves because we've always been so 'efficient'. Expecting ourselves to know what is going on or quickly get things over with... But in actual fact, alot of the time... Many 'crisis' in life just isn't all that easy to get over with too soon... Sometimes you just need to rest your midn 1st... Allow yourself the 'break' you deserves after you're 'away' from things... Only after that would your mind be in proper working order again... And most likely only then... Would 'light' come to you....<br><br>Relax... No point stressing yourself too much even up to this point yeah..? I think you've gotten enough of that already...? Why not just leave the 'worries' behind to them...? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sit down.. get a couple pot budies, smoke some marijuana. Let things slow down a bit. in the fast n hectic lives of ur everyday life and environment , u need to slow down a bit to be aware. More sensitive about ur environment and about urself. Free your mind. Notice i am not telling u to Ice , Amphetamine , E, Lsd, Mushies and all that other chemically modified substances because they cant make u slow down n definately cant think straight.<br><br>Puff puff pass. Go slow , take it easy , relax and go out watch the stars after your session.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Since you can't relax, you might as well sort out yourself first. Get your mind (thoughts) in order first before embarking on the next phase of making plans for the short term, middium term and long term. Then make action plans to ensure you can be okay for the present.<br><br>Once you know that you have at least secured yourself for the immediate present, mebbe you can feel more comfortable to relax a bit. Working out in the gym or otherwise should be made part of your plans for now..... You may want to try practising meditation too..... Good luck!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>
