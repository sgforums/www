            <div class='col-md body'>I had my eyes set for her since we were Secondary 1. I joined the CCA dance even though I knew nothing and never liked dancing just to get the chance to see her more. However, I never dared approach her to chat or express my feelings. Our relationship is just like I looked at her, she looked at me and we both looked away. I waited for her to go home everyday and quietly tailed her to the busstoop everyday... Even if we do talk, it always her thaat started the ball rolling...<br><br>Years passed and we graduated, she went to a JC and I went to a Polytechnic. I wanted to start afresh, 4get about her, enjoy my new life, study hard... But jut when I wanted to do that, my friend SMS me. There was tis celebration for dance Teacher's Day. I went back...half hoping to see her and half hoping not to see her... I told myself, if I saw her, I would ask 4 her number,it maybe my last chance.<br><br>I went back, as expected she was there. And as usual, I was sitting alone cos I am an introvert didn't like to talk. Then the teacher asked us for our HP number, we passed a list around to write... she was the last one to wrote on the list b4 me... but she didn't passed the paper to me herself, she passed it to another friend instead, a friend that already wrritten his down... After tat, she came and sat beside me... She asked my about my current life...and stuff... she was holding her HP in her hands, just like I was... I thought she was going to asked me for my number or something... I wanted to asked 4 hers...but my friend that knows I like her was sittting beside her... sighz...instead she asked me...the model of my phone...<br><br>Then after the celebration, we hanged around with a bunch of friends to catch up... she would usually go home straight as always but this time she hanged around a little longer... talking to us... then when we finally depart for home... she took a different route home... she usually went to the busstop I always walked pass while going home bit this time she took already busstop... That night she logged in to her friendster first time in 2 - 3 months<br><br>I went home, realised I couldn't 4get her...couldn't sleep.... Then the following tuesday was teacher's day... I went back, took a bet she mmight come..she did for a short while then she went home..as usual, a bunch of friends was surrounding her..I didn't have the chance to get her number... I was walking all alone behind..then she turned back to glance at me...<br><br>I went back to school, told myself, I have to get Top 5% no matter how hard, so I can meet her at Univeersity again...<br><br>Then Christmas was coming... I send her message on friendster asking her wat she would like...bad move I know... she didn't reply... I got her number from my friend... Then I SMS her Merry Christmas on Christmas.... she replied u r? I told her who I was, then she replied merry christmas...<br><br>Then the following night, I send her an SMS, Good Night. She reply something, something I failed to intepret earlier... She sent back...something like life is like a road, t an intersection, I met a nice guy like u.... take care.... I SMS her the night after her too Good Night, there was no reply... I was scare she might be angry.... The next day at school, I asked my friend to intepret the message she send me.... they told me she wanted to move on, thus the intersection part of the message and told me it was hopless... I SMS her tat night, Good Night I wun bother u again see u soon.... she replied... huh? Are u XXX from XXX?... It felt weird...it was so obvious she was acting blur... So I SMS her back Ya, may I have ur number? I dun feel right taking it from another friend... she never replied....<br><br>I told myself, it was hopeless...forget her...Yep, and I went to school happily that day... then went shopping...and I had to see her there...wat a coincident.. I couldn't approach her, she was with her faather... we were on the escalator, she was infont, I was behind... I didn't realised it till we reached the top when I turned my head... there she was looking back to...<br><br>I dunno why, everytime I wanna 4get her, she would appear b4 me... I dunwan to wait anymore nor give up...cos I realised finally it will be a never ending cycle... meet aa girl, wait for her, give up...<br><br>Wat should I do next?  I know I think too much....</div>
