            <div class='col-md body'>seems like these things always happen... thats why i find it hard to believe in the existence of true platonic relationships between opp sexes... at one point or the other, there will definately be attraction, whether mutal or not. things will never be the same again until you have reached a closure on this issue.(ie. u two decided if u wanna give this relationship a try, or both decide that there is no way that will work)</div>
