She hopes we can still go together. She thinks that cooking extra food while preparing meals for herself is hardly a trouble, but she's cool about not making my share. She tells me it's a nice dream to go do PhD together after we graduate, and ask me not to give up on it. She will not give up on doing PhD. Then she tells me she's so angry with me for over-reacting and don't want to talk to me.  The next morning, she fainted, and I brought her to the hospital. I was so worried that I stayed by her side. Somehow, after that, we stopped arguing and we are back on talking terms. She even sms me that she will be so guilty if I caught the bad flu bug from her.</div>

Both of them are strangers in a strange land, having found friendship and love in each other, yet both are constantly running away from each other, struggling to not fall in love.<br><br>To geodome, I suggest you watch this movie <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>And there is no use trying to deny your own feelings and lie to your ownself... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Edited: Actually, I find this situation quite interesting, so I went to re-read previous replies. So I guess you are only afraid to pursue this possibility with her because you are afraid that history might repeat itself? Please don't let the past haunt your present...what happened last time might not necessarily happen again! She might be the one for you, and I think from what she has done for you, both of you do stand a good chance to be together. You might be afraid to hurt the friendship, but for the sake of happiness, why not give it a try?
