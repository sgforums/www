            <div class='col-md body'>This post reminds me of the wierd situation I am in now though. She has been "extra nice" to me since I agreed to tour China with her. She has been making meals for me. We were making plans to watch a musical together, but scrapped the idea because the tickets cost 50pounds each. However, she is in favour of having lunch together on a river cruise along river thames. I didn't object to the proposal because it is 40% cheaper. I like the attention and the fact we can share our thoughts so easily and like to spend alot of time together. It seems she fancies me, but there are 3 things that stop my thoughts from progressing into that area.<br><br>Firstly, I am once bitten, twice shy. I don't want history to repeat itself. I lost my ex-girlfriend and my best friend (female buddy) when she and I split apart. My ex-girlfriend was my best friend before we got together. We had been best mates for over 1yr before we got together. It was devastating enough to loose my girlfriend. It was more devastating to not have the listening ear a best friend can offer! I had nobody very close to share my emotional pains then.<br><br>Secondly, past experiences tells me when I fancy a girl, I usually have this urge to chase them. I have this loud voice inside my head that tells me I want the girl. I don't have this urge towards my best friend. However, there are times whereby I miss her badly despite the fact I haven't been talking to her for about 3days. It is things like that that make me wonder if I actually fancy her, and dragg's quote regarding the confusion between loneliness and love pretty much resolve this situation.<br><br>Thirdly, she has always been nice to me since I knew her. When I first knew her, she used to make me tea eggs. I also know the extent she is willing to go, for the sake of her friends. I have been there for her - when she cries over the emotional insecurity regarding her ex-boyfriend's "affairs" (when she was dating him), when they finally broke up, and when she had family problems. I have been taking care of her. Why shouldn't she be nice to me? I must admit that her ex-boyfriend used to complain he can't see why she cooks for me, but not for him. However, that is because he has been sleeping around - she doesn't feel safe and secure with him, but she still liked him anyway. Fortunate bas-tard!</div>

It is always great to find someone you can share everything with, and sooner or later, one or both of them will develop some sort of attraction.<br><br>But I guess, once the confession is out, it is really hard to become friends again...I tried it before and thought it would work, but then there is always the realization on the other party's part that you like him/her, so when loneliness becomes overwhelming, both might succumb to desire.<br><br>Which is something I regret right now, cos after that stage of desire, nothing can go back to the way it was le.

It isn't hard to make my day.<br><br>Elektra, you like your male buddy, and thus you are looking for signs to indicate mutual attraction. We all become like that when we like someone.<br><br>Imagine yourself in my senario. I broke up with my ex-girlfriend not long after I arrived in England. Being alone in a foreign country, I had nobody to turn to in England. Then, a perfect stranger crashed into my life, nursed my broken heart, helped me pick up the pieces of my life, and became my best friend. Why would I not want to take care of her?<br><br>She makes food for me. I do like the "gourmet" attention alot.  She knows it too. The only thing that I find wierd nowadays is the increase in frequency. I am sick of hearing my friends describing her as my "wife" because they all regard girls do not prepare food for guys unless the girl is interested in the guy. <strong>It is a stereotype!</strong><br><br>The current state of affairs between she and I is nice. She makes me food, make packet lunches for me. When she needs my company, I will just be there. When i need her company, she will just smile and seats beside me. We study together. We take care of each other. The arrangement is nice. Each of us is free to date anyone else, yet still assured of each other's company at times of need. She's a bonus in my life now - the best gem even money can't buy. <strong>Who in the right mind would want to disrupt this arrangement?</strong><br><br>Moreover, we made it clear  to each other a year ago that we will not date, ever. I told her that I look out for her well-being out of grattitude. She told me preparing food for me is not a hint that she fancies me. That's how things will always stay between us. I can't see any mutual attraction.</div>

It saves me from awkward situation. Come to think of it, she asked me to tour spain with her last december. I turned her down because I thought it was awkward/strange that a girl and a guy who are not attached to each other should tour together. I ended up touring Spain during her proposed period with a very close male friend. I only told her about my Spain trip 3days before the trip.
