              <p>The only way to forget him is not to think about him and channel that energy into something more useful and meaningful. A dating expert once said it's good to invest 20% of your time in meet new people and widening your social circle thus creating a social life. Meeting new people does not necessarily mean finding another potential dates. Meeting new people simply means get to know people with common interest, ideology and create a social circle.</p>

              <p>Where's your reply? Tsk.</p>
              <p>@Sandy You should just keep to your previous thread.</p>
              <p>You're checking up on him because you're feeling upset that your relationship had turned out badly, and you want to know whether the breakup has affected him as much as it affected you. I can give you the answer: No. If you're hoping that he's just hiding his feelings, I can tell you the same answer: No.</p>
              <p>One will value a relationship not by how much he/she receives, but how much he/she gives. This is why the breakup has such a strong impact on you, but so little on him. All I can tell you is, move on. It may take a long time for the wound to heal, but if you continue looking up on him, you're just rubbing salt into your own wound.</p>

              <p>Aiya, sista, maybe she miss the sex lah, he might be good in bed you know. We gals are more prone to weakness in relationship, we are also more sensitive to the reaction and the reasoning, many do not understand a guy mind as good as you and me lah. From their crook look, you know what they are thinking liao, cannot miss one. But unfortunately, many gals like TS are lamb mei mei waiting to be slaughter, and some even do not mind to get slaughtered, they enjoyed it, so what can I say, quite a disgrace to our womenfolk indeed.</p>

              I can subtly relate to how you are presently.
              
              I was engulfed in the same situation with my previous girlfriend. It seemed like my world ended. I just couldn't believe how worthless and insignificant I was to her after all that giving. The months following the break-up is going to be tough to accept and adapt to. I used to be like you, stalking her Facebook and pine for her at every chance I have.
              
              After a few months of thinking and reflecting, you'll come to realise that he's the one who lost out. You did all you could to keep the relationship going when he couldn't care less. Rejoice over the fact that he'll never have you do that for him again and that you've fortunately, left the guy you were not meant to be with in the very first place. Talk to your friends if you got to let it out, or, just cry alone somewhere quiet. 
              
              Go out, make more friends. Buy yourself new clothes, treat yourself to good food. Dote on yourself in every possible way. Go taste, experience and enjoy how much more there is to life than Him. Whilst doing all these, you'll soon realise that there's so many better guys than Him.
              
              Time heals all wounds. You'll soon find yourself a much stronger person. Embrace that, and go on searching for your Mr Right, :).
              
              Jia you!

              angel, I don't disadvantage myself by having sex with a guy an

              than having sex b4 marriage.I think many parents would agree with

              Everyone thinks and acts differently. When we are forced to let go when we really don't want to, we tend to look back and wish for things to be the way it was. No worries though, we all get over it someday, somehow, ;).

              <p>Hi Sandy! You need to ask yourself is he the kind of man who will</p>
              <p>1) Bring out the best in you</p>
              <p>2) Someone whom you can call your best friend, best confidante, best play-mate .</p>
              <p>Do you think life will be better if you are back with him?</p>
              <p>With a boh-chap attitude like his,  do you think girls will really be with him for long?</p>
              <p>I believe what you need is a revamp of your current lifestyle.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1) Avoid stalking him. You need to heal your own hurts .Why add salt to your wounds by seeing his FB.He's not even worth a glance.</p>
              <p>2) Discard/put away anything that reminds you of him.All emails/old smses ..have to be deleted.</p>
              <p>3) Upgrade yourself  to boost up your own confidence. Your youth is your strength. Enhance your hairstyle..whatever..explore make-ups etc.Refresh yourself with a new look. Tell yourself you are going to have a new better life - in 2012.</p>
              <p>4) Involve in activities with your friends and keep yourself really busy .Time will heal.There are so many worthy single guys out there looking for serious love.</p>
              <p>5) You can call  1800-2214444 if you need someone to talk to privately , unburden your heart (24/7 counseling line).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Lastly, if you are feeling down at times, please remember that it is because you are at the adjustment stages. Give yourself time to adjust to life without him. One day you will look back and tell yourself ' I wish I had broken up with him much much earlier!".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Wish you well here. :)</p>
