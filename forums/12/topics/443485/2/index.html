              <p>Whilst
               browsing HubPages, I've seen a lot of hubs detailing ways to get your 
              ex back, ways to make him love you again, how to use voodoo to force 
              someone into loving you for eternity, etc. But ironically, not too many 
              words about the opposite advice.<br><br>Sometimes, it's <em>not</em> a 
              good idea to get your ex back. When you love someone, this is a hard 
              decision to come to. Some find it impossible and go back to the same 
              person over and over again. But I'm here to tell you this isn't always 
              the best decision for you. Whether you're waiting for the one you lost 
              to change (ahem, see below for that one) or you just can't stay away, <strong>here are the top 5 reasons why you should NOT get back with your ex</strong>.</p>
              <p><br><br>1) <strong>It didn't work out in the first place for a reason. </strong><br>Think
               about why you broke up. Think about all the problems you had with your 
              ex. Did his inability to keep a job drive you crazy? Was it her 
              incessant flirting with other guys, despite her love for you, that made 
              you end it? Or maybe you just fought constantly over everything from 
              dinner plans to whether or not Pluto is a planet. <br><br>When you're 
              considering rekindling that flame with your ex lover, think about what 
              set you over the edge. What made your relationship unfixable. Is that 
              something you really want to go back to? Time makes us forget all the 
              bad and only remember the good--but you did break up with your ex for a 
              reason. Consider those reasons before crawling back.</p>

              <p>2) <strong>Living in the past prevents you from moving on.</strong><br>You
               may find yourself wanting your ex back because you're currently in a 
              rut. You think back to the good times and wish they were still 
              happening--you remember moonlit dinners, trips to the Cape, and now 
              you're only making dessert for one instead of two (and it's much less 
              gluttonous to eat chocolate cake with others). We all get stuck in the 
              past every now and then, and while a little nostalgia can keep us going 
              in the really bad times, thinking about what happened long ago is no 
              good reason to get your ex back. <br><br>Moving on is often the best 
              medicine after a break up. Dwelling on what's already happened will 
              never move you forward in life--imagine if we as humans were never able 
              to learn from our mistakes. We'd be doomed to make the same stupid 
              mistake for the rest of our lives. If we decided to pick a spouse who 
              didn't appreciate us, we'd be constantly picking that same type of 
              person forever. Doesn't that just suck? Use your ability to learn from 
              your mistakes to make your next relationship better and healthier than 
              your last, instead of repeating your last mistake.</p>

              <p>3) <strong>Sure some couples get back together and make it work, but how many examples are there?</strong><br>You've
               seen it happen before. Your friend or cousin or best friend's 
              bridesmaid's sister had a horrid break up, then she realized later that 
              her ex was truly the one for her. And they got married in a huge 
              ceremony and lived happily ever after. Good for them. But one example is
               not the norm--that's a huuuuge misnomer. And further, do you even know 
              the details of why the example couple broke up in the first place? Maybe
               it was something silly. Or maybe they're just the exception.<br><br>Much
               more often, two people get back together and realize all those problems
               they had before haven't changed. He still doesn't respect her, and she 
              still refuses to pay for anything. Those issues that caused your break 
              up haven't changed. Nothing has changed. Getting back together usually 
              only causes a rehash of why you broke up in the first place. Which then,
               leads to another break up.<br></p>

              <div id="txtd_3745576" class="txtd">
              <p>4) <strong>People don't change.</strong><br>I know this is a controversial topic,
              but I'm willing to put it out there. PEOPLE DON'T CHANGE. Sure, maybe
              your ex would be on her best behavior for a few weeks if you got back
              together; but deep down to the core, she's still that same woman who
              you couldn't make it work with. I promise you, the chances of your ex
              changing this time around are next to nil. Now, yes people have the
              capabilities to change--it's not an absolute. People can change their
              clothes, their hairstyle, even aspects of their personality. But change
              has to come from inside yourself (and even if you want to change, it is
              DARN hard). <br><br>Your ex will not change for you. Her personality,
              her bad habits, the way she truly is when nobody's watching, 99.9876%
              of the time those are traits people won't change. You are much better
              off finding a partner who you don't want to change. A good relationship
              starts when you accept the other person for who they are, when all the
              walls are down, when you've seen them at their best and worst, and you
              love them just the way they are.</p>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p>5) <strong>Don't settle for somebody who couldn't keep you around in the first place. </strong><br>Even
               if your ex was the one who initiated the break up and left you 
              heartbroken, this main idea still applies. Either way, one of you wanted
               to break up and the other went along with it. There was something in 
              your relationship that made it not work for one of you, so being with 
              your ex wasn't exactly an ideal situation. So why should you settle for 
              such a situation?<br><br>The bottom line is that there was a break up. 
              Break up means something was wrong beyond the little annoyances. And all
               of this says that you can find someone better for you. Someone who 
              won't want to break up with you, or who you won't want to break up with.
               Never settle or deny yourself future happiness. Even if you can't see 
              it now, you will find someone else. You can find someone who treats you 
              better than your ex did. <em>But in order for that to happen, you have to move on and not get back together with your ex.</em></p>

              <p>In my oriental conservative culture, a gal can never initiate the first, it will only lower our gal pride and status. Let the guy do the first initiation no matter how much you admired him.</p>
              <p>Not only it save our gal's pride and status, at the end of the day, if parting take place, at least we can ask the guy to go and suck his own toes.</p>
