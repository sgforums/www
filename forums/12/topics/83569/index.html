In other words, there could be other ways of showing or not showing things.. Hence, depending on the girl's mentality... She might wanna show it in different way... Or simply bored of routine... It doesn't necessarily signal a RED LIGHT to the relationship... May not even be on a HIGH PROBABLITY...<br><br>Sometimes to think in such negativity is even much more harmful to the relationship...
