            <div class='col-md body'>Well, if you go to JC, you will be hallowed as "One of Us"-smartie pants by most Singaporeans. Ergo you will be able to feel a notch higher than most people here at least, what, being top God knows how many % and all that rubbish. Furthermore, they say JC is the quickest route to university, which is the route to money earning ability... yes... the important bit of paper called the DEGREE.<br><br>If you go to Poly, you will be less respected by people in general, except your friends and peers ofcourse. But I am not like that, its just something I've noticed in general with people. JC people stick to themselves likewise for Poly people.<br><br>Plus I recall when I flunked my prelims and my other friends did better in sec 4... they got into JCs and I got into a pre U... they all shunned me suddenly because I was not of their league. But when O levels Cambridge papers were out, i was a 10  (perhaps some relative of mine was a marker) and they we over 18, then they started hanging out with me in the end.<br><br>Know what you want. I would suggest University. I doubt you could start a business because that requires capital and expertise.</div>
