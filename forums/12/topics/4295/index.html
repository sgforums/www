I agree that if u love someone, u will want that someone to b happy and not to possess him/her.  Aaron, although u can say all this, can u really do it if u r in such a situation, not easy, rite?  I had experienced thinking of a particular girl for so long that I can't eat nor sleep, but she got a bf, what can I do?  I one who dun like competition, since she had a bf, I will give up loh.  This kind of "wishing her happy" feeling is really miserable, anyone here understands my pain...<br><br>------------------<br>Hope to b your frd forever, Mike signing off</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>there is no such thing as true love<br>there is love..but no true love<br><br>men are fickle, not becos we wan to be .. but bcos things are forever changing, circumstances, feelings, moods and so our preferences may change over time.  It just a matter of how u deal with these changes, do u make compromises, make the best of what u have .. or do u bail out?<br><br>so what is true love then????  its too abstract for we all have our own reasons and justifications why we fall in and out of love<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well i think there's no such thing as TRUE love. in terms of relationships anyway.<br><br>love can be in many forms, towards many other people.<br><br>but specifically, in a relationship, i would know if i love the person or not if<br>&lt;Eg 1&gt;<br>he's picking his nose and i dont feel grossed out but still dont mind kissing such a fella<br>&lt;Eg 2&gt;<br>he's getting flabbier and not as fit as b4, plus takes u for granted sometimes instead of showering u with love and gifts and flowers when he was courting you. but u still want to be with him.<br><br>well basically i would know i love a person when inspite of all his mistakes and grossness and whatever shortcomings, i'm able to look past that and love the person.<br><br>but of course, u gotta make sure the person loves u back or else its not worth it !!<br><br>just my $0.02 worth.</div>
