            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Malcolm,<br><br>Actually, there was a period when I was actually "anti-men" <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  I was so scared of being hurt again, etc etc etc.<br><br>However, as time passed, I realised I shouldn't give the people who hurt me the gratification that they'd scarred me forever, &amp; I was forever moping over them.  That's when I decided that I'd do BETTER than them <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>If I'm a woman, &amp; I can do it, then you, as a guy, can.  You're only 2 years younger (if your birth year is 79), so don't give the excuse as too young, I did it when I was 23 or younger <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>FeowFeow<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by mal_colm1979:</div><div class="quote_body">Hi Feow<br><br>Thanks for the console.... Sigh.... Apparently its a case of "kuah puah" liao... The desire to go into love has simply diminished... I think even if I meet Miss Right along the way, I will be very afraid to give "LOVE" once again..<br><br>Dare not take the gamble anymore..</div></blockquote></div>
