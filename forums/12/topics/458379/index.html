              I got this from another website after reading it in yahoo singapore and reposted it within this sg forum. In fact there is another blog website "You don't have to agree" that is also currently talking about this. Thought it would be good to share it here too since it is about Singapore. Take a look at it.

              Letter to Singapore
              
              by Zing
              
              Dear Singapore,
              
              Iâ€™m sorry, but Iâ€™m leaving you. Iâ€™ve fallen in love with somewhere else, and you wouldnâ€™t like her. But London is the place for me. Iâ€™ve fallen for her dingy, narrow streets. The 24-hour bagels on Brick Lane; the club kids in neon and glitter falling out of Boombox at 3 in the morning; the bands with their urgent, clashing guitars, cigarettes and floppy hair. Iâ€™ve fallen for boys who play in bands with a copy of The Female Eunuch in their bedrooms; Iâ€™ve fallen for girls who write poetry and play guitar in Leicester Square pubs. Iâ€™ve fallen for the Chinese boy I saw at Kings Cross holding hands with his boyfriend, while his mother smiled and hailed a taxi for them all. Iâ€™ve fallen in love with the Irish. Iâ€™ve fallen in love with the Welsh. Theyâ€™re all here, Singapore, in tiny corners, in crammed spaces, in underground dancehalls and abandoned warehouses. 
              
              We had a good run, but I was never really comfortable with you. You were always liberal when it suited you, small-minded when it didnâ€™t. You used to say, â€œCareful you donâ€™t be so open-minded, otherwise your brains fall outâ€�. But maybe some fresh air would be good for your head. You were always scared of my clothes, the way I spoke, what I wanted to do. â€œSo smart, is it?â€� you used to say. â€œHave some common sense. Later in life, what matters is money. Sad but true. You have to think ahead.â€�
              
              Iâ€™m 20 years old and I donâ€™t want to be jaded, but youâ€™re already feeding me defeatism and banality as a lifestyle choice. I want to be more than an office drone. I want to be more than my salary. You need to dream big to be big, Singapore. I looked into your dreams one night and they were full of dollar signs. They were full of people getting by on their Mercedes, their two maids, their country club membership. Getting by and not living. Getting but not achieving. Buying and selling but not giving. I d reamed we went to a Club Med on holiday, and I told the receptionist, â€œYou live in a beautiful country,â€� and she replied, â€œYou donâ€™t live here.â€� That night, I said, â€œI wish weâ€™d gone somewhere else.â€� You said, â€œLike where? All the places you want to go are dirty, no air-con.â€�
              
              Iâ€™m in love, of course I take a romantic view of London. But Iâ€™ve seen the dark alleys; Iâ€™ve seen the feral children with their knives and guns; Iâ€™ve been mugged and it wasnâ€™t fun. I almost had to get stitches. I met a drag queen at A&amp;E whoâ€™d been gaybashed on night bus number 54. We looked at each other in recognition, and she smiled grimly and said, â€œHoney, Iâ€™ve always wanted a nose job on the NHS.â€� 
              
              In London, I can be a saint or a sinner. I can be City boy, goth girl, punk kid; I can be in with the media, in with the cool kids, I can drop rhymes in East End ghettos and I can drop cash in Mahiki on cocktails. I can be posh, p oor, upmarket, downmarket, chav, toff, hippie, indie. I can be gay or straight, man or woman. I can make myself up, make myself down. And London will still embrace me, and I will always find somewhere that will take me in, and raise no eyebrows should I wear hoop skirts and pierce my lip and call myself Bettie Page. 
              
              Iâ€™m not sure you could ever do that, Singapore. You say you celebrate diversity, but really you only grudgingly tolerate it. You know what always pissed me off? When you would shrug your shoulders and say, â€œWhat to do? Itâ€™s like that, what. Iâ€™ll never change.â€� I would try and try to change your mind, but you would just shrug. That same reply. Then, accusingly, you would say that you were an Asian and you were conservative, and I was trying to make you something you werenâ€™t. Then, defiantly: â€œIf people donâ€™t like it, not my problem!â€� 
              
              But Iâ€™m not trying to make you something youâ€™re not, Iâ€™m really not. Iâ€™m just trying to make you see that youâ€™re more than dollar signs. Youâ€™re more than people just scraping by, dreaming of money and five-star hotels. Youâ€™re a hell of a lot more than just a good air-conditioning system. Youâ€™re everybody, not just the dream citizen; youâ€™re the Malay kids skipping school, hanging out at Peninsula Plaza in black jeans and trucker caps. Youâ€™re the unemployed kopitiam uncle with his songbirds. Youâ€™re the schoolgirl holding hands with her classmate, hoping the teacher doesnâ€™t see. Youâ€™re every one of them, but for some reason you just wonâ€™t acknowledge this. You like to hold on to this idea of you being this clean, perfectly efficiently city, when really itâ€™s the dirt that makes you who you are.
              
              And at this point in my life, I donâ€™t want to deal with this amount of self-loathing and deception. I donâ€™t want to deal with somebody who sees their history as something to be packaged and sold to tourists, who sees every citizen as an economic unit to be moved around on a chess board. We are the only resource? Who said people can be resources? What are we, oil? Trees? 
              
              (Plus, I donâ€™t want to be with somebody who says â€œwell, you just donâ€™t understand â€“ this is for our SURVIVALâ€� should anybody dare to disagree. Youâ€™re more than surviving. Youâ€™ve done well. But now you need to stop holding your breath, stop acting like everything can be taken away from you in an instant. This kind of warlike paranoia isnâ€™t doing you favours. You could be so great if you just relaxed and let go, just a little.)
              
              I want truth, beautyâ€¦ you know the rest. Iâ€™m twenty and the worldâ€™s an open book to me, but youâ€¦ Iâ€™m afraid that maybe, just maybe, youâ€™re a closed case. 
              
              I love you, but I canâ€™t do this anymore.

                      The question is not him, it is more on the young people of

                      Singapore with ancestor dated to 1940s will become extinct, and to
                      find one, will be very rare, as rare as the 2 pandas</p>

              Well, he has his reasons for leaving Singapore and time has changed. Younger Singaporeans are more westernise nowadays and they probably think the west way of life is more liberal and there are more opportunities there. However, if he did leave only recently is a bad time to do it looking at the economic crisis in U.K or Europe now.

              Well Jacky, not only the new generation of Singaporeans the young ones are leaving Singapore....those who are born in the 50s and 60s already left too like myself, my eldest brother, my second eldest sister and my third eldest sister. We are too tired and too worried about what Singapore has install for us in the future when we are really old and not worthy in the workforce anymore. When I see old people on the streets or at the hawker centres to make their daily living just to survive really worries me. Thats the reason I left Singapore but I'm within range of Singapore. A stone throw away.

              EXTRACTED FROM THE STRAITS TIMES IN 'YOUTHINK' SECTION UNDER THE "SOAP BOX" COLUMN, PUBLISHED ON MONDAY, JANUARY 21 2008.
               
              FORGOING THE RAT RACE FOR THE 'LILIES OF THE FIELD'
              Story by Yen Feng 
               
              The season for announcing promotiions and bonuses is, for many rookies, the annual measure of success.
               
              But it does no account for work we put into out personal relationships, which is harder to quantify - you do not exactly get cash for how good a son, brother, friend or spouse you have been.
               
              That part belongs to another race: the silent marathon to show we are more than the sum of our bank accounts. It is a race we seldom talk about over drinks. It is a race that is easy to forget because we are our own arbiters.
               
              But it exists.
               
              So I consider myself fortunate to have had a reminder of it at the start of my career.
               
              A year agp. I turned in my press pass to take care of a dying loved one.
               
              In that time, my peers whizzed ahead, bagging awards I knew would give them an edge over me in the company. At first, I was envious. Then I thought: How much of it really matters?
               
              A recent e-mail from a senior executive in the newsroom last week brought the point home.
               
              It cited a speech by Pulitzer Prize-winning American journalist Anna Quindlen. In it, she tells a class of graduating students that life's measure isn't about "the next promotion, the bigger  paycheck, the larger house", but about cultivating one's soul.
               
              "Consider the lilies of the field," she said.
               
              As Singaporeans, we have been trained from a young age to covet success in its most admired form: cash.
               
              We compute our worth in dollars and cents. We work hard - the result of being ranked and banded in school from the age of nine.
               
              And, if you take literally what Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew said last week - "Retirement is death" - we will be working not only harder, but longer than ever.
               
              But it is precisely because we push ourselves so hard that Ms Quindlen's words are all the more relevant.
               
              The Challenge is to expand our definition of the words "success" and "reward", beyond promotion and bonuses.
               
              In the end, we are judged in our lives for all our work - not just the work we are paid to do.
               
              Since my loved one died, I have adjusted certain priorities in my life.
               
              After a year away from the office, I am ready to buckle down and earn my keep. But I am also working on that other, "lilies" race.
               
              I know how much it means to listen, to show up, to make time for the people who mean something in our lives.
               
              After all, time, unlike money, is finite. At the end of one's life, no one has been known to say: "I wish I spent more time in the office."
               
              So me, I am looking up an old friend. Or lighting a candle at dinner.
               
              That's the part I'm leaving for the lilies.

              Thats the reason when you open business overseas, you must live there and monitor your business. And you must be strict with your staffs. Thats the way you do it and I've done business overseas before....in Bali....24hrs restaurant...then later I build a hawker centre..
