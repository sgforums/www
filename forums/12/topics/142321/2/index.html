            <div class='col-md body'>Basically knowing a girl less then a month, its difficult to visualise how she will behave or act in the next few months. Usually people tries to put up a good front or try to be nicer with new friends.<br><br>By confessing your liking for her in just merely 2 weeks, you are putting yourself in a risk of going into a "50/50 relationship". A healthy relationship involves both party to have adequate understanding of eachother, getting used to the way both reacts and able to click well.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"><br>What if she got boyfriend but likes to flirt around?<br>What if her character is not up to your standard?<br><br>Of course people always says "good girls hard to find, once found one, faster grab".

Sorry if they sound abit to your disliking.<br><br>I think that there are other ways to find out if a girl is attached like asking a fren or jsut asking her in a joking manner whether she is attached. U can also hint her instead of opening confessing to her. Mayb she did not get your hints?Of cos, if she lie to u or duno how to take hints, then it dun work la. But i think confession is the last thing u shld do.<br><br>It shld come after all the things that needs to be done is done. Like knowing her well, know that at least she has a liking for u, knowing she is single of cos, etc etc.<br><br>I think your reason for confession is abit  out of place. I understand why u are so eager but at the same time while trying to get the info, u could get to know her better so that u can get info easier isnt it?<br><br>Anyway, good luck for tonite.</div>
