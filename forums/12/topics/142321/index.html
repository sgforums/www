Expressing your feelings further before you are even good friends may be cost- and time-efficient, but a tad too intimidating for almost every lady to accept.<br><br>Put yourself in the shoes of this lady. Should I say "yes" and risk making myself sound very 'easy' in front of this man? Should I say "no" and risk losing this man who seems decent enough to be a prospective partner? Both options don't seem appealing, so I'd rather choose the safest way out and say ermmmm... instead.<br><br>Because she didn't really say "no", all is not lost though.<br><br>A suggestion: Send her a message by SMS or email and apologise for your rashness in pushing the relationship. Tell her you'd give her as much time as she needs to know you better first. Ask her if she would continue to be your friend -- just friend (emphasize) -- and if she would still come out and have lunch again with you some day. Give her some breathing space and remember, you don't want to chase the "prey" away (wrong choice of words perhaps?).<br><br>Good hunting.<br><br>Apologies if you find this advice somewhat familiar.

Expressing your feelings further before you are even good friends may be cost- and time-efficient, but a tad too intimidating for almost every lady to accept.<br><br>Put yourself in the shoes of this lady. Should I say "yes" and risk making myself sound very 'easy' in front of this man? Should I say "no" and risk losing this man who seems decent enough to be a prospective partner? Both options don't seem appealing, so I'd rather choose the safest way out and say ermmmm... instead.<br><br>Because she didn't really say "no", all is not lost though.<br><br>A suggestion: Send her a message by SMS or email and apologise for your rashness in pushing the relationship. Tell her you'd give her as much time as she needs to know you better first. Ask her if she would continue to be your friend -- just friend (emphasize) -- and if she would still come out and have lunch again with you some day. Give her some breathing space and remember, you don't want to chase the "prey" away (wrong choice of words perhaps?).<br><br>Good hunting.<br><br>Apologies if you find this advice somewhat familiar. One has reached the point in life where one tends to repeat oneself at times.</div></blockquote>I have apologised to her liao by sms, n took ur suggestion....thanks for your reply....i really appreciate it....</div>
