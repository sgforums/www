Its only preferable coz fellow christians share a common faith: that is in God and through that a better understanding of one another.<br><br>BUT the words in the bible are still important to christians and those who want to read it. It is through the words in the bible that one learns many things and sees the word of God in it. You read it one time, you may take it as a diary, story or narration. You read it the second time, you see it differently. Meanings within phrases, words within words. You see the third time, you understand the meaning in the verses more and more and can relate the words in the bible more towards the life you are living.<br><br>God's will is through our strength, heart, mind and soul. But the only way God can communicate with us is mainly through the bible and at times through a third party: like a person, certain events, a breeze of wind, etc, etc.<br><br>When you find someone whom you decided to spend your life with and she is no christian, I will pray for you and I will know slowly, you will bring her closer to God.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>As for musicbox:<br><br>Correct me if I am wrong.<br><br>Now do you still think guys give empty promises? You are christian and I am sure you have brothers in your church and brothers in other churches. Do you condemn them as you have condemned guys who make empty promises?</div>
