What are promises to be broken? If he has broken them now, he could have just break them anytime in the future even if you're married with him.</div>

I have never given him stress at all but only to tell him my family condition to let him understand that all I need is to have a shoulder to cry on from him.

Usually, just one simple thing can cause us to get stressed and give up. From the above, maybe you lean too much and he felt pressured and give up.<br><br>Dating and marriage are different. Dating he can ignore your family condition. Married he must take up and share your burden as well. If he is feeling that you are leaning too much of him now, he probably became afraid after thinking of what would happen if both of you got married, and decided to run away.<br><br>Anyway, like others said, you guys aren't suitable. Move on and close this chapter of your life.</div>
