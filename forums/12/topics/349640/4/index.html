              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Aear,<br> I try hard to see myself objectively, while I don't dare to say I
              have changed completely, I</p>
              <p>know something in me has changed. I see the world differently,
              and I see so clearly what I</p>
              <p>had done, and what I have missed in life. The damage is so real,
              the pain, sobering. Every</p>
              <p>step I walk, every second I breathe, I am reminded of my own
              stupidity, and her sacrifices.</p>
              <p>You are right about things came easy for me, and after 18 years,
              I did take her for granted,</p>
              <p>she became invisible to me, and I felt I even deserve better! It
              took all of this, to slap</p>
              <p>me in the face and put me in my place. This whole thing has
              humbled me so.<br> Yes, she deserves the righ to walk away guilt free, for she has
              earned it...<br>  <br> The better man is not the past me, but the person she fell in love
              with 18 years ago, and</p>
              <p>now, he is an improved, and has for the first time: a
              conscience.</p>
              <p>I wish everyone can be a pragmatist. I am an emotional and
              sentimental person. I believe in</p>
              <p>hope and in a person's conviction to change. I respectfully
              disagree with comparing a person</p>
              <p>with a leopard. We are not animals, we believe and worship God,
              that alone separate us from</p>
              <p>animals.</p>
              <p>Many has told me, it's not possible, move on and there are
              "plenty of fish in the sea". If</p>
              <p>think logically, that would be an easy decision, just forget it
              and move on. Unfortunately,</p>
              <p>there is nothing logical about love, and hope is illogical as
              well! So is the belief in</p>
              <p>miracles. These are the three things that I wake up to, because
              without these, I won't be</p>
              <p>able to sleep, wake up, and even going about my daily routine
              would be impossible, for</p>
              <p>everything I do and see reminded of her love, and my own
              mistakes.</p>
              <p>I also think that I need to stay and NOT move on, and let it all
              sink in. Bearing the burden</p>
              <p>of pain, is a kind of blessing. Because it's a lifelong lesson,
              for without it, I will never</p>
              <p>have realized my erroneous ways.</p>

              <p>How
              you handled and will handle your lifestyle is entirely your choice,
              right from the beginning until now. I can only tell you my
              observations. <br> <br> Your mistake was simple. You persisted in a concept that is not in tune
              with your real self. A good example: You made a promise to commit to
              one woman and you didn’t. Repeatedly. So why persist in monogamy if
              you’re not built for it in the first place? <br> <br> Your biggest problem is not faithfulness. It’s coming to terms with your own nature and keeping it real. <br> <br> Even within the animal kingdom, certain animals (rats, elephants) don’t mate for life and no one faults them for it.</p>

              <p>Man, I really don't know whether to laugh hysterically or throw up from the sickening stupidity presented here.</p>
              <p>The AOS is straightforward.  The TS was living high, what with his job and his cheap fucks on the side.  Now he's jobless and dumped, and he wants to go crawling back to the girl he's repeatedly fucked over, simply so he can get over feeling like the complete fucking loser that he is.  That's not love - that's plain selfishness on the verge of vicious parasitism.</p>
              <p>He's got the bloody temerity to claim that he's her safety net?!  She's the one who's finally decided to do the right thing and flush this piece of shit down the toilet, and now that he's down on his luck he wants to go back to mama.</p>
              <p>Fucking big baby.</p>
              <p>Don't talk about true love, TS - your actions already show that you're completely incapable of developing the slightest fucking clue of what that is.  If I were the ex, I'd slice your nads off and shove them down your throat for trying to insult my intelligence with all this "true love" bullshit after all of your crap.</p>
              <p>Do everyone a favour and take a long walk of a short pier, jackass.</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Hi all,</p>
              <p>I have been lurking these forums and now just gathered the
              courage to post. I am 37, and was married to a wonderful woman for
              nearly 7 years. We are now separated for about 5 months. She is
              living with a man now, and refusing to see me or even talk about
              getting back together. Long story short, I cheated in her 2x, and
              she forgave me. But the 3rd and last incident, I moved out to
              live with another woman for about 4 months, and when then I realize
              how dumb I had been, my wife already moved out.</p>
              <p>Initally, I thought I could get her back, but as times goes, I
              see how she had made up her mind, she won't even see me anymore. On
              top of that, all her friends and family are ignoring me, and
              rightly so. I tried calling her, texting her, e-mailing her but
              that just annoyed her more. So I followed my sister's advice and
              leave her alone for now. But I am afraid that with time, she may
              drift further and further away and the possibility (no matter how
              remote) of us getting back together is getting slimmer.</p>
              <p>She is the love of my life, and my first love, we had been
              together as BF/GF for nearly 20 years, and she had been nothing but
              an angel in my life, but I was so insecure and immature, I went and
              forsake her love...</p>
              <p>Now that I am "sober" about life and my mistakes, I am a better
              person, I want to make it up to her and "return" her love. The guy
              she is living with now, I don't think she loves him, I just think
              she wants some sort of stability and someone that is a contrast to
              me. I think deep down, she still loves me, and I now know, I TRULY
              DEEPLY LOVES HER...</p>
              <p>I know many people will say, if I love her, let her go, and move
              on. But 20 years of her sacrifice and now that I am a better
              person, I want us, to get back together and truly begin our life
              and love together. It is worth fighting for, and I would like to
              fight for her, before "moving on and giving up".</p>
              <p>I have drafted many e-mailes to her but have not send them.
              Should I send them? Or should I leave her alone for now...</p>
              <p>Any encouragements, suggestions, welcomed.</p>

              <p>I have another friend who got into the same plight as you.</p>
              <p>Everyone had the same advise for him. Learn from the lesson and move on. Your ex gf deserves someone better.</p>
              <p>Sorry for my bluntness. But this is exactly the message you should swallow.</p>

What do you expect? The whole forumers pity you and say 'don't give up...'?</p>
              <p><br>It's over for you and her... you start the fire and got burnt again and again... At this point you have to move on and stop disturbing her, before things getting worse or got yourself sued for invading privacy...  No emails! No phone calls! No SMS! nothing... just stop find her and ruining her life... Stop being selfish and chasing your own happiness and start to let her have her own...  <br><br>Suggestion: Great if you are sober now... but there's no turning back... Real life is not like hollywood where everything's "happily ever after". Be careful... you might hit back by what you had done in the past!!!</p>

              <p><em><strong>I say unto you, that even so there shall be joy in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine righteous persons, who need no repentance. </strong></em>Luke 15:7</p>
              <p>I do not expect sympathy from any of you at all, for you are all human and some level of forgiveness are beyond human capacity.</p>
              <p>My pain might be 1/100000000000000th of what she felt, but my lack of support at all really has taken a toll on me. Going to church truly helped me, and her presence in my life I believed was put there by God to "open my eyes."</p>
              <p>God made her a blessing to me, and I pray to God, may I be a blessing to her, and others. I saw her pics from friend's facebook pics, I must say, her smiles I felt is a little bit jaded, I feel so sorry to have taken away the pure innocent naive joy she could have felt.</p>
              <p>Incidentally, I came across this article: <a href="http://www.asiaone.com/News/AsiaOne%2BNews/Malaysia/Story/A1Story20090226-124624.html">http://www.asiaone.com/News/AsiaOne%2BNews/Malaysia/Story/A1Story20090226-124624.html</a></p>
              <p>And I chuckled, 6x? My cheating was 3x, but still, one is too many. I am coming around to how resolved my (ex) wife is, but in this pit of darkness, I see a ray of light from God. For it is His Will, whatever will happens in the future. However, I do</p>
              <p>I thank you for all the words and time you have put in here, you hate me, pity me, spit on me with passion and I feel great because you are caring for my wife, that made us similar, in that way :)</p>
              <p>I still dream of her, everynight, she would be next to me, and I tend to her ever so gently and lovingly, then I wake up to a delibitating heartache. I am grateful however, for "waking up".</p>
              <p>The Pon &amp; Zi cartoon has a special meaning for us. I love her and I used to buy surprise gifts to her and post images on her facebook for no reason. She responded to that youtube with a short e-mail (usually she just ignores everything I wrote).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am hoping, where there is very little hope. I am not stalking her, disrupting her, I am just here, atoning, smiling, and cheering for her.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Go, my love, Go! :) *cheer*</p>
