              <p>to ts: you remind me of a guy i knew,</p>
              <p> always thought despite him being a flirt he would remain faithful to his wife(because wife is the faithful type so i thought he would commit to the marriage). but later on he admited to me he cheated on his wife 3-4 times. and even after divorce and declaring undying love to the new girl he called me 1 week after the girl left town to go out and have "fun".</p>
              <p>currently with another new one again, just declared undying love again, promise never to hurt, to love always........ lets see how long this last. i think probably end up like you</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Hi all,</p>
              <p>I have been lurking these forums and now just gathered the
              courage to post. I am 37, and was married to a wonderful woman for
              nearly 7 years. We are now separated for about 5 months. She is
              living with a man now, and refusing to see me or even talk about
              getting back together. Long story short, I cheated in her 2x, and
              she forgave me. But the 3rd and last incident, I moved out to
              live with another woman for about 4 months, and when then I realize
              how dumb I had been, my wife already moved out.</p>
              <p>Initally, I thought I could get her back, but as times goes, I
              see how she had made up her mind, she won't even see me anymore. On
              top of that, all her friends and family are ignoring me, and
              rightly so. I tried calling her, texting her, e-mailing her but
              that just annoyed her more. So I followed my sister's advice and
              leave her alone for now. But I am afraid that with time, she may
              drift further and further away and the possibility (no matter how
              remote) of us getting back together is getting slimmer.</p>
              <p>She is the love of my life, and my first love, we had been
              together as BF/GF for nearly 20 years, and she had been nothing but
              an angel in my life, but I was so insecure and immature, I went and
              forsake her love...</p>
              <p>Now that I am "sober" about life and my mistakes, I am a better
              person, I want to make it up to her and "return" her love. The guy
              she is living with now, I don't think she loves him, I just think
              she wants some sort of stability and someone that is a contrast to
              me. I think deep down, she still loves me, and I now know, I TRULY
              DEEPLY LOVES HER...</p>
              <p>I know many people will say, if I love her, let her go, and move
              on. But 20 years of her sacrifice and now that I am a better
              person, I want us, to get back together and truly begin our life
              and love together. It is worth fighting for, and I would like to
              fight for her, before "moving on and giving up".</p>
              <p>I have drafted many e-mailes to her but have not send them.
              Should I send them? Or should I leave her alone for now...</p>
              <p>Any encouragements, suggestions, welcomed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thanks,</p>

              <p>Don't know about advice and suggestions but as a woman I can tell you what I think of when a man like you breaks his vows. He contradicts himself, he is confused, he is sleazy and he is greedy. </p>
              <p>Cheating thrice and moving out was the right thing to do. You did it because you completely lost interest in your wife. Wanting your marriage back is wrong because it shows you don't care about her future. If you did, you would leave her alone.</p>
              <p>What you can do now is start thinking straight and stop being so emotional. Make a list and write down all the good things you had with your ex wife and start thinking about where you stand on the word loyalty.</p>

              <p>Thanks again all, for the wise words. Just writing and reading the responses really soothes me. And especially to <a href="http://sgforums.com/users/242785">xtreyier</a>, you truly understands and that's how I feel now. I met my wife and she was my FIRST girlfriend, we really grew up together and as a result, I grew comfortable with her, secure and slowly, she became invisible to me.</p>
              <p>I do think I have changed, fundamentally, I remember the 2nd time she took me back, I was not all that repentant. But now, the way I walk, the way I see the world, the way I think, I think I am a different person. Some people grow up and are smarter at their 20s, I feel like I have "arrived" and understand the meaning of LIFE and LOVE finally at 37. I was so selfsih and I shudder now remembering past abuses I did to her...</p>
              <p>It's killing me, the gult, the regret, the lost time and opportunities, to love her, to be tender and kind to her.</p>
              <p>Now, she is with this guy who many thinks is somewhat of an opportunist, but I will not put him dowm anymore because it's her choice. I  just am so sad that she may not be getting the best that she deserves, now that I have become a new man...and that she may not really love him, he is just someone that cares about her superficially. I think I am a much better candidate (forgetting the past) with my education, and general pedegree... speaking objectively. And I want her to have the best because she deserves nothing less.</p>
              <p>It's so hard to wake up because I dreamt of her everynight, yes, everynight. In the dream, it's always about she coming back, and I treated her nice, and then I realized it's a dram, and woke up in cold sweat. The pain after waking up is so crippling.</p>
              <p>Hard to go about doing normal things to,everything I do and everyone I see reminds me of her and of my past self.</p>
              <p>I think, and hope she still loves me... I have also recently lost my job, so waking up with no one I care about and no job to go to is extra hard.</p>
              <p>I walk now with constant pain, of how I've let her down, let my parents down, let our friends and family down because everyone around us is affected by my stupidity...I'm bearing the consequences... I hope to God, that He will open her eyes, and continue to guide me, so that we may be reunited.</p>
              <p>I have resolved to make myself better by going to church, taking classes, and writing her and calling her less.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I want to ask you all, do you believe in redemption, in repentance, in "late maturing", and in Miracles?</p>

              <p><br>I can feel your pain my friend, I really do.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>First off, everyone will come to a reasonable conclusion that you are a serial philanderer. You yourself recognize this and so I will not comment any further on the fact that you brought upon it on yourself (Other forumners here have done it sufficiently).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You have already experienced miracles and redemption. Twice. Now you are past the point of redemption.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now there is only one thing you can do to proof to yourself that you still love her; Leave her alone.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You have to know that YOU are her greatest source of hurt and betrayal. At this point, she wants to have nothing to do with you anymore. She wants to get on a new life, with someone she may not love as much as you but someone who is more dependable and trustworthy than you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So let your wife continue with her healing process and leave her be. In time she will get over you. She will get to share her life with someone more deserving of her love and trust (even if that someone is, as you said, of a lesser pedegree as compared to you). If you truly love her, then you will be able to live with the grief and pain, know that she is not hurting.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In time, you will get over her too.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>PS. What makes you think that the man she is living with now is an opportunist? This is not a rhetorical question. I am interested to know how you arrive at that conclusion.</p>
