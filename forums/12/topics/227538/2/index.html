            <div class='col-md body'>Being tall is not exactly good<br>For instance in BMT the tallest guy are often ask to be the right marker.<br>In army everytime there sai kang,tall people usually very hard to smoke out from the saikang sure tio errand.<br>When taking double deck bus,it very troublesome when u alight the bus when u are on the upper deck<br>Everytime some people like to stare at tall people for no reason and look as if tall people are weirdos<br>Too tall may give distance to people<br>Too Tall usually end up hunch back as u have to bend down talking to people,and it very rude if u don't look at people when u talk right.<br>When sleeping,it hard to find a good bed and usually legs have to bend a little to sleep<br>Durning lesson,alway kena ask qns like can the tall guy in black ans this<br>At work if there things that on top,tall guys are alway ask to carry as they are deemed to be good in carrying things,hence doing extra work.<br>Conclusion ,be happy with what u are, and i think in singapore, money is much more important than looks,money give a sense of security not the height.</div>
