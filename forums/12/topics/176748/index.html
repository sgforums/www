In fact, the option that you have implored, is one of the possible options that you could have taken. There's in fact another one, that's is...to try to compromise and accept each other for who they are. And of course that's the most difficult options of them all. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>It's a vicious cycle cos even though you decided to break up with her and let her go so you'll finally find some peace in your mind, but the fact is when another girl comes along...nobody can guarantee that the next girl will not end up giving you the same problem. You probably do not wanna try your luck and see if the next girl is indeed the same or worse than the current girl cos for all you know, you could be back with facing the same relationship problem again like some nightmarish de-javu. Best bet is to ask your best buddies and see if they had similar problems with their girlfriends before...and you'll soon know if this is a vicious cycle or not. But trust me on this...it is. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>There's always lessons to be learned on each and every setback that we encountered in our life. And it doesn't necessary meant that the oldest friend you have among your peers is the most mature, ate the most salt, and the wisest. So don't go around your void deck pestering those poor old folks for their words of enlightenment or wisdom. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Sometimes you may have the same setback as other people or you may have it earlier or later than other people around you. But believe me, we're all undergoing the same syllabus about life itself. And a handful of those selected few graduated to become saints, some became mad, many became repeat-students, and many more didn't even graduate from pre-school. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Have you ever encountered with a person who's old enough to be our parents and yet their behaviour and wisdom isn't on par with their age? As in adults behaving childishly? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Sadly, there are plenty of those in our society and they never fail to amuse me everytime. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>However, should you decided to overcome this relationship setback...I'll definitely support your decision to do so. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Afterall, no matter what happens, you still love her right? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>If you decides not to do so, well...the worst thing that can happen to her is...probably she'll kill herself over you or...she might just end up with another guy who doesn't know how to appreciate her like you do. In short, her life might just be ruined by your selfless decision...that is, to leave her for her own good.<br><br>But who knows, you might find another girl who is submissive to you and born with a natural good-temper and is patient and kind and generous and selfless in giving her love and all in a relationship.<br><br>Anyway, it's your life and your relationship that really requires your own wisdom to lead and live it. Pick your choice and live by it without regrets, cos life often doesn't give us a second chance unless you're really a lucky and blessed person. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Good luck and I hope you'll be happy with whatever decision you've decided to take. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>

(You realise that when you see her REFUSING to admit she is wrong, you are also forcing her to switch to your set of values and principles? so she MUST agree with you, or else she is wrong issit?) Are these principles and values very important to you?<br><br>However, I do believe that to have a happy rship, you should be with someone who shares the same values and principles with you, especially if you are planning to settle down. You can't build a family or have a long lasting rship that is happy with someone whom you do not agree with how life should be held. I can compromise on SOME values, but if being in a rship makes me unhappy, I rather let it go cos (besides myself being unhappy all the time) someone else with her/his values will make her/him happier than me.</div>

They just want a guy who loves,understand and care for them..... I see too many cases of this,in the end divorce is the only solution!<br><br>To me,love is not only the ingredient to have a lasting r/s... 3 ingredients is essential to make a successful marriage. Love,best friend and responsibility..My gf to me is my love one,she is also my best friend(I share all the problem and complain to her.just like yr friend helping u like that) and I have a responsible to take care of her whole life(Even love is faded,u must think of the past sweet things,moment and happiness share together mah)!</div>
