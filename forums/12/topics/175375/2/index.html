Or is she the type who engages in no-strings-attached physical affection?   She could just be enjoying herself now with no intention to commit to a relationship.</div>

If possible find another gal.<br><br>You made 2 bad moves on ur part.<br>1st, u were too fast on her and even admitted that u like her. This actually frightens her. U shd not admit that u like her. This actually turns her off. Control urself. If she likes u she will let u know. Let her make the first move. By doing so, u actually make urself look weak cos it seems u are desperate for her.<br><br>2nd, She has already told u she jus got out of a bad relationship etc... What she is trying to tell u is that she doesnt consider u as a potential bf. Yes, get it! A gal who is interested in u will not give such an excuse. Yet u still persist to go out with her and even hold her arms! Dude, play it cool. All her actions show she jus treats u as a friend.<br><br>So, dun contact her anymore for at least 2 weeks and see if she does contact u for a date. If so, it shows some level of interest from her. If she doesnt, well i hope u get the idea unless u like to get hurt and confused by her again.<br><br></div>
