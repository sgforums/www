I still find that I don't have time for alot of things, but at least I feel that I'm improving? Like my usual belief, why sit around complaining about it if you can DO something about it instead?<br><br>This is from my buddy who has motivated me to really do something about my time management... I asked him how would I ever get enough time to do all the things I wanna do.... He told me...<br><br>"Everybody has got 24 hours a day. No one has more, no one has less. It's just how you use it...."</div>

When I had to do group work during my undergraduate days, I made a point to work only with people whom I knew would pull their own weight.
