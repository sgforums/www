Go home late everyday with unfinished work which is unpossible to clear. It is so harsh, meeting the expectation of my bosses and supervisors.<br><br>Gossips and backstabbing. I am turned off by the people in there wearing formal clothes carrying office bag. Almost everyone has a serious look on their face.No smiling face. You can see that in MRT or taking a lift.<br><br>The hot weather and heavy crowd on lunch time drained my energy,and I always have this chronic headache problem at work. The headache is still with me now at home, Panadol seem useless.<br><br>It is different from primary, secondary school and JC,uni where i had gone through in the past, where laughter is everywhere.<br><br>Sometimes, I aslo have to bring work home to do. No social life.<br><br>I can't imagine myself working in there until I am old or retrenched. I can't find any happiness in life, in Singapore. My friends aslo tell me they had the same problems and we talked about it. There is why Singapore has the among the lowest happiness index.<br><br>I wonder if others have the same problem.

Even a diploma cert is worth much more...<br><br>Regarding your complaints, it's normal lah... first of all, everyone complains when they go into an entirely new environment because they are not used to it... i'm sure your guys frens all complain a lot about army life when they first went in right? After that, they all get used to it liao and never complain much liao...<br><br>As for you, age is a problem... you're still so young but already in the working world... naturally you find it hard to adapt to the serious and hectic kind of lifestyle.... you still have the mindset of a young person - relax, play, fun friendships, etc etc...<br><br>So once again, I would urge you to find some ways to get a degree... it will benefit your career in the future, as well as bring you back to school life for the time being cos u're still young...</div>
