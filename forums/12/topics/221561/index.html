Is that correct?<br><br>Since you are 20 years old, of course you are still playful, want to laugh with your friends. That is normal.<br><br>Dont be overwhelmed when you see serious faces. They put serious faces because they are doing serious things and want to be professional. Just try to concentrate on work. You can chit chat with your colleagues during lulls, or talk to guys, or also chit chat during lunch.<br><br>Try have a social life outside your work. Since you work late hours, then you must maximize your weekends.<br><br>Also I notice you say you are overworked. See if you can make any efficiencies. Observe your work flows and work process and try to improve efficiency. This can range from saving time photocopying, or prioritizing, or breaking up similar tasks.<br><br>Cheers.<br><br>Uncle Meat Pao.</div>
