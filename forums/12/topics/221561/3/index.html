            <div class='col-md body'>It is best for you to matriculate into university first instead of spending too long a time doing miscellaneous work. In the local uni, you can easily obtain loan for both your tuition fees and living allowances (up to $10k a year). With a degree in hand, there will be more opportunities and the starting pay will be much higher than you spending your time doing misc work (which will never be finished) over a fixed period of time.<br><br>Then again, this experience you have gotten from work is priceless. It will make u even more value the time u have now, esp next time when you go into uni.<br><br>Since grad last year; thankfully i have not seen much office politics in my workplace. Maybe becos it is a mostly-guys + jap + engineering environment. Everyone just work together.<br><br>During my 8-mth long internship with a respectable US MNC, where 80% of the staff r all females, I was quite put off by the gossip and politics that is going on in office daily. It can really be quite tiring if we were to spend 50% of the time a day handling all these 'politics'. The only day that every office worker will look forward to is friday (which is today!)   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>So the company work environment is equally important.

You have to prove yourself to your supervisor and your other colleagues as reliable, hardworking and honest . You also have to get your degree or else you are going to be picked by everyone who has one in your company.

When u r at work, just work and switch your mind off about everything else lor. After work, you can get back your normal life and switch off your mind about work.<br><br>Are you working as a professional? Becoz I have and a professional's life is very tough - high expectations, long hours, voluminous work........<br><br>After slogging more than half a dozen years as a professional, I've decided to move on to an in-house position and bingo! Life is so much more straightforward and relaxed........<br><br>But it seems that you are a fresh grad..... It'll be good to tough out life as a professional for a while before moving on so as to earn a bit of credibility.....<br>this is important as it adds to your "substance".<br><br>Anyway, learn to adjust lor.......... Welcome to the adult world and corporate toil.......  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

The boss will say it is your job to finish it. Lan lan to stay up it and finished it. That's why most of my supervisor stay up late to work. You can see from the skyscaper in Raffles Place.
