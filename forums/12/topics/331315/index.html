              <p>Okay i like a girl from a different level and i do not know her. So the first step will be to get her contact and such.</p>
              <p>I have a friend who know her but i plan to approach her directly and ask face to face as she will know who am i and it seems more sincere.</p>
              <p>But here is the problem. I do not know what to say as this is my first time.<br>Should i say:<br>Hello, i want to get to know you better and be friends, can i have your contact number?</p>
              <p>or</p>
              <p>Hello, i want to know you more. Are you free to chat? After that know each other better than ask for number.</p>
              <p>Any other suggestions?</p>
              <p>Also will i scare her if i approach her and leave her speechless, its too sudden and she may refuse to give me her contact. I mean she probably need time to think. So will it be better if i give her my number and allow her to consider before she text me her answer?</p>
              <p>Many thanks and all reply will be appreciated.</p>

              <p>Well, I'm not a girl...but there're a million ways to approach one.</p>
              <p>Usually, I'd go up to her and introduce myself. From observing that first few seconds of noticing you approaching and initiating contact, you'll pretty much know your chances.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #808080;"><span style="color: #888888;">By first introducing yourself, she'd also be less "shocked" and not take you for some freaky stalker.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">Avoid telling her that you know her friend immediatedly, because she'd associate him with you. And most guys are childish jerks in school.</span></p>
              <p>Good luck!</p>

              <p>Well, I agree that TS's line is pretty bad. However, approaching her with your friend might be a double edged sword.</p>
              <p>Anyway, don't girls subconsciously think of a group of guys as a pack of wolves and naturally avoid them?</p>
              <p>Me and a friend did some experiments before in a few bars just for fun. We'd sit by ourselves at the bar counter facing away from the dance floor and just drink quietly. In one night, we'd have at least 2-3 women approaching us to chat...</p>

              <p>looks like one of those tips from dating websites.. some are gd, but don't just follow wholesale blindly, some steps are too "over"</p>
              <p>eg. (5), (6), (7) &gt;&gt; shldn't try those, esp a newbie like u</p>
              <p>but dun worry, having a mutual fren will make things much easier</p>
              <p>essentially, it's all abt breaking that ice:</p>
              <p>(1)try to get some eye contact with her, if she notices you just smile at her ... don't rush, yr aim is to make yrself a familiar face to her</p>
              <p>(2)when she has noticed u enough to return u a smile(most likely after a few times of u taking note of her), only then can u approach her, and be confident!!</p>
              <p>(3)tis the time to start yr convo &gt;&gt; "going for yr class??", "u know so and so??" type of opener, casual w/o sounding too despo</p>
              <p>openers like "u free to chat" will most likely scare her off, so don't use it</p>
              <p>***once u hav broken the ice, it'll be much easier for u to start convo nxt time, strongly advise u not to get her no yet, 1st meeting too abrupt</p>
