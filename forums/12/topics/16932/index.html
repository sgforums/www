            <div class='col-md body'>The Nasi Lemak stall applepie mentioned is along the road towards YangTze Cinema one.  If you take 145 from Tanjong Pagar sure pass by the road.  So far, my tastebuds like immune to Nasi Lemak liao....  :p<br><br>Chom Pang still around meh?  Last time use to go there... wah lao!  Eat the seafood tze char stall very the SHIOK!!!  I like the lei lei and clams..... :0~~~<br><br>Anyone know if the Maxwell Road Teochew Muay still there are not?  There's a roast duck stall also very good (pre-renovation) dunno still there or not.  But his daughter open one shop at Chinatown Hawker Center upstairs of the CD shops one.  Take the central escalator to the 2nd floor, then I think must u-turn to the other direction.  That side very good to explore, got beef noodles, seafood soup, fishball noodles, and the famous Ngoh Hiang but I prefer the Ngoh Hiang at Maxwell....<br><br>Nasi Padang, I like the Lake Toba Nasi Padang.  It's next to Tanjong Pagar Market.  A bit expensive but worth the try.... where got good Curry Chicken?  I want the very lemak one...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
