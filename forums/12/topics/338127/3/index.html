              <p>Actually I don't see what's the big deal on a spouse reading the others messages. Invasion of privacy should not be a issue between husband and wife.</p>

              <p>My wife can help herself to the cash in my wallet whenever she need to, no problem with me, my handphone is charged for hours on end without me attending to it, no problem with me. Its the same viceversa. We have nothing to hide. That should be the case between spouses.</p>
              <p>Unless the culture is that of male dominance, where the wife cannot pry into the affairs of the husband. In such a situation, there is no trust between spouses in the first place.</p>

              <p>Disillusionedblue,</p>
              <p>May I remind you that your husband may be a grown man.. but he is still very much a little boy in his overgrown heart.</p>
              <p>You can confront him.. but in a calm and civilised manner. Like a mother to a child who has done mischief.</p>
              <p>From the way you have described.. obviously he wants to get caught by you. There's probably some underlying issues he dare not bring to your attention.. and like many young children..they do mischievious things to get your attention even though it is the negative type.</p>
              <p>Let him know you are aware of his little flings, and you understand he is bored and need some cheap thrills , but remind him that you do not want any " tah bao" from those girls.</p>
              <p>Admit you have read through his messages.. but do not apologize for your actions.</p>
              <p>If he protest.. simply tell him " If you have nothing to hide.. why hide ?"</p>
              <p>Be very matter of fact. If he wants to throw a fit..keep calm, let him get it out of his system.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, men can and many times do sub categorize women. Throughout history and civilization across the globe.</p>
              <p>They will enslave humans.. as they think of them as lesser human beings.. yet they will also rape them or derive pleasure like an animal.</p>
              <p>The girls he messes around with are a dime a dozen. But you are the queen of the household. Your status is different from those girls, so use this to your advantage.</p>
              <p>A female friend with 2 kids once told me.. she has 3 children.</p>

              <p>if u have no kids, thats really the best thing now. becoz u can still talk to him and try to find a solution to it. ask him why did he do all these?</p>
              <p>or choose the hard way, divorce.</p>
              <p>but remember, if u have kids, im afraid ur choice are very much limited.</p>

              <p>LOL... I have a perfectly fit body to be proud of (we're talking about six packs here). I am not married. I am of a loyal kind.</p>
              <p>Yes, we despise greedy, pork belly, infidel men. A one-way giving in love is a thing to be shunned at all cost.</p>
              <p>But yes, we also hope that couple could stick together through ups and downs...</p>
              <p>The original poster's husband treats her "sweet". According to her first post. I'm suggesting that lets not turn this already sour relationship into a ground-zero.</p>
              <p>It's like investment. When you lose alot, and you think it's gonna get worse, sell your loses and salvage what you're able to. Don't make things worse by arguing for the sake of "fairness".</p>
              <p>Think of the original poster. Is it in her good stead to argue for "fairness" at this stage?</p>

              <p>LOL... I have a perfectly fit body to be proud of (we're talking

              <p>Yes, we despise greedy, pork belly, infidel men. A one-way

              <p>It's like investment. When you lose alot, and you think it's
                  gonna get worse, sell your loses and salvage what you're able to.
                  Don't make things worse by arguing for the sake of "fairness".</p>
              <p>Think of the original poster. Is it in her good stead to argue
                  for "fairness" at this stage?</p>
              <p>Please know that most married men cheat. If "fairness" is so

              <p>Disillusionedblue,</p>
              <p>May I remind you that your husband may be a grown man.. but he
                  is still very much a little boy in his overgrown heart.</p>
              <p>You can confront him.. but in a calm and civilised manner. Like
                  a mother to a child who has done mischief.</p>
              <p>From the way you have described.. obviously he wants to get
                  caught by you. There's probably some underlying issues he dare not
                  bring to your attention.. and like many young children..they do
                  mischievious things to get your attention even though it is the
                  negative type.</p>
              <p>Let him know you are aware of his little flings, and you
                  understand he is bored and need some cheap thrills , but remind him
                  that you do not want any " tah bao" from those girls.</p>
              <p>Admit you have read through his messages.. but do not apologize
                  for your actions.</p>
              <p>If he protest.. simply tell him " If you have nothing to hide..
                  why hide ?"</p>
              <p>Be very matter of fact. If he wants to throw a fit..keep calm,
                  let him get it out of his system.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, men can and many times do sub categorize women.
                  Throughout history and civilization across the globe.</p>
              <p>They will enslave humans.. as they think of them as lesser human
                  beings.. yet they will also rape them or derive pleasure like an
                  animal.</p>
              <p>The girls he messes around with are a dime a dozen. But you are
                  the queen of the household. Your status is different from those
                  girls, so use this to your advantage.</p>
              <p>A female friend with 2 kids once told me.. she has 3
                  children.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>you're crazy,</p>
              <p>to ts: if its still possible to control your emotion, try to, don't talk to him while you're angry. we don't know what your husband is like so based on your own understanding you have to judge whether he is the type who would back off when confronted or otherwise. wait til you've calmed down then decided for yourself if the marriage is worth saving.</p>
              <p>if possible try not to even bring up you checked his SMSes if you feel he's the type that reacts strongly to confrontation but if he ask don't hide. he only needs to know that you know, everything else can let him guess.</p>
              <p>truth is most men after doing it once would do it again if given the chance. everyone i knew who did it, repeated their actions. just think it through calmly first, do you think you can still live with him after this and trust him again? some can, most nowadays can't especially if there's no children.</p>
              <p>at least if worst case divorce, things would end better if parting is peaceful. no point fighting in anger at court. whatever your choice if he still cares, using guilt would be better against him than anger.</p>

              <p>Thanks for all your concern and advice.</p>
              <p>Contrary to what some of you think, I don't strive to look for a perfect guy or a perfect life, but he was that close to being perfect to me; the kind of guy every girl dreams about.</p>
              <p>He was never abusive verbally or physically and like I said indirectly, still very sweet and loving to me as if nothing happened.</p>
              <p>Re: My aunt, she tried her best to salvage the marriage for my cousins. She hoped that he will come clean but he chose to dump her unceremoniously instead.</p>
              <p>Anyway, I've confronted him because I couldn't hold it inside me anymore. <br>He admitted that he did flirt &amp; cybered with them via sms and internet but swears that he has never met up with them or brought any girl home before.</p>
              <p>He asked me to give him a chance and that it will never happen again. He apologised to me and he sent them all a sms in front of me telling the girls not to contact him anymore because he is married and deleted their contacts from his phone etc.</p>
              <p>He asked me to forgive him and put this behind and start afresh. He said this happened because both of us had been busy at work and our schedules clashed a lot.</p>
              <p>I think Jojobeach is right that he was looking to be caught because he seemed relieved?? He said that he was glad that I nipped it in the butt.</p>
              <p>He also told me he only loves me alone and that he wants our marriage to work out.</p>
              <p>Anyway, I've decided to just put this behind me and work on working on our relationship.</p>

              <p>If I were you...maybe it is better to calm down first...and give
              some time to think....</p>
              <p>Those SMSes and emails etc....might not mean that he has gone
              into a serious relationship with other women....my feeling is that
              he just like to flirt.....especially if there are 3 women....it
              means he is not having a serious affair...most likely playing/
              flirting...with anyone he likes....and it seems there is a chance
              his flirting is only at SMS level, or maybe chat/ drinks with those
              women, it might not have progressed into an intimate contact
              yet......</p>
              <p>It seems to me your hubby doesnt take the marriage
              seriously....he still like to fling around...that type of
              guy....</p>
              <p>First give urself some time to think through...and then think
              maybe you can have a serious talk with your hubby and tell him to
              take his marriage seriously, and no more flirting with other
              women.......</p>
              <p>But if the relations has progressed into intimate contact with
              those women....well, that is a serious sin, and its up to you
              whether you want to forgive him or not. But if I were you, firstly
              I will try to find out the true nature of his flirtings.</p>
