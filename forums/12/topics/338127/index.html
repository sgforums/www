              <p>I had a very happy married life. 'Had' because I just found out it's not as happy as I thought it was.</p>
              <p>My husband has always been very attentive and sweet to me. He still is. Everything remains the same as the day we got married.</p>
              <p> I've always trusted him 100% and never probed into any of his matters. I have never gone through his stuff until yesterday.... I know it's wrong to go through his smses but I had this nagging feeling that I have to go through. Call it the woman's 6th sense...  :'(</p>
              <p>About 2 weeks ago while we were watching TV, a sms came in for him and he replied. I casually glanced over as I was sitting beside him but couldn't see what the message was about. He did it very naturally but he had the phone tilted at an angle so I can't see clearly but I thought it was a female name though I didn't catch it. I didn't think too much about it till last week he left his phone on table with the inbox open and walked away for a drink. I happened to glance down and saw a msg that said something like "I just came out of the shower. What are you doing?" It was a female name. I didn't look through his phone then but it piqued my curiousity because no female will ever tell a normal friend that she just came out of the shower unless the guy is her boyfriend or lover or husband.</p>
              <p>I thought through this for a whole week if I should check his phone or maybe I'm just over-reacting and being overly sensitive. However, I fell to temptation yesterday when he was in the shower.</p>
              <p>Curiousity killed the cat :'( My hunch was right. The worse thing is that it is not 1 but TWO different girls.</p>
              <p>The smses were too 'hot' for them to be just normal friends. He should just take a knife and stab it straight into my heart.</p>
              <p>I've always trusted him wholeheartedly. I have been giving him the cold shoulder the whole day. I don't know what to do. How to react.</p>
              <p>I want to confront him but at the same time he is treating me the same as before. There was not a hint in his actions for me to suspect.</p>
              <p>Should I trash things out with him or just lie to myself and pretend nothing happened since he is still the loving and good husband in front of me.</p>
