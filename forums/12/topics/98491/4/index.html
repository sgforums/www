Doing all those bad things that one can think of. But that doesnt affect me.<br><br>So one day i asked her for her contacts and i called her. At first she was very nice to me, talkin nicely to me. Slowly we begun to like grow feeling for me. Like if she go out, at night she will call me to tell me she's home and stuff.<br>From our conversation, i came to realise she is a constant smoker, take drugs before, and like CHIONG alot alot.<br><br>Well, of coz i ask her whether she like her lifestyle and she say yes. But she got consider to change it.<br><br>Slowly we chatted more and more often, almost every minute of the day.<br>One day i cant resist her "temptation" and ask her if she will wan to be my gf( Take note: i never met her before) and she agreed.<br><br>But the nightmare just begin. After being with her, i found out she very senstitve. Like i used to put my ex pic on friendster and forget to take it down and she be angry.<br><br>Den she even ask me to lend her money to pay her fone bill, saying that is her grandma who is payin her bill and her uncle want the money back.<br>She soundurgent and vexed, den suddenly she sms me saying that we not suited for each other. I called her back and found out she wanted to lend money from this guy, in return the guy doesnt wan money but wan her to be his stead.<br><br>OMG, i say this kind of guy only wan her body that is truth. Where will this guy like her. I cried, even before i met her. Haix..she was later touched by me and say she dun wan to lend from him le..but she still requested abit from me..<br><br>I lend her 100 and she still asked from that guy for 100. Although it was enough only to pay half of wat she owe, she was happy and we return to the joyful conversation. Anyway the hp was return to her uncle. So i only can contact her thru her house fone.<br><br>On the fourth day, i planned to meet her for the first time, coz i was workin and no time. So i wanted to meet her after work coz is friday. i told her the plan and she was happy. But only half an hour before i finished work..she said her uncle called again, demanding the other half of the bill.<br><br>This time i couldnt help her, so i ask her to lend from that guy but dun gif in the request. I tell her i will return the guy money when i got my pay.<br>So she say she go meet the guy first, den go uncle house den ask me to go home first. She say she will come my house later.<br><br>I stayed at office till 9pm (my workin hours end 7.30pm) and even took the bus home to pass away time. when i reached home it was 11 plus and she didnt call..so i called her hp thinkin she might answer..after 3 calls..still no answer..So i decided to try the public fone. And only one call she answered!<br>Oh god..i was furious and begun to shout at her for all the suspicious moment i had with her.<br><br>In the end she hung on me ...tellin me she die heart le...After that day, i still got contact her. She told me everytime she wan to devote herself to me, i will alway make her angry. haix...somehow i believe her words..<br><br>Then on sunday morning, she msg me askin me for another 100 to pay that guy coz she dun wan to be with him... After that she also say she need it by 10am..that time she first msg me was 7am...how on earth i going to get money..so i went askin ard...den she suddenly she say no need le..coz she no time...<br><br>in the end she was wif the guy, she sms sayin the guy give her 300 and no need her to return. But she got to be with him.<br>Haix...eventually i still managed to raise 300 and i went to her house... wanted to gif her but she not in..coz that time she say she at the guy's house.<br><br>i met up with her mom...she told me she used to be very nice girl, showed me her past picture...OMG she look so innocent and sporty..ws very tanned...den after a while...she return home...WOW, she was so white and her dressin ws so hot..so diff from her pic...she never saw me be4 so she say she dunno me...<br><br>but after a while...her temper show...she shouted at her mom, bang the door and stuff...i manage to cool her down and she tell me she is like tt...she say she wun change coz she still like to CHIONG and play...she dun wan to look for job...<br><br>I can understand her world and my is miles apart. But i wan the good for her...she even say she had lend the money from that guy and had to repay him by being with him. even i now gif her money the guy also dun wan...<br><br>I at a loss....i dunno how to change her ...i got a feelin deep inside her...she got this angel heart...trapped inside...she wan to become good on one side...the other side of her wan to chiong and clubbin...wat shld i do??<br><br>she alway claim i so nice to her and too good for her le...but she also say she die heart...but when i ask if next time in future i come find her...will she accept me...she will not gif a definite answer....i say gif her 2 year to change...she say maybe no need tt long...haix...but thinkin she had to do the biddin for this guy for juz 300 is way too much for me to handle...anyone got any idea how to help her???<br><br></div></blockquote>i feel she might be using u.<br>U havent even met her once and she agree to be ur stead and end up asking $$$ instead.<br>I might be wrong but.... it jus dun sound logical to me.<br>I hope i'm wrong but hope u can see the actual pictire pal..dun be a fool.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br>well sometimes it is not up to individuals to offer help and being accepted by others.. If she is unwilling to change or listen in the first place you will not be able to help her. Even if professional help is given to a person, if he/she is still committed to him/her behaviour I am sure they will not change no matter how hard one tries. In additional, some problems will only be solve when one matured and see things in a different prospects.<br>Is there love in the first place? Is it more of a lust to love? afterall, u two have not met before at all... well by the way, how old are you and her?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>From a guy's point of view, i can understand why you are so smitten with her because we feel attracted to girls who seem to be in a different world from us. At the start, everything will be nice however after some time when they start showing you little attention, stop picking up your calls, not replying your smses, you will start being dejected and wondering why she prefers her friends over you.<br>You sound like a nice guy and from your judgement there is a nice gal inside waiting to be rescued which might be why shes staying away from you because she is unsure herself whether she wants to change her current life. I feel that you need to wrap up your feelings first and try to learn more about her past and present lifestyle. Have a heart to heart talk with her and try to convince her that you are sincere about helping her. However if she refuses to help herself then you should just stop wasting your feelings and time on her.</div>

I had same thought with you that time. Same story, same excuse, same promise... all this things will lead you to deep painful hell. My only advice is that DON'T TRUST her. You will end up with depression and she never care about you and what you have done for her. She might treat you as an idiot behind you.</div>
