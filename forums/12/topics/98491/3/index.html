In as much as you care enough for a person, you do not want to give them money until you know that the money will be put to good use.  In this case, <strong>you really dont know </strong>what she will do with the money. You may just be encouraging her to continue living in this irresponsible manner for longer!<br><br>The key here is, <strong><span style="color: red;">you really dont know</span></strong>... . you dont know alot of things about her, about the TRUTH of her situation, about what she thinks or even about the truth behind those innocent eyes... <strong>there are plenty of people with that look but <span style="color: red;">no WILL </span>to do anything  about it</strong>.  That is a sad sad fact about life, which is why there are so many nasty people in this world.  We all had that innocent look once upon a time and only very few managed to keep that innocence though out their lives!<br><br><blockquote><br>if i am not in love wif her...u think i be with her in first place??<br><br>sometime i also dun understand how i feel...i feel so useless...if i was able to lend her the whole lump sum in the first place...she wun have to be with tt guy... </blockquote>Sorry but I need to know what is your concept of love?  What is it about her that you love?  Love is not just an emotion, contrary to popular beliefs... true love actually have reasons and basis for that love!  this may sound funny and <strong>UNromantic</strong> that this is really what love is!  Sorry mate but I am not sure that you actually love this person.  You are obviously attracted to her, nothing wrong with that but it is also clear is that like many man (and man from all ages) unconsciously you may be role playing a guy coming to the rescue of a damsel in distress.  This is one of the basic reaction of many man, and many man and woman consciously or unconsciouly play this "game" bec the guy feels good to be able to provide and the girl gets attention and sometimes $$.<br><br><strong>it is admirable that you wish to help a person who is clearly in distress and is besides herself at the moment but giving her money is not it.  Getting yourself emotionally and romantically involved is also not it. You cannot help her like that.</strong>   Further, by doing these No Nos you are inviting trouble for yorself.  You are a nice enough young man, there are plenty of other woman who are more stable out there for you to love and provide for.  I am not saying that this girl is not worth it, I am saying that she is not suitable for you (at least for the time being) and there is a WORLD OF A DIFFERENCE so dont misunderstand ok  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Take care<span style="color: #444444;"></span></div>

Dont get even more emotionally involved than you already have bec that will mess up her mind and emotion.  she needs a friend who will tell her the truth who will feed back to her what she cannot see.

Don't push or force yourself if you can;t... Noone is telling to leave her or not.. decision is still up to you.. Eeveryone is jus merely giving their opinion.. Don't take it to heart if they sounded harsh or wat.. cos we are the 3rd person hearing.. we are not you not the girl.. That's why we can do is to give advices.. or solutions to what you can do..<br><br>Match20 jus tried your best to help her in any way you can.. but if you really cant.. then dun force it.. you might end up hurting yourself.. yes.. you may say you dun mind so long she's on the right path.. but this isnt the way it should..Jus becos of one girl and you yourself changed to someone i guess your friends or your family don't even know you..<br><br>You have to be strong too.. You are too soft hearted.. you are too kind.. To easily being take advantage of.. We are jus worried that you might get cheated by her.. Stay calm.. If you are giving yourself too much pressure and stress... you cant even help yourself.. don't say her.. You need to have a clear mind... and think thru.. DON"T THINK ABOUT GOIN INTO A RELATIONSHIP YET!! it's not the time ok.. Take it easy... take it slow..<br><br>If you ain't the one who can make her go the right path.. someone else will do the job.. You might be one of the nice guy she met.. But then again.. she needs to help herself oso.. if she failed to do that.. then that's no point of you helping to start afresh.. cos she don't even give herself chance to!<br><br>Don't get worked up.. Your mind is confused... you dunno what to do.. dunno where to start.. dunno how to help.. If your mind is in such a mess.. you never think of a way to help her.. but coming in here and asking about what you can do.. Go rest.. Concentrate on your work first.. Take a deep deep breath.. Clear your mind.. Sit down and think of what you can do next.. ASk her out or call her.. or watever you think can work.. JUS STAY COOL AND CALM!! DOn't PAnic!!<br><br>Cheers..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
