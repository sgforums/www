You are also easy to manipulate because you have feelings for her.<br><br>You are asking to get bitten and mauled by an untameable person. If parents cannot control her, it is a high probability you cannot control her because you only just knew her.<br><br>Get out quick of the relationship fast because she is like a quicksand and will only pull you into her troubles.

Bear in mind that you are not suppose to chase her at this point of time.. Are you sure you wanna step into a relationship like this.. You know it wont last.. Being together be bf/gf is not important.. what's important now is that you wan her to be good.. don't wan her to go stray anymore..<br><br>You are doing a good deed not only for herself.. but for everyone.. Even if you aren't together but at least you did something good.. and forever she'll remember you for life.. You ain't forgotten.. you wan to be someone she toys around.. and soon not long after.. she totally washed you off her mind.. and leave a deep hurt in you..
