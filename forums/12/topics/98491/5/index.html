But at least I've been through where you've been..?<br><br>I know the 'attachments'... The thing that everybody else is seeing it SO DIFFERENTLY... They might not even get the COMPLETE PICTURE of who she really is... But words of caution... How CLOSE can you get to 'WHO SHE REALLY IS'....?<br><br>May it be that she's 'kind' (by nature?) or just out to use you... You probably can't easily change her... If it has to happen, it would probably be more because of other factors... You step in too DEEP, you might just end up like a bird without wings...<br><br>Well.. Though nothing's ventured, nothing would be gained... Your chances are simply TOO SLIM... RE-COLLECT yourself for better use....

I seldom reply in forum, but this time I hope you will consider maturely before doing any decision.<br><br>If you really want to help her, juz keep advise her, encourage her and guide her, not to give money. Hold on this relationship as you are not ready for this love.<br><br>I seriously doubt that is she the one who i have met before.</div>

At the start, everything will be nice however after some time when they start showing you little attention, stop picking up your calls, not replying your smses, you will start being dejected and wondering why she prefers her friends over you.<br>You sound like a nice guy and from your judgement there is a nice gal inside waiting to be rescued which might be why shes staying away from you because she is unsure herself whether she wants to change her current life. I feel that you need to wrap up your feelings first and try to learn more about her past and present lifestyle. Have a heart to heart talk with her and try to convince her that you are sincere about helping her. However if she refuses to help herself then you should just stop wasting your feelings and time on her.</div></blockquote>Hmm... A Demon? In Devilism, there were mentions of you... But you're probably not of what it's like in there... Probably just a nick?</div>

She don't want to find a job.. she might just have that mentality to continue her current lifestyle coz it's such an easy way out.<br><br>This is why she needed a guy who can give her money whenever she needs. Perhaps she did consider you b4.. but she did some weighing on her own.. so she pick the other guy.<br><br>why hang on? i am puzzled.<br><br></div>
