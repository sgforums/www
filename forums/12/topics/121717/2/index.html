I have this female friend whom I have a good relationship with: she treats me well, we have nice chats from time to time and all that. About 4 months ago i started liking her. About 2 months later she found out from a mutual friend to whom I have told of the crush! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>So since she knew about it i started thinking hey, i might as well make a move.Her response was kind of funny. She seemed very interested at first. Every time I do nice thing she would become very happy and thank me. But abt a month later her interest began to taper off. I think she got bored of me being nice to her and became quite neutral to whatever i did. Sensing this, I decided to back off for a moment, not wanting to do anything stupid.<br><br>3 weeks ago she suddenly seemed to become interested again...treating me nicely and all that. But last few days she return to her normal self.<br><br>To make a long story short, she seems to be blowing hot and cold to me. She can be extremely nice at times and she can be realtively cold at the same time too. What do you people think? Should I chase her or look elsewhere?</div></blockquote>well,i guess she is interested in you...its just that she waited for so long and you did not express yourself to her...and that is maybe why that makes her to be hot and cold to you...you can't expect a girl to be so close and show that she likes you..people will think that she is desperate~ so as a guy..make a move and tell her then see the two of you can make a good r/s ornot lor~</div>

These mind games are killing me. She knows I have some feelings for her, yet she's not handling the situation responsibly, IMHO. Like means like, dun like means dun like. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> Furthermore, she has said things like she has never liked a guy in her life. Assuming she's not lesbian, this hardly makes sense(she's already 20 for god's sake!<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> )<br><br>I think it's probably best that I treat her as a friend at the moment. In the meantime, I'll be on the look-out for other girls. I've wasted too much time figuring out where i fit into her life. Guess I better spend more time figuring out where she fits in mine.<br><br>Btw, one last question. Supposing one day I think that she does like me. Do you think I should confess to her or should I let her make the first move. Cause she should know by now that I like her, so no point for me confessing anymore, rite? </div></blockquote>BE PREPARED FOR THIS. It's quite unlikely that she'll make the 1st move UNLESS you can REALLY SWEEP HER OFF HER FEET (which is also quite unlikely to begin with?).<br><br>She LIKES INTELLECTUAL and BRAIN GAMES.<br><br>IMHO. If you think you can't handle that her, OPT OUT. From what you've mentioned... I can almost assure you, she's not the type of girl you'll be looking out for (at least not at this point of your life).</div>
