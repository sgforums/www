For example i sms her a couple of times weekly and call her every now and then.<br><br>Maybe I'll give some background abt her. We are both first year university students. Neither of us has ever had a bf/gf before (for ur info i went to a all-boys school in my teens, didnt mix much with girls then) Her opinion on boy-gal r/s is very conservative, while I'm more "modern" so to speak. Her good friend told me dat she seems to hav some interest but may not want to start a r/s right now. But i'm not sure if i can trust wat the fren is saying. I mean she might be conservative but if she knows i like her will she still behave like dat? I'm beginning to think dat she doesnt like me, or maybe there's something holding her back. Btw, she has been talking about what i did 4 her to some of her closer frens, i know coz they told me. Like when i give her something or do something for her etc. But she has ever told me once before that she has never met any guy in her life that she has liked(in the romantic sort of way). I wonder if dis is her way of hinting dat she doesnt like me?<br><br>People have joked dat she n i are a couple but her response is rather neutral - just a light smile.<br><br>Donno if it's relevant but were're from different backgrounds - I'm from an English speaking background while she is from a Mandarin-speaking background. When we speak to each other we use mandarin coz she does not like to speak in English to friends. We have different tastes in music and tv shows - she likes chinese music and canto shows while i don't watch canto shows at all coz my canto simply sucks.<br><br></div>
