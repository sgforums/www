She should be like her mum and bro... just be cool about it. No need to go crazy about it. No need to take any action.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i think its not normal to for your dad to take ur private belongings and who knows what he will do next.....it is best to monitor the situation and lock your door at night.if seriously try to do funny things...talk to your mom first and if nothing works out,police is the only issue....hope it helps.i believe right now u r still young now but who knows in the future???</div>
