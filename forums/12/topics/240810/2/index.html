Perhaps weekend working can help to increase your money and maybe find a way to move out?<br><br>Its very hard to just simply tell you what you can do or what options you have.

I think I will hate it for even tinking abt dis... but since yr mum dun really care, yr brother can't do much, and yr dad saying you r all <span style="color: red;">FAMILY</span>, then you can also take their things for usage. Like your mum's Beyonce songs, or yr bro's books, or yr dad's money to buy undergarments for him.
