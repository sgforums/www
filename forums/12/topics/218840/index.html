            <div class='col-md body'>A few months back ago i posted on our break up and nw we nearly patch<br><br>The story begins like this ... yesterday was her sister birthday , and she invited me over to her house for the B`day party . After that we decided to go over the playground near her house from 10 pm to 12 am ++ at there i give her a heart-shaped bottle with handfolded straw-hearts and stars and i hugged her too after that as it was late i decided to stay overnight at her house with my 2 friends and her family members spend the whole night watching television till dawn and i kissed her 3 times .<br><br>The problems begins here , soon she told me that she got a bf who is 3 yrs older den her (girl 15 , me 15 , boy 18 ) they stead for 20 days only and that guy always wanted her to drink with him and even asked her for sex but she rejected and she say that guy like forced her to stead with him and saying buy wad diamond ring  .That guy soon learnt that i am trying to get her back and maybe scared to lose her he used this "smart" trick. His trick was jus now <span style="color: red;">4.21 pm</span> he smsed her tat he is going for his swimming lesson and on<span style="color: red;"> 4.52 pm</span> he sent his brother to sms her that he nearly drown after swimming for <span style="color: red;"> 50 rounds </span> on the BIG pool i wonder how powerful this person is to swim 50 rounds from 4.21 pm to 4.52 pm and later she called my hp and soon after we have a conference and that guy does'nt know i am inside and tat guy confessed that he was wrong to lied to her and he ACTUALLY CRIED and it was so fake . He keep saying sorry but she jus say she wanted to slp and hang up the fone . Her cousins were in the conference also and they supported me to patch back with her but she send me a message saying that now she is still struck in the middle between me and that b@stard guy who cheated her . And i think that guy send his friends to convinced her to forgive him for lying (wad a loser..zz)<br><br>I really wanted to save her from that beast and prevents her from drinking anymore it really hurts my heart. Now can anyone give comments on this and opinions on what should i do? thanks   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
