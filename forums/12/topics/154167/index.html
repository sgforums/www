            <div class='col-md body'>i'm a sec 4 boy in a neighborhood sch. I have a problem.<br><br>Basically, I'm in my graduating yr n i think i lyk tis girl frm sec 2. We don't know each other in fact. Never even spoke before. But the more i see her the more i felt i lyked her. I didnt let anybody know about it, onli 2 trustworthy friends. They both said that she looked just normal n ok, but to me she looks chio n special.<br><br>Anyway, last week, i decided to take the intiative n added her in friendster n msn messgr. i also chatted with her. i approached her in msn with the intention of making friends with her. However, she doesnt seem interested. Everytime, it seems to be me making the initiative to tok, she just listens and offers short n curt replies. Also, i'm running out of topics cos i dun know her well and i don't know wad she likes. 1 of the friend who knew this suggested that i ask for her number, but we haven even met face-to-face, i felt it would be too fast tis way. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>is there advice to help move this 'internet acquaintanceship' forward?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'd say, be friends first.  Don't be hasty especially when it comes to crushes.  U need to get to know her better before trying to confess anything to her.<br><br>Invite her out for outings with ur friends.  Or go out with her and her friends.  See what she is like among friends, that way u can understand her better.  You should only get into a relationship if u know her well enuff.  If u're not even friends with her, how would u know ur relationship wont give u problems?<br><br>Just be friends, for now.  Let fate decide the rest.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think its would appear strange to her at first to have a stranger suddenly talking to her in msn. but I think since she has approve your msn request that means at least she is willing to chat and make new friends. Its really best not to appear very desperate to her.<br><br>Chatting to her about school work as a start. haha then proceed to finding out whats her interest, then talking about something girls like to hear also would be good. For example if she likes travelling you can talk to her about countries that you went before in msn. Make an impression of yourself to her first before asking about personal questions. After a while when chatting is smooth and happy then ask for her number bah.<br><br>Maybe you are asking alot of questions that seems intruding to her thats why she reply in short and curt way. I dun think she will give you her number if you ask for her number now.</div>

Either you go directly up to her and confess to her or just continue with your own life. It seems to me she's not interested in you. It's better to have a proper ending rather than leave it dangling, especially if you are leaving your sec school soon.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
