              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Hello Singaporeans,</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">I just got scammed for a small but not trivial sum of money
                  from a "friend" that I trusted, he borrow $170 from me but never pay
                  back and become uncontactable. Technically, he buy an item from me for $170,
                  but after taking the item he say he no money, and will pay back later during
                  payday. Eventually, he delay and delay, month after month, until one month he
                  just disappear and stop replying. But he's still alive, messing around on
                  Facebook.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">This scumbag scammer's name is Mervyn Tan and his Facebook
                  name is Ahmole Mervyn. His handphone number is 94789974, but I keep messaging
                  him on whatsapp, iMessage, even call him, no reply.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Proof:</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Seems like new user cannot post proof or images.
                  :/</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">It's very irritating, throughout this 3-4 month he pretend
                  to be my friend, gain my trust, tell me about his life (basically he is very
                  despo for girlfriend, single all the while. But seeing his character now, what
                  a scumbag cb he is, well that explains why nobody wants him. A terrible person!),
                  even tell me that his best friend is actually extremely rich, the son of Koufu
                  CEO Mr Pang Lim!! Wow! He tell me about how jealous he is of his friend and
                  always go out with him for his money and to be treated to good things. Damn, I
                  should have smelled a rat about his character when I heard things like this.
                  But I didn't expect he would go so far to outright betray me like this! </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">I am currently serving my NS now... when I go in BMT, and
                  come out of BMT, he still have not paid me, in fact gone uncontactable! NS pay
                  so low... like peanuts, and he would still do this to me as a friend, WTF! This
                  scumbag scammer himself ownself working part time job already, while I'm stuck
                  in NS, and he won't do a brother a favour, instead try to scam me who help him
                  so much and give him so many chance. I feel very upset.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Is there any way I can get my money back from such a low
                  morals singaporean like this? I don't think I can call police, I don't think
                  they can do much.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">I was thinking of trying to contact Koufu CEO and tell him
                  about how his son is mixing up with bad company, but I don't know his son's
                  name, and I can't find it on google. I really don't know what to do, so I come
                  to online forums to ask for help.</span></p>
