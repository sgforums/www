It is a taboo in most societies and a criminal offence and an impediment to marriage in most countries, as well as being opposed by most modern religions. But <strong>the exact definition of what is a "close family member" varies widely</strong>: some jurisdictions consider only those related by birth, others also those related by adoption or marriage; some prohibit relations only with nuclear family members and ancestors or descendants, while others prohibit relations with aunts and uncles, nephews and nieces, and <strong>cousins as well.</strong><br><br>Anthropologists have found that all societies place restrictions on who one may marry. Although marriage should not be confused with sex, many societies only permit sexual relations within the bounds of marriage--hence, their rules regarding marriage are the same as their rules regarding sex. And in other societies, where sexual relations are permitted outside marriage, persons prohibited to marry are most often (but not always) also prohibited to have sex. Sociology generalizes these marriage restrictions with the terms endogamy -- the group within which one must marry -- and exogamy -- the group one must not marry</span><br><br>i dont encourage u to have babies with ur cousin cause i have heard of a couple almost like urs (they are cousin, but their surnames are different), they have 4 child (now adults) .. 3 of them are blind .. the remaining n youngest one has become a doctor .. the parents have lead a hard life to bring up the 4 child ... realli feel sad when i heard of these things when they could be prevent .. juz hope that u will think twice be4 having children ...<br><br>Marriage n love between cousin is another issue ..so i also dunno whether it's right or wrong... should u do it or should u not do it .. but then be prepared to face <strong>very strong opposition </strong>from ur relatives since both of u have the same surname ...<br>hope that i have help u in ur decsions ..</div>
