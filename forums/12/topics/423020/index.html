              <p>Hi everyone</p>
              <p> <br>i am confuse over a woman. This is how it goes, initially for the first 2 months, she will sent me sms or chat online with me every single day.<br>Till we finally met, i swear i did not gave her a bad impression during our first meet up. Note:before that we have already see each other on the photo.<br>But after our first meetup, i am beginning to realize that our friendship is beginning to distance away, such as she told me her exam is coming.<br>Fine, I am totally cool about it, and even help edit her assignment and concern over exam. Worst at one time, i was asking whether i can be of any help to her, and she says sarcastic remark on me saying can i take her exam on behalf of her?<br>I was totally piss off, and told her off and she apologize saying shes stressing over her exam. Ok cool.<br>However after her exam, i tried to initiate talks with her like the good old times, but it didnt turn out the way that i expected, and is even worst she started to not reply to me a few times.<br>I was thinking to myself, is she taking me for granted?<br> <br>I tried clarifying with her and ended up she said when she in the mood to talk then she will talk, but naturally i do not like her answer as i told her how would i know whether she is in a good or bad mood, i am not a mind reader.<br>And she said im sensitive? i told her im not sensitive and why dont she put herself into my shoes and she how she feels. Crap.<br> <br>Lastly i told her i aint gonna initiate talks with her anymore, until shes in a "good" mood to talk, then we talk, and all her responses throughout are Fine..and Sorry, which i dont like to hear that, cuz that is cheap word.<br>but i already deleted her contacts cuz i really feel is a waste of time.<br> <br>Pls kindly advise, i really dont know whats going on.Thank You.<br> <br>Regards<br>Strife</p>

              <p>For us gal, especially in our teens, our temperment can fluctuate up and down like a cycle within second. And we can be nasty when our period arrive, where hormone change for the first few times can totally irritate us, then suddenly, we find we are going out or chatting with the wrong guy, with such uncertainties in our teen, we tends not to get involve in relationship other than some free tuition which is expensive.</p>

              <p>be it you like it or not.</p>
              <p>humans generally make their judgement based on the 1st impression on the potential of them as sexual/relationship partner.</p>

              <p>look for a better tree in the forest lah. perhaps not better, but at least one that suits you more lah.</p>
              <p>imagine if the two of you managed to commit into a relationship, ask yourself, is she someone you could be with, for the next 10, 20 years?</p>
              <p>can you stand her neurotism? if you can, go for it. if you can't, just abort and save yourself alot of trouble.</p>
              <p>its very stressful on your mental health when you have to fight a cold war every few weeks, without even understanding why she started the cold war.</p>
              <p>Its less painful to not jump into the relationship at the start, then to pull out of a soured relationship.</p>

              <p>actually I don't quite understand why is there a need to "cut losses" or decide on whether to give up or not give up the girl???</p>
              <p>i mean... you are not yet attached, she is not yet attached... as long as that is the case, you can always go ahead to go after her ... AND at the same time, still have the rights to go after the rest of the 3 billion girls on this planet without feeling guilty that you are cheating or two-timing or anything..</p>
              <p>so i say.. go on to test test water in your relationship with her.. but dont have to invest all your time to her alone</p>
