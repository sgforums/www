              <p><br>Since she likes to have dinner with your family so much, why don't you bring her home for dinner often?</p>
              <p>But I know that's not the real reason why she is picking on you.</p>
              <p>Ask yourself this question, how long has she been together with you already?</p>
              <p>When do you want to propose and marry her?</p>
              <p>So long together already still don't want to marry her, of course get picked on lor.... <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>For my brothers and sisters they also don't bring their partner
              along until they are married. Want to hear views of couples out
              there...am I just being stupid to have this kind of thoughts ?</p>

              <p>seriously i don't get the logic that it's only appropriate to
              bring her home for reunion dinner after you guys are married.. what

              <p>My girlfriend quarrelled with me that for the past few years I do not include her in for our family reunion dinner and also when go visiting we do seperate visiting (she follow her family, I follow my family) and not as a couple. Her family always extend their invites to me for all their reunion dinner but she said my family does not do that.</p>
              <p>I don't know if it is me but I explained to her I feel that its only appropriate to include her for reunion dinner after we got married or when we planned to get married. Now I want to include her she also don't want to come. That creates an uproar that she want to break up with me =(</p>

              <p>You don't have to be married to bring her for reunion dinner; u mean she's not important enough to attend ur family reunion dinner when she's only ur girlfriend? Not say u must really bring her la, but if she doesn't mind and if ur family don't mind, why not?</p>
              <p>I have a cousin who brings his girlfriend to our relative's funeral lor. That one is I feel really weird.</p>
