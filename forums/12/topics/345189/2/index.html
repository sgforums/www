                              My girlfriend quarrelled with me that for the past few years I
              do not include her in for our family reunion dinner and also when
              go visiting we do seperate visiting (she follow her family, I
              follow my family) and not as a couple. Her family always extend
              their invites to me for all their reunion dinner but she said
              my family does not do that
              <p>I don't know if it is me but I explained to her I feel that its
              only appropriate to include her for reunion dinner after we got
              married or when we planned to get married. Now I want to include
              her she also don't want to come. That creates an uproar that she
              want to break up with me =(</p>
              <p>For my brothers and sisters they also don't bring their partner
              along until they are married. Want to hear views of couples out
              there...am I just being stupid to have this kind of thoughts ?</p>

              <p>If you don't want her to feel like part of your family. Then don't bring her along. But after married.. you better not complain that she behaves like an outsider.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If I am your girlfriend.. I will not marry a guy like you.</p>
              <p>Just because your sister and brother do that does not means you must follow their backside. Don't you have a mind of your own ? A weak minded man.. is very unattractive.</p>
              <p>Unless it's your family's rule that you can only bring your spouse... and by breaking that rule.. you will incur the wrath of your parents.. ... but if no one is complaining you bring your girlfriend along.. then it's really stupid of you to make this into a big issue.</p>
              <p>You are setting a rule upon your girlfriend.. that nobody other than yourself cares about. That's just dumb.</p>
              <p>But women are like that.. by the time they make a big stink about the issue.. even if you give them .. they also don't want already.</p>
              <p>Because they want to FEEL GOOD about it when they receive it. Once the good feeling is gone.. no matter what you do.. it ain't gonna be good enough.</p>
              <p>So that's why when you deal with women.. always "strike when the iron is still hot".</p>

              <p>Anyway.. since you already realized your mistake.</p>
              <p>The next time your family reunion comes about just extend an invitation to her.</p>
              <p>If she is still angry with you and refused to accept. Then just say this</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Dear, I'm sorry I behaved like an insensitive jerk about this reunion dinner thing before. It was a stupid mistake on my part. I ask for your forgiveness. Let me know whenever you are no longer angry at me, I will be most happy to attend the dinner with you by my side."</p>
              <p>Then to show how important she is to you.. if she don't go.. YOU don't go. A small sacrifice to make this time.</p>
              <p>You miss out one year of family reunion ain't gonna kill you. You will gain her love points that will boost respect for you in her heart .</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Remember.. your male pride/ego ain't gonna cost you a thing if you let it go once a while. But when you hold on to it too much.. it's gonna destroy everything you've got.</p>

              <p>TS,</p>
              <p>About this matter, it all depends on a few factors:</p>
              <p>1. You and your gf's age (I refer her as gf as this was an issue when she was still just ur gf) - in this case, i assume both of u weren't that young when u got together (since u've just proposed to her) so it's not really an issue</p>
              <p>2. Seriousness of the relationship then</p>
              <p>3. How u felt towards her then</p>
              <p>4. How she felt towards u then</p>
              <p>5. Both sides' family culture/custom when it comes to reunion dinners</p>
              <p>From what I see, perhaps there is a disparity in your opinions and hers because u were just not ready to deal with it? Some reunion dinners consist of the ENTIRE extended family and relatives and that can be daunting. Or ur family just doesn't have the habit of bringing girlfriends/boyfriends over? To each family its own. Or because you simply didn't feel as deep about her as compared to her feelings for u back then? Or maybe u were unsure about how ur family and ur gf would get along? Not ready for it? Too young? And I think u don't see it as an act of love whereas she does.There are so many reasons.</p>
              <p>And there's nothing wrong with that. It takes two hands to clap. She was so eager to go to ur family's reunion dinner but u weren't comfortable. That's all there is. Even if she wasn't happy, she has to respect that. Maybe she feels insecure cos' u didn't want to bring her over. But that was over. She's now ur fiancee, and I think she should be feeling more secured about how u feel towards her since u've just proposed right?</p>
              <p>Now u gotta ask urself why u don't feel comfortable with having her over for reunion when she was just your gf. Perhaps u are the kind of guy who isn't frivolous and feels that u need to be absolutely sure before u take a course of action. In this case, u feel that only after u've made the commitment to propose to her, then u feel it's appropriate to bring her to ur family's reunion dinner.</p>
              <p>You following ur bros and sis doesn't mean u have no mind of ur own. It simply means u agree with the 'custom' in ur family to bring only fiancees and wives/fiances and husbands to an event u deem as important as a reunion dinner. U sticking to ur opinion about this demonstrates that u HAVE a mind of ur own. Unless of cos u falter when she questions u and u lie about it. Tell the truth to ur fiancee and don't give stupid excuses just because she's upset. Women will get even more upset if they feel that u're not telling the truth or just saying something to appease them.</p>
              <p>I feel that she's making a big fuss. Now that she's accepted ur proposal, she's suddenly making a tantrum about refusing to go to ur family's reunion dinner when logically, being a fiancee gives her MORE reason to attend as compared to being a gf as she'll very soon be an official part of ur family.</p>
              <p>How u handle ur conflicts with her now will set the tone for how u handle conflicts with her as husband and wife. So tread carefully and have a good talk with her. Hear her side and make sure she hears yours. However, after that, please do reassure her a lot and work hard to make her feel cherished and loved. She probably felt hurt that u didn't want to bring her over for reunion dinner back then and thus felt less cherished and loved.</p>
              <p>Hope this helps.</p>

              <p>i think you guys are stupid,reunion dinner are meant for family members and it is a tradition.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>she has her own family member to have dinner with, and furthermore, she does attend special occasion of TS family...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i think this kind of girl should be dumped for not being understanding enough and acting like a total biatch. for those who supported her, i guess you're just ungrateful children who puts your relationship ovr your family.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>this is what they say "as children goes into a relationship, they start to forget about family"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>what an idiot. even friends are more important than your girlfriend, girlfriends come and go, true friends don't and family don't.</p>

              <p>Hey dude, have you considered this possibility:</p>
              <p>if a girl wants to leave you, she will find the lamest of excuses to nitpick on you, quarrel then later she will tell you, "Im sorry, I don't think we have chemistry at all"</p>
              <p>I, for one, don't believe in the shit she is telling you. I may be wrong of course. I always believed in this: if a girl likes you, she will do anything for you. if she don't, she wants nothing to do with you, including not accepting you treat her a meal unless of course you are talking about a leecher.</p>
