              <p>My girlfriend quarrelled with me that for the past few years I
              do not include her in for our family reunion dinner and also when
              go visiting we do seperate visiting (she follow her family, I
              follow my family) and not as a couple. Her family always extend
              their invites to me for all their reunion dinner but she said
              my family does not do that.</p>
              <p>I don't know if it is me but I explained to her I feel that its
              only appropriate to include her for reunion dinner after we got
              married or when we planned to get married. Now I want to include
              her she also don't want to come. That creates an uproar that she
              want to break up with me =(</p>
              <p>For my brothers and sisters they also don't bring their partner
              along until they are married. Want to hear views of couples out
              there...am I just being stupid to have this kind of thoughts ?</p>

              <p>My sis is returning from Australia for a vacation here with mum. The 3 of us are meeting up for 'reunion' dinner. Her bf did not follow her back even though airfares are really very affordable. At the same time, some people may frown, we're not eating steamboat at home nor having Oriental dishes in a decent Chinese restaurant. But rather at an Italian restaurant. It's not even special. I meet my mum weekly for mother and son meet ups at similar restaurants. Just that this time, my sister also joins in. It's only a dinner that can be conducted any time of the year. I believe non of your family members are permanently abroad. No need to wait till the special day. The ultimate point is your formal introduction of your gf to your family.</p>
              <p>Take it easy and explain things to her. Have a discerning mind. Family is indeed important, but at the same  time, you must be able to cater to the needs of sensitivity of everyone as much as possible.</p>
              <p>And before I forget, happy Chinese New Year in advance to you!!</p>

              <p>Aiya some of you misunderstood .When I said i didn't bring her
              for the past few reunion dinner, its when I've not proposed to her
              yet. Now that I've proposed to her and want to include her in the
              dinner, she dun want to come liao and bring up to quarrel that why
              i last time didn't include her when we are bf/gf</p>
              <p>Actually what parn said earlier is true. I take reunion dinner
              as a important thing as its a family reunion mah.Other than the
              reunion dinner, I do bring her back for normal dinner or when there
              is some special occassion like any of my family's birthday</p>
              <p>I know by not including her earlier is like excluding her and
              also its my fault for insensitive. Think its a matter of what I
              believe vs being sensitive...sigh...</p>

              <p>she has her own family member to have dinner with, and

              <p> </p>
              <p>i think this kind of girl should be dumped for not being
              understanding enough and acting like a total biatch. for those who
              supported her, i guess you're just ungrateful children who puts
              your relationship ovr your family.</p>

              <p>this is what they say "as children goes into a relationship,

              <p>I agree. Just a gf only, why she think she so important? Family reunion means what? For family members to gather la. I'm sure TS got bring her for other get togethers, so what's the big deal over the family reunion dinner? Blood is thicker than water...You should ask yourself if she is the one for you, or you just marrying because you guys paktoh so long. Seems so small gas over small matter. She making a big deal over nothing, so don't need bring her for dinner la. Not married already wanna cling to you meh...lol</p>

              <p>So you're sayin, as a gf she has no business in a family reunion.. now that she is the fiancee.. it is obligatory for her to attend his reunion ?  Who wrote this stupid rule , YOU ?</p>
              <p>With the way you think dude.. I'm sorry to say.. you can't keep a woman very long.</p>
              <p>But it's alright, you'd probably have better chance dating another man, who thinks JUST like YOU.</p>
              <p>Good luck with the boys.</p>

              <p>i guess because she feels that she has introduced her family to you because she consider you as someone very important in her life that is worthy to meet her parents and be introduced to her family.</p>
              <p>and on the other hand, u did not do the same thing for her that could be the reason she feels this way.</p>
              <p>i notice u mention that you have already proposed to her is it ? meaning you guys are enaged , so she is her fiancee instead of your gf. so in this case, it's more or less confirmed that she is going to be your wife right? please correct me if i'm wrong.</p>
              <p>so the choice is up to you then.</p>

              <p>So TS say cannot go .. then she don't go.. now TS say must go.. then she must go.. harlow.. you think gf is a dog issit ?</p>
              <p>Ofcors she feels resentful and takes issue when he FINALLY invites her to this "important" event.</p>
              <p>You really think all girls are so gian bng har ?</p>
              <p>If the girl is not serious with you.. or only see you as a temporary or is unsure of her future with you.. you think she will be interested to attend the reunion dinner ?</p>

              <p>If the relationship fails.. she also will feel awkward facing the guy's relatives.</p>
              <p>By inviting the guy to her family reunion dinner which is JUST as important.. she is signaling the guy that " YOU ARE THE ONE".And if the relationship fails.. she will also face the same embarrassment the guy has to go through on his side.</p>

              <p>Reunion dinner is a renunion dinner. It's just another social event. There is <strong>no </strong>such thing as which family reunion dinner is MORE important or whos is LESS important.</p>

              <p> Respect for the guy and his family ?Then the gf's family don't deserve any respect lah ?</p>
              <p><strong>Respect is a two way street.</strong></p>
              <p>If it truly is TS family culture issue.. .then TS should not attend his gf's family reunion dinner while they are just BGR status. Obviously.. TS is a double standard hypocrite. And I have provided him a suggestion to resolve the problem with the love of his lifetime.</p>

              <p>You can argue all you want with me.</p>
              <p>You can insist that part about respect and culture. It doesn't matter to me.</p>
              <p>Because later when you get yourself a gf, and you face the SAME problem, then you go and argue with your gf until the cows come home , about what respect and culture lor.</p>
              <p>Women will get resentful if you slight her feelings.. worst you slight her feelings with what stupid family culture that was never enforced by your parents. And this resentment WILL come back to haunt you , again and again and again.. until you get nightmares.</p>
