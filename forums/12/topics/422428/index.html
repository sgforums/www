              <p> </p>
              <p>I think someone has filled up your position.. What you can't give him, and what he is lacking of.. it all has been filled up. :) He's doing this to you probably because he is placing a little more priority on the "new friend", and left you on the cold. When a guy meets a new "friend", he'll place slightly more priority on that new "friend" because he feels that it might be a better option. It's false hope actually... but he doesn't know..</p>
              <p>Take my advice, leave him alone for a while.. You need to breathe a fresher air. Since you have not have sex with him, you still can break off easily... Trust me, I am in your position before...</p>
