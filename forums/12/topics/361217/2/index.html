              <p>Minigun,</p>
              <p>The practical truth is, money isnt everything. I've been there and know what's it like, to be fetted like a prince, dismissed like a beggar and had to crawl back to where I am to realize this. But who or what I am is not important.</p>
              <p>The important one here is you. I had my share of women in life, to know that there are gold diggers, but more critically, women who are solid pure gold themselves. How much money do you really need? $100k, $1mil, $1bil? Is it ever enough? And for what?</p>
              <p>The reason is only to support a lifestyle.</p>
              <p>Do you need to be fed on abalone daily? I've known of friends who got sick of it and ended up feeding to their pet dogs. Holidays in Rome? Is it any different on TV documentary? Skiing in swiss alps? Trudged up in mud? Havent we have mud in Spore too?</p>
              <p>A porche? nothing more than a box in 4 wheels to get to point A to pt B? Get you to your destination faster, but to do what? Fear crowds and mingling? Do we live on a secluded private island where no crowd exists?</p>
              <p>I will not deny there are women who prefer the good life, but there are women who are  realistic. All such women want is security and your sincerity, to take care of them. Some will not even mind sharing their last piece of bread with you.</p>
              <p>However, you as a man must never take such women for granted. They exist and may be more than you realize. Similarly, they too are only looking for men who will take care of them, love them, cherish them, and never to take them for granted, regardless of his station in life.</p>
              <p>The only problem is you - what are you really looking for? Cindy Crawford ? Paris Hilton? Without which you rather spend your live alone? Or suffer from the fate of fatalism, having low esteem of yourself and believing you are incapable of anything in life except for a small room? Even that, does a small room matters if you are kept sheltered?</p>
              <p>If roadsweepers or cargo hands can get married and have kids, why not you? And where else in this world does any govt pays you money while you attend courses so that you can upgrade and earn more money, nowhere else other than our Singapore society today?</p>
              <p>Sorry, Minigun, I am afraid I cannot rationally accept your excuses. You alone determine your actions and what you want, and its performances determine your rewards.</p>

              like a beggar and had to crawl back to where I am to realize this.
              But who or what I am is not important.</p>
              <p>The important one here is you. I had my share
              of women in life, to know that there are gold
              diggers, but more critically, women who are solid pure gold
              themselves. How much money do you really need?
              $100k, $1mil, $1bil? Is it ever enough? And for
              what?</p>
              <p>The reason is only to support a lifestyle.</p>
              <p>Do you need to be fed on abalone daily? I've known of
              friends who got sick of it and ended up feeding to their
              pet dogs. Holidays in Rome? Is it any different on TV
              documentary? Skiing in swiss alps? Trudged up in mud? Havent
              we have mud in Spore too?</p>
              <p>A porche? nothing more than a box in 4 wheels to get to
              point A to pt B? Get you to your destination faster, but to do
              what? Fear crowds and mingling? Do we live on a secluded
              private island where no crowd exists?</p>
              <p>I will not deny there are women who prefer the good life, but
              there are women who are  realistic. All such women want is
              security and your sincerity, to take care of them. Some will not
              even mind sharing their last piece of bread with you.</p>
              <p>However, you as a man must never take such women for granted.
              They exist and may be more than you realize. Similarly, they too
              are only looking for men who will take care of them, love them,
              cherish them, and never to take them for granted, regardless of his
              station in life.</p>
              <p>The only problem is you - what are you really looking for? Cindy
              Crawford ? Paris Hilton? Without which you rather spend your live
              alone? Or suffer from the fate of fatalism, having low esteem of
              yourself and believing you are incapable of anything in life except
              for a small room? Even that, does a small room matters if you are
              kept sheltered?</p>
              <p>If roadsweepers or cargo hands can get married and have kids,
              why not you? And where else in this world does any govt pays you
              money while you attend courses so that you can upgrade and earn
              more money, nowhere else other than our Singapore society
              today?</p>
              <p>Sorry, Minigun, I am afraid I cannot rationally accept your
              excuses. You alone determine your actions and what you want, and
              its performances determine your rewards.</p>

              <p>The reasons why it reminds me of government propoganda / speeches:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1) "Do you need to be fed on abalone daily?" - don't have to buy branded stuff, go for cheaper generic no name brands. It's all the same.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Minigun,</p>
              <p>The practical truth is, money isnt everything. I've been there
              and know what's it like, to be fetted like a prince, dismissed
              like a beggar and had to crawl back to where I am to realize this.
              But who or what I am is not important.</p>
              <p>The important one here is you. I had my share
              of women in life, to know that there are gold
              diggers, but more critically, women who are solid pure gold
              themselves. How much money do you really need?
              $100k, $1mil, $1bil? Is it ever enough? And for
              what?</p>
              <p>The reason is only to support a lifestyle.</p>
              <p>Do you need to be fed on abalone daily? I've known of
              friends who got sick of it and ended up feeding to their
              pet dogs. Holidays in Rome? Is it any different on TV
              documentary? Skiing in swiss alps? Trudged up in mud? Havent
              we have mud in Spore too?</p>
              <p>A porche? nothing more than a box in 4 wheels to get to
              point A to pt B? Get you to your destination faster, but to do
              what? Fear crowds and mingling? Do we live on a secluded
              private island where no crowd exists?</p>
              <p>I will not deny there are women who prefer the good life, but
              there are women who are  realistic. All such women want is
              security and your sincerity, to take care of them. Some will not
              even mind sharing their last piece of bread with you.</p>
              <p>However, you as a man must never take such women for granted.
              They exist and may be more than you realize. Similarly, they too
              are only looking for men who will take care of them, love them,
              cherish them, and never to take them for granted, regardless of his
              station in life.</p>
              <p>The only problem is you - what are you really looking for? Cindy
              Crawford ? Paris Hilton? Without which you rather spend your live
              alone? Or suffer from the fate of fatalism, having low esteem of
              yourself and believing you are incapable of anything in life except
              for a small room? Even that, does a small room matters if you are
              kept sheltered?</p>
              <p>If roadsweepers or cargo hands can get married and have kids,
              why not you? And where else in this world does any govt pays you
              money while you attend courses so that you can upgrade and earn
              more money, nowhere else other than our Singapore society
              today?</p>
              <p>Sorry, Minigun, I am afraid I cannot rationally accept your
              excuses. You alone determine your actions and what you want, and
              its performances determine your rewards.</p>

              <p>Well said.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To all the guys out there like TS, I have one phrase for you -</p>
              <p>"If you look in the toilet, why should you be surprised you found shit?"</p>
              <p>Clearly you people are looking for "right" girls in all the wrong places. Or maybe you don't even know what "right" girls are like. And instead of acting like a man and stop looking in the toilet, you like to come here and grumble.</p>
              <p>I am sure we have fair share of materialisic people (men and women included, dun always make as if only women can be materialistic), I am damn sure we have a lot of gold diggers girls out there, but there are at least as many good women as there are bad women out there.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for you whiners, I think there are more of you than the gold diggers women. You either make a decision to stop looking in the toilet, or you can continue to eat shit for the rest of your lives.</p>
              <p>Get it? You're looking for love in the wrong places, in the wrong people, and at the end of the day you only have yourselves to blame.</p>
