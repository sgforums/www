              <p>which part of oz are u in now?yes i know the work experience n excuses they give u.its based on discrimination really.its not that u are underqualified or overqualified…...its lack of jobs really in oz.i have got insider info and how things function in oz n really its not yer fault.ive seen how their culture werks.by the time u get a job or wanna get a job u would have already forgotten bout what it and accounting is.2 years later perhaps but dun bet on rmeberin everything u did in past.</p>
              <p>perhaps oz isnt as attractive to england both in terms of future etc.scholarship is one thing work future is another.</p>
              <p>many come to oz and many also left oz.<br>like yer frend who left for scotland…he might not have his PR from oz after that.</p>

              <p><br>I haven;t gone to Australia. I am planning to go to Victoria. Yes there is discrimination but I am looking at this positively to seek open opportunities. It is not very easy to go to England to work citing that the Liberal-Tory government have restricted the flow of immigrants. I don't know if he did have his PR but he is very highly sought after because he is smart. He has had numerous scholarship offers.</p>
              <p>Anyways UK, is not exactly very attractive, weather is cold and the tax 50% is horrible. Even the petrol is taxed.</p>

              <p>Really? Is it that bad? Several years ago when I went to visit Australia, my mother's friend's son was studying there as a gynaecologist. He was a very nice guy, he hardly knew me and yet he allowed me to stay at his place for 2 weeks. Unfortunately, he decided to go to Scotland to further his studies. So I lost a very important contact person n a friend.</p>
              <p>I think I have to start saving money. I suppose I need AUD$20,000 as a started pack?</p>
              <p>I estimate that it will take me 5 months to find a job. I also must find a temporary place because I don't want to pay rental bond (risk of not finding job and end up going back home - bond/deposit forfeited).</p>
              <p>I estimate I need AUD$4,000 a month. (4k X 5 months). Out of that AUD$1,300 goes to rental, $800 for food, the rest transport, electricity, water, heating and entertainment.</p>
              <p>Finding a job is tough especially for new graduates. My ungrateful cousin couldn't find a job after 1.5 years but thankfully for his rich doctor parents, he was able to stay there.</p>
              <p>What is the best tip in finding friends there? Church is a good start. Plus I have some former classmates there (counting out the doctor who lives in Bundoora who is quite secretive n not very helpful).</p>

              <p>Hey mate,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What kind of jobs are you looking for? It depends which city you intend to go to. For example, Brisbane is a tough place to look for jobs but SYD or MEL might be your best bet. Brisbane is more racist than other city in AU.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I cuoldn't find the job in my field when I graduated here so i had to take an average job and work myself up to where I am not, an Analyst.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you share with someone in regard to a house or something. It could be a lot cheaper.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The best way to make new friends is to either join a social sporting team or maybe do a short course. That way, you make new friends and make networks.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you can't find a job straight away maybe to look at jobs as a waiter/waitress or something like that otherwise you will waste your saving. Cheers.</p>

              tcell,
              
              good luck to u.but its best if u had your pwn company like IT and designing software etc to make immigration n life more liveable.accounting isnt much use in oz as they only give selected australians those jobs.havent seen any aisans werkin in westpac or anz......so low chance u will get any job in the banks in oz.
               
              frpom what i have experienced in oz and spore.quality of work in spore using american work shift is more well planned as compared to sporean or australian werk systems.
              
              sporean system is slave driving if its planned by gov and stat board side mainly.
              
              australian system is by far the worse i have come across that actually forces people to work unproductive hours....and fatigue people thru their 90hrs by making them werk 10 days non stop.thois is a common practice....or 6 days non stop and standby duties as well.with with 1 or 2 days rest.the quality life u watched n heard on tv on australians is merely a myth.it dun exist...its all a sham like their million dollar job by sitting down by the beach to giant lobsters...its all a sham n scam.:)what do u expect from genberations of convicts with conmen n rapist dnas???!!
              
              but pay is still better as compared to singapore if u are hardwerking to werk non-stop for 10 days for $6k/mth salary with little or no rest.thats in the technical line with dinosaur equipment.on the whole i think they should have paid me $10k/mth because i dun feel safe with those kida equipment or badly designed machines near me.
              
              so far i have seen that in engineering the australians are light years behind most developed world and like their quality werking life everything is a myth and their system looks kinda badly organised if folks were to look at it from afar.take the flood episode ..the airport near me had to get volunteers to clear their small airport runways because they didnt have the workers needed to clear runway with dirt n soil.so what they did was armed volunteers with jet hoses and hose the runway i=of small airport.it appears they didnt have any people to clear n clean runway....nor do they have the correct equipment from the start.seems rather badly planned but its slright...their methods are similar to what folks would do in africa too.
              
              if u like it this way and $$$$ is yer only motive...australia isnt the place if yer qualifications arent australian and u dont have a license in yer job.itmay be qualified to be the equivalent but most employers want no part of that qualifications.take the billboard i saw a few days ago.it says buy australian and support local companies in oz.that alone already sound like a protectionist act which would sound like they are against foreign goods.so yer degree in its from spore would be likened to a foreign goods stuff n most australians wouldnt support it.
              
              remeber this is australia.....it only recently lifted the white australioan policy and the culture is still kinda stiff and anything other than fish n chips is considered spicy n exotic.....from another planet kinda thing.

              <p>I am not going to Aust for the work quality. Singapore has the best work and efficiant MNC environment. No where can beat Singapore but UK, Switzerland and USA.</p>
              <p>Maybe money is the motivation. Salary paid is quite ok, sometimes lawyer, doctors, accountants, IT, etc all get almost the same pay.</p>
              <p>Reason why I am going is because I am in my 30s and I want to find a wife. Singapore is very saturated, I don't get many chances to meet people. At my church, I am getting frustrated, not many ministries with opportunities to meet women. Anyhow, there are more better guys there than me, so many guys compete for so few women.</p>
              <p>In Australia, I went to the church, there are so many opportunities to meet women, I saw a lot of young migrant single women from other countries. I want to have the chance to start a family, I want to retire in a country where I can relax in a big house with a garden. Not retire in a condo or a flat.</p>
              <p>Who knows? If fail, at least I made some money and come back with more savings. In the end, it is still a Plus for me.</p>
              <p>And I am an australian grad. In addition, my cousin's wife works at Commonwealth bank, so who says there are no Asians working in Aussie bank?</p>
              <p>I am well aware of racism. But discrimination is everywhere, even within your own race.</p>
