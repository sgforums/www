              <p>Really? Is it that bad? Several years ago when I went to visit Australia, my mother's friend's son was studying there as a gynaecologist. He was a very nice guy, he hardly knew me and yet he allowed me to stay at his place for 2 weeks. Unfortunately, he decided to go to Scotland to further his studies. So I lost a very important contact person n a friend.</p>
              <p>I think I have to start saving money. I suppose I need AUD$20,000 as a started pack?</p>
              <p>I estimate that it will take me 5 months to find a job. I also must find a temporary place because I don't want to pay rental bond (risk of not finding job and end up going back home - bond/deposit forfeited).</p>
              <p>I estimate I need AUD$4,000 a month. (4k X 5 months). Out of that AUD$1,300 goes to rental, $800 for food, the rest transport, electricity, water, heating and entertainment.</p>
              <p>Finding a job is tough especially for new graduates. My ungrateful cousin couldn't find a job after 1.5 years but thankfully for his rich doctor parents, he was able to stay there.</p>
              <p>What is the best tip in finding friends there? Church is a good start. Plus I have some former classmates there (counting out the doctor who lives in Bundoora who is quite secretive n not very helpful).</p>

              MAYBE THERES NO FUTURE IN AUSTRALIA REALLY.if yer frend ghoes to scotland it already tells u theres no openeing for him in oz.and hes a skilled medical professional.
                                
                                unless u have a skill or are able to setup yer own production and manufacturing capability making stuff world wants....best u stay in spore and fight it out for many years with the spore gov as i did.
                                
                                yer relative is considered a family unit with mom n dad in oz so as asians from chinese culture it is normal to have children go join them.unless they are some kinda animals where children can live in that country n leave folks alone tro defend themselves.
                                
                                u should not go to oz just as opportunity because they advertised recently about australkias policies in the past on tv and magazines:
                                
                                australia land of great natural resources
                                wide open space with jobs for everyone
                                
                                terms and conditions apply:no asian ,indigineous,indians,chininese ,somoan n  no non white races.

                                if u think oz has a job for u.....then i need to tell u that most of the people here are rich who immigrated.definitely more than $100k or so story.if u goto oz with $20k u need to start job immediately as $20k is hard earned cash in spore.most folks who get jobs in oz either have australian frends in oz or a masters degree doing simple admin jobs from what i have observed.the other asians in oz are not that helpful really if u arent dressed like a millionaire.

              <p>If your profession is not on the preferred skills list, it can be tough to find a job here because you'll be competing with Aussies, residents with PR, and graduates of Aussie Uni's.  Due to a few revisions made re. the critieria for Work Visa sponsorship, it is no longer easy to get hold of an employer who will willingly sponsor a foreigner with no PR.  That is, unless you have skills that are on a priority list. </p>
              <p>Have you sought out a Migration Agent to find out if you can apply for PR whilst in Singapore?  It might be a better option to obtain PR first, then come over to find employment, otherwise, you might end up wasting precious money and getting nowhere. </p>
              <p>As to your cousins' unhelpfulness, if you weren't close to them before you wanted to network because you intend to move here, their seeming refusal to be helpful can be understandable.  I'm not saying excusable, but understandable.  You're right that everyone's self-centered and rightfully so - they are protecting their own interests, but then, so are you, wanting to network for your own interest.  That's human nature.  That's life.</p>
              <p>Being a migrant myself, the possible explanation I can think of is that sometimes, because the PR doesn't come easy and can be a really tedious process, the thought of possibly assisting someone through this process can be off-putting. </p>
              <p>Or, it could be that living here, they understand the situation very well and thus perhaps think that you are not being very realistic in your goal and they foresee that the chances of failing is high, and they don't want to be emotionally involved in an endeavour that they feel will only lead to nought. </p>
              <p>I don't know your cousins personally but I'm just suggesting that this might be what's going through their minds.  When people see someone being very hopeful but very obviously heading towards a full-on collision, and they realise that that person might or might not appreciate practical advise, then they might exercise the option of being reluctant bystanders.  That could be their psyche.  The basic psychological response of, "If I can't do anything to prevent the collision, then I won't get involved and I will look away."</p>
              <p>If you truly want to network with them, you can always come over, establish yourself first, then after the dust has settled, contact them again to meet up.  Then your cousins might be convinced that you really aren't going to make use of them and will gladly maintain contact with you.  Afterall, your cousins are probably intelligent enough to not let themselves be made use of so, prove your real intentions to them.  If they still avoid you at that stage, then I suggest that you look elsewhere for networking.</p>
              <p>As a migrant myself, I hope I have given you some insight into this situation.  Good luck!</p>

              <p>If your profession is not on the preferred skills list, it can be tough to find a job here because you'll be competing with Aussies, residents with PR, and graduates of Aussie Uni's.  Due to a few revisions made re. the critieria for Work Visa sponsorship, it is no longer easy to get hold of an employer who will willingly sponsor a foreigner with no PR.  That is, unless you have skills that are on a priority list. </p>
              <p>Have you sought out a Migration Agent to find out if you can apply for PR whilst in Singapore?  It might be a better option to obtain PR first, then come over to find employment, otherwise, you might end up wasting precious money and getting nowhere. </p>
              <p>As to your cousins' unhelpfulness, if you weren't close to them before you wanted to network because you intend to move here, their seeming refusal to be helpful can be understandable.  I'm not saying excusable, but understandable.  You're right that everyone's self-centered and rightfully so - they are protecting their own interests, but then, so are you, wanting to network for your own interest.  That's human nature.  That's life.</p>
              <p>Being a migrant myself, the possible explanation I can think of is that sometimes, because the PR doesn't come easy and can be a really tedious process, the thought of possibly assisting someone through this process can be off-putting. </p>
              <p>Or, it could be that living here, they understand the situation very well and thus perhaps think that you are not being very realistic in your goal and they foresee that the chances of failing is high, and they don't want to be emotionally involved in an endeavour that they feel will only lead to nought. </p>
              <p>I don't know your cousins personally but I'm just suggesting that this might be what's going through their minds.  When people see someone being very hopeful but very obviously heading towards a full-on collision, and they realise that that person might or might not appreciate practical advise, then they might exercise the option of being reluctant bystanders.  That could be their psyche.  The basic psychological response of, "If I can't do anything to prevent the collision, then I won't get involved and I will look away."</p>
              <p>If you truly want to network with them, you can always come over, establish yourself first, then after the dust has settled, contact them again to meet up.  Then your cousins might be convinced that you really aren't going to make use of them and will gladly maintain contact with you.  Afterall, your cousins are probably intelligent enough to not let themselves be made use of so, prove your real intentions to them.  If they still avoid you at that stage, then I suggest that you look elsewhere for networking.</p>
              <p>As a migrant myself, I hope I have given you some insight into this situation.  Good luck!</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Helo? If you haven't read my other posts, I am a migrant or else I wouldn't bother raising the issue of unhelpful migrants. Getting PR is the least of my problems because I already got the PR. I got in under the skilled migrant. But that doesn't matter because applying for jobs is a whole different ball game. Oz style is very differnt from Singapore style. Have to go thru a lot of recruitment firms, it is much tougher and competitive.</p>
              <p>My cousin of all people should know that I am expecting help, after all we are relatives. My relatives have all been ingrained with the sense of helping each other. My uncles and aunties chip in to take care of my ageing grandmother. We even chip up to contribute clothes we don';t use for one of my uncles who is not as fortunate as the rest of us. Unfortunately, one of my aunties, she didn't raise this cousin with any sense of relative caringness, because he was spoiled and he was sent to international boarding school.</p>
              <p>Well, they can be unhelpful but the moment I am there, I will remember who there was kind to me and who there wasn't. Perhaps one day, my cousin may accidentaly lock himself out of the shower and in the icy cold Melbourne winter, I would be the last person to help him in that case.</p>

              <pre>unless u have a skill or are able to setup yer own production and manufacturing capability making stuff world wants....best u stay in spore and fight it out for many years with the spore gov as i did.
              </pre>
              <pre>yer relative is considered a family unit with mom n dad in oz so as asians from chinese culture it is normal to have children go join them.unless they are some kinda animals where children can live in that country n leave folks alone tro defend themselves.
              </pre>
              <pre>u should not go to oz just as opportunity because they advertised recently about australkias policies in the past on tv and magazines:
              </pre>
              <pre>australia land of great natural resources
              wide open space with jobs for everyone
              </pre>
              <pre>terms and conditions apply:no asian ,indigineous,indians,chininese ,somoan n  no non white races.
              </pre>
              <hr>
              <pre>if u think oz has a job for u.....then i need to tell u that most of the people here are rich who immigrated.definitely more than $100k or so story.if u goto oz with $20k u need to start job immediately as $20k is hard earned cash in spore.most folks who get jobs in oz either have australian frends in oz or a masters degree doing simple admin jobs from what i have observed.the other asians in oz are not that helpful really if u arent dressed like a millionaire.
              </pre>
              <pre>what job did u do in spore?and whats your education&gt;?

              <p>Look I am not saying Oz is going to be plain sailing and dream land for me. But since I got this opportunity I got to consider my options. After all, opportuntiies like this don't always fall on your front porch. You've got to weigh your options and not just write it off.</p>
              <p>I don't expect high flying jobs, I am qualified in both IT and Acctg. I don';t mind having a normal job because I am aiming for the quality of life, the social, the relaxing life and the adventure in a big country. Salary wise, I don't think they will even consider my work experience unless it is Australian work experience so as expected I will be working right from the bottom.</p>
              <p>About my friend, the reason why he went to Scotland was because he got a scholarship to extend his specialist there. Why shouldn't he take it? If I were him I would. Free lodging, free scholarship, wouldn't you want? He is briliant. Melbourne University gave him a scholarship. Glasgow University gave him an even better scholarship.</p>

              tcell,
              
              which part of oz are u in now?yes i know the work experience n excuses they give u.its based on discrimination really.its not that u are underqualified or overqualified......its lack of jobs really in oz.i have got insider info and how things function in oz n really its not yer fault.ive seen how their culture werks.by the time u get a job or wanna get a job u would have already forgotten bout what it and accounting is.2 years later perhaps but dun bet on rmeberin everything u did in past.
              
              perhaps oz isnt as attractive to england both in terms of future etc.scholarship is one thing work future is another.
              
              many come to oz and many also left oz.
              like yer frend who left for scotland...he might not have his PR from oz after that.
