              there are no asians werking in the banks in my region!!AND I SAID IT!

              as u say racism is alive and well but try not to go insane by it  all.theere are people singaporeans who went overseas n immigrated n eventually turned insane.please dun get so wound up as u havent even seen anything in oz really.
              
              i dun think accountants would go anywhere in oz...IT...??how does driving a cab grab u?many have masters or degree from oz and seems like they are not getting employed be it accounting,engineering etc.....there simply isnt much jobs in oz.
              
              but no harm trying if u want to get a gal n get married.
              lemme tell u something.a story from a famous vietnamese aussie law gradute from top aussie university.he graduated in law...couldnbt get a job so he became a sideshow comedian in pubs and clubs.then when he got an opening for a law form as a lawyer n they demanded him to work 60hrs a week....he accepted it and became a lawyer....FOR 2 DAYS ONLY which he quit after that.so he became a comedian for clubs and made his $$$$ and bought a house n had a family with an ang mo wife who accepted him easily. he is about yer age and has a law degree which he only used for 2 days.rest of the time he was like making $$$$ as a comedian in oz clubs n pubs.
              
              im not telling u its a nice place or a bad place in oz.just dun blow a fuse if u dont get a house or dream job etc.many asians might be well qualified but still get lousy jobs because theres no technological advanced indstries in oz.its only digging minerals n service side but if its fated u go to oz n stay there ....then u need not do anything n it will simply fall on yer lap without u doing much of anything.
              
              we are just part of the big picture unfolding in the universe really.

              <p>Then that is good news to my ears because I never plan to go to Australia for the sake of a dream job. I work in a reputable MNC here, and I get a lot of stick from the other co workers, politics and stuff like that. You think I don't get pressure from a singpaore job? Top level wants efficiency but idiotic boss don't provide proper coordination and training and then other people from other department play politics, I don't get any proper cooperation. Deadlines and mistakes, people pointing fingers. I never think it is fun to work in fast pace environment with full of politics.</p>
              <p>That is why I never aim to want to proper job i nthe first place. All I want is something simple. Get me my pay and I go back home, and have a lot of free time and a lot of opportunity to socialise, make friends and meet other ladies to find a compatible partner.</p>
              <p>Why do you want to work in an Australian bank? The envornment there is crazy. My cousin's wife is having a lot of pressure. Don't perform..they just sack you. Star performer, they reward you well. One minor complain from the customer or if you are late in replying to an enquiry, you are toast. Its a good thing no Asian wants to work in an Australian bank.</p>
              <p>Blow of fuse? Why not. So far everything I read is so negative. As much as we have to realistic, I also hate to see how pessimistic people really are. I am an optimist. When I first applied for PR, it took me 5 years to consider. 5 years, I did my homework. I know how the situation is there like.</p>

              <p>Huh? I have on idea what you are on about. I work 5 days a week. 38 hours a week. So I don't know what you are talking about being overwork. Australia has the best system where we get 4 weeks paid annual leave and 10 days sick leave.</p>
              <p>Plus, if you work for the government. You work 9 days fornight meaning you get a day off eery second week but you still have your weekend.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Australia ultimately has the best working system compared to other western world.</p>

              <p>they can't really sack you unless you are so shit at what you do. There are Industrial Laws that prevent company from simply sacking you. They need a LEGIT reason. No matter how shit you are at your work. It is too hard to get sacked.</p>

              <p>The main reason why Asian find it hard to get a good job in AU is because of their skills in speaking English. The Asian with poor english speaking skills will find it hard but for those that speak fluent will find it easy. Personally, I don't have too many asian friends but there are plenty of asians working in high positions with great companies with my mates in BNE.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If your speaking skills ain't that great. Your best bet is in SYD. Cause it seems people don't speak fluent english down there. I went to a meeting and met several people based in SYD and I found it suprisely that a lot of people that worked in the same company doesn't speak good english.</p>

                                                  <p>im in some regional area and found it hard to get a job and i have found out for myself thru asian informers and for myself....even if you are trained in engineering and are the best in silicon valley and even work with NASA type of technology they wouldnt accept you.why????its not that your english is terrible its rather ;like they have insufficient jobs and most folks when they come over to australia like me had a 7 /10 overall IELTS rating!</p>
                                                  <p>perhaps this town is as condemned as the  town structural organisation itself ..........perhaps this explains why they had to get volunteers outside to clear up the flooded airport runway of small debris as they dont have professional equipment and workers to maintain their airports from the beginning of time....seems like they have not much plans from the start to put up a proper system even for their small airport.it tells alot lookin at tiny details.</p>
                                                  <p>there are many asians werking in high ranking companies???if you have a masters degree!other than that i have like  seen many asians with aussie syney or melb IT degree who returned back to spore after gettin married to asian australian wife after being a part time cabby in melb or sydney for 10 years.another immigrated to nz from oz with his beautiful australian wife with 2 kids.he told me he would not want to werk in oz even if they had a job there for him.he was a toolmaker with  many years expertise from spore.</p>
                                                  <p>and then theres the ugly side of racism in my town...i have seen that australian whites would rather get poorly qualified white guys 10 towns away(300km) who is keen on job hopping then to get an asian  immigrant who is trained in engineering ,  with silicon valley technology and and other high tech expertise  who lives next door to their factory  who needs the engineering job .theres also this white guy who lied about being an electrician but still kept his job without having a license ...probably posted in another section that needs no eletrical license.it depends if they like yer face or not which i find it as good as cannibalism at times.im good at diggin out info and thus get to the bottom of most issues. in this town,they dont care if u were trained from NASA or in the  Silicone valley in the usa or speak with an american accent or were educated in Oxford.they will put most asians where they truly belong either as an interpreter for uneducated vietnamese with no english language exposure , flippin burgers  and cleaners.</p>
                                                  <p>there simply isnt much jobs......and that explains their method of werking things.</p>
                                                  <p>in order to get a normal job as in spore u must not only have 7/10 or more in english overall ielts but u must need to sell yerself like a great saleman too!i got 8/10 for my IELTS for my oral english skills  and still went nowhere.they mainly short change u giving u low salary or simply no jobs in thos town that im forced to stay in under circumstances beyond my control.</p>
                                                  <p>however i have learnt to adapt n build my own company in oz.perhaps my true calling is to have my my own company which has better gains then werking for companies in oz.dont depend on australian companies...wont help much as compared to a professional career in spore.in fact they find it an insult that there are other companies overseas that are better than theirs in oz.spore to them is still regarded as 3rd world n most think its still a fishing village.</p>
                                                  <p> in this town im in.......the  mining graduate from local university  with only 2 years experience could actually be a part time lecturer  in that same local university she came out from.shes going to be the one teaching kids and asian students how to run industries with only 2 years of outside working experience.blind leading the blind??probably thats how they run their system in this town...i hope most parts of oz isnt as dumbass as this town im in!</p>

              <p>i used to werk in engineering and on shifts.its like working for 8 -10 days and rest for 4 days or so.their shiftsystem is not meant for humans.appears they havent done much research other than looking at cows n li8vestock for advice.perhaps its this town....i had to leave becasuse some senior white guy supervisor who was known to be a crackpot kept runnin around using his his homemade sword lookin like he owns u or u owed him $$$$.as if its bad enough with badly designed unsafe equipment around i have to cope with unsafe badly behaved white folks around to make things worse.so i left....no point as i have other things better to do than to werk in dirty,dangerous and dark places!</p>
              <p>and the other job is 45 hrs/week in the same factory that i initially took on.</p>

              <p>The main reason why Asian find it hard to get a good job in AU is because of their skills in speaking English. The Asian with poor english speaking skills will find it hard but for those that speak fluent will find it easy. Personally, I don't have too many asian friends but there are plenty of asians working in high positions with great companies with my mates in BNE.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If your speaking skills ain't that great. Your best bet is in SYD. Cause it seems people don't speak fluent english down there. I went to a meeting and met several people based in SYD and I found it suprisely that a lot of people that worked in the same company doesn't speak good english.</p>

              <p><strong>TAXI operators are sponsoring Australian residency for drivers in return for $25,000 payments, a parliamentary committee has heard. </strong></p>
              </div>
              
              <p>Adelaide Cab Drivers Association member Art Dreimanis told the committee drivers were working up to 60 hours a week for less than $500, attracted by deals for Australian residency.</p>
              <p>"It's mainly the Indian community have come over here to build up big fleets that can sponsor people into the country as taxi drivers," he said.</p>
              <p>"One of my sources told me that some of these operators are receiving up to $25,000 from people landing on these shores for sponsoring them in." Mr Dreimanis said the practices stemmed from a lack of investment in driver selection and education and were driven, in part, by an "industry mafia".</p>
              <p>Taxi Council SA says licences have increased from about $100,000 in 2001 to $342,431 last year - increasing almost 26 per cent from $272,340 in 2007. In the past seven years, the number of drivers has grown from 350 to 850.</p>

              <p>At the airport yesterday, taxi driver John Yu said he had been in the industry for 10 years and thought a lack of adequate training was a major problem for overseas students. "They don't get enough driver training so they don't know what to do or where all the different suburbs are," he said.</p>

              <p><strong>FORMER Qantas flight attendant Lisa Robertson, who achieved notoriety after in-flight sex with actor Ralph Fiennes, is homeless and now convicted of assaulting police. </strong></p>
              </div>
              
              <p>A Melbourne court heard the one-time jet-setting hostie Robertson was depressed, bankrupt and had to seek emergency accommodation from the Salvation Army.</p>
              <p>A teary Robertson, 41, appeared in the Melbourne Magistrate's Court yesterday after a violent clash with police at her Southbank home on Australia Day in which she kneed one officer in the groin.</p>
              <p>Police were called to her apartment over an incident involving Robertson and her de facto.</p>
              <p>When the two policemen did not let her see security camera footage of her de facto, she swung her arms to avoid being handcuffed, said Senior Constable Shaun Gunn.</p>
              <p>She backhanded one officer, kneeing him in the thigh and kicking him in the shin, then kneed the other officer in the groin.</p>

              <p>When Robertson was overpowered, she fell on to a ceramic vase which broke and cut her left arm, needing hospital treatment.</p>
              <p>Sen-Constable Gunn said she was later interviewed by police and lashed out again, kicking over a table and kneeing and kicking a third officer in the leg as police tried to restrain her with handcuffs.</p>
              <p>Lawyer Sue Macgregor said her client suffered depression, lacked support and was homeless.</p>
              <p>Ms Macgregor said Robertson's infamy from her mile-high incident made her life difficult and more exposed to public scrutiny.</p>
              <p>Robertson pleaded guilty to charges of assaulting and causing reckless injury to police.</p>
              <p>Magistrate Jelena Popovic convicted her, gave her a 12-month good behaviour bond and ordered her to pay $500 to the Victoria Police Blue Ribbon Foundation.</p>

              <p>During one of my interviews, the lady who interviewed me told me that she wanted a Chinese – why interview me if she have already made up her mind?</p>
              <p>In my previous employment , the meetings were conveniently held in Mandarin, barely an English word was spoken. In my mind, its similar to withholding information from me to do my job. Its also work discrimination at its worse.</p>
              <p><strong>Is  such discrimination only job-related or  are there other variant incidents? Please specify.</strong></p>
              <p>I have been told by my friends in school that Malays are lazy. In which, they explained to me, still under one breath that I am different and I am not a real Malay. Which did not matter either way, as I still felt offended.</p>
              <p>My sister  was told, during an interview by the owner/interviewer, that she did not trust a Malay as an accountant. I have no idea why she interviewed my sister and offered her the job later on.</p>
              <p><strong>Do you think that Singapore has equal opportunities for all as  we are a meritocratic society without giving any preference to any race?</strong></p>
              <p>No. Pretty sad and disappointing to the point of disillusioned. I have pledged everyday earlier in life, “regardless of race, language or religion” and I personally don’t know what to make out of it now. It’s not real.</p>
              <p><strong>Comparing Singaporean and Malaysian Malays, what do you think is the main difference here?</strong></p>
              <p>We, Singaporean Malays often think that Malaysian Malays are less motivated than us. Maybe we have been conditioned by the Media or perhaps trying to set ourselves apart from them to make us look better. My perception changed recently when I came to know a driven hard working Malaysian Malay that is just as motivated and even more talented than any Singaporean that I have known. </p>
              <p>I have long realised even when I was living in Singapore that each community/race has their good and bad. Its the individual that we should judge and not the race/nationality. Working abroad just simply reinforced the opinion.   </p>
              <p>The main difference is not between us and them. We are the same – still human. The main thing that can make a difference is to change our own perception.</p>
              <p><strong>Are you happier now in a foreign country than back home in Singapore? Why so and do you plan to return home some day?</strong></p>
              <p>I am happier living in Australia. I feel I have a better quality of life. Frankly, there is no love lost about leaving Singapore. You have nothing much to lose if you have very little. The ties that bind me are just my family/friends. Nothing else. I will most definitely prefer to be a second class citizen in a foreign country rather than a second class citizen in my own country!</p>
              <p>I do plan to return at some stage as I am very close to my family and now that my parents are getting older, I will like to spend more time with them. Not a single day in my life here that I don’t think of my family. I always feel that I am sacrificing a big portion of my life for the sake of career/better life.  </p>
              <p>I felt that the situation in Singapore is getting from bad to worse. Even if I do return home, it will be very hard to work under the system/policies that I can’t trust and believe. I have heard the same complaints before I left for good. Only know  that now we have the Foreign Talent issues. Nothing changes.</p>
              <p>A lot of Malays told me not to return. If they have the opportunity, they will want to move out of Singapore too.</p>
              <p><strong>What can the government do to improve on work opportunities for the minority races?</strong></p>
              <p>Any changes to be effective should start from top down. The government should be working on themselves first to develop a greater sense of accountability, integrity and duty of care. Just by saying aloud the pledge and then doing the opposite is the biggest hypocrisy.</p>
              <p>I don’t trust them to work on issues of their own deliberate making. They have known this for a long time. They have practised some form of discrimination themselves. The top politician blatantly mentioned that races are not equal. They have created the model for the society to emulate.  </p>
              <p>The only way this government can improve the situation is for them to step aside. Its very telling that their policy will never work long term. Democracy and transparency in Singapore are only lip service. In reality, the two words are just hummed into the media to attract foreign investors. Never for their own people, be it Chinese, Malay, Indian or Eurasian. I think the government has lost its way.</p>
              <p>Don’t get me wrong. I appreciate all  good that the government has done so far but we can’t live life on past glory alone. We need to live on the present and for the future. And presently, its not working. I stop short  thinking about the future if this carries on. </p>
              <p>If the government is really serious, they would have commissioned one of their ministers who has no portfolio to oversee this and create a healthy platform for all Singaporeans to compete/contribute. They could have done this long time ago..littering, spitting, drugs, chewing gums, are serious offences..so why do they need the citizens to tell them how to manage discrimination within the minority? We don’t need special preferential treatment. Just equal opportunities.</p>
              <p>I don’t know what’s the deal about speaking Mandarin to get a job. By the way. English is still a business language. If Mandarin  is the criteria to landing a job, then make Mandarin a compulsory subject and not English. Absolutely ridiculous!</p>
              <p><strong>Do you think Singapore should concentrate  on having one homegenous national race e.g.  Singapore Singaporean than Singapore Chinese, Malays, Indians which does not really help in national identity?</strong></p>
              <p>Of course, in most healthy countries, they do just that. They regard themselves as their nationality first. It certainly does not help in terms of national identity let alone a sense of pride/patriotism if we are always view as a Chinese, Malay or Indian first. Obviously, to have race in our Identity Card is a form of discriminating one race from the other.</p>
              <p><strong>Do you think having specific race-based social welfare groups such as Mendaki for Malays, Sinda for Indians and CDAC for Chinese further segregate the general population?</strong></p>
              <p>Similar to the above. Thats what Singapore is known to do and its their intention to segregate in every aspect. Easier to control when you breakdown to smaller portion. Pretty much science in terms of implementation than anything else.  We can see this segregation from HDB flat allocation and  our educational system.   </p>
              <p><strong>Lastly, what is your sentiment regarding our local Malay politicians? Do you think that they have spoken up for the Malay community in general?</strong></p>
              <p><strong> </strong>I believe Halimah Yaacob has the passion. As far as I can tell, I think she is sincere.</p>
              <p>Its very hard for me to follow the politics from here. How far the rest can go to speak on this, I am not sure. I hope they have tried their best and persevere. Thats all you can do. </p>
              <p>The worst position to be in any party or organization is if you are selected because of your race. Its just as bad as not being selected because of your race.So, I hope the government has selected these politicians based on their merit and passion and not just to fill in the party’s Malay quota.</p>

              <p>Dear Gilbert,</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.transitioning.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/food.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-14644" style="margin: 4px;" title="food" src="http://www.transitioning.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/food.jpg" alt="" width="520" height="300"></a>I am in my late thirties and worked previously as a software engineer for six years in a local company.   I have a bachelor degree in  Internet Science and Technology,  University of Wollongong and  a  advance diploma in Business Information System, Singapore Polytechnic. I also have a diploma in Electrical Engineering, Singapore Polytechnic.</p>
              <p>The rot started when  my  boss started to hire Foreign ‘Talent’ from the Philippines and India. Rumour has it that they are employed because they are ‘cheap’.</p>
              <p>My point is they are just ordinary workers, who need guidance from local staff  doing ordinary jobs that Singaporean PMETs can do. There were locals who came in for interviews but in the end those foreigners are selected by the boss. And mind you the IT Manager who decides who to hire is also a foreigner himself.</p>
              <p>Everyone in the office agreed that these so-called ‘talented’ foreigners are sloppy in their job but they are excellent ‘balls lickers’. They work hard only when the boss is around.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, the company financial situation worsened  and the big boss decided to let go of some staff in order to save money. Guess what? The first batch to let go  consisted of Singaporeans only while  foreigners are all retained. They are cheap I guess and I belonged to the first batch of locals that were retrenched. The last I heard is the company has to close down due to a lack of operating funds.</p>
              <p>And that was last April. Till now I have yet to find a job. It has been 8 long months and I am living on  well-wishers’ loans  to survive.</p>
              <p>Three months ago, I also  sent in an application to  the MOE under their mid-career switch programme to be a teacher. I have the passion and the ability to teach well  as part of my freelance work  is relief teaching. I have taught in a secondary school before during school breaks, taught adults under the NITLP programme  and also conducted  training classes for my ex-employer clients.  I have not been call in for an interview with MOE and I guessed my chances of being a teacher are very slim.</p>
              <p>Last month, I applied for a position with People’s Association as an Assistant Constituency Manager (Wellness). I was called up for an interview and it went well. I was very hopeful with this one as the interviewers looked impressed with my replies. However, again I was disappointed when the rejection letter reached my letter box, without stating any reason. Disappointment turned into frustration when I found their advertisement seeking the same position  in last Saturday’s Recruit section.</p>
              <p>I am not questioning People’s Association rights in the selection of its employees. However what I failed to understand is that since PA and MOE or any other agencies is facing shortage of manpower, why can’t they give the opportunities to fellow Singaporeans out there who is in need of a job for survival? I have no qualms to be put under probation and  if my performance is not up to the mark,   they can  terminate my contract prematurely while still under probation.</p>
              <p>More bad news came when both my parents were warded in the hospital for a few months recently and I am now paying the huge hospitisation debts. Mum got a stroke which rendered her immobile and Dad got a heart attack – all this happened when I am unemployed and there is nothing from the state that I can fall back on.</p>
              <p>My 5-room HDB arrears are getting bigger and CPF Board was unable to deduct from my ordinary account (OA)  for the compulsory Home Protection Scheme insurance. There are no more money left in my OA. On top of that, we have to eat and there is a little girl aged 4 years old staying with me right now.</p>
              <p>Things are getting out of control and I was under depression  because of this.</p>
              <p>I have lost count the number of resumes sent to companies with  no response from any of them. The IT industry, as we all know,  gets alot  competition from foreigners all over the world and I am in my late thirties. I felt stucked in a rut of which there is no viable way of getting out.</p>
              <p>Out of desperation, I sent an email to my MP asking for assistance in job employment and two months later, I have yet to receive his reply besides the one and only auto-reply.</p>
              <p>I have registered myself with the  CDC on the very first day of my unemployment. I was sent for a 2-day ‘Problem Solving and Decision Making’ course and that was the last time I heard from them.</p>
              <p>I got frustrated to the point of harbouring ‘hatred’ towards foreigners when I see them laughing and talking loudly among their colleagues in public places while I, a true-blooded local born Singaporean  who has served NS,   struggled to make ends meet.  It seems so ironical…</p>
              <p>Where do I get the money for my mum’s next therapy session? For my dad’s next appointment at the hospital? For the next meal? Where?</p>
              <p>What right do I have as a Singaporean?</p>
              <p>I hope there will be someone out there with a kind heart to offer some temporary  work to tide over until I get a permanent  job. I need to pay for HPS which is $400+. In case something happens to me, at least my old and sick parents have a place to stay…</p>
              <p>Regards</p>
              <p>Jobless</p>
              <p><em>Editor’s Note: The writer has  finally managed to secure a full time job starting next month but his salary is 40% lesser than his previous job. He has also sent in his CPF statement and MP’s auto-reply but asked that </em></p>

              <p><em>We recently conducted an email interview with a jobless engineer and here is his reply</em><strong>:-</strong></p>
              <p><strong>How long were you jobless?</strong></p>
              <p>I have been jobless for 20 months as of Oct 2010.</p>
              <p><strong>What is your past profession and qualification? Your last drawn salary?</strong></p>
              <p>I was a semiconductor Process and Equipment Manager working with a multinational company.  I have 2nd Upper honours degree in engineering from a reputable  UK university. My annual pay is around 100K. My boss and boss’s boss are all foreigners. My boss has 4 years of working experience whereas I have over 13 years in this field of work. He is definitely not a ‘talent’ in mine and my colleagues’ opinion.</p>
              <p><strong>What problems did you face while searching for jobs? Was age always the problem or are there other reasons?</strong></p>
              <p>Age is one of the  stumbling block for me – even though I have accumulated over 10 good years of working experience and another 20+ years to go in my working life according to the government retirement age.</p>
              <p>There is just no opportunity given to people like me who has crossed 40, even if I am willing to lower my pay by 20-30%.</p>
              <p>Another obstacle is the hiring manager – most of them who conducted the interview are ‘FT”. Personally, I feel that they are gathering information (pay range and knowledge from me), and likely to give preference to their own ‘kind’ (race) or other ‘FT”.</p>
              <p>Even if the hiring manager is a local, there is no guarantee that they will hire a local simply because there is no incentive to hire a local or any quota to adhere to.</p>
              <p>To make it worse, we locals have to fulfil many obligations like reservist training and have to leave office on time or not too late to take care of other family matters like our young children. Where as in the ‘FT’ case, they do not have Reservist disruption and most of their family are back in their country. They can afford to even ‘camp’ in office or stay until midnight.</p>
              <p>You can say that we are not hungry enough to go to that extend. But these FTs normally would stay for 3-5 years and then move on to other better paying jobs in other countries. But we are not likely to do so.</p>
              <p>I have tried to lower my expectations by applying for an engineer’s role – many times the employer would just say they will keep me posted. After a few rounds, I probed further and they told me that with my qualifications and experience I should be looking for a job of a higher level and give other people a chance to apply for lower level jobs. But the question is who is going to give me that chance!</p>
              <p><strong>How did your family cope while you stay jobless?</strong></p>
              <p>My wife is now the sole breadwinner for the family now. I was very depressed at the beginning because I had worked so hard and made many sacrifices to reach this level. Now I just have to accept my predicament and move on, I strongly believed that no one is going to help me if I do not stand on my own feet. So, I just have to find my own way to make money to provide for my family.</p>
              <p><strong>Are there financial problems now?</strong></p>
              <p>Yes, we have financial problems too. We just have to adjust our finances to cope with our situation. We have to make do with what we get every month and try to reduce our expenses to carry on living our life. One way is to look for cheaper alternative for those daily necessities and buy more during discounts and promotions.</p>
              <p><strong>How do you think the government can help this huge pool of jobless PMETs?</strong></p>
              <p>1. The government should restrict the number of foreigners into the country and also set a quota for the number of foreigners for each company, like 25 percent or something. We invite MNCs to invest in Singapore to give us job, not to give jobs to foreigner or act as a training center. This might be a myopic view, but if we cannot feed ourselves do you think we should be concerned about providing jobs for other people?</p>
              <p>2. We should amend our retrenchment laws, regulate the retrenchment compensation and benefits BY providing higher payout to discourage retrenchment exercise and continue medical coverage until we secure the next employment. The current laws are too lax and it doesn’t offer sufficient protection for the PME group.</p>
              <p>3. A possible solution is for the company to reduce the number of working days to ride out any future downturn than retrenching staff quickly because there will always be downturn. Moreover, nowadays, the business cycle is getting shorter and more frequent. The economy also fortunately recovers faster after every downturn. For example, my ex-company after laying us off, was hiring again within 6 months after retrenching staff.</p>
              <p>4. On top of that, restrict HDB ownership to Singaporeans only. If our PRs want to buy properties they should go to private properties. If not, the cost of basic housing in Singapore will go up due to the demand from PRs. The HDB housing is meant for Singaporeans but now the foreigners are pushing up prices with their purchases. With higher housing price, can we afford to live with a lower salary? We have 30 years of housing instalment to pay and it is so difficult to get a job nowadays despite all our qualification and experience!</p>
              <p>Lastly, I hope that the government will seriously look into helping this huge group of highly-educated experienced jobless  professionals. </p>
              <p>Thanks!</p>

              <p>Then that is good news to my ears because I never plan to go to Australia for the sake of a dream job. I work in a reputable MNC here, and I get a lot of stick from the other co workers, politics and stuff like that. You think I don't get pressure from a singpaore job? Top level wants efficiency but idiotic boss don't provide proper coordination and training and then other people from other department play politics, I don't get any proper cooperation. Deadlines and mistakes, people pointing fingers. I never think it is fun to work in fast pace environment with full of politics.</p>
              <p>That is why I never aim to want to proper job i nthe first place. All I want is something simple. Get me my pay and I go back home, and have a lot of free time and a lot of opportunity to socialise, make friends and meet other ladies to find a compatible partner.</p>
              <p>Why do you want to work in an Australian bank? The envornment there is crazy. My cousin's wife is having a lot of pressure. Don't perform..they just sack you. Star performer, they reward you well. One minor complain from the customer or if you are late in replying to an enquiry, you are toast. Its a good thing no Asian wants to work in an Australian bank.</p>
              <p>Blow of fuse? Why not. So far everything I read is so negative. As much as we have to realistic, I also hate to see how pessimistic people really are. I am an optimist.
