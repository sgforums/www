Still in NS that means around 20's? And you are already behaving like you are missing your wife or what.. Anyways, you are supposed to be a man, stop being sissy and crying in toilets. If people are doing well around you and you are not doing as good as them, then whose fault izzit? Is it because of your gf not being around you? Think about it. Doesn't it sound stupid? Can you only perform well when your gf is sitting beside you?<br><br>Alrite, given that you are not able to concentrate at all on your stuff due to your lack of knowledge about where she is, does she know how you are feeling? Does she know that you are suffering so much? If she really loves you then why she is doing this to you? Can't you ask her to keep in touch with you, update you, inform you which days she will be in Singapore and so on, so that you can plan and have at least something to look forward to?<br><br>In any case, you should grow up bro, you can't be weak like this. You should develop more will power and learn to concentrate on things instead of being distracted by other matters. Like this you won't even excel in studies (if you are planning to do further studies).<br><br>Do yourself a favor, be a bit selfish, work hard for yourself first.</div>
