              <p>hi everyone, im 23 years  old. i was a school dropout back when i was in secondary school, I was in the academic stream , i droppedout of school at 15 out of the N/A stream, parents signed me to take private O at a private school, studied for awhile and took up 5 o level subjects, but when exams were around the corner i cabot. Appealed to Moe to take be back in secondary school, sps took me back in, and i chose NT stream. I end up holding 3 N level papers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I cannot  furthur express  how foolish i was, i had opportunites and throw it away + parents support, no right person in the head would do that or throw away an opportunity like that, plus i dont come from a rich family, more or less average.i was a major rebel at the time, but believe me up to this day i regret because i was a dilinquent child at the time, and i learned life the hard way, time flies and everyone else is advancing, i got a lot to catch up on, i want a normal life a good one if possible not just a roof under my head kind, i will not give up now, because i want education to be able to live normally, feed myself properly and be able to show my parents i made it when they are still around.</p>
              <p>everything my parents thought me was right and whatever they said was right, i always had problems listening to authority and following the rules back then, it just seems that everything i do can be related to disaster here, just having fun in life, partly i feel also because of the restrictions in singapore at the time and the laws they have for every single thing, and about anything can get you jailed.</p>
              <p>I enjoyed my youth to the fullest believe me not many singaporeans did so early. i learn a lot of things in life outside of school, to me these are the most valuable lessons. The PROBLEM IS life needs creditions, it needs certifications, qualifications for every single thing, even if its just to open doors for people, or even labour work, or even signing on in the army, civil defence as a fire officer or anything.</p>
              <p>My dilemma now is which is better to study back all over again for my O Levels in a private school or take up a full time course culinary course at SunRice GlobalChef. I have another option, this one lies within my passion, its either i can take part time diploma course in Sports Management or Sports and Science, and study myself at home for 0 levels, killing 2 birds with one stone, as private diploma classes for that field is only held in the weeknds...to cut some time for me to work my way up faster, as of age is 1 thing i know 23 is not too old, but seriously just taking o levels back again now? its been about 4 years that i have not been in school. i want to know what is better, and if if a private diploma cert is any good and worth it? or should i just take 0 levels first? </p>
              <p>Whatever comments you have please kindly share i am willing to learn, any piece of advice will be nice. thank you!!</p>

              <p>At your age, you won't get another chance to go back to secondary school.</p>
              <p>If I were you, this is what I will plan and do. Please listen.</p>
              <p>- Take up O levels sitting in 2014, choose 6 subjects. Meanwhile, get a job so that you can support yourself while studying. I can help you with most subjects, promised.</p>
              <p>- Go on to a local polytechnic, at 25 years old in 2015. Not that old when there are people aged 30 onwards also studying as Year 1.</p>
              <p>Another way would be:</p>
              <p>- Take a private diploma. Private diplomas are decent, probably unable to apply for civil servant jobs, only private sector.</p>
              <p>If you are afraid of the age barrier, then go for private diploma. Afterall, you will still take up a degree next time, privately.</p>
              <p>PM me so I can know more and help you choose better.</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>I believe I am very qualified to advise you on this as I was
              exactly in the same situation you were in. When I was 18 or 19, I
              was very unmotivated, I was in Temasek Polytechnic Business IT
              course and literally skipped every classes and failed all of my
              exams. In the end, I was kicked out of the course. I spent 2.5
              years in NS and after that I was lost. I had no aims, no goals, no
              life. Trust me, if you are not a rich man’s son and don’t have the
              sharp business acumen to start your own business, without a proper
              qualification in Singapore, you would most likely be doing odd
              jobs. In fact, I broke down several times crying while doing odd
              jobs as I thought this the life I was going to lead in future. And
              when I finally woke up and wiped away my tears, I swore to study
              hard with a fiery vengeance. I enrolled in <span>MDIS</span> biomedical course and completed my foundation course
              with distinction. I was amazed what my mind was capable of if I was
              determined to do it. Later on while intern full-time in A*STAR the
              top premier research institution in Singapore, I managed to
              graduate a 2nd upper hons in Biomedical Sciences. I am not trying
              to impress people but what I am trying to do was to prove to myself
              that I am not as dumb as I thought myself out to be. I worked for a
              year or so and some of my professors recommended I go back to
              school for higher studies and thus, I was accepted into
              <span>NTU M</span>.Sc program. It has been a very long and
              tough journey and I really feel you. I felt that kind of fear and
              despair feelings when I was in your shoes and that’s why at 2.30am
              in the morning, I still feel I have to advise you on this. In fact
              coming this far, my hunger for learning has grown stronger and
              fiercer. I hope this would be helpful to you. Don’t worry about it,
              whatever you focus on expands. I highly recommend you take a
              <span>NLP</span> course, because after my <span>NLP</span> course, I felt as I could do 200% more with what I
              have now. Now is the beginning, make full use of it. Cheers!
              (pardon me for the grammatical errors as 3am is not a very
              conducive time for me to check it through)</p>

              Culinary course? I don't think it is a good idea unless you planning to start your own restaurant.
              
              It is tough job to be a chef. You work like 6 days a week, stuck in a hot kitchen for hours. Pay is not good unless you are a celebrity chef. You got to work during weekends, no rest no social life. You want to go out find girlfriend also no time. Work for hotel even worst, got to wake up 3am, to prepare for buffet breakfast...
              
              Better think twice before you want to be a chef.

This is the very first step of growin up by tryin to get out of a crisis.My humble advice would be start from 'O' level first... Dun make mighty and unrealistic 10 years plan . But rather focus what u wanna achieve in short term(1year) by setting up small goals one step at a time. Ask yourself within this 1 year &amp; subsequent years ,what is the maximum hardwork U can put in to catch up with others(etc. work and study). Build your resume with work experience that could win someone who have no experience..(find your direction &amp; market yourself)Ithere are many people completed "o" levels but with no direction in life .(seen too many cases like that)</p></div>
