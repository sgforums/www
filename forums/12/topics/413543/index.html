              <p>Hi, OT, is your friend the same gender as you?</p>
              <p>If yes, you are probably a gay/lesbian, homosexual!</p>
              <p>Don't be shocked! Do read some tips on how to come out of the closet. Be sure to know there is nothing wrong being a homosexual, but to come to terms with it.</p>
              <p>Admitting is the first step, be brave and come out of the closet!</p>

              <p>By "partner", I assume it's someone he will be spending the rest of his life with. In that case, regardless of how fucked up she is, you can't expect him to dump her for a friend, right? Would you abandon a house for a caravan?</p>

              <p><br>One question you need to ask yourself, "DO YOU NEED THAT FRIEND?"</p>
              <p>It would appears that your friend don't seems to need you in this friendship, so "HOW MUCH DO YOU NEED THAT FRIEND?"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My Golden Rule in friendship is "I WILL TREAT EVERY FRIENDS LIKE MY BEST FRIEND", and you may use the same princples in friendship as mine,</p>
              <p>And if my friendship is being abused or miused or exploited or ignored, then I'll know that the problem doesn't lies with me and I will convienently strike them off my friends list as and when I have decided that they are unworthy to be my friend.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My answer to the question that I have asked you is "I DO NOT NEED ANYTHING FROM MY FRIENDS."</p>

              <p>Time for you to look for new friends.</p>
              <p>I don't think there's anything to be angry about.</p>
              <p>A spouse can give many things that a friend cannot. So why should she stay with you?</p>
              <p>Of course, if you're kind hearted enough, you'll stick around. Because if your friend's BF is as bad as you say, then I think she'll be needing some help and support soon.</p>
              <p>So it's up to you.</p>

              <p><br>I don't know what you are trying to do to console yourself.</p>
              <p>But regardless of close friend or normal friend, the basic rules of friendship should still applies to it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why does it have to be your problem if your friend do not know how to be a friend to you?</p>
              <p>Don't you have better things to do with your life?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Be a good friend to all your friends and even if something bad were to happen, at least you can LEAVE this friendship to rot at your own discretion.</p>
              <p>Worry more for yourself and make sure you do all the right things to people, then you have nothing to worry about and fault-less if one day you need to cut them down when they turned against you.</p>

              <p>like some ppl said here, friends come and go seriously... it is time for you to let go... even if yr friend's partner is not good, so what? ultimately it is yr friend's decision, not yours... if you have ten friends and just nice their partners are all jerks in some ways, are you going to scold them and ask them to leave and find someone better? </p>
              <p>i sort of agree with parn that worry for yrself more... not to say becos this world is becoming more self-centered but take care of yrself first before u can take care of others... </p>
