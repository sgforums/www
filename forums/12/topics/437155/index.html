              <p>What is your opinion about revenge? Would you take revenge on someone who wronged you?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If revenge is wrong, then why do police exist? Why is there death penalty in this world? Aren't they getting revenge on those murderers who killed others?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If revenge is wrong, does this mean you will keep turning your other cheek and letting the person slap you? If a person keeps abusing you, does this mean you will continue to let the person abuse you? Ok, you may say that you will report the person to police, but when you report the person to police, you are subconsciously getting revenge on the person because you wanted to see him end up in prison. This is also known as revenge, even though you might deny this.</p>

              <p>revenge i think is generally unnecessary from a spiritual and characteristic pov, but in practice as mentioned, we probably do it in some form now and then.</p>
              <p>death penalty (handed down by the legal system) is not revenge....tis punishment. If u kill someone as punishment because they touch your Ipad, maybe that's closer to revenge?</p>
              <p>If someone keep slapping u and u block...that's not revenge. If it means u have to punch their face in, in order for them to stop, then that's probably not revenge either. If you punch his brains out simply because he accidently rub your cheek...that's wrong. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>There is a Chinese saying "æ€¨æ€¨ç›¸æŠ¥ä½•æ—¶äº†“ã€‚Meaning there is no end to revenge. It may go on and on till you lost track who was the one started first and who had done who wrong in the 1st place.</p>
              <p>Taking revenge is just like a person who is holding a hot coal , ready to throw at his enemy. Before he can throw at his enemy, he got burnt by the hot coal first. It is ok to be defensive but don't be offensive.</p>

              <p>Depends.......you just have to consider the pros and cons.....</p>
              <p>I think you should take into account the greater good of you yourself and also of other people.</p>
              <p>You need to consider your own's welfare and wellbeing also.</p>
              <p>By thinking about revenge, dont you think you are being consumed by hatred ?</p>
              <p>Why not just let it go.</p>
              <p>Imagine all that energy and all that emotion being put into positive and constructive aspects of your life instead. Why care so much about that other person and being so fixated on him ? Isnt it harmful for your own life ?</p>
              <p>So I say revenge is not needed.</p>
              <p>Unless if it is something that is not only related to you......for instance someone wronged your family, loved ones, your friends who you care, or something that is very important as a matter of principle, then maybe yes, for their sake you may need to take additional actions.</p>
