              <p>I'm sorry you feel that way. However, all I'm doing is exposing you for the cowardly macho man you are. If anyone is mean, it is you. You are beyond cruel.</p>
              <p>FYI, I'm not alone. There are plenty of radical feminists like me. We believe children should be treated in a genderless manner so that boys don't turn into Chen and girls don't turn into Xinyi.</p>
              <p>You, on the other hand, are of the traditional high-testosterone type of pathetic male who believes boys should be able to SOMEHOW accomplish tasks that are clearly *beyond* their capabilities. For example, you expect Chen to defend himself against Xinyi, who is so much more powerful than him.</p>
