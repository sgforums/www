Good to see you trying to "educate nice decent chaps (like [yourself]) to prevent them from being hurt by the harsh, paradoxical realities of this world", but unfortunately your observations (perhaps based on your experience) do not offer any practical advice for them to follow up on, should they agree with you.<br><br>Like when you said it only matters "how much she loves u", well, that theory may be true from your standpoint and some would agree with that, but... so what? Can you give any advice to them on how to tell "how much she loves u"? If not, it is likely that they would still end up "being hurt by the harsh, paradoxical realities of this world", with or without your advice.<br><br>This is like the time when I was having this conversation with a guy and he said, "Beware of women who are money-grubbing cheating b itches. They'll use you and they'll leave you."<br><br>"Yup, I'd avoid such women, too. So how do you tell them apart from the good ones?"<br><br>Long pause.<br><br>The guy took a swig and then blurted out, "The hell with the good ones. There are none... They are <span style="font-style: italic;">all</span> cheating b itches."<br><br>It may be advice all right, but there wasn't anything I could use to follow.<br><br>It's not wrong to rant, I myself do it from time to time, too. However, to paraphrase from parn: "...everyone out there walking and breathing has [his] own sad story to tell, there won't be a lack of sad stories. Instead, don't increase the troubles and frustrations of the common people." <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>That's my opinion.

You  expect ppl to reply whether they agree with you or not... This is a place that we come to discuss to voice our opinions.<br><br>you cant start a thread with such sexist comments and expect all who answer your thread to agree and say things like "HAIL PRINCE CUMMING!!! HE IS ALL KNOWING... I SEE THE LIGHT NOW, THANKS TO PRINCE CUMMING!!!"<br><br>If u don't like ppl to disagree with you then don't post ur SEXIST opinions here!!!<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by Yunhaier:<br><strong><br><br>Come on, this applies to guys as well. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You can like a guy for a few years and he never love you ever.

THAT's the difference!!!<br><br>P.S. i emphasised "MOST" because you can never use one theory and apply it to all the femal species or all the male species!!!<br><br></div>
