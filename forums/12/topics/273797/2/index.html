            <div class='col-md body'>Typical of small-time modelling agencies.  They barely survive on the puny low-budget jobs that the bigger agencies won't entertain, so they send people out to scout and flatter naive young girls into signing up &amp; paying to get a portfolio done.. sometimes even convincing these girls that they need to pay further to take "modelling classes".  They've already decided whether you're model material as soon as you've stepped into the agency, but they won't tell you - chances are, u're one of those who look pleasant but not model material, and u never get a call back.<br><br>Real modelling agencies will either talent scout you, or pick you out from the tons of applications they receive.  They do your portfolio for FREE and deduct the fees back in assignments later.  If you know anyone who's keen, get them to do their homework, and then send in their best photos (incl full length) and details to the more reputable modelling agencies in Singapore.  Just a tip - if you have big double-lidded eyes and/or have a pan-asian or caucasian appearance, u instantly have a bigger advantage.  I know it sucks, but I used to work in the industry and the clients would typically specify "pan-asian looking only, don't bother sending any chinese girls!!"<br><br>I strongly caution girls and boys against going for the smaller agencies, because there is alot of crap going on down there - u'll probably get mostly sleazy job offers, like semi-naked male models for hen parties, full day car shows in skimpy clothing for below-industry pay, kinky dance jobs, even escort services.  But hey if u think that's your cup of tea, go for it hey.<br><br>Hope it helps. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dont join! Alot of modeling agencies ask you to set up portfolio. But they only use you when people choose you. So if ppl dont choose you = you waste $500 - $1000. Siaow. Not worth it <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>If you go for the interview, you will see alot of buang-faced ppl there. That means they anyhow ask ppl to go for interview then "cheat" them into setting up a portfolio de. Who knows if they will show your portfolio to the clients also.<br><br>Yea lor. But I know got some other agencies is real de. Not those must pay type. Some pay for you one. But those, the girls must be of gd quality la <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> Like that <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
