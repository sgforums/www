              <p>Just say hello. It's not recommended that you come across as a creep by engaging in staker-like behaviour on social media websites and various electronic communications tools.</p>
              <p>With regards to how to say hello to her. You need to find (or create) opportunities by getting the help of your friend who is her classmate and got you her number. Perhaps go to her class on the pretense of looking for your friend, and get your friend to introduce you in a non-creepy way.</p>
              <p>Don't sweat it if things don't happen, because once you progress to JC or polytechnic, a whole new and more exciting field is waiting for you.</p>

              <p>Hi I AM BACK. There is this girl that i really like in my school
              . She's 1 year my junior and i am sec 4 this year , gonna graduate
              soon. The problem is she dont even know me, and i doubt she knows
              that i even exist, well maybe not that bad i followed her on
              twitter and she followed back. I want to confess before graduating
              and im afraid that i would not have the chance to. I managed to get
              a phone no. through 1 of her classmate whom i knew.</p>
              <p>I can't think of anyway to confess , and i am far too shy to go
              infront of her to confess as it is superr stupid-z. And i am very
              afraid that she'll reject me cos she don't evne know me. I wonder
              how did i even fell in love with a girl that Don't even know me.
              She's just some random girl in my school. She captured my heart the
              first time i saw her which was 1 year ago. It feels like i've known
              her for all my life, yet we are strangers.</p>
              <p>So...  Any suggestions on anything that i should
              do? </p>

              <p>If you're confident of your attractiveness (looks, conversation skills and such) then go confess, just don't freak her out by the famous line "I love you" and all that out of the blue. Something simple like you find something great about her personality or looks or whatever so that you want to be her friend. Take it slow ok?</p>
              <p>But if you are not confident than forget about it already. Not many girls would be attracted to an unconfident guy who doesn't even carry himself well. Just my thought.</p>
              <p>Cheers</p>

If u do well in this task her frens will eventually share more of u to her. And dun straight away get her to be ur gf, be frens first. Since u alrdy got her num its good alrdy.

              </p><p>I hope I am not too late with an advice... You can use this new Facebook app https://apps.facebook.com/shy-tap</p>
              <p>Just find and tap your crush - she won't know about it until she taps you back. So she will know about your feelings only if she has feeling for you too!!! This is SAFE :) Just spread the word about the app among your friends to make sure she uses the app too.</p>
