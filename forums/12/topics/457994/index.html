              <p>Hi I AM BACK. There is this girl that i really like in my school . She's 1 year my junior and i am sec 4 this year , gonna graduate soon. The problem is she dont even know me, and i doubt she knows that i even exist, well maybe not that bad i followed her on twitter and she followed back. I want to confess before graduating and im afraid that i would not have the chance to. I managed to get a phone no. through 1 of her classmate whom i knew.</p>
              <p>I can't think of anyway to confess , and i am far too shy to go infront of her to confess as it is superr stupid-z. And i am very afraid that she'll reject me cos she don't evne know me. I wonder how did i even fell in love with a girl that Don't even know me. She's just some random girl in my school. She captured my heart the first time i saw her which was 1 year ago. It feels like i've known her for all my life, yet we are strangers.</p>
              <p>So...  Any suggestions on anything that i should do? </p>

              <p>My friend, firstly you need to realise that you are the kind of loser that bitches love to take advantage of. You worry about one thing after another when it comes to this kind of situation, STOP BEING A PUSSYBOY! The number one thing that turns women off is your indecisiveness, any  girl will read your thread and know that you are just a hopeless fuckface that needs to get laid, it doesn't make them question about the depth of your character or look for any values you have that may attract them, therefore they wouldn't surrender their pussies to you. And what's the shit about 'known her for all my life'? All you saw was a fuckable face and body and you said that you have known her all your life? Dude, you don't even have any idea whether she is cleanly shaven down at her poon. Don't get all poetic and emotional here, no one will believe your shit, definitely not her. It just emphasises the fact that you are a miserable virgin, if you want to get laid, just man up. Moreover, what qualities do you think you possess that can make her estrogen run high? First you need to grow some balls before you can ever attract pussies, there is no way around this, you should be the one validating and selecting her among other females instead of slobbering all over her feet. You are the prize, not her. She should be out there competing with other sluts to get a good lick on your small dick. Read my post on '7 reasons why I am a dick and you are getting friendzoned', it helps you to understand why you are such a failure. The truth is, the moment you worry about rejection or display any signs of pussyboy behaviours, you have already blown your chances of locking your key into her hole (if you get what I mean).</p>

              <p>This is not a bar or something where you can just approach a chick and ask her out.</p>
              <p>If you try to confess your love for her, Unless you look like Taylor Lautner, chances are, she will freak out and you will definitely fail.</p>
              <p>To meet chicks at school, you need to have an excuse to meet them or a setting, like during CCA you introduce yourself to her and vice cersa. Or even a scout gathering campfire, you get to introduce yourself to the girls. Or the girl in the same classroom as you. But you never go to a stranger and confess your love for her. Or if you know a friend that knows her, ask your friend to introduce you to her, then you can break the ice from there. Next time you bump into her, you can say good morning or hello.</p>
              <p>Get to know her first then decide whether you have a chance or not.</p>
              <p>If you do not succeed to have a "setting" to meet and get to know her, just forget about it, it will never work, its like salivating over the playboy cover magazine of pamela anderson, and you know you will never get to meet her, unless you try to do a Borat on her.</p>

              <p>School is a lousy place to pick up girls. Moment you go upfront to her and say hi, will make you look like a despo. Girls don't like despo, they just think you are cute but strange then ignore you.</p>
              <p>You need a familiar setting, like being her chemistry lab partner or same CCA. Or you can ask your friend to recommend you to her, but likely he would sabotage you.</p>
              <p>If you can't think of a familiar setting, forget about her. No fate, no honey.</p>
              <p>Also, take into consideration why you like her? You don't even know her. You never spoke to her. So it must be because she is a chio bu. Don't you think you are being vain on liking her on the basis of her appearance?</p>
              <p>If you like her on her appearance, just think about it, how many other guys at school and have nearer proximity to her, that also like her by her appearance? The competition is going to be tight.</p>
              <p>Why don't you consider some other girl at your class. Maybe you could like her for her personality for a change. Beauty is the eye of the beholder. Of course I am not saying that physical attraction is not important. Just don't seek those pretty girls, there are some who are fairly nice looking, if you open your eyes big big.</p>
