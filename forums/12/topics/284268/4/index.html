They fear bad things will happen to you for there are many irresponsible guys or guys who are not ready to settle down out there, who will make you pregnant and run away or asked you to go for abortion. When such things happened, who do you think is the one who suffers the most? You.<br><br>Several years ago, sex education is only taught in secondary schools. Why do you think they brought forward into the primary schools? The main reason is because abortion rate keeps increasing over the years. Abortion cause severe pain and bleeding for many days, cause possible vomitting and adominal discomfort, increase miscarriages and decrease your chance of having a baby when you get married. If your womb get punctured in the operation, you will never have a baby, unless you dislike children and never want to have kids in your life, then its ok.<br><br>On top of that, the emotional trauma. Before an abortion, every doctor will play a video for you and advise you not to go for abortion. It is a shameful thing that you will not want to tell your best friend. Girls that I have counselled, most of them still carry the guilt and remorse for killing a human life, very few have actually moved on. Like what a doctor will say, a 100% safe sex is no sex and a pyschologist will say, sex does not necessary make a relationship better.<br><br>Just my 2 cents worth...<br><br></div></blockquote>Yes Uncle, sorry na.</div>
