              <p>Ok. I just wanted to start off by saying that i DO have friends. We all do have friends but my circle of friends is not that many. Less than 10 as I can say. After my secondary school years, I went to ITE and friends over there is just hi and bye sort of thing. So i visit this forum called sgcafe (how do i know about this forum? long story lol). During that year, it was so active and lots of outing as i can remember. I'm really happy to be part of this forum and i made friends there and it became quite close to me. So close that we make outings of our own and not posted it on forum. Two years passed by and slowly the people i knew drifted away .. as in they no longer meet each other. I only left with 3-4 people that i knew of and days passed by, we no longer meet each other because of NS and/or busy with other things.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So I moved here... sgforums. And to my luck, during that time i visited this place.. it was quite popular. Outings at few parts in this forum. I remembered join in two outings of this forum, I remember one with some guy named callan and bak la va. Then after that, i got quite busy with exams, work and then went to out of country. After i returned to singapore, I found it is quite late for me. As this forum getting quieter and quieter.. it kinda kills me inside. I tried to reach bak la va but she changed her hp i think because her line is no longer available.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Times passes by to this year, I heard about sgclub. I joined in and another luck for me, they made an outing and i got invited thru some random pm from one of the moderators. Then i've been thinking, i wanted to go but.... why am i like this? am i really this desparate to find friends? I mean... i do have one of my best friend but now he's in NS. I cant just only stick to him. I wanted to open wide of my social circle but is this really the way? I miss hanging out with people at sgcafe but we no longer meet each other. So im guessing im doing all these is because i miss having fun.</p>

              <p>You are just deperate to be "POPULAR".</p>
              <p>Being popular is not the same as having true friends.. True friends can be counted within your 10 fingers... true friends you only need a few good ones.</p>
              <p>Popularity is only to  in-validate your inner fear.. perhaps you are worried that you are not a likeable person.... But when you are invited to big social event , you tell/ validate  yourself " see... people still want me to be there and hangout with them, so surely I am a likeable person.. right ?" You have inner doubts, you are using popularity to dispel your inner doubts...</p>
              <p>But being popular doesn't fill that void of having no true friend...popularity is the wrong yardstick to value yourself.</p>
              <p><strong>You can be very popular.. and at the same time.. feel very lonely inside.</strong></p>
              <p>True friends are the ones that fulfill part of you. The other part is yourself.</p>
              <p>You have to like yourself first... after that.. everything is secondary.</p>
              <p>I get invited to big parties.. but that's just part of social life... we exchange names, contact, we net work.. if we have lohbang.. we call each other.. if we got no mutually beneficial involvment..we throw their name cards away... it's all very superficial.</p>
              <p>My "social acquaintances" don't get their nose in my personal life... if I have personal issues... I don't go to them... I go to my true friends and family... and i keep only a few close ones.</p>
              <p>However.. if you just wanna be "popular"... all you need is a LOT of lohbang for others to take advantage of... so they see the value of inviting you to their social network... and keeping you there.....else you simply fade away..</p>
              <p>Once you come out to work.. you will understand the value of net-working.. and why they will rarely be adding on to your small circle of close friends.</p>
              <p> Of cors.. I'm not saying you stop going to social events... it is very<strong> fun.</strong>. , exciting and <strong>enjoyable...</strong> you should enjoy meeting new people.. but don't count on those events to fullfil that void inside yourself.</p>

              <p>You have reached an age where your social circles are shrinking. Some of your friends move on to other circles or to NS, so they develop their own circle of friends and have no time for you. Your attempt to make new friends frustrate you. You are excited that you make new friends with Bak La Va and Callan but is disappointed that they just remain as acquaintances. Tell you one fact lah, it takes years to make close friends. People just don't simply open up to you until they know you much better. Friends are hard to come by, best friends are even harder. Some of my close friends, I know them for more than 9 years but we barely have time to see each other except during CNY and some reunions or hanging out for some drinks. I don't have close friendships with those I know less than 3 years.</p>
              <p>Reality is this, friends come and go. But family is always there for you. So its time to settle down. Find yourself a relationship, a girlfriend (assuming you are a guy). When you are in relationship, your partner is the one who is always going out with you so you not so lonely anymore.</p>
              <p>But if you really insist on finding friends - there's not many alternative (repeat:your social circles are shrinking). Maybe you can join social clubs but I dont know of one. I do join sammyboy forum or there is one malaysian alternative swingers forum (which I don't want to reveal here), so I make friends with sex swingers, have orgies, sneak behind our wives or girlfriends for some "snacks", meet up for drinks to boast about our sex adventures to bangkok and we go swing around. If you wanna be religious, you can think about joining church - they have youth groups who do some youth activities, gatherings and weekly meetings.</p>

              <p>For a housewife you are damn stupid. Where do you get your sex education from?</p>
              <p>I bet your kid was born out of invitro fertilization because you are too afraid to see your husband's penis. Normal women use penis for fertilization, you use a stringe of sperm to ejaculate sperm into your pubes.</p>
              <p>Gigolo are males that offer their services in exchange for money.</p>
              <p>A swinger is one that volunteers to have sex with multiple partners for the sake of enjoyment and fulfillment. No money involve, just sex and some friendship with no strings attached.</p>

              <p>Ok. I just wanted to start off by saying that i DO have friends. We all do have friends but my circle of friends is not that many. Less than 10 as I can say. After my secondary school years, I went to ITE and friends over there is just hi and bye sort of thing. So i visit this forum called sgcafe (how do i know about this forum? long story lol). During that year, it was so active and lots of outing as i can remember. I'm really happy to be part of this forum and i made friends there and it became quite close to me. So close that we make outings of our own and not posted it on forum. Two years passed by and slowly the people i knew drifted away .. as in they no longer meet each other. I only left with 3-4 people that i knew of and days passed by, we no longer meet each other because of NS and/or busy with other things.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So I moved here... sgforums. And to my luck, during that time i visited this place.. it was quite popular. Outings at few parts in this forum. I remembered join in two outings of this forum, I remember one with some guy named callan and bak la va. Then after that, i got quite busy with exams, work and then went to out of country. After i returned to singapore, I found it is quite late for me. As this forum getting quieter and quieter.. it kinda kills me inside. I tried to reach bak la va but she changed her hp i think because her line is no longer available.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Times passes by to this year, I heard about sgclub. I joined in and another luck for me, they made an outing and i got invited thru some random pm from one of the moderators. Then i've been thinking, i wanted to go but.... why am i like this? am i really this desparate to find friends? I mean... i do have one of my best friend but now he's in NS. I cant just only stick to him. I wanted to open wide of my social circle but is this really the way? I miss hanging out with people at sgcafe but we no longer meet each other. So im guessing im doing all these is because i miss having fun.</p>

              <p>You have reached an age where your social circles are shrinking.
              Some of your friends move on to other circles or to NS, so they
              develop their own circle of friends and have no time for you. Your
              attempt to make new friends frustrate you. You are excited that you
              make new friends with Bak La Va and Callan but is disappointed that
              they just remain as acquaintances. Tell you one fact lah, it takes
              years to make close friends. People just don't simply open up to
              you until they know you much better. Friends are hard to come by,
              best friends are even harder. Some of my close friends, I know them
              for more than 9 years but we barely have time to see each
              other except during CNY and some reunions or hanging out for some
              drinks. I don't have close friendships with those I know less than
              3 years.</p>
              <p>Reality is this, friends come and go. But family is always there
              for you. So its time to settle down. Find yourself a relationship,
              a girlfriend (assuming you are a guy). When you are in
              relationship, your partner is the one who is always going out with
              you so you not so lonely anymore.</p>
              <p>But if you really insist on finding friends - there's not many
              alternative (repeat:your social circles are shrinking). Maybe
              you can join social clubs but I dont know of one. I do join
              sammyboy forum or there is one malaysian
              alternative swingers forum (which I don't want to reveal
              here), so I make friends with sex swingers, have orgies, sneak
              behind our wives or girlfriends for some "snacks", meet up for
              drinks to boast about our sex adventures to bangkok and
              we go swing around. If you wanna be religious, you can think about
              joining church - they have youth groups who do some youth
              activities, gatherings and weekly meetings.</p>

              long story lol). During that year, it was so active and lots of
              outing as i can remember. I'm really happy to be part of this forum
              and i made friends there and it became quite close to me. So close
              that we make outings of our own and not posted it on forum. Two
              years passed by and slowly the people i knew drifted away .. as in
              they no longer meet each other. I only left with 3-4 people that i
              knew of and days passed by, we no longer meet each other because of
              NS and/or busy with other things.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So I moved here... sgforums. And to my luck, during that time i
              visited this place.. it was quite popular. Outings at few parts in
              this forum. I remembered join in two outings of this forum, I
              remember one with some guy named callan and bak la va. Then after
              that, i got quite busy with exams, work and then went to out of
              country. After i returned to singapore, I found it is quite late
              for me. As this forum getting quieter and quieter.. it kinda kills
              me inside. I tried to reach bak la va but she changed her hp i
              think because her line is no longer available.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Times passes by to this year, I heard about sgclub. I joined in
              and another luck for me, they made an outing and i got invited thru
              some random pm from one of the moderators. Then i've been thinking,
              i wanted to go but.... why am i like this? am i really this
              desparate to find friends? I mean... i do have one of my best
              friend but now he's in NS. I cant just only stick to him. I wanted
              to open wide of my social circle but is this really the way? I miss
              hanging out with people at sgcafe but we no longer meet each other.
              So im guessing im doing all these is because i miss having fun.</p>

              <p>I'd rather have very few close friends who I can really share things with and we are always there for each other than a broad circle of 'friends', or actually I'd call them acquaintances, but my friendships with them will soon fade away.</p>

              <p>You are just deperate to be "POPULAR".</p>
              <p>Being popular is not the same as having true friends.. True
              friends can be counted within your 10 fingers... true friends you
              only need a few good ones.</p>
              <p>Popularity is only to  in-validate your inner fear..
              perhaps you are worried that you are not a likeable person.... But
              when you are invited to big social event , you tell/ validate 
              yourself " see... people still want me to be there and hangout with
              them, so surely I am a likeable person.. right ?" You have inner
              doubts, you are using popularity to dispel your inner doubts...</p>
              <p>But being popular doesn't fill that void of having no true
              friend...popularity is the wrong yardstick to value yourself.</p>
              <p><strong>You can be very popular.. and at the same time.. feel
              very lonely inside.</strong></p>
              <p>True friends are the ones that fulfill part of you. The other
              part is yourself.</p>
              <p>You have to like yourself first... after that.. everything is
              secondary.</p>
              <p>I get invited to big parties.. but that's just part of social
              life... we exchange names, contact, we net work.. if we have
              lohbang.. we call each other.. if we got no mutually beneficial
              involvment..we throw their name cards away... it's all very
              superficial.</p>
              <p>My "social acquaintances" don't get their nose in my personal
              life... if I have personal issues... I don't go to them... I go to
              my true friends and family... and i keep only a few close ones.</p>
              <p>However.. if you just wanna be "popular"... all you need is a
              LOT of lohbang for others to take advantage of... so they see the
              value of inviting you to their social network... and keeping you
              there.....else you simply fade away..</p>
              <p>Once you come out to work.. you will understand the value of
              net-working.. and why they will rarely be adding on to your small
              circle of close friends.</p>
              <p> Of cors.. I'm not saying you stop going to social
              events... it is very <strong>fun.</strong>. , exciting and
              <strong>enjoyable...</strong> you should enjoy meeting new people..
              but don't count on those events to fullfil that void inside
              yourself.</p>
