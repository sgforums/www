Nevertheless, both of you need to be able to get over whatever obstacle that is preventing you from communicating and understanding each other's needs, and both must also be willing to meet each other's needs, be it emotional needs or security needs. Only with such understanding and willingness can both of you work together to resolve issues. You both need to get through this difficult period for things to work out in the long-term, bec. the days ahead are still long.<span style="color: #444444;"></span></div>

So in their eyes, you are partly at fault.<br><br>I donÂ’t buy that sh!t about how lonely and pampered that guy is. ItÂ’s a matter of responsibility and there is no excuse for being irresponsible. A responsible person will not leave you hanging the way he did while he search for other possibilities.<br><br>As for yourself, you are going through a self denial stage right now. You are with him physically but you simply donÂ’t love the man anymore.<br><br>Why do I say that?<br><br>Your man is an unfaithful and insincere person. It is psychologically impossible to be in love with a person who is not sincere. Love and sincerity always come hand in hand so as to speak. Understand that you may still be attracted to certain aspects of his character (eg. maybe he is humorous, maybe he is a pretty boy, etc), but when you throw in the fact that he is not a sincere person and is unfaithful to you, there is no reason for love to exist anymore.<br><br>So I was initially puzzled about why you still went back...I continued reading your post and I saw myself looking at someone who still has some lingering feelings because you are:<br><br>1) Still in love with the memories (of how well he treated you in the past) and<br><br>2) After been with him for so long, it has became a habit to you and right now you canÂ’t seem let go and break away from this habit<br><br>There are people who are unwilling to let go as well as people who are unable to let go. You have to realize that in your case, you do have a choice!<br><br>You kept saying that you are weak, but when I look at your posts I saw that you actually have a strong character within. You constantly thought of leaving him again because you simply refused to accept the unfairness bestowed upon you. If you choose to use that strength in you, you will realize that there is no reason to willow in self-pity or retain a lost love anymore.<br><br>All you need to do now is to muster whatever courage left in you to face your fears. You must begin by believing that you are strong enough to break free from your routine and find a new reason to live.<br><br>All those comments you made about how your social life is not broad enough and how your life always revolves around him are excuses for people who are unwilling to let go.<br><br>If you push your ability to the limit and make serious effort to improve your life, nothing can stop you from leading a new life without this man.<br></div></blockquote></div>

Do u think i ever wanted him to feel that way? as in feeling lonely?? cuz i subjected him to it? I give tuition cuz i tot that since he's always sleeping when he reached hme after work, i might as well continue wif my tuition.<br><br>Reasons of why i give tuition<br>(1) I have been a full time tutor for 6 yrs and now switch to a part time<br>(2) Got a full time job this yr &amp; still ve alot of students who I cannot let go cuz of their PSLE N some bcuz they r so used to me.<br>(3) He's always complaining of tired after work and is alwaz sleeping when i reach hme straight after work<br>(3) To earn extra $, so that our $ won't be so tight<br><br>The above justifies all. If i am so keen in merely earning $, i wouldn't have care much. It's not that I wanted to neglect him, making him feel lonely..If i can foresee all these unwanted incidents; i will not have chosen to go for tuition after a tiring day of work every night! I can jolly well shake legs at home!!! Or go out wif frens!!<br><br>In fact all the while, I thought I am utilising the time which I used to watch him sleep to give tuition.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>

If a marriage breaks down, you will bear some responsibility, No more how small the percentage.<br><br>Take Jennifer Aniston's imminent divorce from Brad Pitt, for example.  I forgot what her therapist told her, but something along the lines of, although she was only 2% at fault in the marriage, she was still at fault.<br><br>We haven't heard your husband's side of the story, &amp; there may have been things we did Not know about.  It doesn't help that others are also condemning your husband here &amp; making you feel as if you've Not done anything wrong.<br><br>You speak of sacrificing so much for your husband.  Sure, you do.  But isn't that what a normal woman in love would do?  I know I would, &amp; I do make sacrifices.  Only those sacrifices are Not plastered all over so that people will know how wonderful I am, etc.  Most of all, I don't ask for anything back for the sacrifices I've made.<br><br>Anyway KieKie, in short, I definitely feel your husband is wrong to have done what he did.  I do NOT condone it.  But instead of ranting here, isn't it more constructive to try &amp; get your husband to go through marriage counselling with you?  Or to try &amp; get someone your husband is close to, to speak to him?  Or perhaps you should stop working so hard &amp; invest more time in the relationship?  Isn't that a 2% fault of yours that you may Not be trying hard enough?<br><br>FeowFeow<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by kiekie:</div><div class="quote_body">Hope u dun mind if i say these. Do u think i ever wanted him to feel that way? as in feeling lonely?? cuz i subjected him to it? I give tuition cuz i tot that since he's always sleeping when he reached hme after work, i might as well continue wif my tuition.<br><br>Reasons of why i give tuition<br>(1) I have been a full time tutor for 6 yrs and now switch to a part time<br>(2) Got a full time job this yr &amp; still ve alot of students who I cannot let go cuz of their PSLE N some bcuz they r so used to me.<br>(3) He's always complaining of tired after work and is alwaz sleeping when i reach hme straight after work<br>(3) To earn extra $, so that our $ won't be so tight<br><br>The above justifies all. If i am so keen in merely earning $, i wouldn't have care much. It's not that I wanted to neglect him, making him feel lonely..If i can foresee all these unwanted incidents; i will not have chosen to go for tuition after a tiring day of work every night! I can jolly well shake legs at home!!! Or go out wif frens!!<br><br>In fact all the while, I thought I am utilising the time which I used to watch him sleep to give tuition.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> </div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To Feow<br>I probably did not make myself clear in my previous post. Obviously the poor baby will probably feel lonelyÂ…his emotions is not a choice. I agree with that.But he can choose the manner he dealt with loneliness. And he chose to be irresponsible (I have to admit I despise that about him).<br><br>When I point out that he is irresponsible, I'm not trying to judge who should take the blame...it's irrelevant. ItÂ’s just that I donÂ’t believe she is capable of loving someone who is irresponsible and unfaithfulÂ…this is regardless of who started the mess.<br><br>My intention is not to pinpoint to kiekie who is at fault because it really doesnÂ’t matter. Maybe you are thinking it matters because if she knows where she did wrong, she can try to savage the relationship and make things workÂ…<br><br>But why should she try to savage a relationship when there is no longer trust and sincerity?<br><br>Because she still loves him? How can love exist in that kind of environment? Read below to see what I mean.<br><br>To Kie kie<br>Feow is right when she tells you that you donÂ’t need to justify anything.<br><br>What happened cannot be undone. He is irresponsible and unfaithful, those are facts. So can you live with that fact and continue to live with him? I said in my earlier post that I donÂ’t believe you love him anymore. Staying in this relationship is going to do you more harm than good.<br><br>Look at what you wrote recentlyÂ…<br><br>You are sensitive and critical over trivial thingsÂ…<br>Â“So, i told him.. Yalor, ur fren should learn from u mah, want to talk, should wait until knock off then tok or sms wat, no need to be do it so obviously. Wah...ha... he flared up and that's why he told me he cudn't stand the way i m treating him now.. he says that i ve changed completely into another person. And he cried....so we cried together.Â”<br><br>You are suspiciousÂ…<br>Â“I juz found out that he went to a website regarding massaging... I can't help pondering if he had visited any or merely thoughts of them and i wonder how he got to know the website tooÂ”<br><br>You feel that you should be at the receiving end now because you have been victimizedÂ…<br>Â“I am wondering what else should i do.. Somehow i felt that I am the one who is trying hard in making up for our quarrels instead of himÂ”<br><br>There is no trust and sincerity in that relationship anymore. You and him right now is like an accident waiting to happen. No matter how strongly you are attracted to him, love cannot exist in an environment like that.<br><br>From the way I look at it, you are just unwilling to let go<br><br></div>

But as things stand right now, I am not optimistic.<br><br>Simply because you have too much anger in you to calm down and actually analyze WHY you are actually staying.<br><br>A relationship that consists of a Â“giverÂ” and a Â“takerÂ” is destined for failure. The Â“takerÂ” becomes selfish and greedy as time pass by.

No. Instead you opted for a role reversal. You try to be the Â“takerÂ” now and force him be the Â“giverÂ” so that he can suffer some emotional abuse that you have gone through. You kept telling yourself that he must prove something to you.<br><br>Will this relationship work? Definitely not! As things stand right now, there is still a Â“giverÂ” and a Â“takerÂ” in the relationship!<br><br>Re-education means learning that both of you deserve to receive as well as give. Both parties in the relationship must learn to treat their partner with respect and sincerity and expects their partner to treat them with respect as well.<br><br>Re-education means you must let go of the past and stop playing the "blaming" game. It doesnt matter who should be blamed. The important thing is to learn together.<br><br>Re-education is going to take a lot of work since both of you are used to your roles in the relationship Â… which is why I have advised you to take the easiest and least painful option of  simply walking away.<br></div>
