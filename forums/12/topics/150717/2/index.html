Lots of people mis-interprete actions<br><br>Your own friends is really your life. He has his friends what..  and you didn't even question him. You mean you are afraid he's not going to trust you with your friends? Then why should you trust him with any friends?<br>You mean you don't have the freedom to have friends and he should be worried?<br>I think you think too much. Going out with your Female or Male friends for Coffee or movie is Ok ... if you don't feel good, go in a group. Or attend group functions like this forum outings or ask your friends out .. whatever. You need to get away sometimes and enjoy your life a bit. If he wants to tie you down and suspect you and isolate you ... then I wodner if he understand trust and r/s at all.<br><br>BTW, Is the level of communication satisfactory in your r/s. If its not, its also something to work at.<br><br></div>

He also keep all those toys and relies on his wife to do everything even help him with his school worrk. The wife becomes a crutch to support a useless person and she grew resentful of her life/husband and everything. They had a very empty life and house - and he wanted kids - I laffed very hard...  She already had one....<br><br>You should have your own interest. He can have his. There should also be some compromises.  R/s is not measured by movies or outings but the quality of outing.  I watch lots of TV with my bf and he also introduce me to new things.  However, its the communication we do during those times - through actions or words.  If these things bother you, you should also make it clear to him. I doubt very much he would change cause I told my classmate off. He's still the same and resented that I had highlighted he needed to understand the bigger picture. So much for stupid people.<br><br></div>

First solve your own life.

But also you must make other choices such as to move on and have other things to do and look forward. Perhaps you ever consider to choose to live happier with or without him...<br><br>In the back of my mind, I continuously think through, and know my bf and myself can live without each other and I run all the scenarios.  I know I will grief but I know I have the strength to carry through and continue on my own and I have to do this without my parent's help and I have to re-manage my rental housing issue and adjust my finances.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm not an expert in these matters, but I can tell that your love for him far exceeds his love for you, from the way you try to get used to his passions and always putting him first in whatever you do. From a male's perspective, it is not difficult to take you for granted.<br><br>But I can see that he is making an effort to make it up to you, by offering to quit his job. Subconciously, he perhaps didn't realise that you mean the world to him, until the night you left home. I think the emotional cheating phase was just an ego trip for him. Give yourself and him a chance, and as mistyblue said, communication is very important. Stay strong!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

This are all he told me last time.<br><br>He said he already hinted her they are impossible as her husband treats her very well and she is already married with kids.

What a Loser!   I peel prwn for my BF then i think he should be super grateful and fall deeply in love with me lah.<br><br>Hard to tell her not to SMS? He wants to continue the r/s with her is it? what's so hard?<br>CHANGE HP Number lah!<br><br>She more important to him than you are. This you Already realise. She cry and he scared. You leave he only beg and you give way. So you will always be the losing party. Always treated 2nd class to everything he likes and he do. You want that meh?<br><br>And as Spidee said, and my BF also told me. Its easy for men to take things for granted and they are not shy to climbing on your head and Sh!t on you.

I didn't tell you to leave him and divorce him immediately. To Think is to Plan and to revise if the r/s is working - why not and how to fix if the r/s means something to you.

You have to decide for yourself and he has to be an adult and respect your decisions. If he cannot... you really want to conitnue the r/s with him?<br><br>Oh as for vomitting... I used to know this guy - he's borderline mad actually. He vomits on command. So its nothing.  People react badly to change... I would put it down to strong resistance... and I wonder if he's crying for himself and the loss of a good easy life and spending money or the loss for you. That is a VERY big difference... only he knows ... but you have to find out...<br><br>BTW. I know I am harsh. But unless you deal with the facts and truth... there is no way you would get out stronger and in 1 piece.<br><br></div>
