            <div class='col-md body'>Hi CuriousOrange,<br><br>Sorry for this late reply, I've Not dropped into this thread for awhile.  Yep, I understand where you're coming from.  The husband has acted irresponsibly, I agree with you, &amp; frankly, I don't condone what he's done.  No matter what kinda reasons he may have, it's just Not the right thing to do.<br><br>I'm basically coming from another angle, I'm glad we can see eye to eye on that.  That a marriage is based on 2 parties, &amp; when a marriage fails, 2 parties are to blame, it's just how much or how little (frankly, it doesn't matter, does it?).  I'm just wary about condemning 1 person when the other party comes across as "all innocent" (for lack of a better phrase, No offence intended).  Frequently, if we look beneath the surface, there's also fault on the other side.<br><br>Notwithstanding what we've agreed on above, my main objective was to highlight to KieKie, that instead of justifying to me whatever reasons for her blasts against her husband, whatever sacrifices she's made, blah blah blah, there could still be things done to salvage a marriage.  I'm Not interested in who's more at fault, I'm more interested in what CAN be done in the hopes of salvaging a marriage.<br><br>FeowFeow<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by curiousOrange:</div><div class="quote_body">To Feow<br>I probably did not make myself clear in my previous post. Obviously the poor baby will probably feel lonelyÂ…his emotions is not a choice. I agree with that.But he can choose the manner he dealt with loneliness. And he chose to be irresponsible (I have to admit I despise that about him).<br><br>When I point out that he is irresponsible, I'm not trying to judge who should take the blame...it's irrelevant. ItÂ’s just that I donÂ’t believe she is capable of loving someone who is irresponsible and unfaithfulÂ…this is regardless of who started the mess.<br><br>My intention is not to pinpoint to kiekie who is at fault because it really doesnÂ’t matter. Maybe you are thinking it matters because if she knows where she did wrong, she can try to savage the relationship and make things workÂ…<br><br>But why should she try to savage a relationship when there is no longer trust and sincerity?<br><br>Because she still loves him? How can love exist in that kind of environment? Read below to see what I mean.<br><br>To Kie kie<br>Feow is right when she tells you that you donÂ’t need to justify anything.<br><br>What happened cannot be undone. He is irresponsible and unfaithful, those are facts. So can you live with that fact and continue to live with him? I said in my earlier post that I donÂ’t believe you love him anymore. Staying in this relationship is going to do you more harm than good.<br><br>Look at what you wrote recentlyÂ…<br><br>You are sensitive and critical over trivial thingsÂ…<br>Â“So, i told him.. Yalor, ur fren should learn from u mah, want to talk, should wait until knock off then tok or sms wat, no need to be do it so obviously. Wah...ha... he flared up and that's why he told me he cudn't stand the way i m treating him now.. he says that i ve changed completely into another person. And he cried....so we cried together.Â”<br><br>You are suspiciousÂ…<br>Â“I juz found out that he went to a website regarding massaging... I can't help pondering if he had visited any or merely thoughts of them and i wonder how he got to know the website tooÂ”<br><br>You feel that you should be at the receiving end now because you have been victimizedÂ…<br>Â“I am wondering what else should i do.. Somehow i felt that I am the one who is trying hard in making up for our quarrels instead of himÂ”<br><br>There is no trust and sincerity in that relationship anymore. You and him right now is like an accident waiting to happen. No matter how strongly you are attracted to him, love cannot exist in an environment like that.<br><br>From the way I look at it, you are just unwilling to let go<br><br></div></blockquote></div>

Dun live in the past memories. Cuz thery hurts."<br><br>something dat I wish to share wif u (which I din previously in my thread) which is very similar to your plight was my failed marriage:<br><br>I knew him for 7years, got married for 8years (including the 3years' separation). I did everything for him, cooked, washed, ironed (even his hankerchieves) and also paid all bills + his debts as he was struggling financially and at work. The initial 2 years were ok, then he took me for granted (surprise surprise), and he was often not patient with me, flared up if I asked him too much. He went clubbing all the time, came back drunk and I had to clean up after him. At times he told me lies but I chose to believe him instead e.g. there was a credit card charge at a Geylang hotel and he told me his fren got drunk so he checked him into one etc.<br><br>Then 1 day 3 years+ ago, I was sick at home, lying on the sofa, he called me. As the reception was not good, I could not hear him so I hung up. The next call from him he scolded me with foul language for hanging up on him. Strangely that was the last straw, that night I told him (in tears of course) that I din deserve to be treated this way, that I was tired of looking after him after all these years, dat I wanted to live for myself and I moved out.<br><br>Though it was my decision, it was not easy, I cried and cried for the next month, couldn't sleep, couldn't eat. He too begged for forgiveness, told him he will change and that he was so sorry that he took me for granted. But I had already given out on him and more so bcos I realised that I need to get myself out of this <span style="text-decoration: underline;">co-dependent relationship</span>.. the rest of my story, u oredi knew.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">I guess wat I wanted to say was you made a right decision to move on, dun look back, he ain't worth it. One day u will find that someone who will love and cherish u... take care</span>...</span></div>
