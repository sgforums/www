            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>What should i do? I m really in a dilemma.<br><br>Recently i found out that my hubby has been sort of 'CHEATING" on me outside. Specially on Friday's nite. cuz i usually stay at hme on fri nite as i gotto work on Sat. Hence, he went out to pubs with his friends even though he knows he can do so on Sat taking me along. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>Nevertheless, i trusted him so much until recently. I was really devastated when i found out that he was on very good terms with one of his married colleague. They chatted on the phone eveyday when i was at work, which lasted for 30min to 1 hr.  and even has multiple sms to one &amp; other everyday.<br><br>I found out when one fri nite he came back at 6am. That day i was sick, throwing up &amp; having a bad flu. However, i asked him to take care of himself and enjoy cuz i felt that if i ask him to come back early, its oso useless, it won't cure my illness.<br><br>I waited from 11pm to 2pm at the void deck and quicklyawent home when 1 stranger came to approach me to be friends. I laid on the bed and tried to sleep but i cudn't. At around 4pm, i went downstairs again and waited till near 6am. Despite my multiple calls and sms, he didn't answer or reply. I was so worried that something bad might have happen to him.<br><br>I went home again to get prepared for work and the moment i stepped out of the lift when i was going out, i saw him....drunk and I began to question him. He merely replied that he went to pub then makan with his colleague.<br><br>I was doubtful and tried to check his HP call details. Then i saw him making calls to some numbers that i didn't know. I asked him y he nv answer my calls &amp; all he replied was his HP low batt. I packed my clothings &amp; decided to moved out.<br><br>He was lying on the bed restlessly and asked me not to go. I poured out my emotions and told him off.<br><br>All these yrs, i ve been treaying him like a king. I served him meals, pick up his laundries cuz he alwaz dump them on the floor when he comes back. Get his socks for him, paid for his expenses and bills. Even thou i got to work from 8.30 to 9.30pm, i alwaz make the effort to call him &amp; buy dinner for him as he alwaz sleep when he came back from work.<br><br>Only now then i realised i m a fool. He didn't sleep when he came back, he was making calls to his married colleague whom has 2 kids.<br><br>How do i find out? I managed to get his call list and sms list n matched up all the calls they made.<br><br>Why do i do that?<br><br>Cuz after that fri incident, he promised to be better to me &amp; i forgave him. But  3 days later, while he was asleep, i tried checking his HP. I knew he dun like it but i have no choice as i dun know wat he's doing behind my back.<br><br>&amp; i saw a MESSage that shattered the vision of mine.<br><br>It says:  No matter wat's ur decision, i will always care for u. You muz study hard and nv let urself fall ill again. I LOVE U!<br><br>I noted the number and realised it was the name of the colleague whom he mentioned to me before cuz she was the prettiest in his company.<br><br>That night, while he was sleeping, i packed up all my belongings and left the house with lots of bag. I met my good friend &amp; sat down for a chat. She tried to console me that things might not be as bad as i tot. That night was another sleepless one. I spent the whole night checking out the numer of calls and sms they made and tried to match them up one by one.<br><br>The next morning, he called me as he cudn't find me. I avoided his calls for 1 hour. And finally on my way to work, i answered. I told he that i will go. He was shocked as he didm't know wat was happening. He nv know that i will have a list of the info. he kept begging me to come backand promised that he will change. I questioned about his colleague and he was so afraid that i might ring her up as she has a family.<br><br>Then i told him, since u r afraid of hurting her and not me, then let me go. I ve u but not ur heart......u ve changed. No wonder u treated me so badly. Whenever i buy food for u at night, u r sleeping and by the time u wake up, u complained tat the food is cold and juz have a mouthful and go back to sleep. We have very little conversation and he alwaz tells me he is tired.<br><br>I am so sad. I felt so foolish, thinking that he's really tired.....on the other side, he's chatting with that woman before i reach home. Usually, when he charge his hp, he always leave it on a chair, now he hide it under his pillow.. sighz....<br><br>That morning when he called me, i told him that i knew everything, he was shocked and only after much questionings, he revealed the truth. He said that his colleague is in love with him. But only when the night i choose to leave him, then he wakes up and realised my importance which he nv did in the past.........He said that he didn't touch or went out wif her at all. Merely sms and chatting on the phone. He said that he has no feelings for her. I told him if he has no feelings for her, then i dun find a need for them to sms each other everyday or chat on the phone everyday for so long! Whenever i call him, he will tell me he's busy la. Then how come he's free to chatt with her for so long?????<br><br>I told him my heart is shattered and if he wants the kind of thrill go ahead, i will set him free. He broke down and cried begging for my forgiveness. Then thru the call list, i found a few numbers that he called frequently too. I tried dialing them n found out they r all gals!!! This time i was firm to leave him.<br><br>I wanted to stay, but i cudn't find any good reason to do so..He dun love me anymore, our lifes has become stagnant. He resorts to knowing other new gals at pub on Fri nights and chatting wif his married colleague to ease his stresses at work and studies. I understand, thats y he choose to keep me in the dark. He said that he's afaid that i will be angry. N i told him off that if he's afraid that i will be furious, then in the first place, he shouldn't have done so!!<br><br>He kept denying abt the gals he befriend with and in the end, when i threatended to call them up one by one, then he confessed. He kept begging me not to go cuz he cannot dun ve me. But i told him straight that he will be able to find a better one. He's juz used to our relationshio and do not love me anymore. It's a kind of habit to be together..Anyway being together with him, he had forced me to be so independent  and i can take care of myself.<br><br>We already ROM, juz that we have yet to hold the wedding dinner.  SO he kept saying that he will talk to his parents abt it and we will applied for a house. I told him... what for??? Everynight, i sleep with a GREAT PRETENDER and thought that he was really tired and stressful... I had nv felt so foolish at all. I even gave him $$ to go to pub, afraid that he dun have enough.... Now all i get is.......................hurt.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Now i m back with him but feeling very insecure as i dun know when he will stray again. He promised that he will changed n be better to me. He said that he knows who is really good to him and he has found the person, that's me. I stayed as i really love him...so much to the extent that i sacrifice all time time for him and nv go out with my friens at all.<br><br>I really duno what i ve choose is right or wrong. Afterall, i still love him, to me, he's my life, he's my everything....but to him? Only that day he begged me and told me that he was wrong. He nv felt so scared of losing me in the past.<br><br>Hope that it's not another one of his lies. I will die if he gave me another sudden blow!!</div>

I told myself that i ve to learn to let go of his wrong doings and willl nv bring them up for a quarrel.<br><br>In fact I am at fault too cuz i pampered him too much, always trying to give him all he wants and allow him to have too much freedom and spoilt him. He nv help out with household chores at all........and i nv ask him to do, cuz i tot he's tired. SO everyday, i did it myself. It's me that makes these become a habit for him..a bad one.. that he took me for granted. I am crying now....<br><br>You know last night when we got together again, i dun dare to look at his face... cuz whenever i look at him, thethoughts of him calling n chatting, messenging and befriending other gals will pop up in mind mine again and again...<br><br>I m so saddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd..........................<br>huhhhhhhhhhhhwooooooooo Cry......<br><br>What have i done to deserve all this setbacks???<br><br>My friends say that i shouldn't be as gd to him as before. But i really can't bring myself to do that.<br><br>Last night, he went to study, fearing that he may be hungry, i went o buy food for him...i noe i shouldn't. and he came to the kopitiam to fetch me which he nv did before. I know he;s trying to change... and i can't help feeling that its because his guilty conscious that's y he's good to me...</div>
