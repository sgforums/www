Just take this one bold step in your life, you will find hapiness once again. Rather then suffering under this emotional trauma he puts you through.<br>Don't believe whatever he says. Don't show your care and concern. Just cut off all contact and show you lead a much better life.<br>Don't pity him. You get more even hurt. Don't live under the same house with him, show him you are independent. Don't give him money, males are the one to feed, not the females.<br>Get out from his life.</div>
