              <p>don't give up. go ahead. without much delay, tell her that you like her. there is nothing wrong in sharing one's feelings. if not anything she would appreciate the fact that you had the courage to ask. also, that's the quickest way to find out what's on a girl's mind.</p>

              <p>why not start by asking her out first? no need movie outing or anything.</p>

              <p>well if you are shy then writing to her would be the best idea, i
              think. why bother writing some hundered odd lines? just write that you
              like her and want to know if she feels the same for you. keep it short and sweet.</p>
              <p>lastly, it's not something simple. proposing is not that easy, you know. particularly, if you are serious about the girl. anyway, you will soon find out ;-)</p>
