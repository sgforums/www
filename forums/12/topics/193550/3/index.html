            <div class='col-md body'>I guess its more important to know the reasons for ur insecureness rather than to try to stop urself from putting on make-up, since that is more the problem than the make-ups.<br><br>Maybe you could try to think of WHY u wanna look pretty. I mean you are attached. And im sure ur boyfriend likes u beyond ur looks. (If he doesnt i think its the time to find out anyway) You need to realise that ultimately, 20 or 30 years from now, make-up wont help u much. Sad but true.<br><br>You know ur problem - you are feeling insecure. Putting on make-up might just be your way of copping with that insecurity. BUt if u really want to solve this problem, its time to look more into why this insecurity.<br><br>Just remember, to someone who likes u, ur looks wont matter, and to someone who dont, why bother?<br><br>In anyway, all the best for ur efforts to solve ur "problem".

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I saw an oprah winfrey show episode where a wife have never shown her unmadeup face to her husband for like 20 years. She will wake up earlier every morning to make up, and sleep after her husband sleep at night. it's a bit like a mask she puts on.<br><br>Actually a lot of women put on these 'masks' when I put on makeup, though rarely, I feel excited maybe cos make up is something that I associate with special events. You dont have to go barefaced all the time either. Get a tan!<br><br>I think you know where the issue lies... I was about to suggest some activities that can help you boost ur confidence in your own abilities, so that the looks compartment wont be where you tap your self esteem on. Learning that you can be good at other things will help I guess.<br><br></div>

Once you start putting on makeup and realising how good you can actually look (because they enhance your features), of course you will not be willing to settle for anything less, anymore.<br><br>Guess you are getting used to the admirative glances you get when you go out, and would feel uneasy and inconfident when you don't apply makeup and stop getting them.<br><br>Sometimes when I am out with my bf say just going to have a normal dinner, without makeup or dress up, and run into other people, when I see other girls prettily dolled up, I would feel kinda regretful that I didn't. Insecure, but definitely not bcuz of my bf, its just a confidence kinda thing.<br><br>All girls have a vain side of them. My friend once told me, b4 her sis goes out, she'll ask my friend a qn: will guys look at me when I'm out? Its not that she's flirty or wad, its just good to feel confident and being admired =)</span></div>
