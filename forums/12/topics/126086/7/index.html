            <div class='col-md body'>Dear clarion,<br><br>I went out with a guy once. On our first meeting, we had a some sort of okay conversation. I guess I was the sociable and chatty type, thats why most dates went on well. But, to me, I felt that the guy can't really "click" with me. So, there you go, it may be your point of view that you think that your conversation went on well...<br>After that meeting, I went out with the same guy again. But, obviously, that guy was interested in me, and started to hint that we shld get together. Since then, I avoided him as I dun want to break his heart. Even though on several occasions, I have already hinted that I am not interested in any love affairs.<br>So, you see, I am the one avoiding him, and he is the one wondering why I am avoiding him.<br>Hmm...<br>So, right now, I guess he got the picture and has disappeared from my life again. Even though, once in a while, he will sms me to go out. And I juz ignored him.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">  Cruel, you may say, but, I dun want to be in a point where I give that somebody hope, and then, crush their hope juz like that.
