She sees you too easy to handle<br>3) No matter how much you like her, you WONT have to tell her first<br>4) Don't waste your precious money on flowers. She just blows you off     when  she recieved the flowers<br>5) Even on first date, DONT EVER OFFER TO PAY. NICE GUYS FINISH LAST.<br>6) *repeat* You dumb shouldn't have told her you liked her during and after your date.<br><br>Now she's playing hard to get.<br>It's so simple shit<br>what u suffering now is a onenitis.<br>Move on there's many chicks.<br>Learn from mistakes/failures and dun repeat it.<br>Ask me what u want and i reply them here.<br></div>
