She may not be ready to receive your call yet -- she probably would have guessed what you were going to say, but she was not ready to respond.<br><br>Don't quit after one missed call. True, the silent response to your numerous messages may mean she is not interested, but it may also mean she simply does not know what to say, yet. Call her again after one week or two. If your call went through and she cut you off after seeing your caller ID, perhaps then you could go back to your TV programmes and forget about her.<br><br>You may also wish to go easy on the messages via SMS and MSN. When the lady is not ready yet, whatever message you send is only going to confuse or irritate her.<br><br>And I'd ditch the flower idea if I were you. You've already reassured her that you just wanted to be normal friends with her. One doesn't send flowers to a normal friend unless he or she opens a new business or is lying in a coffin.</div>

I'll classify it as dense, it's not their fault.<br><br>Personal advice to Antoh: To girls, truths are not to be said. Truths usually hurts and comes with harsh words. They don't want to be known as b!tch or looked like they've dumped the guy outright. When you understand girls...those facts are simple, rather it's quite 'in the face', to accept or not is all up to you.<br><br>She's not obligated to give you a direct answer unless both has entered into mutual knowledge of attraction.<br>Neither is 'waiting is waiting' a wise idea. It doesn't prove anything. To your situation....it is very unwise. You're too unflexible and self absorbed, learn to relax and take things easy and slowly.<br><br>Take care.</div>
