I would not hold it against her nor feel unhappy about it. This i repeated several times using several mediums.<br><br>I believe in a way she is still thinking about it and like what TauTao said in the beiginning, she will be in a difficult position if she answer yes or no. We have to remember we are dealing with a 36 year old lady that is experienced and mature in thinking, for her to be coy and just ignore a person in the hope he gets a hint is nigh unlikely in my opinion. In fact she very much has the upper hand in the matter just by the fact that she is older than her pursuer.<br><br>I think she is perhaps waiting to see if a better man comes along after all we both met at dating event.....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I did very much wanted to send her the flowers today to her office. I had already prepared a nice note, nice stationary etc...but like my previous posts and advice from some of the forumers, i decided to hold back for now to give her some breathng space. If i were to force her to say something when she is not ready, the results would be predictable. But, i have not given up on this idea yet, everything is still in place for later when i feel that it has been long enough.<br><br>Other than that, like what timble say, i need an answer to move on...i can handle rejection, i am not new to it. Weather it be, "best of luck", "not keen", etc etc nothing i have not heard before. This is what i have been empahsisng to her over the past few days, but nope nudda nothing from her.<br><br>Flowers is not meant as a show or anything along the lines, it is just to "encourage" her to react thats all, as her collegues will most likely pour themselves all over her and she would be obliged to do something abt it.</div>

Unless we are Don Juans or Cassonova...where we can flirt and practise on a daily affair.<br><br>For most of us we might be good at our jobs, sports etc because of repetition but how many of us have repetitions of relationships?

Perhaps one day when you meet another with about as many scars as you, the relationship might benefit all the more from those scars.</div>
