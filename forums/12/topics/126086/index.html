            <div class='col-md body'>Hi..can someone advice me please...<br><br>Here is the story;<br><br>Met this girl for the first time had a cuppa and everything went well, i did experess my interest to her during and after our meet. Perhaps she could not handle the pressure but the next day no more reply from her. It has been three days already and counting.<br><br>Before anyone decides to give advice to me here are the facts.<br><br>1) She said the meet was nice and interesting and she is sincere i believed that<br>2) She is 36 and kinda of traditional so perhaps i might have come across as too aggressive by expressing myself to her<br>3) I believe she is interested in me from her body language etc<br>4) She does not mind that i am 5 years younger than me<br>5)Everything seemed cool<br><br>I sent her some sms and an email asking her to tell me if she is no longer keen so i can move on, but also no reply from her. She does not seem like the type that would stay silent and seems she is older she should be able to tell me straight or at least say the usual stuff, to indicate if she is not interested.<br><br>So being optimistic, i am thinking, perhaps<br><br>1)_she is thinking something?<br>2) Insecure?<br>3) Not into me but enjoying the attention?<br>4) The type that stay silent and keep ignoring till i give up?<br><br>What What What?<br><br>Some of the experts here pls advice...i cant believe she would not at least indicate her preference....what is happening?<br><br>So frustrating<br><br></div>

A lady loves to be chased -- cutting to the chase makes her feel like she's some kind of 'lelong' goods on sale. Expressing your interest to develop the relationship further on the <span style="font-style: italic;">first</span> date may be cost- and time-efficient, but a tad too intimidating for most ladies to accept, especially for the traditional-minded type like this lady whom you're interested in.<br><br>Put yourself in the shoes of this lady. Should I say "yes" and risk making myself sound very 'desperate' in front of this man? Should I say "no" and risk losing this man who seems decent enough to be a prospective partner? Both options don't seem appealing, so I'd rather choose the safest way out and keep mum instead.<br><br>If I were you, I'd send her a message by SMS or email and let her know I understand I've been slightly aggressive (glad you know it yourself) in pushing the friendship and would give her some time to know me better first. Ask her if she would continue to be your friend -- just friend (emphasize) -- and let her know you would be calling her to ask her out again for dinner or movie a few days later. (Call -- it is a more sincere form of invitation.) This way, you'd be giving her some relief space and remember, you don't want to chase the "prey" away (wrong choice of words perhaps).<br><br>You certainly made the scenario sound optimistic, and with your maturity in thought and your confidence in action, I'm optimistic of the outcome as well.

I am sincere but as you say i seem to have rushed too much into this situation<br><br>The problem is i have already sent her two emails and apologixing for my rashness and expressing my friendship proposal, but till now she has not responded.<br><br>So i guess i decided i must somehow, use juie zhao and sent her flowers to garner a reaction...if she is irritated perhaps everything will go south, but if she is moved then she might start responding again.....<br><br>Tua tau, your words have managed to put all my jumbled thoughts into perpective...thanks for your encouragement, look forward to your further ananlysis.<br><br>Cheers</div>
