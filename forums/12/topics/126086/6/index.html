            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Clarion,<br><br>Sorree to reply to Antoh in ur thread.<br><br>======================================================<br><br>Dear Antoh,<br><br>I'd been asked by a kind soul who really wans to help u, so I've looked @ ur replies &amp; ur posts, &amp; here's a lady's pt of view.  Pls note tt these r my own subjective views, &amp; r Not wholly representative of the SG female population:<br><br>1.  U asked why izzit girls can't simply tell u straight in the face tt there's No hope for u instead of simply keeping quiet.<br><br>Objective View:<br>If u wanna look @ it from an academic (altho this is arguable) pt of view, we'll take a leaf outta the book of Women Are From Venus, Men Are From Mars.  We ladies r supposed to be sugar &amp; spice &amp; all thgs nice, it's instinctive for us to wanna protect a person from hurt.  Hence, we'd rather keep thgs inside than be nasty &amp; hurt u.<br><br>Subjective View:<br>If u're a gd fren, I'd definitely Not wanna tell u, "U're a gd fren, but u're really Not Prince Charming, so I'd appreciate it if u can get ur creepy hands off me".  If u're Not a gd fren, I cldn't be bothered to tell u, lest u go ard telling ur frens I'd been leading u on, &amp; I'm a biotch, etc etc etc.<br><br>2.  U asked how a girl cld be nice to u for 2 wks or more, &amp; suddenly ignore u.<br><br>Subjective View:<br>U're a new fren of mine, or even if u're Not a new fren, u may be a fren whom I've Not gotten to noe well enuff.  Mebbi I wld like to see whether there can be anythg more tt comes outta this frenship.  After 2 wks, I've decided tt u're kinda creepy, &amp; do Not wanna carry on further wif u, but cosh u called me 20x on my mobile fone, I think u're a psycho, &amp; I'd better avoid u instead of telling u.  I wldn't wan u to stalk me.<br><br>3.  How can she (as stated above in Pt 2) when she hadn't been resisting ur touching, kissing, "playing" (watever this means, altho I shudder @ the thot).<br><br>Subjective View:<br>She might be trying, to see whether anythg can come outta this frenship (perhaps more?), as stated in Pt 2.  But after she realised tt u're clearly Not her type, she beat a hasty retreat.  Moreover, u called her 20x on her mobile fone, it'd be wiser to avoid u if she feared for her safety.<br><br>4.  Not sure if u're in a r'ship wif her.<br><br>Subjective View:<br>U're Not, period.<br><br>*DISCLAIMER:  The above is based on the assumption tt u dunno her tt well.<br><br>FeowFeow<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by MÂ©+square:</div><div class="quote_body">quote:<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Originally posted by antoh:<br><br>how could she be nice to you for 2 weeks or more and suddenly ignore you ...<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>quote:<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Originally posted by antoh:<br>when she dont resist your kissing? or touching? or "playing" with you?<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>quote:<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Originally posted by MÂ©+square:<br>suit yourself.
