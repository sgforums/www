            <div class='col-md body'>nowadays, believing is like going to the supermarket. u find things u like and u dont like. if u believe for what it's shown to u, then u'll buy it, right? even tough later u get the bad or expired, etc goods. In the case of believing God, there's no money back guarantee, just take it or leave it.. just as simple as that..<br>That's how I look upon the religion...</div>
