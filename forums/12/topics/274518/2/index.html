And also bring bfs to our room.<br>After she left, we have to pay more money as now 3 of us have to share rather than 4.<br><br>But 2 months later, she is back with us because she went to the other room, get bullied and kicked out. Now she appreciate what we have done for her. She apologised to us and said that actually, without knowing the outside, she thot we were the worst lot, but actually we are the best of the best.<br><br>The 4 steps of relationship<br>1. Introduction: very warm and nice, courteous and polite<br><br>2. Pre-storming: start to have problems, the like and dislike, the comparison, the sacrification, the arguement, stamp authority, the tolerance and endurance among each other.<br><br>3. The perfect Storm: Wow, quarrels and even fightings, scolded here and there, no respect anymore, knowing each other bad habit and points, look for trouble, sore in the eyes. Everthing good is bad, everything end in bad mood and quarrel. In the end, broke off relationship, but if the relationship is not broken off, it arrive at the next step, so call<br><br>4. Normaling: It like after a big storm, all clear liao, you know my style, i know your style, each have each other respect space, the do and don't. All learned to understand each other like and dislike.<br><br>From then on, you may become good buddies, gf/bf, husband and wife, colleagueship, boss and subordinates. teacher and students etc etc and all other relationship.<br></div>
