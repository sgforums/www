            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm.....I don't know if it's a mind game, Joyless.  I don't know if he is also battling with himself.  Just trying to be objective and not directing at gender but at situation, people has a tendency to want to have their cake and eat it too.  I suspect, on one hand, he wants to let go and on the other he is also hanging on.  Like saying things like remaining friends and such.  Sort of you are still around or within arms length kind of thing.  I also suspect that the reason he initiate the breakup so he doesn't have to hide his new relationship.  Dear, dear, not sure if I am making any sense here.  Maybe I am not expressing myself well.  Anyways, just a thought.  No further advices as our virtual friends here have all written very good messages herein.  Hopefully, some will drive home the point.<br><br>Again, write and tell whenever you are down.  But definitely move on.  You can do it, lady!!!!</div>
