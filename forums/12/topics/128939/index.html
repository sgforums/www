            <div class='col-md body'>Sorry to hear about your present situation, Joyless.  If you navigate about this forum, you will realise that you are not the first nor the only one in this type of situation.<br><br>It is sad that many people "choose" (intentionally or subconsciously) the "third party syndrome" as a way out of a relationship.  Would things have been different if both parties run into problems, working out not successful and then go parted ways amicably?  Than, run into problems, working out not successful but one still adamant to try and the other go astray.....being tired out or drained?  Open for comments, anyone?<br><br>Anyways, Joyless......sad to say, you have to move on (he has given you a firm indication that it is over, right?).  It will not be easy but you will succeed.  Be strong.  Many forumites have written very powerful and meaningful messages so I hope you can find some comfort and strength from there.<br><br>If this is not meant to be, then perhaps, it is a second chance at life, at love...for yourself too.<br><br>May God gives you the strength to overcome this challenging phase and the wisdom to see and know what is good for you.  Amen.<br><br>All the very best, Joyless.  Remember to visit this forum each time you feel unhappy.  It beats keeping everything to yourself.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Joyless<br><br>I can understand why you feel this way.

Now he want to give up and walk away, with you alone wanting to maintain a 1 person relationship(I dont think theer is evena 1 person relationship) is impossible.

After 2 yrs plus, my ex-gf had gone back to her ex. I was like you, trying to salvage the relationship in anyway I could.. buying her flowers, making gifts for her, etc. But all is fruitless as she's already set her heart to go with the other guy.<br><br>I understand the pain that you're going thru, but it seems that it'll not be the best solution to try to get back to him. What's the point of keeping someone whose heart doesn't contain you anymore?<br><br>I hope that you can get thru this painful period, and wish you the best in ur future r/s.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

It's always better to happen earlier then later.<br><br>A lot of people thought they know what they want only to know it's not what they want when they went through it.

(I mentioned in ~lyn~ topic on 'Asking too much'. This is definitely a classic example of man who desire to leave, with or without any proper reason - that's if you can accept this as a reason at all).<br><br>YOUR relationship begin on a basis where challenges are laid obvious in your path. Courage are gathered and you both move through the treacherous route and with the power of love, your relationship remain intact and seemingly alright.<br><br>The catalysis is the one week holiday. So surprisingly, the Venus/Mars caveman theory actually applies here; the time you were gone is exactly the time he took to review/preview his relationship. (Of course this is but half the catalysis) Three years has passed, the treacherous path remains threatening still - he looked ahead and instantaneously become tired emotionally. You mentioned that he dump in alot of effort; his mind started questioning his heart - is that what he want?<br><br>Another woman walked into his life (this makes up the other half). She MAY not be equipped with the love you and him had foster, but certainly, when he looked ahead into the path with her, the route seemed easier to walk. This is a fatal attraction for your bf to leave the relationship, thinking that the spark had died, when another had entered into the picture and MADE him realise all that thingy.<br><br>How do I know if the mind is questioning the heart? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"><br><br><blockquote><strong>During the week of break-up, he did sms me occassionally, asking me how am I. He told me to hang on and he feels hurt when he knows that I'm feeling miserable. He also told me that he still care for me. </strong></blockquote>Mental power is strong and manage to <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>convince </strong></span>the heart to give up the challenge he opt to undertake three years ago.<br><br>P.S: Move on. Although, things are going way too fast and create much blurness, your missing nature is NATURAL, so do not mistaken something natural as a sign to wait for him. Wait is but a foolhardy attempt to revive the relationship. What dead is difficult to resurrect and you must attempt to leave the burning village, before the flame engulf your soul.
