            <div class='col-md body'>Hi. I am a Higher Nitec student from biz administration. While i was studying, my ITE teachers told me that Higher Nitec qualification is higher than O level. When i went for interview as Admini Assistant, the interviewer asked me to take my O level. When I want to enroll into other private school or look for entry level job, I got rejected. ITE is a great place to study, they provides caring lectures, more useful modules, however the cert is not very recognized.  So I decided to take O level and a part time local diploma.</div>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>My life is at the bottom now... Here is brief background</p>
              <p>I was from normal primary school, Without studying I usually
              scored the top in the class and I scored 240 for my PSLE without
              even touching studies and I really believed I was genius.</p>
              <p> I went into so called "top school" And My life untill sec3
              was the same... Don't study, play whole time and score an A(At this
              point, I din't noticed most of people in the class scored an A).
              Everything was soo easy for Me. Once I hit sec3, everything
              changed. I took Amath and I totally had no idea what to do. People
              around Me who studied punctually can cope with class and have no
              problem with O level studies. I felt very inferior as it was My
              first time in life I failed my studies so miserably.</p>
              <p>I Was  arrogant and I Couldn't admit the fact that I'm not
              that smart. And I need some effort to make it in studies.</p>
              <p>And Because of that, I stopped going school and got expelled.
              The next year, I moved to private and repeated sec3 because My
              previous school attendance wasn't enough..This is the part When I
              Started hanging out with those gangstar and really stopped going to
              school. But because that school wasn't strict. I got to progress to
              sec4.  And that was last year. BUT even before O level, I
              constantly skipped class, didn't pay attention in class, didn't
              even flip my workbook even once. And My prelim's result was Str8 F9
              with all subject beside english I which i got D7. At this point, I
              already stopped thinking that I'm smart and I just gave up
              everything with My life. I was really whilling to work after i
              finish my O. 2weeks before My O level, I realised I'm wasting My
              life and I needed to make a change. I went down to popular
              bookstore and bought ten years series for my math and science and
              started doing. Ofcourse I felt frustrated but I pushed my self to
              study hard for math and science.But I never touch my social study
              and PoA.</p>
              <p>My O level grade was</p>
              <p>English D7</p>
              <p>EMath B3</p>
              <p>Science Phys/CHem C6</p>
              <p>Social Study E8</p>
              <p>PoA C6</p>
              <p>I know Compared with other people, My result is horrible. But I
              started from0 and I got to score B3 in Math and C6 in science with
              2weeks. I regretted and cried.. Why I din't study earlier.. But it
              was already too late....Now I find some potential in my self again,
              but this time I really want to study hard and keep up my
              attendance.</p>
              <p>But because of my result, I was placed in higher nitce course in
              bishan ITE. The environment there is horrible especially for my
              course. Everyone's saying like " ITe=Its to enjoy no need study"
              "who give fck bout GPA" And Make noises during lectures and I can't
              concentrate.</p>
              <p>So I Want to change the school. Doesn't matter Private/Local as
              long as the environment is good to study. Problem here is I don't
              really know what i want to do in future. I just want to study.</p>
              <p>My dad's income is around 130~150k per year so school fees
              should be affordable.</p>
              <p>Any recommended place for me to go?</p>
