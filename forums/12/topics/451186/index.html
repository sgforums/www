              <p>My life is at the bottom now... Here is brief background</p>
                  <p>I was from normal primary school, Without studying I usually scored the top in the class and I scored 240 for my PSLE without even touching studies and I really believed I was genius.</p>
                  <p> I went into so called "top school" And My life untill sec3 was the same... Don't study, play whole time and score an A(At this point, I din't noticed most of people in the class scored an A). Everything was soo easy for Me. Once I hit sec3, everything changed. I took Amath and I totally had no idea what to do. People around Me who studied punctually can cope with class and have no problem with O level studies. I felt very inferior as it was My first time in life I failed my studies so miserably.</p>
                  <p>I Was  arrogant and I Couldn't admit the fact that I'm not that smart. And I need some effort to make it in studies.</p>
                  <p>And Because of that, I stopped going school and got expelled. The next year, I moved to private and repeated sec3 because My previous school attendance wasn't enough..This is the part When I Started hanging out with those gangstar and really stopped going to school. But because that school wasn't strict. I got to progress to sec4.  And that was last year. BUT even before O level, I constantly skipped class, didn't pay attention in class, didn't even flip my workbook even once. And My prelim's result was Str8 F9 with all subject beside english I which i got D7. At this point, I already stopped thinking that I'm smart and I just gave up everything with My life. I was really whilling to work after i finish my O. 2weeks before My O level, I realised I'm wasting My life and I needed to make a change. I went down to popular bookstore and bought ten years series for my math and science and started doing. Ofcourse I felt frustrated but I pushed my self to study hard for math and science.But I never touch my social study and PoA.</p>
                  <p>My O level grade was</p>
                  <p>English D7</p>
                  <p>EMath B3</p>
                  <p>Science Phys/CHem C6</p>
                  <p>Social Study E8</p>
                  <p>PoA C6</p>
                  <p>I know Compared with other people, My result is horrible. But I started from0 and I got to score B3 in Math and C6 in science with 2weeks. I regretted and cried.. Why I din't study earlier.. But it was already too late....Now I find some potential in my self again, but this time I really want to study hard and keep up my attendance.</p>
                  <p>But because of my result, I was placed in higher nitce course in bishan ITE. The environment there is horrible especially for my course. Everyone's saying like " ITe=Its to enjoy no need study" "who give fck bout GPA" And Make noises during lectures and I can't concentrate.</p>
                  <p>So I Want to change the school. Doesn't matter Private/Local as long as the environment is good to study. Problem here is I don't really know what i want to do in future. I just want to study.</p>
                  <p>My dad's income is around 130~150k per year so school fees should be affordable.</p>
                  <p>Any recommended place for me to go?</p>

              <p>I just want to ask... are you currently healthy? (as in no terminal illness like cancer for example)... if the answer is yes, then it's never too late to turn your life around... i think the problem with you now is that you're using the standard society norms to judge your own life and that's why you are sad.</p>
              <p>It's good you have awaken from your slumber... and wants to deal with your studies issues... but you dun have to be sad merely because you failed in studies. animals don't study, but they don't get depressed because they don't care how humans think. They live life on their own terms. So firstly you need to get over being sad and depressed and all that. You need a new perspective on life. If you're young and healthy, I say you should be very happy and not take what you already have for granted. You're sad because you fail to see what you already have and you're looking at what you do not have.</p>
              <p>Studies wise, I can't help you because I am not a good student myself. But that didn't stop me from becoming successful in life. Just so you know studies is not everything, but it is something you need if you want a decent job next time. From what I can see, you seems to have the right attitude, I think that for me, is more important than exam grades itself.</p>
              <p>In life, it's also not always what you know, but who you know. Don't take things too hard on yourself, at the end of the day, everyone dies and all the assets/money/exam grades... everything goes out the window.</p>

              <p>hi,</p>
              <p>Thankfully, ur dad earn decently.</p>
              <p>Are u willing to work hard from now on? If yes, I suggest u enroll into private institution and study for 'A' level. You need at least 2H1 2H2 subjects. Since u only take E math(no A maths), no pure chem/physic. I recommend u to take the following subject as a private candidate(u can limit urself to four, I just list more in case):</p>
              <p>            - H1 General Paper</p>
              <p>            - H1 Chinese(or ur 2nd language)</p>
              <p>            - H2 Economics</p>
              <p>            - H2 Accounting</p>
              <p>            - H2 Business Management</p>
              <p>Alternatively, if u are not confident to pass A levels, u can re-take ur O levels, then discuss wif ur father( he earns, so it's fine) about sending u to USA university(if u are u male, after army?). They recognise 'O' levels as a sufficient qualification. Please verify the recognition of that particular uni - in terms of world ranking or national ranking. Try pick up a 3rd language as well.</p>
              <p>Of cuz, u can go poly, but i recommend u go try US uni, esp if ur dad can afford.</p>

              <p>My father also O levels until ard 30 years old then pass an accounting exam(ACA? or something like that?). Then work as accountant, then finance controller. Now, he owns several business(he dun manage, he invests only), he earns alot of $$$.</p>

              <p>How much longer do you want to spend your father's money ?</p>
              <p>He may be earning enough to put you through school, but when are you going to let him have money to save and enjoy his own retirement ?</p>
              <p>NITEC or whatever shit school you go to, it's not about who is teaching you or what kind of classroom you sit in all day long.</p>
              <p>The fact is, if you are willing and truly eager to learn, even if you go to the shittiest school, you will still be able to excel on your own.</p>
              <p>What the teacher teach is what is in your text books and what you are able to learn.</p>
              <p>Some kids don't even go to a school environment, yet they excel in standardised tests and examination. They study on their own, they seek out knowledge from books independently.</p>
              <p>If you cannot even excel in a shitty environment where all the students are perceived by you as losers.. then what hope is there for you to even do well in a more competitive environment ?</p>
              <p>Who cares what others say about ITE. Are you so gullible ? Unable to think on your own two feet ? Why do you let people around you influence your thinking so easily ?</p>

              <p>My suggestion is this:</p>
              <p>Retake your O Levels as a private candidate. Give yourself one year to clear it. Since this is your second time taking the O Levels, you will at least have familiarity with the syllabus (compared to learning completely new things in ITE).</p>
              <p>Then it is just a matter of making this second chance count. Take private classes if you have to. ITE may have subsidized night classes for O Level subjects, if I'm not wrong. Work your butt off and do well in it.</p>
              <p>Then once you do well enough, go on to poly.</p>

              <p>Academia is not for everyone. If he is not academically inclined, why force himself to become one ? Setting him up for failure , no ?</p>
              <p>Since he cannot learn anything from ITE,-- because of lousy schoolmates, lousy teachers, lousy whatever excuse..his brain shuts down and his heart stop beating the moment he steps into ITE..... . maybe he can go Shatec... hopefully he cannot find any more excuse for his own failure there. But then again... if that also fails him.. then what ?</p>
              <p>All he needs to do is <strong>Pick up a skill</strong> so he don't need to leech his daddy's money forever.</p>
              <p>Remember, he don't even know what he wants to do yet at <strong>17</strong>. No ambitions, no .. nothing... no big dreams.. so why bother ?</p>
              <p>The only thing he seems to be proud of is that his daddy earns a decent income.. maybe he is hoping he won't ever need to work his whole life... sponging off his daddy for as long as he can.</p>
              <p>Go out there and start earning his own keeps. Go work in a warehouse, or flip burger at Mcdees.... whatever.</p>

              I think you should just ask your parents to send you overseas and let u focus on your studies since your family can afford it and u want a second chance.
              
              U are still young and education is really important which I can't stress enough. 
              
              Gone are the days where ppl without education can get a decent job.
              
              You will be fighting for job from both Singaporeans and foreigners and your dad is not going to be around for life. What if someday he falls sick and you are required to feed the family? Your family will break down and goes into proverty zone - thus it's important you understand not everything is about yourself.
              
              Goodluck kid.

              <p>Since you say your father earning so well = go study overseas.</p>
              <p>A lot of singaporeans struggle to get into the best local universities n polytechnics because their results aren't good enough.</p>
              <p>You have the adv of financial support from your father.</p>
              <p>For instance if some poor singaporean wanna study Law at NTU but his/her GPA isn't good enough - they have to find anther subject.</p>
              <p>But for you if you wanna study law and scored bad results - you can still go to Australia or UK to go study law and come back with the same qualifications as those who graduated from singapore.</p>
              <p>There is a lot of reputable foreign universities that don't consider your results so as long as you got the $$$$.</p>
              <p>I know of one guy - he also like you. From school to college to university - always fail. Then his father got frustrated and send him to Curtin university because the university is one of the most easiest to graduate in the world. This guy just pass his degree but he is good in talking. He join an IT firm as a marketer. Then he climb his way up. Today he is a marketing director.</p>

              <p>To be honest with you, you are actually quite fortunate to have a father than earns better than most people. Right now, you're in a dilemma because you cannot pursue certain courses or educational paths due to your " bad" results. </p>
              <p>All i can say is, you have to clear the distinction between psle and o levels.</p>
              <p>PSLE= requires IQ</p>
              <p>O Level= hard work and determination</p>
              <p>A levels= hard work + IQ.</p>
              <p>I have a friend exactly like you, she scored 259 for PSLE, then she went to ITE.</p>
              <p>If you really wanna leave ITE, then i suggest you leave and probably take MDIS.</p>
              <p>If you are a boy, leave now before NS catches up with you.</p>

              <p>Your experience is, "The higher a person climb, the deeper a person falls". You lost all motivation when you received a failure. You reminded me of myself when I was in sec three. We're similar in how one incident can turn our life around by 180 degrees.</p>
              <p>I'll share a part of my life to you.</p>
              <p>I used to ace through my Maths from primary one to sec three. I had a very strict and judgemental Math teacher during sec three. She always picked on me after one incident during first two weeks of school. An incident when I took an mc from fever. I became the only student who didn't finish the homework. She forgotten I was on mc and had a wrong bad impression towards me. I never clarified due to being uptight, shy and quiet in nature.</p>
              <p>Her wrongful bad impression towards me carried through until the end of the year. I was demoralised each time. When she picked on me everyday, I get too distracted and unable to catch up anything she teaches. Thus, I wasn't able to keep up and left questions blank. I started failing from one class test to another. Each time I failed, she continued her bad treatment &amp; impression towards me. Her intentions are good but her methods are wrong. She was very judgemental and never understood me before raising accusations. Due to her daily pressures and demotivations, I was demoralised gravely and lost all motivations for studies. I started failing all my subjects that year. I also started skipping classes. A domino effect.</p>
              <p>What turned my life around was I retook 'O' levels. Unlike government schools, private schools gives you freedom. Teachers never pressure me. I grew long hair for self-confidence and esteem. I grew my own personality from the freedom choice of clothes. There were no tensions and strict rules. I rarely studied because I felt it was much easy to absorb. I scored A1 for Maths and few other subjects.</p>
              <p>I entered poly in my next phrase. JC will never be my choice because of uniforms, hair rules and typical school strict rules. Same like sec schools. I fear those restrictions and boundaries will affect my mind functionality and dvelopment. I can't feel controlled or else it affects on everything I do. In these present days, even ITE (higher nitec) requires male students to have short hair and uniform. ITE and JC wasn't my choice.</p>
              <p>What matters is that you must believe you can do it. That's how you were able to score As without much effort. The moment you felt inferior, that's where everything falls apart like a domino effect. That was what happened that caused your life to turn around. You can do it. You're still very young. There're several paths you can take especially with the support from your parent. :)</p>

              <p>This student has the same story as yours. Never study properly during O.</p>
              <p>Then found his interest in Science during ITE.</p>
              <p>Then went on to SP with a good grade average.</p>
              <p>People like these can do well and progress in life.</p>
              <p>Excerpt from article "</p>
              <p>The former St Patrick's Secondary School student scored a dismal 
              O-level aggregate of 30 points and went on to study at ITE College East 
              after being rejected by the three polytechnics he had applied to.</p>
              <p>He had to contend with his mother, who objected to him enrolling in 
              the ITE and wanted him to resit his O-level examinations. But it was at

              <p>Retake your O Levels.</p>
              <p>Make sure you do well in your English and Maths.</p>
              <p>The rest you can just pass.</p>
              <p>In Singapore poor results in English and Maths will haunt you when you are older.</p>

              <p>even I am not singaporean - I can tell your results is not good. Is really at the far end.</p>
              <p>But all hope is not lost. Like the rest say - repeat your O levels.</p>
              <p>Then go overseas.</p>
              <p>I don't think there is much hope for you to study locally. You already pushed down by your bad results. Overseas would give you a fresh start.</p>
              <p>Try it. YOu may like it.</p>

              Hmmm.....looking back....u're indeed clever without having to study and scored As...but that was primary school, and u thought you could excel without effort for the rest of your schooling days ahead.....
              
              from wat i see, u r better with numbers than language....and u would have done much better had you put in more efforts than relying on 10 year series....u need to shake off that bad attitude, stay away from bad influence (gangsterism??? haha...do they deserve to be garang in Singapore...u can kiss my foot)....
              
              in singapore, u need at least a diploma to find a decent job with a pass in Eng/ Maths ...and a degree at least to smell the management doorstep....whether pte/ local...u better get down fast to get done with it...before u go NS with at least A level or diploma....u r racing with time than the environment....in short, its you...
              
              brudder....look at yourself now.....before u worry about the future without your good present self....

              <p>Hi ....retake your exam night class or private...MIDS (<a href="http://www.mdiscollege.edu.sg/gce-o-level-private-secondary-school.html">http://www.mdiscollege.edu.sg/gce-o-level-private-secondary-school.html</a>)</p>
              <p>Nothing is too late...you are still young...MIDS have both O &amp; A Level course...work on it.</p>
              <p>Once you are done with that, go into Army...there after go into Uni locally if poss or perhaps SMU, SIM or even MIDS etc...there is still an option.</p>
              <p>You can also work at the sametime study...but need lots of hard work...</p>
              <p>It is also good because you will understand more in depth.</p>
              <p>Cheers !</p>
