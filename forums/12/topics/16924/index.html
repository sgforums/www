            <div class='col-md body'>I have got 3 explanations in mind. not too sure if it applies to you.. somehow related in a way, but can be independently by itself :-<br>1) you feel that u r not loved.<br>2) you want to get some attention..<br>3) you have not got a purpose in life...<br><br>here's the details.<br><br>1) You feel that you are not loved because you find that ur parents do not care abt you. Or maybe, they just don't show they concern they have for you when you were younger. you don't feel the so called nag to tell you to do this and to study. Or maybe you feel that they are just nagging and nagging, till u got tired of it. Basically you just don't feel you are that precious to someone anymore.<br><br>But the thing is that the hopes and aspirations of that someone is still there on you. just that as time goes by, the person may speak less of it.. and hence you sort of put it at the back of your mind and seldom bring it out to motivate yourself.. and the person still loves as much if not more. just maybe was not expressed openly.<br><br>2) You feel that in this world, no one cares abt you, or someone important to you just did not bother about you. so you may want to seek some attention. the more drastic the better, so that you will know if the person truly cares or still cares for you.<br><br>But isn't there better ways to know if pple care for you? and there are so many people out there who care for you. A very good example are your parents. Even if u feel that one doesn't care, there's always the other. I doubt that there are mothers who can give up on their children with just a flick of a thought. Besides, we people in AA here, do care for you.<br><br>3) You haven't know what you want. you have no goals. Hence you may have the thoughts that, 'Heck, having me in this world doesn't make much difference. The world still goes round without me.'<br><br>Why not start thinking of ways to let people in this world feel that you I can't be without you? If you are a supervisor of a factory, you can be a great supervisor such that ur workers will feel, discouraged to work without you around with them. Or maybe as a teacher, let your students missed your lessons when happen to fall sick. I think Teecherz Crysania will be a great help on that.<br><br>Who you are, makes a difference.<br><br>------------------<br>()""()     ************************<br>( 'o' )     Barely Bearing Berry Belly Bear<br>(,) (,)   =======================<br>(.)_(.)

Happened to me before... And I bet we're not alone...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> But don't feel bad about it ok? Not that this is not uncommon..? Especially in a city like Singapore... Your idea of killing yourself....? Does it come in a FLASH? Many flashes on and off? Or is it VERY OFTEN and perhaps even so much so that you're actually PLANNING for it...? Visualisation of it happening...?<br>Technically speaking, you should be experiencing a slowing down of your life pace now.... Mentality and reaction.... Could be a 'hormonal effect' like Yolanda and Larry have mentioned...? Then perhaps you should take Larry's advice and go for a good time...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> GOOD TIME... Not really WILD TIME.....? (Not recommended...)<br>What you proposed as 'not related to anything unpleasant event'..... Could be really so, or at times.... More like 'indrectly' linked to something.... This could provoke an involunteerary DEPRESSION.... Just as Bear has PROPOSED....<br>IF by any chance, you are actually feeling very fine now....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> PLS.... Just IGNORE our POSTS for now... If you need more help, just let us know...?<br><br>------------------<br>I have no 'friends' nor 'family'.<br>I hold no past and see not future...<br>These are just samples of illusions....<br>I don't exist, but I shall live ETERNITY.....
