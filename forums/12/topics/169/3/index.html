            <div class='col-md body'>Part 7 Memories..<br><br>The next 3 months have been my most happiest time in my life. Sky has accompanied me almost everyday. He will be leaving in a month's time. We have lots of memories together. We went shopping, bookstores, dramas, movies, arcade, bowling, cycling, swimming and of course places for dating.that is boatquay. I enjoyed picking love peas with him. Its only the both of us. Although is a hot and sunny day, i think is rather romantic too. He promised me to pick all the love peas he had seen to me. In the end, he really did so. We end up picking 99 love peas and I had put them all in a small and cute bottle for remembrance.<br><br>After that 3 months we spent together, it was like totally no news from him..before that he had mentioned that he need to pack his stuff for this period. However, I really missed him very much. The only thing I can do now is to cherish the times spent with him.<br><br>I think of him everyday, and the things around me really reminds me of him. Its hard to except the truth that he's leaving me soon. But what can I do. If we both like each other, no matter how far is the distance apart, or how many years, we will remain true to each other. That's the only thing I can pull myself up. I just lead back my own life without him...<br><br>Time passed really fast, the day has arrived. Sky called me the night before to meet me one last time before he left. We meet at Suntec Fountain and I had prepared a gift for him. Although is quite old fashioned, but I really take lots of effort to do it especially I had never done it before. I knitted a scraft for him, hope that he will like it.<br><br>Sky was so touched when he saw the scraft. He hugged me and say "thank you". I looked at him and he pointed at my neck. Suddenly, I realised that there was a necklace on my neck. I had no idea since when it had been on my neck, should be the time when he hugged me and put it on for me at the same moment. I felt very happy as the necklace will be like him accompanying me everyday. I say thank you to him and we sat there looking at the fountain, enjoying the soothing music there, not forgetting the song, Nothings' gonna change my love for you'.. Although we remain silent, our hearts are united.<br><br>Before he parts, he asked me not to send him off the next day. He do not want to leave sadly and also knew that I will sure be very sad seeing him leave. He said we would contact online when he reached there. That night, he see me home and we promised each other to count to 3, turned to leave and never looked back again.<br><br>And so.... we part and goes our separate ways.....That night, my pillow got wet too......I cried till I slept... I dream of Sky and me.......going to school together...We had lunch and dinner together..We see snow together.........We cooked for each other............we spent times together...........<br><br>to be continued........<br><br>[This message has been edited by Fericia (edited 20 May 2002).]<br><br>[This message has been edited by Fericia (edited 20 May 2002).]<br><br>[This message has been edited by Fericia (edited 20 May 2002).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Part 8 Goodbye My Love<br><br>The time I wake up is already 1030.<br>He should be boarding the plane now.<br>Haiz* sianz...still thinking of sms him...<br>Suddenly, my phone rang. I answered it. IT was SKY!.<br>"Lynn I am leaving now.gt rush.bye.." I couldnt even speak a word, the line already cut off. At least he still bothered to call me before he leave..I looked at my<br>necklace, thinking of last night at the fountain..which I would never forget<br>in my life.<br><br>3 days later, i received a mysterious call. When I listened, there's only music.<br>The song is "Nothings gonna change my love for you". I know is Sky. I cried to tears<br>when I heard that song. I cried for his name, waiting for his answer but there was no reply. After the song finished, the caller hangs up. I thought of him again... and our memories.. I went to the place where we pick love peas together...and stay there the whole day.<br><br>3 months passed, I tried calling his hp, waited every night at ICQ and IRC but no news at All!... I believe he must have got his reason for doing that to me. Day by day passed, slowly i lose hope and stop going online, leading my nomal usual life. Of course, I tend to think of him mostly. But what can I do. Maybe he's too busy with his homework or settle down over there.<br>I just have to wait patiently for him.<br><br>1 more month passed and it was christmas eve. I was having lunch with my friends. Suddenly my hp rang. I picked it and heard<br>"Hi Still remember me?" IT was Sky!. I stood up in astonishment and shouted "Where are you?" I realised the whole restaurant was looking at me.<br>My friend quickly pulled me down on my seat. "Surprise!!i am now in Singapore. Its my holiday now." I was so happy but also feel abit uncomfortable as we had not contacted each other since so long. "Lynn i call u later. ok bye" and he hangs up immeidately. Why did he appear in my life again?! I was about to forget him and put him in my memories. I wondered if time is the reason that I felt the kind of feeling has changed when I talked to him just now. I couldn't describe it. However, I really hope to talk to him again.<br><br>That day, I waited for his call the whole day.. but he did not called..<br><br>to be continued..</div>

The whole day I spend all my time staring at the numerous interesting TV shows blankly. Just as I was about to get up to bath, I received a message from Sky. He said that he had managed to get the factory job. I felt happy for him but also sad for him as he had to bear the tough times starting from now. *sign..<br><br>*my hp rings* and it was sky.<br>Sky: hi lynn,<br>Lynn: yes..<br>Sky: I managed to get the job.

I felt nothing and even felt disgusted. where has all my feelings gone to??I really don't like him anymore ? but why/&gt;? because he has changed or because of the time passed..??didn't i said no matter how far or how long, i will still love him?Oh my goodness...I really donno what to do now...............<br><br>That day I went out with Edward. Since the time when May introduce me to him, we have slowly build up our friendship. He's always be on my side and support me. He's very nice to me but I have always like Sky. I told Edward about Sky. He always listened to me patiently. He's really a great buddy. After a day's outing with him, I felt that I am better. Oh gosh..don't tell me I have fall in love with Edward instead??cos of time spent with him mostly?? no canot be..I just take him as my best friend...thats why I feel better....Anyway, now i really felt better when i do not love anyone..the feeling is free now..<br><br>My hp rang suddenly. It was Sky..<br>Sky: Hi Lynn<br>Lynn: Hi how are you/??<br>Sky: I am in the hospital now..<br>Lynn: What? how come?<br>Sky: I was hurt by the machine when working just now..<br>Lynn: Oh my goodness.Are you ok?<br>SKy: Lynn..Can you lend me some money again as I need to pay my hospitalise fees and also I may lose my job after this...I need some money for the time being..<br>Lynn: but Sky i really had no money now...<br>Sky: you don't wana help me??you see me in this situation..and I am all alone..so helpless.. please help me.....<br>Lynn: SKy please..dont say lidat..ok i tried to help you..how much do you need now??which hospital are you in?<br>Sky: I am in NUH.

So, it'a still a true story, such a dramatic one, but still I must say that luv doesn't involve spoiling one another, if you really think you are "spoiling" your bf, that implied that there's no luv already, luv is all about sacrificing, ok?<br><br>------------------<br>Hope to b your frd forever, Mike signing off</div>
