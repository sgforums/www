            <div class='col-md body'>Don't you find it hypocritical to post your friend's story here and treating it like some kind of suspense story to get ppl coming to followup and comment? Some unhappy experiences aren't exactly nice to reveal...it's like betraying her or washing her dirty linen in public, I'll be ashamed if I were your friend Fericia. I confided in you and told you what happened to me but you posted every detail in a public forum to gain attention and probably hoping to hit a very flaming thread.<br><br>If your friend wishes to get advice from forumnites, she can post her problem or pour out her sorrows here herself at her own discretion.<br><br>Moreover, now that you said you have broken up with your boyfriend, it shows that you aren't exactly the stable sort in love or matured enough yet.

            <div class='col-md body'>Part 12 Another Side of Sky<br><br>I walked slowly towards him while noticing that he had actually cut his hair. He's like botak now, wearing a cap to cover.Even his side burn was gone. He smiled at me happily and run towards me. In the next moment, he hugged me tightly. I pushed him away and asked "how are you? Your injury pain ?" Sky smiled "oh well, see you I no more pain liaoÂ… <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> so glad to see you again. I really missed you so much!Lynn, you looked so pretty today.Â” I really think Sky had changed or is that his real self ? I really had no idea. How could a person changed so much over the past few months ?Â…..<br><br>We walked a corner and sat on the stone chair. Â“howÂ’s your work?Â” I asked Sky. Sky shake his headÂ… and said Â“Lynn donÂ’t talk about this..tell me how did you pass these few months without me by your side?Â” Oh my goodness, this is getting so mushyÂ…I smiled at Sky and replied Â“I am fine, donÂ’t worry about me. Worry more about yourself.Â” Sky kept quiet for some moment when hearing this. He looked at my eyes with his shoulders, leading closer to me. I tried to divert my attention to elsewhere. He lifted my chins and suddenly kissed me on my lips. I was shocked as this really happens less than one second. Before I know whats happening, his tongue was searching for mine. He use his left hand and grab my waist, holding me tightly. I was so disgusted by what he had done. Â“Sky, can you stop itÂ” I tried to push him away but in vain. He was already leading on top of me. Although his other hand was injured, his strength is still more than mine. I bit his tongue and shift my lips out of his and turned my head at another direction. Oh no! donÂ’t tell me heÂ’s going to fuck me here..1?~ I am so helpless. At the moment, I thought of Edward, if only heÂ’s around. As I was struggling along the way, Sky still continue kissing meÂ…on my neckÂ…my cheeks, my earsÂ…..He shift his hand on my tighs and slide into my skirtÂ…Â…Â…..At this moment, I tried all my might and used my hands to push his injured hand and kicked his leg. He screamed and I pushed him away, standing up, tidying myself.<br><br>Â“What THE FUCK are you trying to do?Â” Sky looked at me and said Â“I missed you.Â” I shouted Â“ No. You are not respecting me you know. What do you treat me as ?Â” Sky smiled and say Â“ Can you be my girlfriend ?Â” I was shocked..really shockedÂ…but I still replied immediately Â“ NOÂ” like as if I really sure without thinking.<br><br>Sky looked down never said anything after that. Why did he suddenly feel so sad ? Is he pretending ? This is not the Sky I liked. Sky walked close to me and say Â“Lynn, I am sorry for just now. I really thank you so much for lending me the money and coming out to meet me today.Â” Â“Sky, we are still friends.Â” After that I handed the money to Sky and left when my bus came. I had many thoughts in my head. I really cannot figure out what Sky wants. Is he feeling too lonely then he did this to me ? or he really loved me ? but for now I am sure that I realized the one I loved is Edward, I really blame myself for not cherishing him all along. Too much things had happened suddenly. I am really getting tired. That day I got a feeling that I wont see Sky anymoreÂ…<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Part 13 Truth<br><br>Edward and I got closer after I realized that heÂ’s the one I really loved. Things are so unpredictable. Since that day, Sky not only refused to pay me back my money. He even keep messaging and calling me to lend him money. I began to suspect that heÂ’s out to cheat me. As the reasons he cock up are always like money to see doctor, no money to eat, money for living expenses. I was really totally disappointed with him. I had expected the money that I had lent him would never be back to me again. So I work overtime in order to pay Edward back as soon as I could. Everytime Sky asked for money from me, I would say I donÂ’t have anymore. This is true and I think he really make use of me, treating me like his ATM. I really see his true colors. It is a blessing that I did not love him and be his girlfriend eventually. The money makes me feel painÂ…but money can always earned back however feelings which are given out can never be returned back. The feeling of betrayed and cheated really hurts. I think for a few days and I decide not to contact him anymore, just treat it as a lesson to buy a friendÂ’s true face Â….this lesson really make me learn more to see people more clearly. One can easily blinded by love.<br><br>After that incident, I never go IRC anymore and also no longer interested in online stuff. Maybe, the scar is still there. However, Sky disappeared after one month of messaging almost everyday to borrow money from me. I did not think much also. I am glad that I still have Edward with me.<br><br>One fine day, after Sky disappeared for 3 monthsÂ…I received his call. Actually I did not want to answer but I picked up in curiosity. Guess what ? It was SkyÂ’s number. BUT it is not Sky. ItÂ’s SkyÂ’s friend. He introduced himself as Steven. He called me up as he said that he was feeling guilty. I was surprised, wondering what the hack is he talking about. After some time, he told me the whole story. Sky has been cheating many girlsÂ’ money. He lied to me almost everything. He did not go overseasÂ…no wonder he donÂ’t let me send him.. and he is a Tua Ah BengÂ… gangster. Â…currently serving NSÂ…no wonder he was botak at that time.. and the worst thing to know isÂ…Â….the reason why Sky keep disappearing is because he has been stealing money from people, even StevenÂ’s money and handphone. Steven was very pissed off with Sky for doing that to him as he really treated him like a good pal. He told me that Sky has been borrowing his handphone secretly to call up girls and borrow money from them.. sometimes he will ask the girl to be his girlfriend and have fun with herÂ….so called both money and body is gainedÂ…Steven has known about my story and he thought that I was one of SkyÂ’s girlfriend and he said that I was lucky that I did not agreed to be his girlfriend. He mentioned that SkyÂ’s money is never enough as he has a girlfriend for 4 years who likes to spend money a lot. Super tua ah lianÂ…Â…who goes to cheong every weekend, go hang around etcÂ… To think a cheater will cheat girlÂ’s money to give his girlfriend suck his money..this is a real joke manÂ…Steven then told me that he is very sorry that he did not inform me earlier as he is also not very sure about my situation. I told Steven that I lend Sky money because I know he got his reasons but I really didnÂ’t expect him to cheat me as I really treated him as a good friend.<br><br>Anyway, Steven warned me not to believe Sky and lend him any more money again. He also consoled me to treat this as a lesson. I told him that I had no intention to look into this matter as I already very disappointed with Sky and wonÂ’t contact him anymoreÂ… just treat it as donÂ’t have such a friend. Steven then feel relieved and hang up. I felt relieved too, as I finally know the true storyÂ… After that, I had decided to forget about the matter and lead my normal life with EdwardÂ….<br><br>The reason for telling this story is to warn all of you not to trust people so easily, especially the ones you know online, you never know their true colorsÂ…Â….<br><br></div>
