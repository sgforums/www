            <div class='col-md body'>fericia:<br><br>urmm.....being a guy i would say the you is being rather unreasonable. how can she expect sky to talk to her and only her? is sky only supposed to be happy in company, and detest the company of all other girls?<br><br>and speaking from a perspective of a guy, me and my other guy friends agree that its very annoying when girls "play games" and expect us to read their thoughts. they tell us to do something, but expect us to do the opposite. as far as us guys are concerned, when we are not happy, we say we're not happy, and then we negotiate. if can't negotiate, we argue abit, then avoid the topic, and forgive and forget. i think the way some girls tend to harbour grudges for sooooooo long is very immature.<br><br>during the dinner, didn't sky keep saying he'd already promised to keep you company? isn't that being sincere enough? what more do you want? he -did- sit in the sun for a few hours, and choose to keep you company instead of the other girls which he was more familiar with, showing that he -wants- to get to know you better.<br><br>i think getting jealous about something as trivial as this is being really really childish. since you kept asking him to go, and being unfriendly about it, he probably just figured you were being moody and having pms or something and listened to you so as not to annoy her. how's he supposed to read your emotions? please lah don't be unreasonable and expect him to know that you mean the exact opposite of what you say. and stop pitying yourself. you were at fault for getting angry over nothing and saying something whilst you meant the total opposite. most guys i know at least are usually very simple. you not happy about something, you just tell them. don't need to play games like that. i really don't mean this post as a flame, but i've been put in a situation like this by a girl before and its -very- irritating.<br><br>have you ever asked yourself how you react and feel if you were sky? if he wanted to behave the same way, he could have said that you weren't sincere about meeting him since you were working all the time, and then he could have insisted you go home instead of going out with him after you finished worked, and then get upset that you listened to what he said. do you think that's being very reasonable and fair? and i don't think he's a flirt. what's wrong with smiling at the smses and calls he receives if he's being friendly? what do you expect him to do? shout at them and frown each time they call and sms him? lets say he knew about edward, and he had the same mentality as you, he could have gotten upset too right? how would you react to that if it happened?<br><br>and last time i checked, it doesn't matter whether the guy goes after the girl or vice versa....so no need to feel awkward about it.<br><br>ok i think i've said what i wanted to say....anyway i really don't mean to upset you. and this is what i'm telling you and i really mean it. just try to see things from a different perspective k?<br>anyway good luck with it<br><br>[This message has been edited by chamenos (edited 14 May 2002).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Part 5 -  CounterStrike and Me<br><br>3 days had passed..since that day I met Edward and he got my hp no from May, he had been trying to ask me out for a date but I really had no mood to hang out. He had been in low spirits due to the fact that he had quarrelled several times with his girlfriend. As a friend, I can only advise him to be more patience on relationship matters. Y can't I tell myself that too..? Edward has mentioned that his girlfriend has being complaining that he was not being concerned enough for her. I do not know his girlfriend in real so I do not have much to comment and being an outsider, I think they should settle these things between themselves.<br><br>Me myself also quite tired of my own stuff. These 3 days Sky has been messaging me almost everyday around 3 times each day,  stuff like "hi are you angry with me?" "Y didnt see u online nwadays?" "are u ok ?" "i am worried for u"." ..take care of yourself .".you always fall sick...remember to eat ok.." However, I did not reply him. I really unsure of myself of what to reply him. Perhaps I want to cool down and think over. I must sort out my feelings..what kind of feeling do I have for him..Y do i get jealous so easily..its not my usual self..That's pretty petty...and unreasonable...Can't he have his own friends..Every night I think before I sleep, lying on my bed..looking at the stars from my window. For these few days..I have think it over..not to rush with this so call net relationship..Its rather childish to be in this state.I should take things as it comes ...I decide to be back my own self..and let nature takes its course.. So i planned to message Sky the next morning.<br><br>"Hi Sky! Sorry that I did not reply to your message. I had been busy working past few days. WellÂ…How have u been?"I messaged Sky the next morning. Within 10 sec, I gt an immediate reply. "Phew* u finally replied.Do u know I am so worried about you. I thought u kana kidnapped. I miss u so much.*hugz" I smiled when I saw the message. However, I decide not to be too happy and think so much as I should not take things easy..and not put too much feelings in this since now I can walk back after a short distance..I then replied him. "haha.I am ok.Don't worry. Must take care of yourself wor!.." then I did not replied further and he also didnÂ’t message me after knowing that.<br><br>At work, my colleagues was glad to see the sudden change in my mood. Maybe I was feeling rather down past few days, been thinking about Sky. Now, I talk as my usual self to them. They were glad to see my happy sweet face back. However, for times, I will tend to look out and stare at the seat where Sky sat on that dayÂ….seems like I had not totally get him out of my mind. I felt a shock suddenly. It was my hp vibration. Nokia hp vibration is always so powerful. Â“1 message receivedÂ” I saw. It was Sky. Why ? Why ? The moment I trying to get him out of my mind, he start to message me. I pressed on the left button to view the message. Â“Lynn, I and with my friends now playing CS around your workplace. Later I go find you when you knocked off to have dinner, ok?Â” Oh gosh..!~ HeÂ’s asking me out. This was the first time. But maybe is because heÂ’s near my workplace. I could not avoid him forever. Thinking that we could still remain as good friends, I agreed to meet him for dinner.<br><br>After I knocked off, I call Sky to find out where he is. There is no answer for the first time I called. I called the second time. Â“Hi Ya Â“ he said. The background was so noisy. PeoplesÂ’ voice and game sounds. Same to what I am thinking, he was still playing his CS. Â“you knocked off liao ah?Â” I was so surprised to hear what he had said..he should know the time I knocked off. I said Â“Its already 7pmÂ” He replied without concentrating Â“Oh is it..so fast ? I am still playing leh.Â” WOW KAO ..what does he want? He told me that he will meet me after I knocked off and now he didnÂ’t even realize what time is it. Â“Do you still want to meet ?Â” I said. Â“Yes, Can I meet you one hour later when I finished playing this ?Â” I really get so pissed off by what heÂ’s saying..seems like he has no sincerity in meeting me at all. Â“Its ok, you continue playing. LetÂ’s meet some other days..ok byeÂ” and I hanged up the phone. I decide to go home and sleep to forget this.<br><br>10 minutes later, my hp rang. Â“Hello Lynn, I am coming out to meet you now. See you in 15 minutes at Mac.Â” I was shocked. Just few minutes ago, he has been so obsessed playing his CS game and now he said that he wanna meet meÂ….I really canÂ’t understand him. Â….<br><br>to be continued...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Part 6 Tears<br><br>He came wearing a big t-shirt n bermudas with sandals. I stared blankly at him and asked "Why did you change your mind meeting me?" He replied "XiuMei told me to come meet you" XiuMei is one of the few girls from IRC but she's very close with them and often ask them out. "She tell you to come then you come...dn you think you are lack of some sincerity in asking me out? Anyway, forget it. Why you so urgent ask me out ? Any important matters ?"<br><br>We found a corner and sat down. Sky took out a cigarrette and smoke, looking down without saying anything. "Lynn...I am going away for some time..." I Was shocked when I heard that. However, to confirm what he was saying. I asked "you going away ? Holiday ?" He replied.."No..My parents wanted to send me to Australia for further studies.this will take 2 years..".........."Huh..?!~" I replied then remain silent.....Why does things happened so sudden...He's going to leave ....earlier on I am still so jealous about the girls....suddenly he's leaving me....suddenly feel my eyes watery...but i must control..not to let my tears drop..."Oh well...thats good. By the time you are back, you are with a degree, can go for your desired area of work and earn lots of money!" I smiledÂ….......<br><br>Sky stood up and heading towards the dustbin to throw his cigarrette. The shops nearby were playing one old song, Â“NothingÂ’s gonna change my love for youÂ”. It was a nice song, especially hearing this song with him around. After that he turned and walk towards me....I could feel that he's not happy about leaving. Should I say "Can You stay Becos of me..Dn leave here or anywher?" No i can't..this is his own life..besides..I am not his girlfriend also.. He walked close to me and look into my eyes deeply.. I just stare at him controlling my sadness. The next moment, I found out that I was in his arms. He was hugging me so tightly saying "Lynn....I ....don't want to leave you." I was so touched by what he had said..my controlled tears all falls on my cheeks.. I raised my hands and hugged him, even if that's the last time. I forget everything, just be in his arms...We remained at that position silent for a long time..till he could sense that his collar is wet.."Lynn...Sorry to make you cry over me..pls don't cry...pls...I don't wana see you sad..." the more he said the more i was crying...he kissed away my tears softly.......for certain times..his lips were so close to mine...   my heart was beating so fast....I suddenly stood up and all imitate actions stopped.. I wiped away my tears and said "I am not sad..I am too happy for you..you will have a good futureÂ…..Â” I smiled and punch him lightly on his chest Â“DonÂ’t you dare to forget me!Â” He caught hold of my hands tightly saying Â“I wonÂ’t forget you.Â” He let off a while, found a seat and sat down, pulling me to seat on his laps, hugging around my waist from behind. His ears touched mine and I turned to see his face was so close to mineÂ…Â”Will you wait for me?Â”Â” he asked.. I was stunned when I heard that. DoesnÂ’t that means we are couple when he asked me this question. He never asked me before. However, our actions now already seems to be like a couple.. Maybe this is called natural. My heart immediately replied Â“YES I will..Â” but my words did not came out from my mouth.. Â“Wait for you?? We can still chat online, right ? DonÂ’t think so muchÂ…technology is so good now..You can also call me using autoroamingÂ…or email me when you are not busy with your homeworkÂ….. ...and..." I could not continue anymore....and so i stopped..<br><br>Sky looked at me sadly but smile a bit and hugged me tighter. We remained there the whole night and I would never forget that song.<br><br></div>

There's a couple more Felicia(s) that I know during my course of live when I was still in Sec Sch and my NS life. Dunno which one you are if you happen to be one of them. But anyway if you're interested in becoming friends, can email be &lt;beingfunny_1999@yahoo.com&gt; or icq me @ 19569168.

True or not we're the party involved, nothing much can be said to judge it. just enjoy it and let it flow. Just like, the Chinese drama, Zhen Qing, that you guys have in Singapore right now..

Secondly, my IRC nick is totally different from this one that I use. Used to use "Zippy", "Funny" only on even fewer occasions I will use "Bear". That's becoz of the reason I can't use "zippy" when I sign up for this forum, and use "Bear" because of my hph cover then.. ehhehe~<br><br>ANyway you're welcome to add me into your icq list or email me to bond friendship... =)<br><br>------------------<br>()""()     ************************<br>( 'o' )     Barely Bearing Berry Belly Bear<br>(,) (,)   =======================<br>(.)_(.)
