            <div class='col-md body'>A Real Life Girl's Story: Troubled Heart Part 1: It all began with MIRC<br><br>I am a happy go lucky girl..my hobbies are sleeping, swimming, going out with friends, hanging around shopping, watch vcd n tv, sleeping, eating, never think of wat's gonna happen tomorow...<br><br>One day, i met my gd fren on the streets whom i nv contact for very long about few yrs. We talk and exchange nos. Sometimes, we will go out for dinner and window shopping trips. Soon, we become v close frens. She mentioned that her greatest hobby is playing MIRC and she greatly recommended me to start playing MIRC cos she knows I am quite bored at home and also I nv play b4. (while she thinks is v interesting as she had played it for a few yrs)...so one stary nite at home, i was quite bored ...no tv...no vcd to watch...i suddenly remmebered my fren in MIRC and i decide to dl the program and my love story starts here....<br><br>I played MIRC for about 1 and half yrs. However, i seldom met guys on the net.i always dl music from there or to know the latest news happening in some channels..probably my idol's channel..i jus talk to know more frens...I have one  thinking ...that is..MIRC is nothing to do with real life..once i switched off my PC everything will go back to normal in my real life..i do back my own things..and i will nv go and think abt the ppl i chatted wit in MIRC..<br><br>One fine day...i noe a guy frm irc.in one of the channels i went in...he's an interestin guy...likes to joke around..and v knowledgable.......we started as net frens and chat whenever we see each other online. As time goes by...i start to sms him those love sms or jokes whenever someone forwards me these interesting msgs. This is really not like myself...cos I had mixed MIRC with real life...Later, we start to talk over the pone and teasing each other ..abit talking cock...bt sometimes i did told him abt my things..<br><br>Slowly, i realise tat i call him almost everyday, sms him almost everyday...thinkin of him everyday...so i become irc addictor...go home straightaway on PC cos he is sure in net if hes at home...<br><br>When we chatting on pones, sometimes i tend to joke with him saying .."i miss you v much u know.." n stuff lidat lor...bt actualy is real no joke bt i talk in a jokinly manner (in case he don like me then i v the pai seh one leh..)...then he replied "i miss u too".i was shocked cos he is not those so call flirty type..hes a bit shy..[forgt to add that he is older than me 2 yrs..he is studying while i am working...)and he wont call gals up..is mostly i called him up...so i tink i am like courting him...bt who cares nw is 2002 liao...i aso scare throw face bt dono y i nv care n i am the one who call n sms him every time...<br><br>One day...i finally take the courage to tell him i like him...then i ask him back if he likes me too...(here is realy throw face for a gal to ask that..*feel tat i am more n more like a guy courting a gal..)...and he replied "like" (rather cool...) then i was so unexpected for the ans..n like most gals i ask him the same Q "u always tell gals like that ah?""u always like girls so easily?" and he replied "beleive it or nt.i oni told u"..wow tat was so.....i feel v happy bt aso dn trust him completely cos we nv even met each other BEFORE! not even exchange pictures. we become closer after tat nite confession over the pone...and we continue our net or so call pone relationship ? (but aso canot say relationship ...)....<br><br>Time dot dot dot n pass..as a gal...i tink tat is nt enuff...i want to see him ..he had asked me to met before but becos i don usually met net frens so i always rejected him...bt nw when i told him i wanted to met.he rejected me!.then i suggested exchange pic..i showed him my pic and he say i am not ugly (cos earlier i keep saying i am ugly b4 he see my pic)..then i force him to show me his pic too...n he did...he is normal looking...(i aso dn care abt look jus wana see nia) then i was v happy after tat cos at least we gt an idea hw we look like...(i always tink cyber relationship is v stupid..nv expect to happen to me...).....Everyday i feel v happy chatting with him...but i know gd things wont last long..and this is a bit adnormal cos we nv see each other before...i understand that..one behaviour is sure to have some difference between MIRC or real life or pone.............Maybe i am greedy...i always think that is not enuff........so i made a decision....<br><br>to be continued...Part 2..stayed tune.....<br>(welcome any comments if any..)<br><br>[This message has been edited by Fericia (edited 10 May 2002).]<br><br>[This message has been edited by Fericia (edited 10 May 2002).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Part 2 Our First Date<br><br>As usual the next day, I went online to look for him and chat. As usual, he met his IRC friends in a group for his outing. He was telling me how much he enjoyed the night before when he met his IRC frens to cheong. I felt rather left out everytime, thinking if only I can really spend time with him in real life, how nice will that be! However, I also fear that he might run away after meeting me because of my looks. (You all know IRC guys 80% all see looks!!!) Finally, I took up the courage and asked him Â“Shall we meet also?Â” I waited quite a long time for my answer. He then replied Â“You really want to see me?Â” Â“Of course, donÂ’t you think its time for us to meet? We cant continue like this forever. ArenÂ’t you curious to see me also?Â” He agreed and I immediately told him to meet the next day. He felt shocked as it was quite sudden.<br><br>I was thinking if he really mind my look and run away when he sees me, I will just forget about him. (I can just spend one whole day swimming Â…hope it might help coz I haven really have so deep feeling for him) However, I also think about what are we going to do when we meet. Hope that it will be a great outing. I dressed myself up (Actually only combed my hair and tidy myself, coz I donÂ’t make up or wear nice skirts or dress like other girls). I arrived first and waited. (Also bio around see which guy look like himÂ…wow eyes damn tired sia) then suddenly he sms me say he saw me and asked me to walk further up. I was so blured when I saw that, thinking that he had see me in real but..but I still haven see him lehÂ…so I so like ah gong thinking, opening my mouth and my eyes while searching for him. I stopped for a while and I saw a guy in 20s  from far keep looking at my direction. He looked dark and was very much shorter than me. He got that kind of Â“pervert faceÂ” as he was smiling with a cunning look at me. OPPs I thinkÂ…..NO no How come so different from picture one. Â…people in IRC really use fake pictures I thought.. hesitating if I wanted to walk a step more to him.<br><br>Suddenly, I felt a tap on my shoulder. I turned and saw a guy smiling at me asking Â“Are you LynnÂ”. I felt a shock maybe I was too engrossed thinking about the guy just now. I open my eyes big big and said Â“huh?Â” It was really embrassing. Within a few seconds, I sort out and realized that this was the correct Sky I was meeting. I was like just woken up and quickly replied Â“OH ya ah .. huh Ya I am Lynn, You are sky ?Â” he nodded his head laughing at me. Maybe he was thinking I like Bai Chi like that lor. Then I saidÂ” you should have approached me earlierÂ…I thought that guy in front was you. He laughed and said Â“How would I know ? hmmÂ…lets go..Â” We then walked out of the place. Sky was a ok looking guy. He wear spects which make him look very decent and boyish. HeÂ’s slightly a bit taller than me. We headed for our lunch. Along the way, we chatted like in phone. I was very happy, smiling all the way, thinking that everything had run smoothly for us. I was really really happy as I finally can see him and spend time with him in real. I feel so fortunate. (So I like Bai Chi like that, gong gong smiled for the whole dayÂ…the worst thing is I donÂ’t even know I am smiling till my mouth aches.) We had our lunch, shopped the whole Suntec, Marina Square and Raffles City. I find him a nice person to be with. Then, we went to catch a movie at night thinking that it was a great movie and rather bored of shopping. (coz really nothing for us to shop liao..nothing to buy in mind also).<br><br>In the cinema, we sat together and joked during the commercial before the show starts. During the show, I crossed my arms and he noticed it. Â“Are you coldÂ” he asked. He did notice that I am cold like other guys used to ask gals when they go see movies. So I smiled and say Â“NoÂ” He smiled and turned his head, continue watching the movie. After 20 mins, I really bei tahan coz is really freezing. So, I keep changing my sitting positions, like sitting on my hands. (ThatÂ’s a bit stupid hur) He asked me again Â“You very cold ?Â” I looked at him, before I can say anyting, my teeth was shivering and I say Â“ yea Â…Â” When he heard that, he smiled and hold my hand. He felt shocked when he hold my hand as it was really very cold. He rubbed my hand and hold it tightly. When I was feeling better, I took my hands off and continue watching. However, the same thing happen after 20 mins when my hands are cold again. So he noticed it everytime and he hold my hands throughout the show. I wonder if itÂ’s the show too boring or what. I fall asleep and when I wake up, I was sleeping on his shoulders. I felt so embrassed and thinking his shoulders must be very ache. He must have stayed in the same position without moving to prevent waking me up. I feel so sweet. I was thinkingÂ…how come things happen so fast. Its only our first date and we already hold hands and I already lied on his shoulders. Thinking of that, I quickly sit up and pretending to stretch myself so that I can released my hands from him. We then walked out of the cinema when the show ends. We walked and talk about the show. He teased me for sleeping halfwayÂ….We walked and walked till boatquay. Where we walk past the river and I think that was really romantic. (Lile TELEVSIONÂ…I thought.hehehe ) We sat near at the river bank and chat till quite late. So we parted and went home. At home, we met in net and chatted about our outing previously. As usual, he chatted with his net friends happily and I felt tire after a dayÂ’s outing. So I asked him to sleep early and I went to bed saying good night to him. In bed, I was thinking whats going to happen next. We did enjoy our first date. That was so sweet. I think of the places we went on that day, what he said, his reaction, his gesturesÂ…everything of himÂ…and slowly I fall asleepÂ….whatÂ’s going to happen next ?Â….<br><br>To be continuedÂ…Â…......<br>Comments time....pls comment .....<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Part 3: Girls Interruption..<br><br>The next morning i wake up with a shock and check my hp beside my pillow<br>whether Sky msg me the night before. He did msg me goodnight, like the normal<br>msgs i received from most guys. "Goodnight, sleep tight tight don't let mosquito bite<br>bite and sweet dreams!~"<br><br>I smiled at the message idiotly and save the message in my inbox. Then I jumped out of my bed and went online to see if he's in IRC. I on my PC while I went to wash up. Then I connect online and just as what I had<br>expected..I saw him.I was so happy. (He can sleep very late but wake up very early. While I slep late and wake up late) Then I greeted him and asked him if he had eaten his breakfast etc. We chatted a bit and he<br>said that his exams are coming and wanted to find a place to study. Earlier on, he always went studying with his friends at his school library so I was quite shocked that he told me that he wanted a change of environment<br>in studying. So I just jokingly suggested him to come my workplace to study.<br><br>I worked as a waitress in a cafe at<br>orchard. To my surprise, he immediately agreed.<br><br>- So, Sky immediately went offline to prepare himself to meet Lynn. As for Lynn, she never expect to see Sky so fast again. -<br><br>It was a hot day. I was having a busy time with my customers, serving coffee and making coffee. Awaiting to see the arrival of sky, I keep looking outside to see if he had arrived. I looked at the mirror to check if my hair was messy and I realised I was smiling happily. I slapped myself lightly and scold myself not to be so "Hua Chi" or bai chi.."No need to look...very pretty already.."said someone.<br><br>I was shocked and immediately think of my stupid reaction. THe voice was so familar. I turned and saw ...Skkky..OH is really a great embrassment to me...WOw kao...I was<br>thinking..to find a hole n dig to hide inside..Sky laughed at my reaction. He then asked me why my face so red then I looked at him and pretended nothing had happened. Then he laughed again..I laughed too..Another customer came up and ordered a cup of coffee. Sky looked at me and told me to cotiue my work as he did not want to disturb me working.<br><br>He then ordered an ice mocha and find a place to sit down outside as the place inside was occupied as the cafe's famous ice mocha coffee was in 2 weeks promotion offer. Unfortunately, he found a seat which has no shelter and sat there. I was thinking that he was rather stupid to sit there as it was really very hot.<br><br>One hour had passed, two hours passed too, I had been messaging Sky to shift to the seats inside as it was really hot outside. I could see him panting and sweating. Earlier, there was no seats available, but later there were some seats available but Sky refused to move in and asked me to concentrate my work. We had agreed to meet fr dinner after I knocked off. He had messaged me that his friends were intending to ask him to meet them at Marina for a billard session. I could see him keep answering his phone calls when he was studying. He looked really serious when studying. The only bad thing I feel bad is he keep taking out his tissue and wipe his sweat and his glasses.<br><br>After 2 more hours, I messaged him if he needs to go off to meet his friends. He say he is not meeting them as he had agreed to wait for me to knock off. Thinking for a few seconds, I walked towards him and talked to him. I told him not to wait for me so that he could meet his friends. His reply was "I already told you I wantedto wait for you to knock off.." I said,"its ok SKy, you go meet your friends..no need to wait for me..they keep calling you.." SKy replied that he did not know how to play billard but they still asked him to join them. I was curious and asked who they was. He said it was the bunch of girls friends from IRC. They were his usual hang out friends with his guy friends.<br><br>I was quite disappointed to hear that. Maybe I was feeling jealous, thinking that he always meet those girls out and this time it was he alone a guy with so many girls. Maybe it was not the first time. I walked away and ignored him imaging the scene when he was with those bunch of girls. I become more angry when I see him smiling<br>at his hp while messaging to those girls.<br><br>Time passed very fast. It was time for me to knock off. I changed my uniform back to my usual clothes, tshirt and jeans. I walked out of the cafe, seeing SKy already waiting for me at the corner. I feel soft hearted and touched, thinking that he had waited for me whole day under the hot sun.but...thinking about those girls, i turned black face again. He walked<br>towards me and asked me "tire or not?" I actually wanted to scold him but change my mind and shake my head. I smiled and asked him "you nv go meet your friends?" He kept quiet and replied "Lynn, how many times must I tell you." Hearing his reaction, I began to say some angry words "Go and meet them lor..don't let them wait..since they enjoyed your accompany so much.." and I walked in faster pace. He came up and stopped me in front. "I waited for you for few hours under the hot sun and you asked me to go meet them?" I feel bad and I looked at him and say happily "Sorry..let's don talk about that. What do you wana eat?" So, we end our arguement and went ahead with our dinner.<br><br>We went to have dinner at Mos Burger and we were happily talking and chatting about my work. I was telling him about my colleagues and my job. We talked about movies and I take the initative and asked "y not one day we go for a movie again?" He immediately replied "ok, sure." We continue our chat. We were eating halfway when his handphone rang and we both stopped talking.<br><br>I looked at his phone and knew that it was one of the girls who is calling him. He answered the phone and laughing when talking to her. He told her that he wasnt' going to join them as he was having dinner now. After a while, he hangs up and I pretended nothing happened and we went on with our conversation. One time, two times, three times, four and so on.. different girls keep calling up to ask him to join them and even sms him. He was busy replying and answering phone calls. Once or twice he tried to off his hp but later when he on it, they still continue calling him.. till I had finished my burger while he still have half of it unbite. We always got phone call interruption when I start to talk or he start to speak. I was becoming very pissed off.<br><br>Finally, I said "SKy can you listen to me?" "Yes, lynn I am listening to you..." Again his hp rang and he picked up his phone giggling and smiling while talking to his friends. I was getting more and more tire of this. Can't we have a proper dinner together. The moment I see him hang up his hp, I said in a low voice "Sky, you go meet your friends.I am ok. I can go shop alone." This time his reaction changed, "really?but I have agreed to have dinner with you..If I leave now..is like leaving you here alone.." I was quite disappointed to what he had said..He stayed only because he promised me and not because he wanted to? I continued<br>my angry way of speaking "I can go shop on my own later and go home myself. You go lor.Dont let them wait so long, see they keep calling you missed you so much!" He keep quiet and take out his hp to call one of the girls to ask where they are so that he can meet them. I feel like a thorn pricking at my heart. He really take my words seriously..how i wished he will say he stay...and not leave anywhere...but i was too tire to think anymore..."I will leave when I finished my dinner with you,"he said.<br>I replied "ok up to you." We then keep quiet all the while and his friends also stopped calling him after he agreed to meet them.<br><br>We finished eating and walked out of the restaurant. He stopped and asked me "So, where you heading now?" I replied "I went shopping on my own..you no need to care about me.Quickly go meet your friends now." Hearing this, he looked at his watch and said "ok, I go now. You take care.Bye" He turned and walked towards the bus stop. I looked at his back sadly...looking down on the floor. I could not describe how I feel now. I feel so lost and disappointed sudenly for what he had just done. He could just leave like this, without realising that I was unhappy. I stood there for a long time..thinking that afterall the whole thing was not as smooth as i thought.....<br><br>That night, he did not msg me good nite. I waited till midnight 3.30am then i msg him "I guessed you are not back yet. Anyway I am going to sleep now. Good night and take care.." I went to bed immediately as I was really tired that day and next morning was my morning shift. I did not think so much and sleep soundly. However, that night...I could not sleep well as I kept waking to check my hp if he had msg me..to my disappointment, he did not........<br><br>to be continued....<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Part 4: My new friend-Edward<br><br>RiNGgggg!~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~********...the alarm clock rangs.. as usualy, I throw the clock on the floor and continue with my sleep..It was really a tire night for meÂ…..I had waken up more than 10 times to check if Sky message meÂ…*sign but he did not..  I changed to my uniform and head for my work. As usual, I took MRT to my workplace, along the way, I took the Streats and Today newspapers to read. Flipping the pages, I saw advertisement on one of the movies Sky and I was talking about yesterday. Oh gosh..Sky again..I had been tired and yawning the whole morning now I thought of him again. I wondered what time he returned last night.. he must have enjoyed himself very much. The more I think, the more depressed I was. What to do..I am not his girlfriend at all.. even if I am his girlfriend, he got his freedom to go out with girls also.. I slapped myself againÂ…how can I thought of being his girlfriendÂ…He still far to be my boyfriendÂ…..I decide not to think about him.<br><br>It was a boring dayÂ…The cafÃ© was hiting mosquito after the 2 days promotion. I was very tired, sleeping with my eyes open. Â“Excuse me Miss Can you give me a piece of Strawberry Cake ?Â” I quickly stood up hearing there was customer talking to me. It was rather rude for me to stare blank like this. I looked up and was in shock. At first I thought if only it was Sky but that couldnÂ’t be him as it was a ladyÂ’s voice. It was May. She was TracyÂ’s (the one I mentioned earlier who introduced me play IRC) friend. I had only seen her once in pub when I went clubbing with Tracy. May knew Tracy from IRC too. SheÂ’s a nice girl to talk with. I often chat with her online. It was a surprise to see her again. ..Â”eh..you come here drink coffee ahh?Â” I asked..(rather stupidÂ…of cos drink coffee )Â…she replied Â“ya..i came here with my colleague to relax here for our lunch time.Â”<br><br>I turned and saw a tall guy staring at me (how long had he been staring at me?). He is tall, tanned and not bad looking..In fact he is really handsome..(eh ..i very seldom say people handsome one..how come I say him?Â…*bish myself*) I was staring at him looking at his sadly eyesÂ…(like tom cruise ..eyesÂ…) suddenly he say Â“hi I am Edward. Nice to meet youÂ” he took out his hands from his pocket wanting to shake hands with me.. I smiled but it was quite far to shake his hands from mine as the fridge was blocking my way. So I just waved my hands and say shyly Â“hiÂ…~ ~ Â” then I turned to May and served her order also telling her is my treat since she is considered to be a big visitor to me. They sat down and I went back to my work.<br><br>I felt a vibration on my pocket. It was my handphone. I had turned it to silent mode but vibration during work. I took out my hp and saw Â“1 message receivedÂ”. My heart was beating fast. It must be Sky, I wondered what will he message me. I unlocked my hp and pressed to see his message. Â“Morning LynnÂ…really Sorry..about last night.. I was so shocked to see the time you message me just now.. and was so touched you had waited for meÂ…u should go slep earlierÂ…anyway, hws ur day...remember to have your lunch..take care..Â” I smiled at his message. I should be angry with himÂ…I wondered why I still treat him so good..forÂ…what?!~?!~Â…I was hesitating if I wanted to reply his message..but I really donÂ’t know what to say to him at this momentÂ….should I ask him Â“did u enjoy ur nite with your girl friends ? that will obviously stirred up a quarrel with him.. so I locked my hp and decided not to reply him.<br><br>I heard a voiceÂ…Â“Lynn..Â” I looked up and to my surprise ..it was Edward. Â“May I know whereÂ’s the toilet?Â” I think for a second and pointed the way to the left without saying anything. (still thinking of the hp message Sky had sent). He smiled and headed to the toiletÂ…After he came out from the toilet, I can sense that he was walking towards my direction but was called by May halfway and so he returned to his seat shortly.<br><br>After 30 minutes, they stood up and May thanked me for the drinks and say bye to me. Edward did tat too and they both left. I looked at the time.. sign* 3 more hrs for me to knock offÂ…had no mood to work at allÂ…Â….my whole mind was SkyÂ…still thinking of his changing characterÂ… what to doÂ…Â…Â…Â…Â…let nature take its course Â…<br><br>When I returned home, I went online immediately. I kept thinking of Sky. I really wanted to talk to him so much. I went to grab my cd to play music and I looked at the main channel. I could see the girls chatting with him about last night outing. Again, I turned to despair.. don feel like talking to him again..or anymoreÂ… He seem happy chatting with them. Suddenly I realized a private chat message. I opened the window and it was Sky!. I felt that I was not forgotten.. He said Â“hi finish your work? Tire or not..*massage for u*Â” I replied Â“no nt really..Â” After that, he never replied. He was so busy chatting with the girls on his channel, teasing with one another about last nite outing. I decided not to look at it anymore. Seems like I made the wrong choice to go online.. I went offline and off my computer..and decide to go to sleep.<br><br>I was lying on bed, preparing to sleep. Then I heard beep beep sound. Â“1 message receivedÂ” I saw on my hp. Thinking that it might be Sky, I pressed to see, eager to see what he got to say now. I was wrong. It was not Sky. It was May. She message me Â“Hi Lynn, sorry to tell you..that I had given your no to Edward. He had been asking me for it.Â” Oh my gosh!~ how can she give my no to someone without my permissionÂ…but anywayÂ…I didnÂ’t think much as EdwardÂ’s impression to me is quite ok. So I donÂ’t mind having one more friend. I erase the message and I heard beep beep again.. I pressed quickly hoping to see it was SkyÂ’s name appearing.. but it did not. It was a no whom I have no idea with. I opened the msg and saw Â“Hi Lynn I am Edward. Sorry to get your no from May without your consult. Hope that we can be friends.Â” I was too tired to do anything.my whole mind i was thinking that Sky really didnt care about me.. I didnt bother to reply much...and was really too tired,...and i have no idea what to say to Edward also..so i just say sms Edward Â“its ok. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">Â” and I went to slep, I am not going to care whats gonna happen next.. now the most important thing to do is to sleepÂ…Â…Â…Â…..so I fall asleepÂ…Â…Â…Â…..ZZzzzzZZ**<br></div>
