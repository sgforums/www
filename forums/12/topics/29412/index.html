During the last few months in school, I have the chance to meet a girl, then in Secondary 2. When I first seeing her at the assembly area, I started wanting to be her friend.

Have to say, only 1 year at most 2-3 times, which include going back to school for teacher's day and chinese new year celebration.<br><br>Once, I went to school to look for her. I want to make friend with her. However, when she came out of her school, there was too many people. I do not have any chance to approach her. Therefore, what was in my mind was: Follow her to her place, at the void deck, walk up to her and ask her to friend.<br><br>However, upon reaching the place, I lost touch with her. Then I went home and went to irc. Surprisingly, I saw her there and she admitted that she is the girl. I told her that I wanted to be her friend and to be very honest with her, I told her I followed her home. Actually, I should not tell her. She was angry with me and I knew I was in the wrong.<br><br>How, I deciding whether I should stop this 3 years torture or not. Even if she really agree to be a normal friend with me, will we have any chance to go for a meal, show, etc? Will she? Will I get to see her often even? Worse still, I will be enlisted for NS very soon, prehaps mid of next year.<br><br>Should I rather go for my few best male friends instead, who are all without girlfriends?<br><br>I have been thinking of her these few days and it is making me sick.<br><br>I really hope that any of you can suggest to me.

The best way to to "personally" meet her and tell her your feelings. Nothing beats that in sincerity, but both must be willing party. Her reaction to you will be solely based on her maturity. If she's mature you might have a chance to meet, if not she might even hate you. But that's the kind of gamble we take when we go for the love of our life. Besides, it's better to clear things up than to have that suspense that's driving you crazy/sick.<br><br>To succeed, never fear failure....that's part and parcel of life.<br><br>sgboy....it's time to be sgman.....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  goodluck...</div>
