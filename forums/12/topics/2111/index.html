            <div class='col-md body'>Retrac,<br><br>Hi welcome to the forum aunt agony. Ermmmm generally here is a nice place, with some of us who are really willing to help. But of cos, there are just some idiots ard trying to make a hell out of this place.<br><br>Anyway to ans yr qns 1st........ hmmmm is 16 and 22 a big diff in age. Let me put it this way, a diff of 6 yrs......... hmmmmm well the ans is NO, IF the both of u r adults........ lets say both in the 20s or 30s like u r 28 yrs old and she's 22. But it did seems a huge gap now that since she's still a teenage (being 16) and u r already consider an adult, ermmmm get my picture. And sorry but lets be frank here...... do u think 16 is mature enuff? I dun think so..... do u still remember what u r like when u r 16? U r still learning i guess, most 16 yrs old are........<br><br>Yr 2nd qns.........can't really ans yr qns but just a few points u might like to take note. Yes its possible for a ger to mail u the whole day and everyday, but the fact remain that she might not like u (happen to me b4). Guess she might be bored and its just simply interesting to sms u as u keep her 'company' in a way. So it doesn't really prove much. And same like u, my close friends doesn't do that also, as in sms me whole day.<br><br>How to let her know u like her? Well just tell her the truth........ face to face if u can and if can't just sms........ and see what's the reply like. E.g, got reply or she simply avoids u...... a good way to test water u know, and can avoid much embarassment somemore.<br><br>In short, its not esy, from what i see....... but still, my advice is try! or at least fight for what u want, the rest just leave it to tian yi!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Wish u luck.<br><br>Regards<br><br>------------------<br>nOthiNg iS ImpOsSibLE In tHiS wOrLd<br>EvEn tHe wOrD ImPoSsiBLe SaYs "i'M pOsSiBLe"</div>

It's about the MENTALITY....<br><strong><br>2 - How to know if she likes me?</strong><br>ASK her DIRECT... &lt;- That is the MOST LIKELY of a chance you'll find out from her the answer... And according to how you describe your situation, likelihood of getting an answer through this way is QUITE HIGH (&gt;85%).... But of course the CHANCE would vary again subject to changes MAINLY to her characteristics.... If you want a more 'accurate' answer from her.... CHOOSE a more appropriate time to ask her that question... (NB. 'Appropriate' as in suitable.. Not when she's TOTALLY IMPRESSED by you... Under that kinda circumstance she might give you a WRONG answer (because she's MISLED-likelihood HIGH &lt;- Only 16..)THEN it's your OWN PROBLEM liao....<br>Whatever it is, just accepts that as the ANSWER.... If you have 'little doubts' you can still 'try 1 or 2 times more' or 'pin a hope'... BUT.. DO NOT PESTER her... DO NOT PRESUME (Notice from your writing that you've got a very good 'presuming fantasy'....<br>That's my advice for now... Whether she's really 'mature' enough for this relationship you should know better than I do.... But I can sense 'stirring airs' in this thing...

            <div class='col-md body'>The answers to the 3 question....<br><br>I first got to know her thru IRC. Then I found out that she is and i was in the same eca.... anyway i still carried on my intrest in it even after i graduated from my sec. sch.<br><br>How well i noe her... honestly, i'm still discovering her character.<br><br>I met her quite often during the preparations for two competitions in which she was mostly with her team and i was with mine. However, i did talk to her but not too often as i didn't want too many people to gossip. She does have a problem at times when going out because she is the only child and wat's more a gal.... quite strict, her parents.<br><br>Other then that, i would call her and spend quite a bit of time talking to her.<br><br>I'll be going out with her tomorrow. I'll see if i have the chance to ask her.<br><br>For the moment, i tink that we do have things in common to talk about and our jokes are on the same frequency. She usually get 'suan' by me, but i'll always make sure i don't over do it.

We start in the morning, depends on who gets up 1st, until at nite, who decides to go sleep 1st.<br><br>Recently, she had her cheena O level papers, durin that weekend before the papers, she told me that she quite scared and so i send her encouragement notes (sms). On the nite before the paper, i gave her a call and talked to her for a while. She sounded quite happy talking to me. &lt;-maybe to me only. I ended by wishing her all the best and to take care.<br><br>I've asked a few gals already but i really want to confirm, being prepared for the worst fears.<br><br>In all logic, why would someone decide to sms another person for the whole day, every weekend? Even all my close friends don't do that.<br><br>How should i approach her and tell her i like her?<br><br>however, she recently send me an email saying her h/phone kenna cut liao tat's why she never sms me. she wrote a long email abt her parents wanting her to study and updated me on her holidays.<br><br>In all logic again, i tink she might like me, but i'm not sure because of my past experiences.</div></blockquote>frm my pt of view 16 and 22 is nt realli a huge gap,as long as the both of u have something in common to tok abt its quite okie.<br>firstly i would like to ask, does dis ger have any close frens? if ur ans is NO, then probably,shes regarding u as her close fren,some1 who is willin to lend a listening ear.if ur ans is YES,then theres a great possibility dat she sort of had a crush on u.shes onli 16,nt realli dat mature so i assume shes nt dat sure of wats true love.y dun u hint her or simply ask her?comon, u r a guy!its better than guessing rite?<br>anyway, wish u the best of luck!!<br></div>
