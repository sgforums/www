Cos I am having problems lately and cant sleep well. Neighbours upstairs will start to drill things early in the morning. Its either that or the Rag and Bone collector (Galang Guni) keeps pushing the horn and shouting! And all these at 8 or 9 plsu in the morning when the previous nite I slept at 4 - 5 am!!<br><br>Wonder where did all those considerate ppl go? Somemore the Garang Guni think even happens on Sun!!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>in sinagapore, there are laws governing the use and noise disturbances by people using  public spaces or between neighbours.  it is just that the authorities are to damn lazy to search for them.<br><br>it is even stipulated how many people are allowed to gather at void decks and not to distrub residents staying there throughout the day.  it applies to any public spaces.  by the way public does not really mean the PUBLIC as in free for all and can be loud noise and party.  there are strict public laws and that includes noise human noise disturbance.<br><br>the time factor as highlighted in the 18 jun 2005 SAT ST newspaper forum that police will only repsonse to noise between 10.30pm to 7am is stupid and irresponsible.<br>what happen to words , case by case, safety and so on.<br>this spokesman is setting a standing order of the time for all to follow and even worst for those loud noise trouble makers to follow and make as much noise to the discomfort of residents.  its is saying don;t disturb the police between 7am to 10.30pm if you want to complain any fighting noise, gangster harassing resident noise and so on.<br>even police offiers on night shift needs to sleep in the afternoons, pri shcool morning sessions needs to sleep by 9pm so that they can wake up by 5.30 am.  now if a resident complain about rowdy gangs of yuouth singing loudly in fornt of this ground flr unit , the police can don;t response.  hooligans like to make loud noisers for the purpose of distraction so that they can commit crimes.  as resident shut themselves tight or leave flats, then these hooligan can commit petty thefts or breakin.<br><br>if not everyone can go around evrey where and make a lot of noises.  ever wonder why they never build basket ball courts, street soccer courts next to town council, hdb office, police station or even CCs especailly for street soccer.  the impact noise is just too loud even for them.  so it basically push noise problem to residents.<br><br>it is very straight forward , any time 24 hrs ,  as long as someone complains and needs police help with excessive human loud noise related to crime prevention, safety, disorderly behavour, peace and public disorder and security issues   They must response  as in the order of priority with the cases at the time.</div>
