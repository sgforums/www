              <p>Hello. <span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">I hope someone would chance upon this post and give me some advice. </span></p>
              <p>I am currently working in a local bookshop as helper after completing my pte O Levels last year. I got 18 points. Although the grades I get are good enough to enter poly but I chose not to. </p>
              <p>It may seem strange but If you ask me what kinds of career I wants to work in, I won't say I wants to be a lawyer, a doctor, a teacher or those main stream jobs that students are striving to enter. In fact, what I really want to work as is either being a library assistant that helps shelves the books, displaying, a postman who delivers letter to the island-wide or a canteen store owner. Really. </p>
              <p>I've seen office people, and sometimes I will be like .. .wah ... their face really very stressful. I won't want to work like that ... although the pay is high ... but are there really true happiness? </p>
              <p>As many says, having more education is important but I don't want to waste my family's money anymore. </p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Instead of counting on them forever, I chose to go outside to work to support myself. I find that it's not right for me to continue asking them to pay for my education fees when I might not succeed in getting a good grade or get into a good uni after that. If it goes the wrong way, their money will once again be wasted which I don't wsh to see that happen.</span></p>
              <p>Working in the bookshop, some may say it's a job without much pay and that I don't have a ambhitious heart. But I always felt that someone has to do the job anyway. For me, I really don't mind working in this field. Some may look down on me, but I am really happy working there, and that's the happiness I can never find in school. Working scenario can be tough but at least I don't hurt anyone. That's the most important thing that I deemed as my life quote. </p>
              <p>Basically, In my life, I just wants to live a simple life, without hurting anyone and just live by through a stable job. Education wise, currently I have no plans on going to back to study really. I am not academically inclined anyway, definitely no point for me to continue studying when I might not succeed in getting to a university. Instead of throwing the money into the sea as a bet, I rather work my ass off and live a ordinary life. </p>

              Hey BloodXavier, maybe you are just sick of being stressout with your studies. Ok, it seems you probably in a blur state right now and plus that you probably thinking about your NS if that what you are thinking of, doing something else before enlisting into NS and probably continue your studies after your NS?
              
              Anyway, I see that you are actually interested in books and reading is your hobby for past time. Ok, how about doing something that would interest you more about books? You can work for a publishing firm and from there you can learn many things about publishing or being a publisher. And then, if you want to become a publisher, you must know how the books, magazines, newspapers etc are being done. You must know about printing and its production. In printing firm you can learn about the various type of papers and also about the printing machines. You can work for a printing firm to know more about that business too. 
              
              So once you know the business about printing and publishing. You can become a publisher and publish whatever books, magazines, periodicals etc plus you have your own printing company.
              
              How about that?

              <p>And what happens to you if the book shop close down ?</p>
              <p>Are you able to sustain yourself if that job no longer exist ? Are you able to find another book shop to work ?</p>
              <p>The kind of job you have right now.. is a low barrier of entry job. That means anyone can do your job. You have no job security.. at all.</p>
              <p>If someone is willing to be hired at a lower cost... you will likely lose your job and be easily replaced by... anyone who is qualified... which.. is not difficult to find in Singapore.</p>
              <p>You must understand that in any business... the boss is only interested in cost and profit. This is something you don't learn in O levels.</p>
              <p>This easy job, easy life..who don't want ? When I retire liao.. I also go look for this kind of easy life job.. with my life experience and low pay requirement.. how are you going to compete with me ?</p>
              <p>Sure.. I say as long as you are happy... but pray hard you won't lose your job in the near future...</p>
              <p>An education helps open doors... it does not guarantee success... it's a tool... and the fate of your life depends not on the tools.. but how you wield it.</p>

              <p><br>it good to be independant and not living off parents. you can wor your job at the moment and have a feel what's it slike and if the feeling will last or not. you are young and in life things change, circumstances and people's point of view and feelings about their own life.</p>
              <p>here its not like western country or japan countryside you can live peacefully and usually no one will find you trouble. in complicated city like spore, you need top have cert and education to arm and prepare yourself for any change of the weatehr or turn of the tide.</p>
              <p>your disceprtion of your loving job now lots of foreign cheap labor can do it. its a matter of time before a foreign cheap talent replace you when they can beat your salary. trust me the boss will hire alternative.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>meanwhile you can still do what you like, but take up a course or 2. since your grades can make it just hold your o cert and wait up for a while. if later in life you find that you wantto go for a higher education, just do it. meanwhile try to pick up a skill or learn something, get a certification for them as certification really helps. </p>

              In that case I see advertising industry is your best bet. You look around for an advertising agency in Singapore and see whether you can get in. At the same time, you should lookup for mass communication courses....that is what your skill is going to be...it deals with advertising industry....target audiences, media buying, copy writing, script writing in the mass population. Its an interesting career and will meet all kind of people...and interesting clientele. You are still young and many years ahead of you...you can learn lots of things in advertising.

              <p>And what happens to you if the book shop close down ?</p>

              Are you able to find another book shop to work ?</p>
              <p>The kind of job you have right now.. is a low barrier of entry
              job. That means anyone can do your job. You have no job security..
              at all.</p>
              <p>If someone is willing to be hired at a lower cost... you will
              likely lose your job and be easily replaced by... anyone who is
              qualified... which.. is not difficult to find in Singapore.</p>
              <p>You must understand that in any business... the boss is only
              interested in cost and profit. This is something you don't learn in
              O levels.</p>
              <p>This easy job, easy life..who don't want ? When I retire liao..
              I also go look for this kind of easy life job.. with my life
              experience and low pay requirement.. how are you going to compete
              with me ?</p>
              <p>Sure.. I say as long as you are happy... but pray hard you won't
              lose your job in the near future...</p>
              <p>An education helps open doors... it does not guarantee
              success... it's a tool... and the fate of your life depends not on
              the tools.. but how you wield it.</p>

              <p>On the other hand, I agree with your sentence that education helps opens doors as in more career opportunities will be visible however I will only study again through my own money. </p>
