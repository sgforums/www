            <div class='col-md body'>hey guys i would like post my fren's case here since it is partly related to this topic, hope u can help me out. A few days ago i had a long chat with a good friend of mine, basically he has most of the symptoms listed by u guys towards a particular girl, but he wants to forget the person and move on as it brings him too much sadness and the problem is he cannot forget, i never really came across such problem before so i did not know what to say to my fren. After further asking, i learnt that he made some mistakes before and thus chasing the girl is almost impossible, as for being friends maybe, erm note he did not do anything harmful to the girl yea in case u guys are thinking otherwise.<br><br>My fren also said it saddens him whenever he sees the girl as it reminds him of his mistakes, i thought since they have both graduated seeing each other should  be quite unlikely, i was wrong as he said he saw her a few times within 1 or 2 weeks, at places he didnt really expect to find her and even asked me why is he so unlucky. lol, i do not really know how to answer or help him. Alright after hearing, my pov is that my fren seems to be still hanging onto this girl, its like half hanging on half wanting to forget, sigh this guy used to be a cheerful fella who dont give a heck about this kind of girls stuff, so fellow AA friends pls help my fren out, what should i say to him? btw hes going into army very soon, not sure if it will make the situation worse..</div>

A few days ago i had a long chat with a good friend of mine, basically he has most of the symptoms listed by u guys towards a particular girl, but he wants to forget the person and move on as it brings him too much sadness and the problem is he cannot forget, i never really came across such problem before so i did not know what to say to my fren. After further asking, i learnt that he made some mistakes before and thus chasing the girl is almost impossible, as for being friends maybe, erm note he did not do anything harmful to the girl yea in case u guys are thinking otherwise.<br><br>My fren also said it saddens him whenever he sees the girl as it reminds him of his mistakes, i thought since they have both graduated seeing each other should  be quite unlikely, i was wrong as he said he saw her a few times within 1 or 2 weeks, at places he didnt really expect to find her and even asked me why is he so unlucky. lol, i do not really know how to answer or help him. Alright after hearing, my pov is that my fren seems to be still hanging onto this girl, its like half hanging on half wanting to forget, sigh this guy used to be a cheerful fella who dont give a heck about this kind of girls stuff, so fellow AA friends pls help my fren out, what should i say to him? btw hes going into army very soon, not sure if it will make the situation worse..</div></blockquote>Keep himself occupied.. hang out wif friends.. try not to be alone, if not he'll think abt her again.. like what's mentioned earlier.. time will heal his wound =)</div>
