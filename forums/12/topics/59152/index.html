            <div class='col-md body'>Have u ever felt like u were belittled? Well, for the past 2 Semester, i used to be late for lessons and end up missing classes, thus not knowing what is going on. So my classmates would assume i would fail. When i dun write notes, they would just say things like:" WAh so PRO ar?" But the fact is tat i was listening and would get notes later. So i passed all my modules for the past 2 sems. And some of them who even went to lessons, failed some.<br><br>This sem, its the same thing all over, my grp has got 3 gals, 2 of which are really good frenz and 1 is really a hypocrite. BUt now, even 1 of the 2 gd frenz start to talk in a way tat she looks dwn on me too. When she's dwn, i'll console her. And yet now, she speaks as if i am going to fail and speaks in a manner such as:"Do u noe hw to do this? its not simple u noe as i myself dun even noe." Thus i decided not to go soft when they act to be good. As for the other hypocrite gal, when she passes a test, she just go so happy bout it. When she fails, there are ppl who tok bout their passed test, and she will start to gossip bout them. There are more evil thigns bout her. I noe them coz i was liddat many yrs ago. And these few days, i want to change as i had many bad n sad memories. BUt their actions really make me furious and kinda wanna "pull" the old bad me "alive" again... Its really torturing... I go sch and there i will be, left out and belittled. I tried not to bother but these are direct actions towards me. I really wish to kill them now. I noe if i used old me, they will surely end up horribly... coz i used to have a mouth that will only spread unhappiness among a grp if i want to. I dun want this to happen again... HeLp...<br><br>And yeah, i am starting to feel the evil me back... really very agonising...</div>

I noe it feels horrible.. I'm an easily-hurt person too... so some of my frens' comments do come down harsh on me.. Well.. those people whom i bear a grudge towards or treat me so poorly, I just simply dun treat them as my close frens!<br><br>Why not U try to distant urself from those people who antagnoize u? hehe.... I mean.. maybe u are happier alone.. I am fortunate i have other close frens who stand by me...<br><br>Hope u find better frens soon.... Don't think so much abt their comments.. but think if they are sincere frens who are worth befriending... Cheers!</div>
