The reason why some people read about their Sun Sign (or very often, grossly mis-term as horoscope - horoscope and Sun Sign are two different thing) and realise that some parts or most of it doesn't apply to them is because Sun Sign is only ONE aspect of your entire birth chart - I give it about 10%, if I divide by 2 luminaries and 8 planets (the percentage will be smaller if I include major asteroids).<br><br>Obviously, you can't get very much stuff from, say a 5-10% view of your ENTIRE birthchart.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by 'L':</div><div class="quote_body">nation, dun believe in star signs, it's nt as accurate as chinese horoscope. chinese horoscope more accurate cuz it is linked to ur birthdate, birth year n everytink. for star signs, every1 hab bits of personality frm each of the star signs, it's oni a matter of which personality traits u hab more.<br><br>actuali it's all in the mind. like my best fren, his horoscope n his gf clashed v badly, bt in the end they overcome obstacles n stil happily 2gether. it's more on how both parties wan their r/s to be, in the present n in the future. hehe! </div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Actually western astrology also needs birthdate, birth time and birth place - it's no difference from chinese astrology. I don't blame for your ignorance because most people don't know. If you wanna talk about which is more accurate, it's not the method - <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>it's about the proficiency of the person doing the reading.</strong></span><br><br>The fringing thing that is damaging the image of western astrology is because of commercialising - people feel it's fun to read in that manner, like from a magazine or newspaper because it's a causal, fun read. But I can tell you those stuff are crap - as mentioned, how can the whole world's day be divided into 12?<br><br>In fact, one ethics of professional astrological (American Federation of Astrologers) is NOT to get involved in those commercialising channels and making forecast WITHOUT formation of birth chart and providing inaccurate readings.<br><br>Hope this is clear. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

The reason why some people read about their Sun Sign (or very often, grossly mis-term as horoscope - horoscope and Sun Sign are two different thing) and realise that some parts or most of it doesn't apply to them is because Sun Sign is only ONE aspect of your entire birth chart - I give it about 10%, if I divide by 2 luminaries and 8 planets (the percentage will be smaller if I include major asteroids).<br><br>Obviously, you can't get very much stuff from, say a 5-10% view of your ENTIRE birthchart.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Actually western astrology also needs birthdate, birth time and birth place - it's no difference from chinese astrology. I don't blame for your ignorance because most people don't know.

But I can tell you those stuff are crap - as mentioned, how can the whole world's day be divided into 12?<br><br>In fact, one ethics of professional astrological (American Federation of Astrologers) is NOT to get involved in those commercialising channels and making forecast WITHOUT formation of birth chart and providing inaccurate readings.<br><br>Hope this is clear. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers     [/b]</blockquote>So I'm actually just an amateur...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>

Not as bad as the other way round I guess...?<br><br>From the way I see it, she probably might not have much settled down... Even if she has, her pattern might still be more or less the same..?<br><br>She is a person who swings by the mood... It's just to what extent she 'swings'... It'll would be unwise if you allow your temper to swing along with her... Your temper is more classified as 'wierd'. But on the will to exercise control over temper... You probably have much more of an advantage than her...<br><br>Give her more room and space... Give her more CARE..  SHOWER her with that even when she's throwing tempers at you... You'll be REWARDED (when her mood turns for the better). Give her ROOM to be on her own if she really needs to be ON HER OWN. Have ya thought of why she could really be ignoring you...? I suggest somehow she knows that she might not be able to control her upsetting temper infront of you BUT do not wish you to suffer her 'nonsense' at the same time... That's why she's ignoring and avoid you... Another possible reason could be that you're tying too tight on her... She needs to breathe and SPACE to do some things which she just so happens to feel like doing...<br><br>Hope this help?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
