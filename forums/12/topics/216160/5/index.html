Yr situation somehow looks identical to me.<br>I've been with my gf for the past 4 mths. Everything seems so smooth in the 1st and 2nd mths, we talked about anything under the sun. Very little barriers. I used to not giving in too much. When she called when i'm outside with friends, i'll talk to her a little while and end the conversation fast. But after a while she will called or sms again. She treated me very good.  Like how a gf should treat a bf. But somehow, things started to get out of hands... She got a lot of friends, who always asked her out. She used to meet me on fri and sat , sometimes sun. Now,  she meet me only fri, or if  not sat. Reason? She misses her friends and long to meet them to catch up with them.<br>But after sometimes, i realised she really treat me very good, why should i be so strong and firm to her? i started to give in and treat her well. After a terrible quarrelled, (i'm not going to elaborate. too long) She told me to give her up.. but of coz i couldnt bear.Becoz i give up, it looks as if i'm the one giving up. Then i asked her to go think properly before making decision, ended up she say , dun think so much, take one step at a time. Things went back normally after tht, of coz not smoothly as it was in the beginning of the r/s. i'm wondering if this r/s can be salvage? When i treat her not tht good, then she listens to me. When treat her very good, she started to pull furthur. Whats wrong with girls nowadays man...?</div>

Whats wrong with girls nowadays man...? </div></blockquote>There is nothing wrong with girls nowadays.<br><br>The problem is that sometimes we also want space for ourselves, just like guys everywhere. During the honeymoon period, meaning the first few months when you started a relationship, of cos the attraction will be really strong and you will feel like sticking to each other because there are so much to learn from one another. But after that initial period, usually the couple will not stick to each other that much anymore and will long for some sorts of interaction with their friends outside of the relationship.<br><br>There is nothing wrong with this...nothing wrong with not being as close as during the beginning of the r/s. This was something I did not understand as well at first, but now that I think of it, every couple should learn to give space to each other.</div>
