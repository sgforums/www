I knew you would say that I sound like that...no Im open to challenges to my opinions. Everyone is entitled to their own thoughts but I believe I gave a very realistic point of view.<br><br>Allow me to clear things up k? Here goes:<br>Im not giving suggestive opinions. All along the girl shows signs of low feelings to the guy. You want evidence: Avoidance/Dun want to talk/dun feel like talking/Arguing/saying its her fault... it's all very common female behaviour when the girl gets turned off slowly...We just have to ask ourselves logically.<br><br>Does a girl with high feelings towards the guy do all that kind of hurt ? Does a girl who likes me hurt me? See my point? I m giving a point of view that is only common sense.<br><br>So you see, Im not saying it's the girl's fault. No where did I mention its her fault. It's her feelings to the guy that are at fault here. And the poor guy did it by giving in too much and showed too much of a nice guy. Nothing wrong with being a nice guy logically speaking. But what kind of result do we have here?<br><br>Hey Im not saying be an evil guy either but sometimes the poor guy has to speak up for himself and know his own position, know his stand properly. Make it clear to the girl. Dun be taken for granted. It's the cause of many heartaches. "Im treated her so well and she treated me like crap?!" We want to treat girls well but they have to earn it.<br><br>doko<br></div>

I had this similar experience of having a gf that ditch me almost in a similar manner. Though that period of time i did sense something is wrong but only drag on for a while b4 i made any confrontation with her. Sometime when time is not on ur side and she has made up a decision to be with someone else she feel more comfortable with you only had to give her your blessing.<br><br>Its difficult to move on, most probably for everyone. My world crash when she told me that she is going to be with her ex, during that period of time i had only like few days b4 my exams commence. i manage to survive both on the emotional side and sch stress by just hanging out with friends. I believe your exams should be nearing. Make your move to confront her asap. If its gg to be a painful break do it now, unless she gave u the opportunity to salvage the situation which i do not have the other time round.<br><br>It will be crap if i put in words like asking you to move on. those posts that said this probably never had these sort of experience. I can only say that time will be able to heal all the wounds. Indulge yourself with school works or daily activities with friends will make your day much more easier to pass. though when night falls you will be thinking of her. Luckily for me i manage to complete my studies, without much effort cause i really didn't have the mood for anything  . But never take the risk and gamble like me as i feel that its sheer luck that i manage to get through.<br><br>Give me a pm if you really feel like finding someont to talk to.</div>

My views are open to be challenged so that you can see many sides of the picture instead of just a small part of it. So no, I dun think too highly of myself and neither do I think Im wrong either. Im very sure of myself because the girl's actions speak the loudest.<br><br>The thing is Im not going to force it down anyone's throat to accept it like it is because it is your own free will after all. But like I said, I am very sure of myself that I only read the girl's actions to determine my opinions match the real reason behind everything.<br><br>As for practicality, where's your basis for saying that? Don't get me wrong. I respect you as someone senior as well as other posters.  Your insights are definitely valuable, serious. Maybe you can't accept my ideas as the truth but I tell you what I think. It's definitely part of the whole truth, if not the whole thing.<br><br>I don't want the guy to be treated like crap when he does not deserve it. Don't get me wrong. Im not trying to tell him to be a bastard either. He just needs to be reciprocated. I believe he is a good guy who just cannot believe why it appears to be like this. Forget the whole bullshit about to love is to give. A true r/s should be fair and square.<br><br>As for the truth, I will face the truth if the r/s is not meant to be. I will only be true to myself after all. I'd rather be happy than to be a slave to unrequited love.<br><br>After a long text, hope you dun get offended by my politically incorrect ideas lol. Just hope Im making sense to you...I want more gd guys feel they are being satisfied in a r/s.<br><br>doko</div>

Either the girl wants the power or the man over the other party. I say it's usually the girl. Girls want to be pampered and be treated like princesses. Not all girls give in the r/s.

Some say they met eye to eye and dated. Some took longer time and confess their feelings and got together. Some are more direct and just tell them. Many fall in "love" based on the initial feelings and heat of passion because they want to feel the emotions of the moment. They rarely consider the consequences of dating on impulse unless they had in mind to date ONLY and nothing else involved.<br><br>It is beneficial for those who post their problems in AA and for the many people who give their suggestions, views and advices. On the one hand, the troubled can find many options and ponder upon it. On the other hand, the people who read the problems and postings can learn a few good things as well as to what will they do if they are in the TS's shoes.<br><br>Beers.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

Just that u cannot accept the truth atm. You cannot change her overnight but if she loves u, she will consider your feelings and not give u heartaches everyday.<br>Cool off from her and see how she reacts.

It is very stressful for a person who dates a very high emotional maintenance person.  that could be the reason why your relationships usually last only half a year.<br><br>Another thing.  You are showing that you are so weak!  Gals dun like weak guys!  Learn to stay cool, or at least for a start, appear cool (then slowly learn to stay cool).  Take things easy!  Don't be so uptight.
