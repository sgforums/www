Some say they met eye to eye and dated. Some took longer time and confess their feelings and got together. Some are more direct and just tell them. Many fall in "love" based on the initial feelings and heat of passion because they want to feel the emotions of the moment. They rarely consider the consequences of dating on impulse unless they had in mind to date ONLY and nothing else involved.<br><br>It is beneficial for those who post their problems in AA and for the many people who give their suggestions, views and advices.

I have already told TS from the start that he can choose to accept or ignore my comments. As much as I think other guys' posts are important, I definitely know what I am saying when I posted my comment. As such, I do not think I am biased because I do not rationalise behaviours. The reason I stick to my own beliefs is because I know what I am saying. Combined with other posters opinions, it does not confuse threadstarter. In fact, the whole truth can be seen.<br><br>I dunno what you mean by saying Im avoiding the loophole. Care to elaborate? Perhaps at times I was not too specific in my explanation. The main focus in on the TS's plight here. I do not want to argue but you kept saying I want to argue. This is supposed to be a friendly discussion. TS's situation is more important. That is the reason why I do not want to argue with you over my "so-called biased" opinions.<br><br>If you said my mindset was not correct, what is your definition of a correct mindset then? Are you saying that your mindset is the absolute mindset for all to adopt? Please enlighten me on this.<br><br>Nowhere did I belittle others' posts. I even encouraged TS to read good posts. I posted my comments and let TS decide himself. I repeat, I DID NOT belittle others' comments nor pick on them. If you notice carefully, most of the time I advise TS. I don't know how or where you get the idea I belittle people.<br>Are you saying that disagreeing with people is called belittling, in your definition? As much as I welcome people disagreeing with me, I believe I have the right to disagree as well.<br><br>As I said, the focus is on TS, not on my mindset/opinions/whatever. I don't wish to get personal. I do not wish to argue with anyone. I wish to receive/give constructive feedback.<br><br>I shall reiterate again.

BUT that is a GOOD thing (in moderation). cos it shows you CARE about him.<br><br>FailureOfTheNation, if u really treasure this relationship, think abt it, did u do anything wrong? talk to her, make her talk to you. clear things up.<br><br>you might wanna apologise first. it helps to cool her down before attempting to talk to her. so do something sweet, something nice for her.<br><br>u can msg me if u like a listening ear...</div>

Try to keep your emotional turmoils under control. It's ok to be 'disturbed' if it does not excessively bother you too much.<br><br>Keeping your emotions in check does not mean you don't do anything. It's cool that you try to resolve things calmly there afterafter.. But REMEMBER... The period whereby you're thinking too negatively and confused is the same moment when disasters are more likely to happen.. Especially if you have that period prolonged..<br><br>Do your gf know about or have seen you in such turmoils before?</div>

I have already told TS from the start that he can choose to accept or ignore my comments. As much as I think other guys' posts are important, I definitely know what I am saying when I posted my comment. As such, I do not think I am biased because I do not rationalise behaviours. The reason I stick to my own beliefs is because I know what I am saying. Combined with other posters opinions, it does not confuse threadstarter. In fact, the whole truth can be seen.<br><br>I dunno what you mean by saying Im avoiding the loophole. Care to elaborate? Perhaps at times I was not too specific in my explanation. The main focus in on the TS's plight here. I do not want to argue but you kept saying I want to argue. This is supposed to be a friendly discussion. TS's situation is more important. That is the reason why I do not want to argue with you over my "so-called biased" opinions.<br><br>If you said my mindset was not correct, what is your definition of a correct mindset then? Are you saying that your mindset is the absolute mindset for all to adopt? Please enlighten me on this.<br><br>Nowhere did I belittle others' posts. I even encouraged TS to read good posts. I posted my comments and let TS decide himself. I repeat, I DID NOT belittle others' comments nor pick on them. If you notice carefully, most of the time I advise TS. I don't know how or where you get the idea I belittle people.<br>Are you saying that disagreeing with people is called belittling, in your definition? As much as I welcome people disagreeing with me, I believe I have the right to disagree as well.<br><br>As I said, the focus is on TS, not on my mindset/opinions/whatever. I don't wish to get personal. I do not wish to argue with anyone. I wish to receive/give constructive feedback.<br><br>I shall reiterate again. I want to have a friendly discussion.<br><br>I respect you as a moderator.<br><br>Thank you<br><br>doko</div></blockquote>I do not wish to waste my time on you for now.<br><br>Ask yourself what are you doing in AA.<br><br>Let your HEART be the ANSWER to whatever you've said.... Whatever you questioned... Whatever you did... Whatever you tried to show....<br><br>I do not ask of you to follow absolutely of my mindset... Each of us is an individual here... You are who you ARE....<br><br>Just be RESPONSIBLE for YOUR ADVICES...<br><br>GOOD DAY. <span style="font-style: italic;">And hopefully a better one tomorrow....?</span></div>
