U try ur best to do everything right and to please her. Obviously, it's a turn off to her. It also reveals a lot of your insecurity by those that I highlighted in red above. Big big turn off for many girls as it's a show of ur no-confidence.<br><br>This could be a vicious cycle, cos u had 4 failed ones (6 mths each) and now the fifth.

Im going to analyse your story paragraph by paragraph. Along the way if I sound crude, dun take it too personally. I was like you as well until I learnt not to take girls too seriously. My two cents below. You can choose to take it or believe it but what I am saying is pure common sense based on female behaviour. Here goes:<br><br>First para: You only knew your gf for 6mths and you said it meant something to you? Ok guy, time to wake up.  It was just an illusion on your part because your feelings in her was too high while her feelings are getting lower every day.<br><br>Second para: You only knew her for 6 mths and you already see her as your future wife? What load of crap is that? 6mths is not a long time. What made you see that? Some ppl were together for 10 years and cracks still occur. Why? Don't ever feel that she is the one for you. She has to prove it to you. Obviously, she did not and all she did was to hurt you. You need to work on getting more self-respect here.<br><br>3rd para: You can give in but not giving in to please her. Sometimes women like guys to take control. You must always be in control. Not controlling her but controlling the direction of the relationship. Take charge, not giving in. That's weak. And what do you mean by giving in? Is it allowing her to control you and giving her presents all the time when she says she wants it? Are you losing your sense of pride here? Are you not able to say no in her face sometimes and tell her to wake up?<br><br>4th para: Next time u see her and she seems like "ignoring" you, it means her feelings for you are dropping. She don't feel like seeing you...not tired, not paiseh, not other reasons(excuses?) she gave. Don't bother to ask her. Don't give a damn. It makes you appear you are begging for her permission to appear happy to you. Just say "hi" and get the hell out of there! If she doesn't, prepare to eject from the r/s.<br><br>5th and 6th para: If she really loves you, would she not bother you? Of course she will! Stop making up excuses for her! It's obvious she has low feelings for you. Oh, she likes you so much that she talked to other classmates and completely ignores you huh?! Don't take that personally.<br><br>7th para onwards: No, not pms or whatever excuses you want to make up for her: She just have low feelings. You are a typical nice guy who gives in and gives in and she keeps pulling away and pulling away. Please, guy, control your feelings, if not it will reach a point where you might do something that might hurt yourself... all these for a girl?!<br><br>Suggested solution: Take a step back and hang around with more friends and socialising with more female friends, especially. Withdraw and allow her to contact you, hopefully. If not, just get out of the r/s and mean while start to date other girls. There is NO SPECIAL ONE  EXCEPT YOU. Remember Mourinho, ok Jose?(if you are into soccer). The one who gets out first suffers less. Remember, be a man and dun take any crap from a girl when due respect is not shown.<br><br>Good Luck! You still have us to confide in.<br><br></div>

Do not pressurise her. Pressure does not work in any situation, especialy for girls. The more you do,  the more she will pull away from you. Now I know why she kept pulling away from you...because you always pester her. Pestering is a form of pressure. Learn to relax.<br><br>Just get out of her sight and wait for her to contact you.<br><br>And the reason you flop because you care too much about the relationship. That's an irony, huh?<br><br>But it's better now, because you can start to look at other women for a wife dude.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by dokono:</div><div class="quote_body">Hello Guy,<br><br>I know you put in a lot and you invested a lot of your feelings into this r/s. Im going to analyse your story paragraph by paragraph. Along the way if I sound crude, dun take it too personally. I was like you as well until I learnt not to take girls too seriously. My two cents below. You can choose to take it or believe it but what I am saying is pure common sense based on female behaviour. Here goes:<br><br>First para: You only knew your gf for 6mths and you said it meant something to you? Ok guy, time to wake up.  It was just an illusion on your part because your feelings in her was too high while her feelings are getting lower every day.<br><br>Second para: You only knew her for 6 mths and you already see her as your future wife? What load of crap is that? 6mths is not a long time. What made you see that? Some ppl were together for 10 years and cracks still occur. Why? Don't ever feel that she is the one for you. She has to prove it to you. Obviously, she did not and all she did was to hurt you. You need to work on getting more self-respect here.<br><br>3rd para: You can give in but not giving in to please her. Sometimes women like guys to take control. You must always be in control. Not controlling her but controlling the direction of the relationship. Take charge, not giving in. That's weak. And what do you mean by giving in? Is it allowing her to control you and giving her presents all the time when she says she wants it? Are you losing your sense of pride here? Are you not able to say no in her face sometimes and tell her to wake up?<br><br>4th para: Next time u see her and she seems like "ignoring" you, it means her feelings for you are dropping. She don't feel like seeing you...not tired, not paiseh, not other reasons(excuses?) she gave. Don't bother to ask her. Don't give a damn. It makes you appear you are begging for her permission to appear happy to you. Just say "hi" and get the hell out of there! If she doesn't, prepare to eject from the r/s.<br><br>5th and 6th para: If she really loves you, would she not bother you? Of course she will! Stop making up excuses for her! It's obvious she has low feelings for you. Oh, she likes you so much that she talked to other classmates and completely ignores you huh?! Don't take that personally.<br><br>7th para onwards: No, not pms or whatever excuses you want to make up for her: She just have low feelings. You are a typical nice guy who gives in and gives in and she keeps pulling away and pulling away. Please, guy, control your feelings, if not it will reach a point where you might do something that might hurt yourself... all these for a girl?!<br><br>Suggested solution: Take a step back and hang around with more friends and socialising with more female friends, especially. Withdraw and allow her to contact you, hopefully. If not, just get out of the r/s and mean while start to date other girls. There is NO SPECIAL ONE  EXCEPT YOU. Remember Mourinho, ok Jose?(if you are into soccer). The one who gets out first suffers less. Remember, be a man and dun take any crap from a girl when due respect is not shown.<br><br>Good Luck! You still have us to confide in.<br><br></div></blockquote>thanks. makes senses. perhaps its time for me to start being a man...</div>

Stop pressurising her.. can't you see that yet you keep pushing and pushing? Communicating is not the only way. Communication is one of the ways. Have you ever heard of the subtle art of body and facial language communication? Women are more good in that area.<br><br>The reason she mentioned incompatible is because she is constantly kept turning off because of your constant giving in. She will not tell you that but gave you another BS because they are not usually direct. They do not want to hurt you. Do you dare to ask her if she is losing her feelings? That is what I call communication. (which I do not recommend because you will accuse her )<br><br>Dude, there is nothing wrong with you as a person. She will say it's her fault. Yeah, it's her own feelings that are losing steam(because you gave in too much)<br><br></div>

All women test guys. That is where the man can see if he is called the true MAN. The woman wants to see if the bf is a real MAN to be worthy of her baby. It's about protecting his own stand.<br><br>I feel that in areas of r/s especially, guys should learn to hold back and not attempt to rush in to fix things. That's because it means pressure to the woman. The guy should feel as if it does not affect him. If things get bad, prepare to get out. No one likes cracks to appear.

It's not that you are not ready, in fact you will never be ready as a matter of fact; you are just afraid of the consequences.<br><br>I always feel that people prefer to target themselves as the blame (that they are bad/lousy) to conclude the relationship, than to end the relationship amicably because it has to go.<br><br>People always mention that Love needs no reason to be together; similarly, it needs no reason for one to leave as well.<br><br>P.S: I believe you have your own plans now, therefore, I wonÂ’t put anymore words.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>
