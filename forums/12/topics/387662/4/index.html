              <p><br>Of course if you ask any people in their 30s, they would want to be married and have kids lah. But real life it is actually not the case. In metropolitan singapore, it is not exactly easy to find the right person. But if one cannot find romance, what to do? It is not their fault, it just happen to be fate. I know a lot of guys are so desperate for relationships that they get fooled by haopors who only want to play around with them and cheat them. It is better to face the facts and live life, trust in your religion that one day god would help you find the right person, have faith than to live in suffering endureness.</p>
              <p>I read an article about a woman who had to suffer divorce and her mother pass away, causing her distress and memory loss. And then came her child, she has to raise and support him alone. She is working in a lowly paid job and too poor to afford transportation, walks one hour to get to work. Her 14 year old son now plays truant and mix with bad hats, she now has no choice but to send him to boy's home to prevent him from causing trouble. Lesson learn here: 1) There are people worse than us 2) Do not simply wish for marriage, some marriage are breakdown or lead to divorce 3) Of course don't give up - seek genuine relationships, a girl/guy whom you can trust, respect you and you like a lot. 4) Watch out for ungenuine haopors who go out there to seek public exhibitionist, want to lure you out in the open in front of everybody so that they can embarass you and increase their market value. These haopor women only want to cheat you only. They are fakes so you have to tell fake from genuine. It is a waste of time to be with haopors, when opportunity comes, they take the slightest excuse to dump you. These haopors take advantage of your desperation to get married. Do not show your desperation and also don't get desperate or else people would take adv of you. Therefore seek long term rships that can lead to marriage. Do things to increase your self-esteem and prepare you for relationships.</p>
              <p>Trust me, Jack Neo feels like hell now, you wouldn't want to be in his shoes. It is so embarassing for him and his family.</p>
              <p>You think marriage very fun? I have a friend who is married but hardly sees his family due to reasons i can't say. Although you see their family during festive holidays and they look happy together, but behind the curtains - you can sense their tenseness. Do not judge book by the cover. Just because you see your married friends put on a happy family look - you don't know what is going on behind the scenes. Marriage also a lot of heartache. Wife can be a handfull.</p>
