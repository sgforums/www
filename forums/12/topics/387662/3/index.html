              <p>One can delude oneself and stick to one's opinions/views and lull oneself into thinking that one knows 'all'. In other words - it is merely perpetuating ignorance. Having an open mind means  the willingness to put aside one's prejudices,beliefs and be open to differing views. That does not mean one has to embrace,imbibe or subsribe.</p>
              <p>The predicament is many only hear what they want to hear and see what they want to see. That in itself - speaks volumes of oneself.</p>

              <p>depends on age group and ur living condition.</p>
              <p>some are still young or still sheltered. havent kena shit yet so of cuz they will say 'no'.</p>
              <p>some are too shallow, the enjoy the material shit in this life that have no permanence, they will say 'no'</p>
              <p>some jus seem to have it all-for now and they enjoy it, so they will say no.</p>
              <p>The above are jus good example of how pampered most Singaporeans are-embarrassing</p>
              <p>some have religion meaning and purpose, so they will say no. but they understand how u feel as they probably wrestled with that question themselves until they found the answer, these people will help you find your meaning to existence.</p>
              <p>for me is a Yes, i felt that way, still feeling that way, but gonna crawl out soon.</p>
              <p>mean while you can read a book by Viktor Frankl 'Man Search for Meaning' this is a good book to ponder.</p>

              <p>Like you do not know what you want in life.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You do not know what job/career you want to work as and you just change from 1 job to another until you are coming to 30 years old/already 30 years old/or maybe even 40 years old already.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You are old already but still do not have a career. You are alone by yourself got no gf/bf/husband/wife.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You don't even have close friends at all.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Everyday you go to work and force yourself to do a job that you hate with long working hours, shitty boss and collegues and miserable low pay. After work you go back home and watch tv and sleep and the next day the same routine goes on.</p>

              <p>You write like this mean you r a big loser. Only losers can think like this. I dislike people who write this kind of rubbish, it is like saying to people who are not married in their 30s are losers. It is all in the mind. Get rid of your stigmatism.</p>
              <p>Work sucks, so what? Take the challenge. Got one haopor there disturbing you? Take the challenge to repel it. Learn.</p>
              <p>Just because a person is 30s and married doesn't mean they are much more happier than you. I know a friend who is married but he is not happy because the wife wants things run her own way. I know another friend whose kid is suffering from leukemia, and he and his wife are having sleepless night, worrying over the child.</p>
              <p>What is happiness? It is all in your head. It is even a challenge to take a breath of air into your lungs. What is that? It is a smell of freedom filling your gills.</p>
              <p>Hard to find close friends? Then go out there and get one, two or ten. Dunno how to do it? Then learn. Now there is a new objective in your life. Learn how to find friends. At least youhave one more reason to know why u are living for.</p>
              <p>Hard to find wife? Then learn. But beware. There are many ungenuine women out there who pretend to like you. They are public exhibitionist, they like to use third party and get you to go after them in the sight of public - draw you in the open to make a clown out of you.</p>
              <p>Go look for legitimate relationships, you go for your choices. Don't care about what people say to you, you have your own opinions. You want a gf or wife who can be your friend, not the fakes out there or the haopors who come to harass you.</p>

              <p>You write like this mean you r a big loser. Only losers can
              think like this. I dislike people who write this kind of rubbish,
              it is like saying to people who are not married in their 30s are
              losers. It is all in the mind. Get rid of your stigmatism.</p>
              <p>Work sucks, so what? Take the challenge. Got one haopor there
              disturbing you? Take the challenge to repel it. Learn.</p>
              <p>Just because a person is 30s and married doesn't mean they are
              much more happier than you. I know a friend who is married but he
              is not happy because the wife wants things run her own way. I know
              another friend whose kid is suffering from leukemia, and he and his
              wife are having sleepless night, worrying over the child.</p>
              <p>What is happiness? It is all in your head. It is even a
              challenge to take a breath of air into your lungs. What is that? It
              is a smell of freedom filling your gills.</p>
              <p>Hard to find close friends? Then go out there and get one, two
              or ten. Dunno how to do it? Then learn. Now there is a new
              objective in your life. Learn how to find friends. At least youhave
              one more reason to know why u are living for.</p>
              <p>Hard to find wife? Then learn. But beware. There are many
              ungenuine women out there who pretend to like you. They are public
              exhibitionist, they like to use third party and get you to go after
              them in the sight of public - draw you in the open to make a clown
              out of you.</p>
              <p>Go look for legitimate relationships, you go for your choices.
              Don't care about what people say to you, you have your own
              opinions. You want a gf or wife who can be your friend, not the
              fakes out there or the haopors who come to harass you.</p>
