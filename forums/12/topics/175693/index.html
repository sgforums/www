Because everytime I go out, inevitably some guys/girls will happen to look in my direction, so if I think like you, I would probably think that they fancy me and thinks I'm handsome and they want to get to know me, so to safe myself from being gang raped by them, I would want to stay at home... But, wake up lah, , they may look because of the sh_it in the eyes or nose, or even the veggie stucked between the teeth... Don't jump to conclusions so readily as it shows your maturity level isn't quite there yet.</div>
