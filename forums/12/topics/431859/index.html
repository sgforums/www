              <p>my dad seems to favour my younger siblings over me.he talks to them nicely, plays with them, talks to them. i'm not jealous, but i feel hurt.</p>
              <p>the last time i told him about a problem i encountered in sch, he brushed the topic aside, and told me firmly to go shower because i was smelly and that i should be more hygenic, etc. </p>
              <p>*ouch*</p>
              <p>although i'm doing relatively better for my studies as compared to my siblings, i feel very left out and not appreciated and recently, i lost my motivation to study. and i found that i felt better when i was doing things for my cca, because i was being recognised, and the friends i have there are really appreciative and i feel a sense of accomplishment when events go well. however, this led to another problem because my dad has a issue with me coming back late, and recently, he told me "i don't care what you do in school, so long as you deliver the As" refering to my A levels which are coming, end of this year. it feels so demoralising, to hear that all my dad wants from me, are my "As". </p>
              <p>please help.</p>

              <p>Since u r the 'lau-da', eldest child, I guessed he wants you to lead by example, behave better and more matured than yr siblings.</p>

              <p>Dun feel bad. Keep the communication line open, wide open. Keep talking to him even though he didnt response or reply. He will sense it one.</p>
              <p>Dun just bring yr prob to him or ask questions. You shld also contribute some solutions &amp; suggestions to everyday things. You must let him feel that you are PART OF THE TEAM.</p>

              hmm.. not sure.. maybe your father likes you the elder son to be independent and mature, but your siblings he enjoy treating them as children to play with.  He told you what
              he wants from you, that he thinks it is good for you, but never want to control your life or how you live your life.  Mabye your father thinks you are not independent and mature enough, that's why he don't like to hear your problem and discuss it with you like a small boy.
              
              or you are not your father son.. oops..
              
              anyway dont think too much..

                                love from your father. No wonder your brother hates you.</p>
                                <p>Your crappy result make you end up in Poly diploma. And now you
                                are a total failure. No wonder your father don't want to talk to
                                you la.</p>
                                <p>Now we know why you always hang out with that littlemissbonkers
                                because you need a fatherly figure from a monster which hide in the
                                drain.</p>
                                <p>Your father don't like to talk to you, cibaikia, because you are
                                a total failure, he got no face to look at you.</p>

              limeapplestick,
              Whatever we or you think are the reasons, it does not matter. 
              Maybe you are the oldest and during those years, he was learning how to show love, and did not know how to? Maybe he expects you to lead by example?
              It really does not matter.
              Just do what you need to do. I can see you are a very responsible and nice person. Continue to do so. 
              He loves you la. I can feel it.
              I love my daughter too, but sometimes, I forgot and I nag at her also "Why dont't study? watch YouTube foe what? YouTube can give you A's meh?" as
              But I love her, and am trying to be nice.
              It doesn't matter what others feell about you. Just feel that you're a lovable person.
               You control your happiness.  Don't let others take that control. 
              Keep smiling.

              haha... i used to feel that same way too because my dad always compares me with my bro and that favouritism still shows quite evidently. But as time passes it onli makes me realise more than what matters is how u see urself.
              
              TS i hope u realise that what's important is how you see yourself and not how your dad sees you. It can be kinda sad that all he wants is As from you but just take it positively and not let him affect you.It is only important on how you see yourself and not others.
