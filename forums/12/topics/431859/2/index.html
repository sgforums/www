              <p>2. sorry, maybe u have parents. but really sibeh hard to tell sia from ur behaviour. cuz u behaved like u got parents to bring u to the world but no parents to teach. so i dont blame u for behaving like this and for stealing people wife. but if they got try to teach u then whos fault is it? ur useless parents for failing to teach u or u are jus too fucked up to learn how to be a decent person?</p>
              <p>3. im nt angry at u. cuz obviously u dunno anything (what do u noe anyway?) and anyhow shoot only. like what ur father did to have u.</p>
              <p>4. how to be even more disappointing in life than u? if theres a grade to rank guys attractiveness u are prolly right at the bottom. no career no money no looks no character no qualifications</p>
              <p>5. any fat fuck can bounce a ball and claim to be playing basketball. u are still a fat fuck. 95 kg fat fuck</p>
              <p>sorry again, u are really a loser. have a nice day.</p>

              <p>my dad seems to favour my younger siblings over me.he talks to
                  them nicely, plays with them, talks to them. i'm not jealous, but i
                  feel hurt.</p>
              <p>the last time i told him about a problem i encountered in sch,
                  he brushed the topic aside, and told me firmly to go shower because
                  i was smelly and that i should be more hygenic, etc. </p>
              <p>*ouch*</p>
              <p>although i'm doing relatively better for my studies as compared
                  to my siblings, i feel very left out and not appreciated and
                  recently, i lost my motivation to study. and i found that i felt
                  better when i was doing things for my cca, because i was being
                  recognised, and the friends i have there are really appreciative
                  and i feel a sense of accomplishment when events go well. however,
                  this led to another problem because my dad has a issue with me
                  coming back late, and recently, he told me "i don't care what you
                  do in school, so long as you deliver the As" refering to my A
                  levels which are coming, end of this year. it feels so
                  demoralising, to hear that all my dad wants from me, are my
                  "As". </p>

              <p>You may think it is hurtful for your father to tell you go wash up because you stink. You take it so personally it affects the affection you had for your father. But in fact, you are stinky, you are unhygienic.</p>

              <p>There's no cure for stupidity. if you can make smart choices, life will be more fulfiling than sulking for the lack of affection from your father. Your dad can only "validate" your success, but you are the one who truly benefit from your efforts.</p>

              <p>However, your As in study results will affect your future academic success, which may in turn help you in your career. CCA.. not so much. So you need to weigh in the activities and what you choose to forgo.</p>
              <p>While you desire your father's validation, he is not the one living your life.</p>
              <p>There's no cure for stupidity. if you can make smart choices, life will be more fulfiling than sulking for the lack of affection from your father. Your dad can only "validate" your success, but you are the one who truly benefit from your efforts.</p>

              <p>Getting As is not going to mean you can make it in your future, it all about moderation, as long as you are discipline, focus, work abit hard and smart, you can make it in life even without Aces, as for parenting, parents do not know or unable to differentiate if they had inequalities in treating their childrens, to them, they assume that all are their children and all are equality treated. But from the children perspectives, they can see, feel and judge the unequal treatment, feel betrayed and jealous.</p>
              <p>This is common among all families with more than 2 kids, be it rich or poor, parents are your parent, not your boss, you do not need to curry flavour them for something.</p>
              <p>Some old minded parents dote sons more than daughters, but end up son giving them more problems, and daughter is alway there to help them. Daughter like me and most in the world have a heart for parents, they are more close to them, for sons, most will leave the families and some even married off and get controlled by their wifeys.</p>
              <p>Just like my case, my brother seem like married off, that is why i must be wary of my sis in laws, she is up to grab our asset, luckily my Dad realised now that I am more filial piety than his son, but then, I also need to be skrew inorder to wills under my name.</p>

              <p>Parenting - like all other tasks - gets better with practice :)</p>
              <p>I'm an elder daughter too, and I think the way my parents 'handle' my younger brother is much better than the way they handled me!</p>
              <p>For what its worth - its really tough to manage teenage daughters. We tend to be more sensitive and unpredictable.</p>
              <p>However, having said all that - I can only say don't give up. Parents love us in ways different from how we want to be loved - it does not mean that they don't care for us, just that they don't show their care in a way we appreciate.</p>
              <p>Now, 35 years down the road - my father suddenly asked me the other day - How his parenting methods had affected me. He told me, now it is OKAY to tell him how I feel. Then I realise.. seriously - most parents have no idea where they went right or wrong - they just try their best, and hope for the best!</p>

              <p>Hi <span style="line-height: 17px; font-size: 15px; color: #333333; font-weight: bold;"><a style="text-decoration: none; color: #5d5ebc;" href="http://sgforums.com/users/280144">limeapplestick</a>, </span></p>
              <p>As you can see, many of us here do not have a good relation with our dad, or parents.  I am also one.  I never really understand why he did what he did to me, and I was also very much affected.</p>
              <p>However, when I became a dad myself, I suddenly forget all the bad things he had done, and appreciate him for bringing me up.  Perhaps this is life.</p>
              <p>Now I am telling my children, that my love for them may not be reciprocated, understood, nor appreciated, but that does not means I don't love them.  Perhaps we are just having different expectation. </p>
              <p>My pal, if I can suggest, try not to compare with your sibling, but run your own race.  Do well in your study, and be useful to the society. One day, you will understand that family relation is complicate, yet important. </p>
              <p>(BTW, all those sibling that have more attention from my dad, they don't enjoy life as much as I do, perhaps because I don't have anything to begin with, and I treasure all that I have.  But they were given whatever they want.).</p>
