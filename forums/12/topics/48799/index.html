You have to provide us more details to visualise what really went wrong from the relationship. What assured you that the two of you won't be together anymore? Extravagantly neither the both of you wanted a breakup in the first place. Now it's a positive time to decide and judge whether something can be done to prevent this relationship from hitting rock bottom.</div>

In this case, your boyfriend was cold towards you because of some girls enjoying themselve and not helping out with the bbq. In addition, he's probably having some trouble at home and work. Did you not served him and drinks nor food at the bbq while he was helping? Well did your boyfriend did get you drinks and food during that period? Sometimes in a relationship you have to give and take. In this incident, most likely your boyfriend is impatient and you are giving in to him, he's not taking it. Morever, he keeps pestering you of what happened in the past and mentioned he's willing to wait. That's not a healthy sign. I suggest you drop him a hint that you can't take this pain anymore. Considering he demanded a decision to be made. Possiblity a break up.</div>

Never wanted to tell me wat happened till I probe.<br>And he is unhappy that, I took drinks for my female frens but never serve him.

He told me that he took the trouble to save me food but I dun give a damn abt him, but care for my female frens instead.<br><br>I mean, I didnt volunteerily took drinks for my female frens.

To me, this is childish. </strong><br><br>There r bound to be quarrels in r/ships. Quarrels enhance understanding for each other and r/ship tend to develop stronger after much quarrels. I dun encourage it here but do see the positive side of it. Maybe I belong to the 'same frequency' as you bf, i dun think he is jealous over you being nicer to your galfrens. He is explaining to you why he feels so by giving the examples.<br><br><strong>I admit it is my fault that I didnt shower him enough affection. But b4 we were together, he already know that I am a somewat career minded person. If he wants me to serve him like a housewife even b4 we are married, I m sorry, ask him to get another gal.</strong><br><br>Being career-minded isnt a valid excuse for not showering enuff affection, dun you agree with me? All the more, if you already know tt u r career-minded, does it hint to me tt you r not so readily in showing your affection as you feel the need to prove tt you r no woman in apron but in power-suit? Im sad to hear if you have this mentality. Your bf isnt a competing male colleague <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"> , so let down your hair and feel great as a woman, show your man that you love him.<br><br><strong>But on the day of the BBQ, one of my frens was a pregnant lady. Naturally we take care of her more. I mean please, we are no longer teenagers anymore. We are working, grown up adults. Why is he behaving this way?</strong><br><br>It's pretty obvious to me why he is behaving this way. You matter to him. Why wld a guy who had no concern for another woman to get agitated at all? I do u/stand wat you mean being grown-up n etc., but it may not be this case here. Even a seventy-yr-old man behaves this way! Coz it's abt handling things in different ways. Perhaps, you guyz did hav alot of time to u/stand each other well before coming together.<br><br><strong>He keep saying that he is human, so is natural for him to get jealous.

I have problems at work too. I dun behave like that! </strong><br><br>Maybe you can try to u/stand that he's not experienced in r/ships, thus, not able to handle many of the way things wld be when one goes thru for the 1st. Try to put yourself in his shoes, maybe you'd u/stand why? No matter wat he did, i guess he did it out of love. Cool down abit to see that all he had done to piss you off was juz irrational behaviours. A quarrel wont even exists if both parties were rational. Btw, I really dun feel that you shld compare how you'd behave to his. Everyone's different, if you love the man, love him for who he is. It takes more than knowing wat you will do &amp; wat he does to be different fr you, compromising is essential.<br><br><strong>He even mentioned that if I cannot withstand his temper, it is not too late yet. He said he regretted asking me to be his gf only 2 mths after knowing me.<br><br>He told me, he got other problems, just wan to get this cleared as fast as he can. Want things to be over and done with. I always thought relationship things are meant to be handled with paitient and care? I told him I need time to cool off. And he tell my frens that i am avoiding him. And he didnt dare to tell my fren how he made me so upset.  He lied to my fren that because he didnt sms me, I felt neglected. So I got angry. </strong><br><br>Well, I can deduce that many misu/standings &amp; hurt result from lack of u/standing for each other. jnifer, Im only trying to make you see the other side of the story, it isnt so bad. If you think that the r/ship cant be retrieved due to these misu/standings, i find it a waste n unnecessary. You &amp; your bf happens to handle probs diffeently. You need time to cool off and he doesnt like to drag things. If both of you have been given more time to u/stand this, all this cld have been avoided. Since love may not last forever, why not love with all your heart now? Wish you the best <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></blockquote></div>
