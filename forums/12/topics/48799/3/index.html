Is like this, we had been together for 2 mths<br>Never had quarrel b4. He started to be very cold towards me after the BBQ. Never wanted to tell me wat happened till I probe.<br>And he is unhappy that, I took drinks for my female frens but never serve him. He told me that he took the trouble to save me food but I dun give a damn abt him, but care for my female frens instead.<br><br>I mean, I didnt volunteerily took drinks for my female frens. She happened to request that can I help her to take a drink. So I take lah. I mean, wat is this? He is 27, and he is jealous over gals? To me, this is childish.<br><br>I admit it is my fault that I didnt shower him enough affection. But b4 we were together, he already know that I am a somewat career minded person. If he wants me to serve him like a housewife even b4 we are married, I m sorry, ask him to get another gal.<br><br>But on the day of the BBQ, one of my frens was a pregnant lady. Naturally we take care of her more. I mean please, we are no longer teenagers anymore. We are working, grown up adults. Why is he behaving this way?<br><br>He keep saying that he is human, so is natural for him to get jealous. And that I am his 1st gf, he dunno how to handle things, I should guide him.<br><br>All along, he say he has been smooth, never had any problems. One shot kena from gf, family and work, he say he cannot take it.<br>I told him many times that I needed personal space to cool off b4 I can meet u up and talk about it. But he doesnt listen. He sms me everyday with things like "within 1 week, my whole world collapse"..."I dun feel like going home now, wan to go to the sea and let the water take me away"<br>I am not a person who can take all these nonesense. I have problems at work too. I dun behave like that!<br><br>He even mentioned that if I cannot withstand his temper, it is not too late yet. He said he regretted asking me to be his gf only 2 mths after knowing me.<br><br>He told me, he got other problems, just wan to get this cleared as fast as he can. Want things to be over and done with. I always thought relationship things are meant to be handled with paitient and care? I told him I need time to cool off. And he tell my frens that i am avoiding him. And he didnt dare to tell my fren how he made me so upset.  He lied to my fren that because he didnt sms me, I felt neglected. So I got angry.</div></blockquote>Dear jnifur,<br><br>This is not a critical problem at all and remedy is around, if that's what both of you wished to do.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Firstly: this relationship is probably under Morning Foundation (the act of being together under very short period of time - CloUdiSm Remix III) - in which his standard and requirement of a girlfriend and yours could be different, and probably only during the journey of this relationship, the both of you started to realise. (That's the whole thing about relationship: if it were to be entered blindly by pure emotions. Astrologically speaking: those with the strongest attraction are most often karmic relationship)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Next: you are his first gf - there is tons and thousands of things that he will need to learn and adapt. When you are attached and single -its totally different. Coping with all the different stress and maintaining a relationship is a skill to be learn - exactly the same way as parenting. Who the hell born into this world knows how to be a good parent or a good lover? Everything is experience and learning along the way - give up halfway: you will encounter problems during your next relationship. Its a karmic cycle (b|tches that don't learn to treasure themselves never find true love, guys who are possessive often lose their gf to competitors, etc)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Btw: being matured in a relationship and the kind of maturity that exist in adults is totally two different issues. Everyone wants to be love, to be depend on someone, etc - your bf is no difference. Career-minded your personality - in your love life: its shouldn't be defined exactly as what is it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Let me tell you there are woman strong and hard like a shield on the outside, to their friends, working society, etc, but when it comes to their hubby or bf - they become like a child/mouse. I am not saying you have to be like that; rather to learn about the femaine energy of a relationship (simple hug, kiss, notes of love, simple gestures and the list goes on)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Everyone learns from their relationship along the way: observe details and it makes everyone's day better and happier.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sometimes in a relationship, doesnt mean both parties have good character and thats it, its a perfect couple....no...from what u have said, your BF is kinda sensitive to your actions, he needs attention as much as girls need from guys (usually). He might be a good guy, u still have feelings for him...but how long do u know him, it only takes 2 months for u 2 to be together, i think its a very short time. i can only say that u are giving each other a chance and trying out to see if e relationship works... so now u have a problem, maybe u might wanna review this relationship as to whether is it worth continuing...is it a permanent prob that will always be there or its just some mood swings from your BF n stuff. Since u said that u all are working adults...i think u should be able to rationalise e whole situation properly. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
