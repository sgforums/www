              <p>My friend came up to me and told me about an incident he cannot forget. I do not know what to say to him. someone help me give advice! This is a serious matter &gt;.&lt; so here goes:</p>
              <p>B-my friend (male)</p>
              <p>C-my friend girlfriend (female)</p>
              <p>D- my friend girlfriend ex-boyf (male)</p>
              <p>B came up to me and told me his that he found out C had given a BJ to D. well it happened when C and D were together. However B only found out after months being together with C. I knoe B shud juz get over it if he love C very much.</p>
              <p>BUT, the thing is, the BJ was D forcing C to do it. C was forced to do it until she cried and vomitted. Now B is telling me he cant live with himself knowing his girl got violated. Imagine u have a gf who got violated by an ex and suffered months emotionally after that. Than in the future, this trauma will continue each time B and C gets intimate. I feel for him man. He doesnt know what to do and ask me for advice.</p>
              <p>I told him report police. But it happened like a few years ago and C parents and B parents will know about it. This will cause their relationship to be torn apart. B said that he dont know how long he can take it before he will track down D and god i dunno what will happen!!</p>
              <p>someone help me advise him! i dun wan my best fren do somethin stupid =(</p>

              <p>common sense in action, please</p>
              <p>there are some females, who only wanted to attract more attention only, but maybe, just maybe this is C's personality</p>
              <p>and also, if you report, it'll be only about less than 10% of success, the police would rather go after mas selamat than this minor crap</p>
              <p>and think about it, words will spread like wildfire, and it will attract unwanted attention, and destroy your friend, C and D's reputation</p>
              <p>imagine how would their parents, peers and the people around them will feel</p>
              <p>don't do something on impulsive that you'll regret later, it is only a moment of folly, your friend's gf probably wanted to try it out, otherwise she can simply push away</p>

              <p>tell best friend to take it slowly, get intimate only when his gf is comfortable with it.</p>
              <p>understand that best friend now wants to stand up for the girl he loves, it's sort of a male thing, which is sweet. but pursuing the matter will only escalate many unspoken sentiments. especially for her. </p>
              <p>it may worsen the situation, and cause even more embarrassment.</p>
              <p>imho (no offence intended), he's probably getting all riled up because his ego is speaking as well. the blowjob happened way before best friend came into the picture. what happened was between his gf and D. it was nobody's business but theirs. especially if they were both at consentual age liao.</p>
              <p>if best friend really wants to hunt and track D down like a ruffian, by all means go ahead, but leave his gf and her family out of the picture completely. what i will do if i were you is buy him a beer and pizza, then change the topic. he'll get the message.</p>

              <p>I think your friend has a conservative mindset. It is hard to find a virgin these days.</p>
              <p>And yes, if he does love his gf, he should leave the past behind. If he can do that, his gf will likely cherish him more.</p>
              <p>If he cannot accept the girl's traumatic past, then he should let go of the relationship. And let the girl find someone else who accept her for who she is now.</p>
