His/her attitude towards love, psychological and sexual development would be so badly affected that it could hinder his/her potential growth. Shadow of the past cannot be erased, because you were young and had little control over your life. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> That was history.<br><br>You can claim and put control into your life now. You have shaped certain way of thinking, mentally and within your character. Quit worrying about your history because you still have probably 3/4 of your life to govern.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> This is within your grasp of control.<br><br>You desire and long for emotional satisfaction because you can't get it from your family; you turn to BGR. Yet because of lower self esteem and pessimistic outlook of life - somehow, what you attempt, desire and the outcome doesn't tally. It walks back to the same circle and you still feel emotionally dead inside.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>In theory of Love; we are but the mirror of our partners. The kind of attributes we demostrate, we attract. You mentioned that your 1st gf was suffering from depression - understand why? Because this could be found in you.<br><br>Advice?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>1) Grab hold of your life. When you were a kid, you knew nothing and were subjected to external factors. Now, you are biologically old enough to be a father - are you still going to allow the same old factors affect you for the rest of your life? Like I mentioned, you still have another 3/4 of your life to spend - will there be a break through from your current pathetic state? No, I didn't say it was going to be easy - but if you never try, you will never get out of your prison.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>2) Learn to love yourself. From the theory of love, if you were to treasure, appreciate and love yourself - you will eventually attract someone who will, in turn, treasure, appreciate and love you back. You want positive quality in a mate, you have to have them in yourself. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>P.S: Before you learn to walk a mile, you have to begin your first step.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">When you love, you should not say,<br>"God is in my heart,"<br>But rather,<br>"I am in the heart of God</span><br><br>Cheers</div>

Cos my father was a very traditional and violent man....very violent.....to the extend we lend up in police station. My mum suffered a great deal. So did all of us...financially, emotionally...well, that's not the point here. The point I want to point out is that I can understand from your level what you're driving at. And...I just want you to know, believing in God is one thing, committing your burdens, fears and sins to Him is another thing. And we all dun deserve His perfect love &amp; mercy but He still loves us; that's call <strong>grace</strong>. And with His grace, He loves us <strong>unconditionally</strong>. So what expectations are you trying to match? We can never meet His expectations....never cos we are all not perfect. Think there's anyone in this world who can meet the 10 commandments. None. We just strive to be more like Him cos we know we are made in His image, and when we fail, we know He still loves us and will carry us through. I love this verse I just memorised Galatians 2:20 "I have been crucified in Christ and I no longer live; but Christ lives in me. The life I live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me." So, your "old" self is "dead", treasure your new "creation". God Bless N take care  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Personally i HATE playboys because they usually hurt the hearts of those carebears of people's life and there's nothing more painful that watching a girl whom u love deeply fall in love with a guy only to freefall to her own demise.

A traditional, violent, unreasonable father, who brings only money back home/a nonchalent mother who cares little about her children/2 siblings way too young for me to relate to. Lucky as i may seem, emotionally, i'm an empty person. Since young, i never know what love is. Intellectually i know how it is defined, but remains a fairy tale I have never experienced. While everyone may seem to have a share of it, i wonder where is mine?<br><br><strong>&gt; "Love is patient..." You gotta wait man... at least your parents do earn a decent living providing for the family. perhaps they arent too good at relating to their children... but they at least raised u up to be a yound adult!</strong><br><br>My parents loved to compared me to my intelligent and brilliant cousins.

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks for your advice everyone, i appreciate this. I wasn't in need of help, neither was i hoping get anything. I was just lamenting, complaining. In the end I know the sensible thing is to move on with life. I never have the habit to voice my complains anyway, so i wrote all those simply to let out, because i know everyone has their equal share of problems.<br><br>Cheers! away with our problems!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
