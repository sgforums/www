            <div class='col-md body'>Maybe I should tell you all a story.....<br><br>Part  I<br><br>Many years ago...... I met a girl in my class. She is not the most prettiest girl in my school, but in my eyes, she is the prettiest to me....<br>we are from the same ECA too so we get to meet each other often. Unfortunately, she fell for one of my best friend. I could only watch in dismay that she is out of my clutch.<br><br>However, due to some unforseen circumstances, their relationship didn't last long. I was shamefully enough to admit that at that time I was "happy" that I still had the oppotunity.<br><br>We were still best friends at that. We talked, joked, went out and makan often. I guess I was a shy kid at that time, so I didn't dare to propose. And further more, I did not know how to understand how she was feeling about her breakup and her thoughts at that moment. It had been a long time before I gathered enough courage to propose to her. However, she was shock by it and ran away. At that time was the fall of our firendship.<br><br>Though our friendship is strain, sometimes we still keep in contact. However, it was a brief one and she was always trying to run away from me.<br><br>I could not take it anymore. Not in this kind of life where I could only love someone and not have have her love. I told her that I wanted to have a clean break and not to contact her anymore. She also wanted it that way (reluntantly I am not too sure about it). However, I guess I was too soft and still unwilling to let go of it. I just proposed that we would not see each other for a few months and see what happens next.<br><br>In the end, she e-mailed to me that "we no longer can be friends, not anymore". She ran away from my world for real.<br><br>12 years of my lifetime, all I got is nothing, but created a monster inside me.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Part II:<br><br>I grew very angry.... so angry that I was almost on the verge I could not control the anger in me. It's as if I wanted to taste blood off my hands to quench my anger inside me. I would go to the beach and yell out all night long, take a stick and pretend it's a sword and swing it all nite long until I drop dead.<br><br>I used to spar in a Tae-Kwan-Do sparring Hall (Sorry, I can't reveal the name of it). I was given the nickname "WuMing" because I was simply a nobody  over there. However after this incident, I became vegenceful. I would kill if means satisfying the desire of anger and betrayal. No-one dared to challenge me not because I was good,.because they all could sense that I only desire blood on my hands at the end of the match.<br><br>There was this incident where a newbie who didn't know me and challenged me. He was good, and he managed to stay on for a couple of rounds. Suddenly, he swung his fist at my rib cage. Though it didn't hurt that much, but I was furious that a newbie could hurt me, not in flesh, but my pride. I unleashed my fury on him. I broke his collar bone and dislocated his arm and pinned him to the ground. I wanted to beat him up into plup if not my friends at the sparring ground rushed to stop me. They too got bashed in the confusion of my outbust of rage. From there onwards, I was barred from the sparring hall for some time.<br><br>Still, my rage continued. I would take it on the walls (because I didn't have money to buy a sandbag) or went to arcade center and challenged people in fighting game. Everything went wrong till a good friend step in and stop me.<br><br>It took me quite sometime before I calmed myself down and realised that everything I have done so far was wrong. Seriously and stupidly wrong.<br><br>End of Part II</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> 1978 - If it was your age, you should be 25 this year.<br><br>You spoke about a girl whom have affected your life very much. (Gut feeling told me this happened very long ago - you mentioned ECA; btw its called CCA now, therefore my deduction would be that it all happened in your Secondary school, which could be around 9 -12 years ago.) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Deduction thrown aside - in part I you were rejected outrageously while trying your means to capture her heart. Rejection is nothing, but avoidance took place. Deep inside you were hurt, but the avoidance part worsen those wounds.<br><br>In part II - it simply talks how violent and aggressive person you became and part III (IV is the same as III) speaks how envy you became when you witness friends having fulfilling relationship while you still the same-old self.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Analysis</span><br><br>Your ego is seriously bruised - To such an extend that you demostrate your man-li-ness through fighting and being aggressive. Your mind needs to protect itself from harm because of your fatal love setback &amp; it channels your restless energy into your limbs and fiery temper. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>On surface, (you too mentioned you don't smile much as well), you will appear calm, cool, apathic, but deep inside - you suffer from inferiority complex.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You know why you have landed in such a state? You realise that it is because you created that mental and emotional prison and sealed yourself in. Nobody can enter &amp; nobody would want to attempt. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> This is half the story.<br><br>Realised that your rejection took place years ago? And you are still pinning that kind of hatred for the girl? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Let me ask you personally - why do you hate her?<br><br>Does it ever come across your mind that she has her own right to choose the kind of partner she desire and wish to have?<br><br>Its not about hating the decision she made - its about <strong>YOU</strong> unable to accept rejection.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>The power of Venus is to rule over people through the mystical strength of love, while Mars commands the aggressive and lust in you. You want to earn respect of the one you love - you will FAIL through the use of Mars energy. Love is femaine energy and only if you learn to release yourself from your narrowness and openness to other (including friends, family and lovers) - then you can fully walk out of the pathetic cycle you are strolling, in circles. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Its ironic when you spoke about how you wish for a simple girl to appear when you yourself do not show any quality of a simple man in return. Your yearning for a companion is heavily due to peer influence and self reflection. You want to get out, but do not know for sure how to.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Observe any successful relationship and you will discover that both party are not only very ease with themselves, but also as well as one another.<br><br>You ain't yourself and can't open to others. How can you expect a relationship to form externally when seeds of love can't be sown internally?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You have so much Mars (restless) energy in you - why not you use it to make a substantial change to improve your own life? Its easy to talk about or just to imagine your outcome - but it certainly require more than just brute strength to change and improve yourself.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Learn to use more of your mind and heart. <strong>Acknowledge your weakness</strong> and improve yourself - Self-pity will bring you nowhere OR trying to deny your flaws will eventually bring you down. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>P.S: Are you an Aries, Leo or Scorpio?<br><br>Cheers</div>
