N our relationship was a secret... His parents know but not my. N my parents do not really lik him, n so we often quarrelled bout tis so... I am the one caught in between he n my parents. So i understand how it feels.<br><br>It is indeed terrible to be caught inbetween... Though it is difficult to see from ur gf pt of view... Try it... U may see things in a different light. In the beginin... all one could think of is why my partner don understand me... But do u understand wat she is goin thru at all?<br><br>In a gal's view pt, i dunno... But i think most prob she has strong feelings for u as in... She talked bout marriage. Tis goes to show she is serious bout u. If she really want break up wif u, would she mention it so many times yet no action is taken yet?<br><br>I feel tat wat she is feelin is hurt. Esp coz of ur mum reaction to her. She feels unaccepted? I mean, being in a relationship, when u see ur son gf, coz u did be v happy, nice n welcomin to her ma... She mays think tat ur mum feels tat she is not gd enough for u her son... Tat's why she treats her lik tat...<br><br>Ya, i belive tat she knows tat u treat her v gd... But she is so v unhappy.... U mention tat u give her all ur attention... But she doesn't... Mayb coz she is actin lik tat to hurt u? When i am angry wif my bf, i would do things lik don want to bother bout wat he is sayin, but deep down, of coz i do hear every word he is sayin...<br><br>Try puttin urself in ur gf shoes... Wat if her parents dun accept u... Critsize u openly... I should say tis is really quite hard to bear... There is surely a great strain...<br><br>I suggest tat u should have a gd talk wif ur gf... say on the phone... or mayb u could find a place wif nice envt to have a heart to heart talk, whichever u deem fit... Explain to her more bout ur mum behaviour towards her... Mak her feel assured... Isn't her fault or tat is coz she is no gd... (A sweet little gift eg, a bear wif words lik, u don know how much u mean to me... eg... surely will help matters!)<br><br>Some not so applicable ways but u may want try...<br>Talkin to ur mum about tis, though i doubt is possible...<br><br>Or how bout explain to ur gf... Bare ur heart out to her... Tell her how hard it is for u to struggle as a middlman btw both of them... Tat she is very impt to u, u cannot lose her, yet u have no choice, coz she is after all ur mother...<br><br>Other is mayb to suggest ur gf give somethin to ur mum? to mak her happy... say her birthday or x'mas... somethin ur mum would lik... so it may kind of break the ice, n hopefully, ur mum impression will change...<br><br>Also discuss wif ur gf bout   life after marriage... try to come up wif n agreement... both parties need to compromise... but think do tis only if she ask lor... Tis isn't exactly one of the nicest topic esp when u r makin up! But don waste all ur efforts hor!<br><br>I wish u all the best n both of u chang chang jiu jiu!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

And this has made it a point that noone will snatch her son away from her... become <strong>too protective </strong>over her own son.. I wouldn't say it possessiveness... cos your mummy loves you too much!<br><br>Maybe she's afraid that one day or someday you leave her, married and move out..

OR certainly.. it might be <span style="text-decoration: underline;">something that your gf displease her incertian ways..</span> where your mum thinks that she bad?</span><br><br>Well.. find out more about your mum.. talk to her.. and ask her why she's reacting this way? Is there something that she dun like about your gf?? or is it something that she's afraid that she wi;l lose you in the end.. <strong>Reassure</strong> her that such things won't happen.. know that you are filial to your mum..    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>as for your gf.. found out more and <strong>discuss on the issue</strong>.. of what can done about this.. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">using break-ups to run away is not the way to solve any of this problems..</span><br><br>If the reasons i give it true... then even if you break-up with the present one.. and much later.. you had another gf.. the same thing will happen again..<br><br>to prevent "YE CHANG MENG DUO"  actions!! actions!! you need to come out with a solution together with your gf.. on the other hand.. try to talk to your mum round..   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Cheers...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

And learn from somewhere..<br><br>Tolerating is one thing.. The problem is how to stop this toleration and make peace to both.. Like what i've said.. Take for example.. this relationship ended.. cos both cannot compromise to each other.. If you enter to another relationship.. Same issue will appear again.. Once again.. there's no one to blamE at!<br><br>This is a good time for you to source the root of the problem out.. Right now.. you dunno what's goin on.. you're like the meat in the sandwich.. Being stucked in the middle.. You need to break thru and put it to a stop..<br><br>Tell your gf.. that things will work out.. if both work together hand in hand on it..  and not jus you alone.. Relationship involve 2 person.. not 1..<br><br>Ok.. you said your mum always have mood swings.. hmm.. my guess is.. maybe is the woman thing.. you know "GENG NIAN QI" Maybe she's having that.. SOme.. i'm not saying all.. will experience mood swings.. IT really affects them.. SOmetimes they can very bad tempered.. Sometimes they can be very nice.. The system in their body is changing... Becos.. sometimes.. menstrations come sometimes can dun come for many months and come again.. this is when the body is regulating.. Or sometimes they may feel very uncomfortable.. like giddiness or extremely tired this n that...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>This will sometimes take very a long time for the "GENG NIAN QI" to stop depends on individual.. until the things fully stop.. no more menstration.. then they will be back to normal.. as in not so much of the mood swings..<br><br>Maybe ask your mum to go for a body check up.. if she ask.. jus say.. is jus a routine.. chekc up once a while also good.. at least sees if body functions well anot.. then found out from the doctor issit your mum having that anot... if this is not the reason.. then is your duty to have both of them together with you.. COME and HAVE A TALK about the cause of this problem that's bothering everyone!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Meanwhile if that's the case.. then let your gf know about it.. let her understand and get a clearer picture out of it.. It helps..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Cheers...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
