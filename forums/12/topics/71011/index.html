            <div class='col-md body'>This may sound a bit harsh but I believed you have brought this on yourself. Failing to cherish what was around you at the time when you had the chance to do so is the most common of mistakes guys and gals alike do. She wouldn't have given you a chance since she has been hurt by you before and why would you not do it again since you have done it before? The best way is to change yourself not for the sake of having her back but for the sake of yourself. Why do you need her by your side to change? If you can't even change by yourself, then I would recommend that you do not even think of going after her again. Promises made are always broken whereas actions speaks louder than words. Last but not least, please do cherish your next GF when you have the chance to do so. Think of how lucky you are to have at least have the chance to change things but how some other people would have not have the chance to do so no matter how much effort they have put into a relationship.<br><br>Just my two cents....</div>

I find it hard for myself to get over it. as for the reason, I was not a caring enough person for him. I mistreat her and never treasure her when she was with me even when she is living with me for more than half a year I think. no that I have regretted and wanted to change for her, she decided to leave me and I can't get it over. I promise her I will change and prove to her I will be caring to her again. but without her by my side, how will she know I have change to be more caring to her. I have a lot of bad habits like smoking and drinking. I can drop all that if she decide to come back to me. but I think she have to be there to see it right? if she is not with me, how will she know? I really don't know what to do with myself now. I feel so lost without her. this is the 1st time I come to such forums to seek for some advice...</div></blockquote>bro, humans often regret too late. i suggest u gotta move on.. it happen to mi quite sometimes ago and i said the same things like u did.<br><br>but i was told, when gers do make up their mind. their mind set is SET. if she realli breakup coz of dis reason, i guess u better wake up and dun mistreat another ger dat come along in ur life later..<br><br>if dat is not the case, or she broke up juz to be with another and cock dis reason out, i tink u better seek the truth reason..<br><br>tk kare bro, meanwhile spend sometime with ur fren whom u did not realli contact while in a r/s.. dey can gif u some suggestion..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmm...<br><br>can offer u some advice... coz i was in the same situation a few mths back.... the difference is that i was the one that chose to walk out of the relationship.. in other words, i was the gf who was so disappointed n heartbroken that i chose to give up a 6 yr relationship....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>wat i can tell u is move on with ur life... dun bother calling her n asking her for another chance... it'll only make her hate u more... just like my case... i felt like i had made the rite choice when he was calling me n asking me for second chances....<br><br>a breakup is always for the betta... sad but true... it's either u 2 decide that u 2 really love each other n are willing to compromise n make it work out.... or both of u are betta off without each other.... there's no pt in hanging onto a failed relationship... u might feel upset now.... but u gotta learn to cope with it... coz ultimately, it's by ur own doing that things turned out this way....<br><br>this is not exactly advice... but views from another perspective...
