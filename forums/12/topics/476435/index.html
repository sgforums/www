              <p>Hi. This is what happened.</p>
              <p>I needed short term loan. Cant get any and unemployed. Chanced upon loan shark number and called them.</p>
              <p>For $400 cash, I have to pay $150 weekly for a month. And I did that. </p>
              <p>Their mode of operation is this, I call them, they never answer but will call me back through an unknown ID number. Every week I will receive via sms the bank account number to deposit my installment into. </p>
              <p>But at my last installment, the loan shark offered to ‘reloan’ with a lower interest and ask me to <strong>‘support’</strong> him. I decline politely as I do not want to offend them.</p>
              <p>I did not approach the loan shark for one month. But during the one month period I would receive calls or sms 3-4 times a week soliciting me to get a loan from them. I always reject him as I told him I don’t have a job and have no confidence of repaying back.</p>
              <div>One month ago, I have to get a loan again so I return to him. This time was $450 cash, pay back $150 weekly for a month. I did that but something happened. On my last installment date, he offered me <strong>‘reloan’</strong> again and I declined. But instead he verified my account number with me. I told him to message me the account number to me so that I can make my last repayment. He did not and instead he credited $350 into my account. I didn’t realized that until the next day when I checked my bank account. I frantically messaged and called him. It took him 5 hours later to return my call. And when he did, I confronted him about the $350 sitting in my account. He claimed that this is an <strong>‘automated’</strong> process that the loan will just keep going on. I told him that we had agreed the previous day that I do not need the reloan and I just want to clear my loan account with him. He said that he didn’t receive my sms and that he don’t recall we talking about it. Then it became a heated conservation and he said that he will see what he can do and inform me. The next day, I called him again and checked on this matter. Again he said that I wanted the reloan and there is nothing he can do. So I told him that I want to immediately return my last installment of $150 plus the $350 which he credited to my account the previous day. He said no way, if I want to settle this; I have to return the last $150 and $600 for the $350 loan he credited into my account. I told him that this is not the way to force people and if he insists I will report this matter to the police. On that note, he started hurling foul language at me and he hang up. </div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>I have moved to a new place recently. My concern is that the loan shark will harass my old neighbours and also the new occupant of my old place. I have no intention to discuss anything with the loan shark anymore because they are simply only interested in getting more out of me by force. I am willing to go to the police with this but I am not sure if it could help. I just want to share my story here and I have learnt my lesson. Even if u are able to return the loan on time, it is never enough for the loan shark. I have intention to change my hp number, go to the police and fight it out with these blood suckers. </div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello hubba hubba. If you really want to help others from being victims to loan sharks....then go make a report to the police. If you can go to the CID better still and hopefully they will refer you to the SS Unit which is Secret Society Unit. Usually, members of gangster groups will do this crime of loan sharking. So don't waste any time...I'm very sure the police can trace that phone number that was given to you and I'm very sure the Investigation Officer will tell you what to do next.</div>

              Whether that person is a Singaporean or a foreigner it doesn't matter. That phone number will help SS officers to trace its origin and co-ordinate with the authority outside Singapore.

              <p>if you can just chance upon a loan shark number, the police would have chanced upon many many such numbers.</p>
              <p>you know how much loan they would gave you, you know how much interest you have to pay and over what period of time, and you AGREED. That is a legally binding contract!! Nobody trick you, con you, or force you, you went into the agreement at your own free will.</p>
              <p>you can take a loan from a credit card company and you would also be required to pay very high interest rates, they are the institutional dai yi long. The only thing that the police would be bothered is how they try to recover the outstanding. So if you want to go to the police, you must know what are you reporting.</p>
              <p>Care to share with us what really gave you no choice but to borrow $400 cash from known loan shark, may be we can learn what in life can give us no choice.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Sgdiehard, like many before you, you didnt read my story impartially but rather already jumped into conclusion and gave me the death sentence. i paid all my dues. i can only repay when the loan shark message me the account number to make the transfer, it was a different account every time. at my last repayment, i did not receive the account number but instead the loan shark put another $300 into my account without my agreement. and now demand me to continue my loan installments. i only borrow what i can return and i did so far. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">which part of my story depicts that i have problem or i have no intention to uphold my end of agreement ???</span></strong></p></div>

              <p>Well hubba hubba,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am sorry to say that you should not borrow from loanshark in the first place. As the police are not able to catch the big boss, those small fly who spoke to you are using pre paid card registered by other debtors or some forgien workers. They operate out of singapore. chances of getting them are one in a million. </p>
              <p>Account numbers given to you are usually belongs to their debtors who can in return reduce their debts.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>as for you, I am sad to say that they can find you easily when you updated your new address. Anyone can purchase your personal details online through DP or 1questnet by Just paying below $40.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>loansharks are connected. My advice to you is to stop borrowing from loansharks as if you borrow again, they won't even need to spend money online to purchase your profile, your NRIC no and new address will pop out in their database again as loansharks are circulating names and nric no and contact numbers among them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>hope what I say could help you although with your self centered and arrogant attitude, you may think what I wrote here are bullshit.</p>
