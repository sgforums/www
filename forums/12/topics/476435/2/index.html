              <p>I have read thoroughly what you wrote And something really puzzled me. You mentioned you are unemployed so you got not choice but to borrow from loanshark. </p>
              <p>No income and yet you are able to repay $150 every week for a month! </p>
              <p>Forgive me if I m wrong, let me guess, you managed to pay.....</p>
              <p>$150 every week working part time?</p>
              <p>$150 every week borrowed money from friends?</p>
              <p>$150 every week winnings from casino or 4d? I think casino mainly as nobody wins 4d every week.</p>
              <p>$150 every week day dreaming or dejavu?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>sorry, treat this post as really bullshiting. God bless you.</p>

              the moral of the story is NEVER EVER borrow from loansharks!
              
              Explore alternatives.  
              
              If you have insurance plans, some of these plans allow for withdrawal of cash at difficult times.
              
              If you have shares, try to liquidate them.
              
              If you have a flat, rent out a room.
              
              If you do not have all of the above, and no job, find a job.  Any job.  There are jobs in Singapore that no one wants to do, such as dishwashing, clearing dishes at hawker centres.  These are decent jobs that offer you a pay.
              
              The encounter from the writer is similar to a friend of mine in the past.  He borrowed from a legal finance company.  But it ended up that his bank account info was somehow made known to an unlicensed moneylender who credits money into his bank account, and thereafter starts to harass him for moneny, even after the last repayment.  In any case, they will not want to terminate the business.  They will keep giving you money.
              
              Somehow our police has been effective against a lot of crimes, but not against loansharking, which I cannot understand why.  Maybe it is really very complicated network of crooks.
              
              In any case, I feel that the writer should be responsible to clear the mess left by him and not leave the new owner to bear the brunt of his past actions.  It is very unfair that new occupants are being harassed for something which they did not deserve.
              
              I hope one day all the loansharks can be eliminated once and for all.

              <p>Asl7777, the core of my post here is the mode of operation of

              all. besides havent u noticed the first few posts? i wouldnt want
              to be seen as <strong><em>begging for sympathy or

              <p>Wow, thank you for telling us that playing with fire is dangerous, I am sure that your post would be useful for people who has an mind of 5 years old virgin kid who didn't know what crimewatch is or how to read those loan shark's warning poster at the bus stop.</p>
              <p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1385520331799_77179">And just an kind advise for you when you need small cash in the first place, you heard of working in F&amp;B industry like Macdonald, Burger king etc or pawn shop/selling second hand goods like laptop/handphone etc? Unless you telling us you didn't even have an O level, maybe like you said your background will not affect your future 'ricebowl' and maybe the loan shark just 'accidently' find you and you pity them they get no business and that why you borrow from them. <img id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1385520331799_77367" src="http://mail.yimg.com/ok/u/assets/img/emoticons/emo30.gif" alt="*=)) rolling on the floor"></p>

              <p>One up for shirt_less...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>you are right! the police has set up a unit called Unlicensed moneylender Strikeforce, also part of the CID. They put in 100% of work trying to bring all loansharks into justice. But the loansharks are just too evil. </p>
              <p>10 years ago, loanshark operates in singapore. You call them, they will ask you to meet somewhere in the evening. The commandos will meet you up checking your NRIC. Someone will call you house pretending to be your friend asking for the address saying that they want to mail a wedding invitation card to you. This is to verify that you are staying in the address stated in the NRIC. After verifying all details, the commandos will pass you cash. Usual operating hours of loansharks are usually 2 hours in the evening.</p>
              <p>loansharks are operation out of singapore now. They will send SMS saying they are from some legal finance company in singapore., Gave you a prepaid number to call, then call you back using internet calling. Get your NRIC no and sing pass and date of issued of your NRIC. They logged into your cpf using sing pass and try to amend your sing pass. This process will need you to key in the date of issued of your NRIC. If they managed to change it, it means that your NRIC card is authentic. Then they will ask their contacts in singapore(usually their debtors who worked for them when they cannot pay) to bank in the loan into your account. You will just need to sit at home waiting for money to come in.</p>
              <p>then every week, you will bank your payment into their designated account. As to why there are differents account numbers for you to bank in? It is because some account holders were caught by the unlicensed moneylender Strikeforce, so, cannot use already. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>People here, please ignore SMS from credit companies advertised with a mobile number. These are loansharks. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Take note that a licensed money lender can only advertise their office land line numbers on their advertisement. </p>
              <p>When you are granted a loan by a licensed moneylender, you are required to step into their office and sign the "note of contract", a legal document under the law, must have. Before signing the NOC, the authorize officer of that company must explain to you in details of the repayment schemes. After signing all legal documents, they will issue to loan to you by cash or by cheque.</p>
              <p>licensed moneylenders are regulated by laws in singapore.</p>

              <p>   Among the 89,000 are:</p>
              <p>   About 15,000 investors who own $14.6 million of Singtel shares and dividends.</p>
              <p>   They have no Central Depository accounts and had bought the shares at $2 each in the company's 1993 initial public offering.</p>
              <p>   The shares have returned more than twice that amount since.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="line-height: 115%; color: #77933c; font-size: 14pt;      "><span style="font-family: Calibri;">• </span></span>Another 74,000 are shareholders who have yet to claim $53.7 million in dividends, which is in SGX safe-keeping.</p>
              <p>   They cannot be contracted and did not cash their dividend cheques. Unclaimed dividends are returned to the relevant listed companies after six years.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Besides locating the rightful owners, SGX executive vice-president Chew Sutat said the exercise will help to make Singaporeans more aware of the role that share investment can play in their financial planning.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>   He said: "We hope to draw attention (to the fact that) investing in the equity market brings about returns."</p>
              <p>   SGX's head of retail investors Lynn Gaspar said: "Singaporeans work very hard for their money, but we have to make our money work harder for us."</p>
              <p>   To encourage investors to come forward, SGX is waiving the administrative fee for the re-issuance of dividend cheques and dividend crediting until Jan 26.</p>
              <p>   To check if you own any unclaimed assets, go to <a href="http://www.sgx.com/mygateway">www.sgx.com/mygateway</a> or call 6589-8039 during office hours.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 115%; font-size: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">He received $100,000</span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Private school operator Winson Choo, 49, was among the investors SGX managed to trace down.</p>
              <p>   He received a phonecall from SGX about three months ago. At stake: An estimated $100,000 dividends.</p>
              <p>   Mr Choo told The New Paper: "I was very surprised when they reminded me. I'm just a small fry."</p>
              <p>   He knew about the money but was "too lazy" to do anything about the accumulated dividends. Paralysed after suffering a stroke in 2002, the Serangoon North resident also found it a hassle to deposit cheques.</p>
              <p>   "There are no facilities in my estate I have to take a cab to Ang Mo Kio Central for the quick cheque deposit service," he said.</p>
              <p>   After applying for the Direct Crediting Service, Mr Choo's money was credited into his account within the week. He intends to park the money in a foreign currency account.</p>
              <p>   "It feels wonderful to get back my money after so many years. The staff did a good job."</p>

              <p>Got a call from the loan shark syndicate today. It was another person as he claimed. i cant really tell over the phone if it was the same dude. anyway he was asking me why my payment was late. i explained to him that it wasnt late. I was due to pay back last week when his colleague forcefully dropped another sum of loan to my account without my consent and didnt give me a chance to settle my last installment for the existing loan. And i told him i was pissed to receive his vulgar barrages. He actually apologized for that and after some verifying he said that it was a colleague of his. This colleague got drunk and did stuff like that. He made me narrated the whole saga and he note it down as a statement which he said he will let his boss know of this incident. So he gave me an account to make the last remaining payment installment. He said that the reloan amount of $300, he will notify his boss and let me know the outcome.</p>
              <p>He also mentioned that this is a business they are doing. they wouldnt want to sabotage such relationship as he noticed that i am always very prompt on my payments. With that he hanged up.</p>
              <p>Frankly, regardless what is the outcome i am prepare to pay off if interest if it is added for the loan that i did not agree to.  i just want to move on. but i will take the advice of Jen San. terminate my bank account and change my hp number.</p>

              was a different account every time. at my last repayment, i did not

              $300 into my account without my agreement. and now demand me to
              continue my loan installments. i only borrow what i can return and

              <p>so there are two accounts, and one is your account where loan sharks or anybody can put in money? hahaha..the day money that is not yours come in, you either report to the bank that unauthorised money goes into your account or you verify with the loan sharks and then deposit back into their account and close the account. You can't only if you use that money, by accident?</p>
              <p>Bank account, with online banking facilities, it is prudent for one to protect their account properly.</p>

              these loan sharks are sharks...they deposit into your account but will not easily allow you to return the money back to them...you won't know how to return the money that was deposited, until a week later then they will demand repayment with interest, but they will not accept full repayment, so that they have recurring business...
