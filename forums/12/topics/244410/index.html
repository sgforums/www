I got shortlisted for a few companies, so not yet briefed cuz I'm not officially in the company yet. But once I got the job then the problem would arise... like what to where and stuff like that. So I think it's better to know first hand the type of dressing which is allowed/disallowed usually at these kinda jobs</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>usually smart casual will do...but it depends on what company you are in. if you dont like to wear skirts, wear pants loh. plus a nice-looking blouse. when you go to the company for the first time, observe how the people generally dress there. dont wear jeans or t-shirts unless it is your company culture. some companies do allow you to wear jeans on fridays.</div>
