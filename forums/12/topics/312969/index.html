              <p>Hey guys, i've been very down since recieving  my O level result in feb.</p>
              <p>My results are not "that" bad, but it's just that i failed my maths.</p>
              <p>L1R4 - 21points</p>

              <p>E Maths - E8</p>
              <p>Upon rcieving the slip(form A) for the courses which im eligiable for, i can only spot one poly course. N78(digital visual effects) of Ngee Ann Poly. I tried to enroll into the course, but sadly im being rejected.</p>
              <p>So i tried DAE for RP and NYP. Sadly, both schs rejected me too.</p>
              <p>At the same time, i'm already applying for NAFA as a back up.</p>
              <p>Some of my friends who failed their maths, and even having a COP higer then me gets a course by RP's DAE. So im quite confuss why didnt i get a course.</p>
              <p>I did work hard for my maths paper (since mid year last year), but i still cant managed a pass.</p>
              <p>Do you guys think by going down dirrectly to RP to appeal will do any help?</p>
              <p>I seriously wanna get into a poly as it's been my dream. Now everything seems shattered in my life. I cant imagine when april 14, all my friends will be attenting sch, and i'll be alone at home doing nothing.</p>

              <p>hi,</p>
              <p>perhaps you can try enlisting for NS and in the same time, retake your maths.</p>
              <p>it might be tough though. but if you are determine to go to poly, i am sure you will try to work hard enough to obtain a better grade.</p>
              <p>if you are below 18, there's an volunteerly early enlistment scheme. which can be found at www.ns.sg under pre-enlistees.</p>
              <p>if you are over 18, then call up ns.sg hotline inform them that you wish to enlist for NS.</p>
              <p><br>if don't want to enlist then go for private diploma.</p>
              <p>but still, i suggest you go NS and retake your maths as a private candidate.</p>
              <p>reason is because, (i assume you are either a Singaporean Male or PR) most  male need to enlist for NS.</p>
              <p>and try applying for poly the yr once you get your results. if still have not ORD yet, you can ask the poly to reserve the course for you till you ORD.</p>

              <p>Depends on how badly they fail. A D7 will still get them a place. And if they do get in, they have to pass Maths with the next retake else they are out of the school or before they graduate from the poly.</p>

              <p>ok...so I take it as U will be a happy man with something like 5 x B3=15 points...and/or get in ANY course in ANY poly.</p>
              <p>DAE is like the last of the last exercise for people to get in...if U cant get in at DAE...then I think U dun have to personally go down...U can only pray that U are the best of all the people that didnt get in...and when poly term starts...there might be people who dont show and U manage to get an offer...but this MIGHT only happen in the 1st week of sch and I personally would put the chance of it happening as like less than 1%...so dun count on it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Mid year last year till actual exams is not very long...and it depends on how hard U studied...I think ur best option now is to see if U can get into NAFA or find part-time work while redoing ur Maths as private candidate...if U are a guy...then CMPB might want a deferment letter from U....so U might need to get urself enrolled with a private school...which is of course more expensive than the govt secondary schools...or if U dun have any illusions of wanting to be an officer and things like that...U can think about serving out ur NS liability 1st.</p>

              <p>Depends on how badly they fail. A D7 will still get them a place. And if they do get in, they have to pass Maths with the next retake else they are out of the school or before they graduate from the poly.</p>

              <p>ok...so I take it as U will be a happy man with something like 5
              x B3=15 points...and/or get in ANY course in ANY poly.</p>
              <p>DAE is like the last of the last exercise for people to get
              in...if U cant get in at DAE...then I think U dun have to
              personally go down...U can only pray that U are the best of all the
              people that didnt get in...and when poly term starts...there might
              be people who dont show and U manage to get an offer...but this
              MIGHT only happen in the 1st week of sch and I personally would put
              the chance of it happening as like less than 1%...so dun count on
              it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Mid year last year till actual exams is not very long...and it
              depends on how hard U studied...I think ur best option now is to
              see if U can get into NAFA or find part-time work while redoing ur
              Maths as private candidate...if U are a guy...then CMPB might want
              a deferment letter from U....so U might need to get urself enrolled
              with a private school...which is of course more expensive than the
              govt secondary schools...or if U dun have any illusions of wanting
              to be an officer and things like that...U can think about serving
              out ur NS liability 1st.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I guess you are right. There's near to no chances to get into a poly already for me except retaking and pass my maths. maybe i should just learn to accept the fact that i cant get into a poly.</p>

              <p>I can understand how u feel because I always failed my maths in sec school and even my teacher almost gave up on me. lol.. but luckily I managed to pass my maths during O'levels and I felt so relieved..</p>
              <p>Why u didn't want to retake ur maths? I think u should give it a try, and u said that u want to get into a poly so badly. If not, little options are left for u.</p>

              <p>i would say is better to go ite and retake o-level as a private candi at the same time. cause if you would to go down personally they would reply you "we would only accept appeal via email". But is still worth to give it a try.</p>
              <p>or either,get the MP of your area to write a letter for you,that might help.</p>

              <p>Retake your O'level Maths! It's not that diffcult, you know. Try to do the ten years series on your own at least once, and ask your friends/tutor if you have any enquries. But don't try methods like going out study with friends, you'll end up doing nothing. I've been through O'level just last year and I understand how you feel. Tell you what, I only passed my Maths once throughout my Secondary School life, which is Sec 1 Common Test. And I attained a B3 in the end, what about you? Just bear it through, even though you may not like Maths but take it as the last chance of doing Maths and you'll be free to choose any course you want!</p>

              <p>I guess the ITE would welcome you with open arms...</p>
              <p>And yes, appealing sometimes helps... especially an opening when the student decided not to take the place that was offered... or when the poly decided to take you in while you will need to retake certasin subjects. Maths is rather important as you would be facing probnlems to catch up... but that do not apply for RP though... at least that is what I think...<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              <p>i think u really need to retake your o level maths, find a full time job meanwhile. honestly, 1 year isn't a very big difference in the working world.</p>
              <p>or u can go ns and take the while serving ns. but be warn without the papers going ns is really tough. u will most likely tio all the sai kang.</p>
