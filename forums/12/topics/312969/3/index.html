              <p>Forumers have given you many good advice.</p>
              <p>1. retake "O" level, get good results and join poly next year</p>
              <p>2. join ITE, get good results and go on to Poly</p>
              <p>3. join Nafa but make sure that you are really interested in Arts and Design, not just to get into any school to study.</p>
              <p>4. join NS, retake "O" level and get good results to join poly</p>
              <p>Think carefully on the options and make your choice but option 4 is clearly not a very good option.</p>

              <p><br>That is plain insensitive, true, TS might not be well-versed in math; but it is not on your stand to comment, assuming that TS did not try.</p>
              <p>I would recommend that you enter into NAFA - Either the design or architecture courses(Don't try the singing or dancing, you're future is limited, unless, of course, you have a talent and interest)</p>
              <p>Or, if you are a male, enrol for NS first, this does not waste your time because, ultimately all males(except for those with MBBS or related degrees) have to go through the process.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile you can retake O levels and try to push up your score as much as possible(push those C5/6 up) as well as maths up, WHILE using your current cert to apply for the next enrolment.</p>

              <p>And the courses you appealed for, do you know why you can't get
                  in? Because its not L1R4, its L1R2B2, Language(english) Related 2
                  and Best 2, the courses you chosen for DAE probably fail the
                  category.</p>

              <p>If you are trying to say that I'm not giving you any advise,
                  then just flame me. I believed that one has to work hard for what

              <p> </p>
              <p>Try your best to see if you can get private O, because SAF will
                  defer your NS by a year for you to retake if i'm not wrong. You
                  have to work now from now. Its your life, be serious about it.</p>

              <p>If i really wanna get into a poly, i should just work hard for it. But sadly, i realised that abit too late. I must say i did really worked hard for my maths.

              <p>For me i was also in the same situation as you, O's got 17 points but maths D7, but for me i went in army first (no choice cus cannot defer) and retake while i'm serving NS... Thankfully i pass and got accepted into SP doing a course which i like...</p>
              <p>O lvl holder go ns not tt bad actually still can be a spec, my time inside quite enjoyable lei, COs all very nice... i kanna stay-out unit somemore...lol...u just hv to be positive and do the task assigned to u to the best of your ablilty.</p>

              <p>If you are interested in business course, you could consider taking diploma courses in Singapore Institute of Managment or Kaplan APMI. I am not too sure they will look into your maths result. Based on my knowledge, SIM diploma will take a shorter time but will be more expensive. But, after getting diploma, you can take their degree courses in a shorter period and you can come out as a degree holder with a shorter frame of time(exclude NS). Most of the young working adults are also mugging their studies in SIM so if i were you right now, i would seriously looking into this option.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And you definetly have no time to study for maths during your NS time!!!</p>

              <p>Brother, my situation is similar as yours. Or said to be more unlucky than yours. I got 4 distinctions in my o'lvl that time and a E8 in my English Subject and my L1R4 is 13. Same like you, I tried all ways such as DAE to get into polytechnic, yet none is successful. Having hopeless feeling, seeing ALL my friends who got higher points but entering polytechnic or JC with a good course, I never give up and continue to search for an alternatives of life or work towards my future.</p>
              <p>Here's my advice for you. Firstly, don't give up and this is the most stressful period you need will struggle through it.</p>
              <p>Think carefully, what are the alternatives you can do next that it will not waste your youth. </p>
              <p>1. Such as finding private schools for the courses which you like. Just that you have to pay more for the school fee.</p>
              <p>2. Early enlistment and re-take during NS days, but I believe here you still have to wait for a few months unless you have already gone for medical check up. Imagine you will have the 2 years in NS to re-take you o'lvl. Are you able to do it? Do check out with Mindef exactly when will you enlist if to opt for early enlistment. Meanwhile, work outside to earn some income or study before going in NS which was what I did. However, I only improved by one grade and I'll still re-taking, for the last year even though that I can actually go poly. Take note that if you enlist without a A'lvl or Dip, you may be going to mono-intake. And u'll only enter poly at the age of 20-21. Will you mind age?</p>
              <p>3. Like what some of them say, go for ITE while re-taking O'lvl. Some people did that too.</p>
              <p>4. Just re-take O'lvl and focus on that subject. As for this option, you got to really make sure that you will get at least a passing grade for your failed subjects.</p>
              <p>5. Overseas education.</p>
              <p>I believe there are more options or the options can be altered for a better purpose. Nobody can really tell you which option is the best for you cos only you urself understand whether which option makes you best out of it. You got to choose the options which SUITS you most.</p>
              <p>Bro, take care and stay happy! =)</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>first of all, don't be depressed. I was once in the exactly same situation as you.</p>
              <p>I would strongly recommend you to retake maths as a private candidate and study hard. You could also enrol in ITE or other institutions to spend this year meaningfully, as well as widen your interests.</p>
              <p>Remember, don't give up hope. Entering NS will be too early now, so study while you are still fresh. No doubt this is a difficult period for you but please do endure and go through it.</p>
              <p>It will also be good if you can get a tutor to help you out in math. Coping alone may be harder, and makes you less motivated. Just take it as your last chance to progress further, instead of lagging behind even more.</p>
              <p>I am sure you can do it.</p>
