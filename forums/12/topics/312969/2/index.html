              <p>hey don't go to an arts school unless you're really interested in arts or design. have you taken dnt or art for your O's and how do you think of a project-based education?</p>
              <p>my advise is find a course you have passion in and aim to ultimately graduate in tht course with a degree no matter how long it takes.</p>
              <p>say if you got into a course in poly or in the few govt art schools that you dont like, you would drop out anyway.</p>
              <p>that said, the entrance test at NAFA or Laselle shouldnt be a problem if you've taken DNT or Art, Temasek Design School might be abit strict during their interviews cause they want people with the real potential to succeed. prepare a portfolio though.</p>

              <p>dun go to NAFA for the sake of "getting into a school like your friends" unless you really have a flair for the Arts or really interested in the Arts. By doing so, you may deprive others of the same situation as your only that they ARE really interested in the Arts and you may end up doing bad if u arent interested in it.</p>
              <p>You mentioned your "dream" is to go Poly..Then, why havent you work towards it? U flunked ur Maths and seriously, u can't expect a golden ticket to a poly, can u? Settle for ITE education first and wipe out the stigma of ITE because reality is, you arent eligible for poly education just yet.</p>

              <p><br>Hey bro,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you seriously don't think of retaking your O maths, then there's really nothing much you can do in pursuing your dreams. The rules are like that, either you meet it or you have alternate plans.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Like one of the forummers had said, don't go into arts school if you have no interest in it. It's not easy as everyone think it is.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My bro failed his O English, he chose to go ITE and retook his O English. Anyway, he couldn't make it, complete ITE in good grades, go to army, go to poly, just finish his part time degree with NUS.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Or you may want to go to NS while retaking your O maths. But I don't advise that, as another forummer correctly pointed out, with only O levels, most of the things you are going to be assigned would be sai kang. But then that depends on what you want to achieve in NS as well.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sometimes, there are just people need to walk a bit longer route to achieve in life. It's all about perseverence.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Even if you want to go to the poly, go there do what? It seems like you want to go poly, but have no idea what course you want to take. I was like that, I went in, failed my engineering maths, and got retained for a year. Also quite a waste of time. Think through carefully in what you want to do. Meantime, you can consider taking up some temp job so you won't feel that you have 'nothing to do'.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Good luck.</p>

              <p>i hate people like you talking.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>you said its your dream to enter the poly, yet in the first place you don't want to work hard.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>21 pts and its not that bad? Pls...don't kid me. WAKE UP ITS 21 PTS.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And the courses you appealed for, do you know why you can't get in? Because its not L1R4, its L1R2B2, Language(english) Related 2 and Best 2, the courses you chosen for DAE probably fail the category.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you are trying to say that I'm not giving you any advise, then just flame me. I believed that one has to work hard for what he or she wants.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Try your best to see if you can get private O, because SAF will defer your NS by a year for you to retake if i'm not wrong. You have to work now from now. Its your life, be serious about it.</p>
