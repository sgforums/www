              <p>There is no such thing as a good idea or bad idea in staying with Poly or going to Australia for studies. There is no such thing as a good or bad idea to even rest one year for health reasons.<br><br>Instead, the more pressing questions are: Are you willing to lose the time and effort spent during your Poly days?Â Are you willingly to move to unfamiliar country and take up education there?<br><br>These are the considerations you have to think about. And once you make a decision, you should not regret the decisions make because you had your reasons.<br><br>Of course, you must also consider the course offered, the future prospects after receiving the qualifications, the problem of being overseas and had not fully recuperated etc etc.</p>

              <p>The healthcare in Australia sux. Got one time I suffered bad gastric and went to the ER ward. Nobody attended (not even the nurses) to me for 4 hours. I had to wait in excrutiating pain (lyng in bed) while listening to an elderly white lady next to my ward, screaming in pain for 2 hours. There were only 4 doctors for 100 patients.</p>
              <p>Also after 5pm all their clinics closed. If I feel ill, I had to wait till next day.</p>
              <p>I prefer Malaysian clinics where I can go see the doctor and then he dispense his medicine on the spot. especially when I am very sick, feel like vomiting and cannot walk, this is very convenient.</p>
              <p>In Australia, the doctor see you and then consult you, after that, you have to take public transport to the nearest pharmacy to get your medicine. Doctors in Aust don't dispense medicine. Try walking to pharmacy during winter when it is 0 to 5 degrees.</p>

              <p>Hey suffered from something similar from you 4 years ago so I can comprehend how you feel. I made my decision to stop schooling and came back after 2 years. If you feel the need to talk to me on a more personal basis you can mail my mailbox I'll try to reply asap.</p>
              <p>I understand that stress can play an important part in the remission of crohns diesease but what do you find stressful about poly? You can always differ and go back to poly when your health is better because crohns is serious and should not be taken lightly.</p>
              <p>Also why move to australia? Don't mind if I ask but is it beacuse you feel different and need to escape or start life afresh or is the need to suceed in Singapore too stressful for you because in Australia you might find a different kind of stress...</p>
              <p>Australia has a different climate from SG and it might affect crohns and are you really sure you want to move away from doctors that know your condiiton well. You might not receive health benefits as you're not a citizen of australia.</p>

              <p>So instead of troubling your parents, you want to trouble your aunt and uncle? If you are sick, don't make others take care of you. How annoying would it be, if you had a relative from overseas who was sick and you had to keep tabs on them all the time?

              <p>Hey just wanna tell you that - if you really want to achieve your goals and dreams - go for it. If you think this is really for you - have a hard thought about it.</p>
              <p>Having said this - make sure you make necessary homework and preparation about life there. Ask your unc and auntie - about the health facilities there. Yes I know you are not a citizen nor PR threfore you're not entitled to medical benefits there and if anything were to befall you- treatment in Australia is very costly. However it is easy to obtain PR in Australia. Once you start working - you apply for PR. I tell you in ranking the easiest to obtain PR - 1) Singapore 2) Canada 3) Australia. Unfortunately your Crohn's disease may count against your PR application. Perhaps you should research this with a migration agent because Aussie govt do conduct medical test on any VISA or PR application. Don't worry as long as you wanna study and pay private tution fees - Aust govt is very welcome to give you student VISA.</p>
              <p>I understand that you need certain treatment drugs for your condition. Like anti inflammatory drugs. Check up with friends or your auntie/unc about the availability of drugs in Australia. I recall last time when I had pimple problem - I needed the drug Roaccutane. In malaysia it cost be a whopping RM300 for a box of 30 pills. But in Australia - Roaccutane is heavily subsidised so I only got it for AUD20 per box. So maybe in Australia - they do subsidise your drugs but check it out first.</p>
              <p>If you think the hardship is worth achieing your dreams - go for it.</p>

              <p>This is all just a ploy by pharmaceutical companies to boost their sales. You see, they don't want to findÂ a cure for your crohn's disease because they know they can keep on selling their painkillers and anti-inflamation pills. You just keep on taking them but they are not healing you- just taking away the symptoms.</p>
              <p>So my advice is, try to take more vitamin supplements. I have a friend who suffer from a disease and doctor ask him to take anti inflammation pills, it was killing him. He was getting ulcers in mouth and stomach. And then there was gastro bleeding. And then he decided to take a supplement (I will not disclose), after a few months, he showed signs of full recovery.</p>

              <p>I think the disease is not clearly understood. Therefore, we do not know the cause of it for sure. So, pharmaceutical companies simply do not want to spend billions of dolars on a disease that is poorly understood and with small prevalence. Its usually about costs these days.</p>

              <p>Ok I tell you story.</p>
              <p>I have a friend who suffer from back injury. He was a fitness freak, love to do sit-ups sometimes 100 a day. Even do sit-ups hanging upside down like batman.</p>
              <p>Then one day, he hurt his back, he still exercise more because he believe in pushing himself. But he injure his back so badly that he can't walk and can't sleep well (wake up middle of night with pain).</p>
              <p>He went to doctor - x-ray and MRI tell nothing. He suffer pain for 2 years. Doctor prescribe NSAID. Mobic too weak so he took celebrex. Celebrex didn't help much but cause lots of ulcer and uncomfortable stomach upsets. My friend had to put ice packs for hours. NSAID not cheap come more, very expensive.</p>
              <p>Then the doctor decided to get my friend blood tested. Diagnosed him as Ankylosing Spondylitis. Some sort of arthritis joint disease. No cure.</p>
              <p>My friend check internet for cure, tried diets and ask fellow sufferers for solution but no solution.</p>
              <p>Then his pain got worse. It spread to the back of his legs and buttocks. He could not walk properly and needed crutches. He didn't exercise for 2 years, his weight bloated and he got fat. Imagine from 65kg, he became 90kg. He was depressed because he could not lead normal life, ate a lot and could not go jogging, something he loved to do. Cannot go to gym - he also like to body build.</p>
              <p>Doctor continue with NSAID. Then doctor ask him to go to Rheumatologist - to get more stronger drugs like Steroids for his joint pain. The side effects was even worst ! Potential heart attack and liver damage. My friend tried physiotherapy but pain got worse. It got so bad that the doctor propose to get my friend surgery to get joint replacements. My friend was shocked and depressed.</p>
              <p>One day, his uncle from hongkong came down to visit his family. Turns out his uncle suffers rheumatism arthritis, joint pains. His uncle had a simple solution - eat supplements, GLOCUSAMINE. So my friend went to buy blackmores - Glocosamine. Ate them daily. After 2 weeks, my friend could sleep well, no need to get up at 4 am with bed sores. Then my friend check the internet, decided to build up more cartilage, bought CHONDROTIN and COLLAGEN TYPE 2, elements important to make cartilage. His mobility improved and paid reduced. After 3 months, he resumed jogging. And he lost 20kg.</p>
              <p>What the heck? Joint replacement? NSAID? Steroids? Blady pharma co and doctors wanna make $$$ out of him. Simple supplement much cheaper Glocosamine - readily available at Guardian pharmacy is much more effective.</p>
              <p>So see? It is a conspiracy by pharmaceutical companies to make more $$$ out of you. They prescribe NSAID because they know you get addicted to it. Pharmaceutical co want you to buy more NSAID to increase their sales and profit. They don't want to find a cure because a one pill solution won't help to grow their sales. Pharma cos are evil. Doctors also want to make money, they know supplement is simple cure but they can sell more medicine and perform operation - to make money from you.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>OMG! I didnt think that glucosamine and chondroitin actually worked. Wow! That's amazing that he is recovered now. To be honest with you, western medicine and its drugs are no so wonderful. They cause so much unnecessary side effects. Often, most drugs work by inhibiting symptoms and not the root of the problem. Its sad to hear that your friend actually had painful ulcers and had to go through the ordeal. Steroids are far worse esp if you had to take em long term. Bless your friend. Damn the medical people and pharma company. Doctors simply prescribe you drugs according to trial, like lab rats. 1 drug, 2nd drug, the other, and subsequent. Thnx for that story</p></div>

              <p>Actually, glocosamine and chondroitin are western supplements. They are no different from Vitamin and calcium supplements. FDA classifies them as food.</p>
              <p>Western drugs are amazing. Problem is that, doctors and Pharma companies are motivated byÂ profit. So they are not willing to promote a supplement that is easily manufactured and has too many competitors. Pharma companies rather make some silly drug like vigra and then have IP protection to prevent other companies from copying them so that they can monopoloze the drug.</p>
              <p>Therefore Pharma companies would rather pour more R&amp;D on anti-inflammation drugs which has higher profit margins and higher prices than the more common glucosamine. Everybody is selling glucosamine - Kordel, Blackmores, Amway, etc. But how many are selling Celebrex.</p>
              <p>Yes my friend is lucky. But what about Uraniumfish who is suffering from Crohn's disease? Better go check the internet and try more supplements, it doesn't kill and its cheaper - no harm trying. If doesn't work, hey at least you tried.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Yup its true, Pharma companies pour out so much on R&amp;D to develop a better drug, say a better NSAID with lesser side effects. After they cleared clinical trials, they will have about 20 years to monopolize the market once a patent is issued. I think its just cruel. We have moved to become a society not driven by compassion but profit and money. This is the sad truth!Â </p></div>
