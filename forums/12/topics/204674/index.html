            <div class='col-md body'>hi saw you in the fetured topic.<br><br>I was a snr recruitment consultant before and your girlfriend's profile, I came across many too.<br><br>By what you have mentioned, her past working experiences and attitude towards the job, she should be very pampered by you and although 28 years of age, should be very pretty right.<br><br>Actually is okay to change job frequently but how she handled each job that really counts and you will see how far she can go.<br><br>By the way, since you are in this forum, am I right you have already made up your mind somehow, you are not willing to forego her that's why you are here to get confirmation on your decision.<br><br>As a recruited, she already been blacklisted.<br><br>In employer's point of view, the positon she held before, ya presentable counts anyway employer have nothing to loose because there are so many candidates to choose from whenever she leaves.<br><br>As a boyfriend or future husband, you have responsibilities to discuss with her maybe she got challenges with her work but dare not tell you in depth. She is not a money making machine although she earn S$2K+ but both not happy what's the point.<br><br>You have debt.  Is that your debt or she is in debt too?  If the debt is created by you, you are responsible.  Budget your finances and let her know your situation.  If she loves you she will change unconditionally.  Right.  If not you know what to do.<br><br></div>
