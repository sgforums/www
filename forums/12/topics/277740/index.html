This is clearly a sign that your body is giving you. Now it's time to take some action.<br><br>My suggestion is: If you are financially able, perhaps you can do a MRI scan on coronary arteries and other major vessel around the heart.

And it's all the same: it's about stress, it's about feeling something's wrong with your health, it's about how you don't like something.<br><br>I have one answer that I think can cover all:<br><br>YOU ARE NOT HAPPY WITH YOUR LIFE.<br><br>And there is only one solution:<br><br>BE POSITIVE, TAKE CARE OF YOUR HEALTH, AND PUT SOME EFFORTS IN SMALL RESEARCH ON YOUR CONCERN.<br><br>Why ?<br><br>- Because all your negativity about your works, people around you, etc... will only give you more pressure and stress, which obviously can affect your health.<br>- Because you need to know about your body, seek professional advise and when doctor speaks, listen. Take the medicine, exercise and have healthy food.<br>- Because you can easily find out a lot on google, wikipedia, etc. It is lazy to just type something and wait for all answers to flow in, which I doubt you will take anyway.<br><br>Right. now you hate me. so what ?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>alba it does sound to me like a panic attack, and if stress is getting to you as per the above persons post it would make sense. it doesn't neccesarily require a doc or drastic measures, just take the time to reduce your stress - there are a lot of things that can help - just a few suggestions:<br><br>- Reduce caffeine intake if you drink lots of coffee or tea or soft drinks - caffeine can be a major factor when it comes to stress and panic attacks and if you drink a lot of tea, coffee or drinks like Coke which contain high concentrations of caffeine it bumps up your blood pressure significantly<br><br>- Reduce the stressful situations you get into when you can, if doing something unneccesary stresses you out try not to do it, eg, taking a particular route to work, if theres a less stressful route that adds maybe 10 minutes to your journey time take that instead<br><br>- If you smoke try to reduce the amount, I know that most smokers believe it calms them but Nicotine is a double edged sword, it acts both ways, it may take a few days or weeks to be noticable but significantly reducing the amount of cigarettes you smoke per day could have a big effect<br><br>- Panic attacks and stress are predominantly psychological, if you can try to avoid getting to exploding point in your mind the chances are you won't have a panic attack and you'll feel a lot better. Things like counting to ten when you feel stress coming on, taking a short walk etc could help<br><br>- If you can, take a holiday, get away from the things that stress you out and relax, you might find coming back to things with a more positive and relaxed mindset can help you get rid of it altogether.<br><br>If it happens more regularly it would be wise to see a doctor, if nothing more than that chest pain can be very serious and when it's not obviously caused by something non-serious it should always be checked out by a doc. same as when you get whacked on the head a bit too hard.</div>

Congratulations, you can go on and on to ask people just for the sake for releasing your stress but people can only listen,comment and give you advice and the rest is up to you.<br><br>Seems that you don't need any medical help, you just need to be here to ask for listening ears.</div>

You would have a new one once every few days. And it's all the same: it's about stress, it's about feeling something's wrong with your health, it's about how you don't like something.<br><br>I have one answer that I think can cover all:<br><br>YOU ARE NOT HAPPY WITH YOUR LIFE.<br><br>And there is only one solution:<br><br>BE POSITIVE, TAKE CARE OF YOUR HEALTH, AND PUT SOME EFFORTS IN SMALL RESEARCH ON YOUR CONCERN.<br><br>Why ?<br><br>- Because all your negativity about your works, people around you, etc... will only give you more pressure and stress, which obviously can affect your health.<br>- Because you need to know about your body, seek professional advise and when doctor speaks, listen. Take the medicine, exercise and have healthy food.<br>- Because you can easily find out a lot on google, wikipedia, etc. It is lazy to just type something and wait for all answers to flow in, which I doubt you will take anyway.<br><br>Right. now you hate me. so what ?<br></div></blockquote>Bluecom, well said.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
