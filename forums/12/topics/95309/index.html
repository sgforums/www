            <div class='col-md body'>damn pek chek la<br>can understand how u feel but it's liddat one<br>aniwae, keep an eye out for those who take you for granted and if they ask you for anything again, just dun give em an easy and direct reply like be wishy-washy and uncertain of your answers and make em double guess your answers or u could make it a point nv to discuss school work outta class.<br>but it's quite sad if u kena stucked with this bunch of people and taking a wrong step is like asking to be ostracised.<br>if u realli want to go for an outing, be a bit more thicked skinned and ask the first few times and at the end of the day say "call me out for future outings pls thx!" or something along those lines.<br>After some time they should auto call u for it if u "behaved" properly during those outings.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I remember I used to have fair weathered friends like this. I was dumb enough to help them out and in the end they did better than me and forgot about me somehow. When I was in uni ,I was a lil wiser....I don't really help anyone beyond lecture notes or tutor them unless they have proved to be true friends. People can call u selfish but ultimately they are actually competing against you. I basically kept quiet ...pretend I don't know anything and ,nobody except my real friends talked to me and asked me out. Those friends are still my friends today, we did well together and we kept in contact. Some of these friends have been there for me for 5 years already.<br><br>Perhaps ur helping the wrong people for the wrong reasons. Stop and observe who ur real friend is. It is selfish I know but that was how I survived in my workplace politics. I don't teach all that I know for self preservation purposes hence I am not expendable ......yet I work as part of a team by contributing  <span style="font-style: italic;"> knowledge that everyone knows</span> and I never hesitate to claim credit for what I have done ...I don't let people claim my work as their own . My boss and workers call me a good team member because I seem to be contributing more than what I am contributing.<br><br>Probably u have to learn how to seem like ur helping but when ur not actually helping - i.e. not beyond ur class textbooks or notes.Keep ur private study notes to urself.  Slowly these fair weather friends will back off once they find u cannot help them to achieve a result they are looking for.</div>
