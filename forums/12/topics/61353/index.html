Neither can I imagine what kinda person would I be today if I've managed to survive under the salvation of those thoughts...<br><br>My life is busy. Not really that good but at least better than the past. I'd always hold this belief. No matter how deep a shit you're in, you're bound to bounce back... Unless you die? To DEEPER a shit you're in, the higher the probablity that your life would get 'better'... Go think about it...?<br><br>I know there're many 'mistakes' that I've made in my past life which have kinda greatly affected my life today. I know there're probably little I can do today to change them. Then again, I'm not sure if I would even wanna change them? For without them, I won't have been who I am today? A NOBODY....

I believe I think too much....<br><br>My main concerns now other than work and survival would be the future generations of human kinds... What kinda person have we become as the world constantly reshape itself and changes....<br><br>Is it kinda be a brighter one? I certainly hope so...? But of course, 'hope' alone is certainly not enough for me... Sometimes I just wish there're so much more that I can do about it... But reluctant as I always am... I'm afraid... Of what I could end up doing? What if I really turn up to be a 'Devil'?<br><br>Damn...
