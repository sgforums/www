              Hi everyone, my name is Cassidy, and i'm very sorry my first post has to be asking for help already..but I feel really trapped and I could really use some non-judgemental help right now..
              
              My mom died when I was very young and since then, all my dad would do was focus on taking care of me and my younger sister.
              A few years ago, when I was in my early teens, he talked to us about him dating again and we were okay with it so he eventually married a slightly quirky but generally okay woman.
              
              
              It turns out she had quite an ugly side and recently my dad caught her cheating on him..
              Anyway, SHE filed for divorce against him, as if to push the blame, stating that he was an alcoholic abuser and he beat me and my sister constantly, etc. all lies. (my dad has NEVER hit us ever.)
              
              he just wants to get away from everything and he can't live without me and my sister..we're all the family each other has.
              
              He plans to migrate us back to Illinois (hometown) and he said he'll work out the divorce court stuff himself.
              
              I am 17 this year, just finished my O levels and i'm just wondering..what should I do?
              
              I had no intention of going on with my poly or JC studies, but this is all so sudden and he wants us to leave ASAP and never come back..
              We're all PRs here, and my friends say Singapore could even track us down overseas and bring us back for trials!
              
              I know it sounds absurd but i'm so nervous I can't really think straight..
              
              Nothing is set in stone yet, he hasn't bought any tickets but he's planning everything really fast, should I stand up to him and tell him this is wrong and I have to stay?..
              I feel like it'd really send him into depression and I don't think I can cope living here alone with no family at all..
              
              Can someone please help me make up my mind about this?..
              
              I'd just leave with him and my sister if I felt it were that easy but i'm just so worried the law will catch up to me even if I don't come back..

              <p>Cazzidy, you have nothing to fear. There is no legal requirement for you to stay in Singapore. Unless you are also holding a Singapore passport .</p>
              <p> As long as your father and/or you did not commit any criminal crime, the court has no reason to track your family down overseas.</p>
              <p>Divorce is not a criminal crime, it's just an "inconvenient" procedure.</p>
              <p>Your stepmother is threading on thin ice when she falsely accused your father of child  battery/violence. She can very likely get herself in trouble if she persist.</p>
              <p>After O levels.. you can start school at your new home in Illinois. Go into a college or university. Your options are plenty. Start a new life, make new friends, look forward to a new future.</p>
              <p>Since you are a PR.. and have no plans to return to Singapore, all you need is just let your PR expire. If you wish to return for a  visit.. you return as a tourist.</p>

They are NS defaulters. Under the Enlistment Act, NS defaulters shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding three years or both.  They would have to fulfil their National Service obligations, thereafter.<br><br>None of them are allowed to return on student passes or work passes or on PR status, without resolving their NS offence and serving out their NS liability.</p></div>

              <p>u can follow your folks back to the u.s.a.and no sporean gov will bring u back.they can only jump up n down from far away swearing to arrest u once u come into spore again.that is a fact!</p>
              <p>the singapore education is not recognised in the usa.and its best you go to the usa a community colledge and get some skills like electrical electronics mechanical.its like 2 years only before u start going to work.and its pretty affordable.</p>
              <p>if u have lotsa cash,u can go take a degree which is 3 or 4 years.</p>
              <p>dont worry about n,s,..............by the time u go to the usa..its just a bad dream.just dont return because theres too mucgh red tape leading to arrests next time u visit spore at changi airport.</p>

              <p>Is Singapore the only country that insist on "National Obligation" for PRs ?</p>

              <p>If a child of a Singaporean go to their schools.. enjoy the social benefits accorded to the citizens in a foreign country is the Singaporean child also obligated to serve their host nation ?</p>

              <p>To OP: If you dont feel the need to do NS intrinsically, move back to Illinois. You can continue with community colleges or directly to Uni with some extra effort.</p>
