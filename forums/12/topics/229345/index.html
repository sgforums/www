            <div class='col-md body'>Your problem is not really about whether you feel like mixing with your new classmates or not. In my opinion, there is really no big deal that you retain as long as you know what you are doing. When it comes to pride, ultimately, you will realize that your opinion of yourself is what matters the most and the opinions of others is insignificant since they will all forget about you anyway.<br><br>I guess, maybe, your problem is that you still do not know what you want to achieve in school.<br><br>Everyday when I go to my campus for lessons, I will always come across this quote which I remember quite well.<br><blockquote>"Everything's in the mind. That's where it all starts. Knowing what you want is the first step towards getting it. (MacWest) </blockquote>So what I suggest is that everyday, when you are at school, ask yourself few questions.<br><br>1. Why am I here?<br>2. What do I want to achieve here?<br>3. If I cannot get what I want here, where should I be?<br><br>Hope you can learn something here.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

At least stop using "dey", "cls", "skl" etc...<br><br>I think you need to overcome this yourself.<br><br>Ask yourself why you retain. If you played too much, cut down or stop. If you cant understand your work, you got another year to work on it.<br><br>I would also suggest that you use your spare time to read up on your sec4 work. Considering that its your second time doing sec3, you should have more spare time to do so. It helps when you go to sec4.<br><br>If you work hard, no one should look down on you. They should only be ashame of not working as hard as you.<br><br>I had a friend who retained in JC, scored all As in the end and now in Medical School. My friends who scraped pass J1 and got promoted to J2, passed A's with shit results or flunked it.

I used to be so close with my formal jc1 class n yet nw almost all hav left me after graduation .

Moreover , i had a temporary teacher who downright hinted me that retainees r dumb . I took it in my stride becos i know it is my own fault .<br><br>Sad to say after retaining , i still kinda screwed up my alvls last yr .
