            <div class='col-md body'>It not about how people view you as a person it about how you view ur ownself.<br><br>Studying for the cert is just to have a better stepping stone when go out to work, after that it depend on ur own ability. It doesn't mean that by studying until very high you are the best.<br><br>If you are smart and is good in something, you can make it big too. You don't need to have very high qualification to be successful, on the other hand, if you are good in doing business and is ur own boss, you can have very high qualification ppl working for you isn't it? So who the winner now?<br><br>But if can study then study lah cos afterall that piece of paper is sort of a life insurance for us too.<br><br>The whole issue is never look down on ownself, we gotta believe in ourselve and not get affected by ppl view on us. Remember, you can never please everyone and you can never outstudy anyone. There will always be someone that is more academically better then us.<br><br></div>
