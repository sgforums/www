            <div class='col-md body'>Hi there, im a newbie here and just regist.. having a prob....<br><br>I graduated from sec sch last yr and currently studying in a new env, and i feel lonely sometimes coz i have yet to find a clique of my own. back den in sec sch, I had this standard clique which was alwys buzzing w activities. We would alwys hang out after sch, during recess and celeb after exams and bdays.It was insane.hahah. I know i shld move on and comparing to the 1st 2 mths in sch , im slowly adjusting to tt.<br><br>I gt along perfectly fine w my classmates bt the feelings arent the same with tt clique in sec sch. right up till nw, we do meet and keep in constant contact bt of coz, its nt the same as we go on our sep ways.You might think im a withdrawn person, bt im act totally nt. Im a very pp person, outgoing and am a v talkative person.Bt the sense of security is still nt there.<br><br>Some of my frens seem to be fitting in just fine bt i wonder why im nt? It cld be the fact tt i didn attend first 3 mths so there wld naturally be a prob, and i can say it contributes bt looking at hw my other frens who also din go for 1st three mths, it seems a lil diff frm them. Though i still noe some who are in e same sit as me.<br><br>My sch is v comp so its nt as easy as sec sch to grab leadership roles where u gt to meet evryonne in sch. I managed to secure one, being part of my floorball exco mem.I wan a vibrant sch life so ive sign up for CIP [also coz i wanna help] where i can meet more pp and also told myself to participate in evryth. Dun think im a nt enthu and participative person. I am! as i love activities.  just tt i feel tt the lack of firt 3 mths and a big leadership role has attributed to my prob.<br><br>wat shld i do?</div>
