If you don’t have a doctor then talk to the DSC Clinic or visit a local clinic.<br> <br>Who can have an abortion?<br><br>According to the Singapore Abortion Act law:<br><br>    there is no defined age limit for the abortion procedure<br>    there is no legal requirement for parental consent for minors<br>    abortion is prohibited after 24 weeks (6 months) of pregnancy unless the mother’s life is in danger<br><br>What is the process?<br><br>    Abortion patients must undergo compulsory counselling before the procedure. Girls below 16 years of age need to be counseled at the Health Promotion Board Counselling Centre (except for rape victims).<br>    This is followed by a mandatory waiting period of 48 hours before the procedure can be done.<br>    If you want an abortion and your doctor refuses on personal grounds, you have the right to seek a second opinion. See here for other providers.<br>    Patients will normally undergo post abortion counseling after the procedure and may be required to return a week later to check for any complications.<br>    Because of the risk of infection, some doctors may advise that you should not have sex for up to two weeks after your procedure.<br><br>Types of Abortion<br><br>In Singapore, there are 2 main types of abortion procedure:<br><br>    vacuum aspiration – (up to 14 weeks)<br>    The patient will have to fast for at least 4 hours and sedation will be given as anesthesia (ie you will be put to sleep for about 10 minutes). Then a small tube is placed into the womb via the vagina. An attached vacuum will then remove the pregnancy. The patient should be able to go home after 2 to 4 hours.<br>    Mid Trimester Pregnancy Termination – (14 to 24 weeks)<br>    This process is more complicated and hospitalisation is usually required for a day or two. Medicine is inserted into the vagina to induce natural expulsion of the pregnancy. After the foetus and placenta are aborted, the womb is cleared by by vacuum aspiration as above.<br><br>Because the second procedure is much more complicated, it is much better for an early decision for abortion be made.<br> <br>Legal restrictions on foreigners<br><br>Foreigners are only eligible for abortion in Singapore if one of the following criteria are met:<br><br>    They have been residing in Singapore for 4 months or more<br>    They are married to a Singapore citizen or have PR status<br>    If they have a work permit<br><br>More Info<br><br>    Teen Central – Health Promotion Board<br>    Termination of Pregnancy/Abortion in Singapore – Anglo Info<br>    Guidelines on Termination of Pregnancy (PDF) – Ministry of Health<br>    Singapore Sees Abortion Rates Rise – AFP, May 2009<br><br> <br>Statistics<br><br>A Ministry of Health spokeswoman said there were 12,222 abortions in Singapore in 2008, compared to 11,933 in 2007. No official figures are available for 2009 (source). During the same period there were 39,935 babies delivered indicating that roughly 1 in 4 pregnancies are terminated.<br><br>While a small proportion of pregnancies are terminated for health reasons, most terminations are due to financial or social concerns (unwanted pregnancy).</p></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Abortion in Singapore<br><br>Abortion in Singapore is legal. Abortion is available on request during the first 24 weeks of gestation unless the procedure is necessary to save the life or to prevent permanent injury to the physical or mental health of the pregnant woman<br><br>Eligibility for Abortion<br><br>Abortion is restricted to citizens of Singapore, wives of Singapore citizens and women that have resided in Singapore for a minimum duration of four months.<br><br>According to the Singapore Abortion Act law there is no defined age limit for the abortion procedure, nor is there a legal requirement for parental consent for minors under the age of 21. In other words just about anyone may request for an abortion, as long as they are of sound mind and body and understand the risks and details of the procedure.<br><br>Pre-Abortion<br><br>The Singapore Abortion Law act also requires that the woman undergoes brief counselling by a qualified abortion counsellor at any accredited abortion clinic, and watch a video on the subject.<br><br>For girls under the age of 16, they have to undergo mandatory counseling at the Health Promotion Board.<br><br>There is also a mandatory waiting period of 48 hours after the counselling before the procedure can be done. So that means you will have to visit your doctor twice. Once for the scan to confirm the pregnancy and counselling, and the second visit, two days later, to undergo the termination.<br><br>The Cost<br><br>The cost of abortion and consultation ranges from S$400 to S$2,000, depending on the type of theatre employed, the depth of anaesthesia applied and in the package inclusions.<br><br>What Happens During an Abortion<br><br>There are two types of abortion, abortion through syringe, and vacuum aspiration. Both types take about five minutes and you will need to fast for six hours before your abortion. That means no water as well.<br><br>Other Options in Singapore<br><br>Abortion is not the only option of “getting rid” of a pregnancy. There are various hotlines, such as Beyond Social Services that you can call to talk about the other options.</p></div>

              <p style=" margin-bottom: 10px; color: #666666; font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 24px;">It is important to talk to a health professional as well as the doctor who will perform your abortion about possible side effects.</p>
              <p style=" margin-bottom: 10px; color: #666666; font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 24px;">Your period should return about 4 – 6 weeks after the abortion and you can get pregnant again soon after the abortion.</p>
              <p style=" margin-bottom: 10px; color: #666666; font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 24px;">If your doctor has prescribed antibiotics, it is important to take them as directed in order to help prevent infection.</p>

              <p style=" margin-bottom: 10px; color: #666666; font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 24px;">The following is a list of side effects that are frequently experienced after an abortion. It is possible to experience these side effects for as long as 2 to 4 weeks following the procedure.</p>
              <ul style="margin: 1.5em 0px 1.5em 3em; line-height: 24px; color: #666666; font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif;">

              <p style=" margin-bottom: 10px; color: #666666; font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 24px;">Although serious complications occur in fewer than 1 out of 100 first trimester abortions and approximately 1 out of every 50 late term abortions, it is important to be aware of the following risks:</p>
              <ul style="margin: 1.5em 0px 1.5em 3em; line-height: 24px; color: #666666; font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif;">

              <p style=" margin-bottom: 10px; color: #666666; font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 24px;">It is important to understand that these risks are rare and that some of these risks are associated with child birth. What matters is that you are aware that these risks exist as you strive to make an informed decision about your pregnancy.</p>

              <p style=" margin-bottom: 10px; color: #666666; font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 24px;">If you have had an abortion, call your doctor and seek medical attention if your side effects become severe or if you experience any of the following:</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p><strong>What is the legal age for sex in Singapore? <br>What are some common sexual offences in Singapore?</strong><br><br>According to Section 376A of the Penal Code, sexual penetration of a minor under 16 is an offence, even if consent was provided by the minor. The law protects both male and female minors. According to the definitions of the aforementioned section, sex is constituted by sexual penetration, which can include vaginal, oral or anal sex.<br><br>In addition, commercial sex with minors under 18 is also a punishable offence according to Section 376B of the Penal Code. Furthermore, a citizen or PR of Singapore who engages in commercial sex with a minor under 18, in a location outside of Singapore, will still be liable under Section 376C.<br><br>With regards to the common defence of “I did not know she was below 16!”, Section 377D states clearly that:<br><br><em>    If the offender is above the age of 21, he cannot claim that he mistakenly believed the minor was not underage as a defence. <br><br>    If the offender is below the age of 21, he may claim that he mistakenly believed the minor was not underage as a defence, but only if the minor was of the opposite sex, and if the offender has not previously committed any similar sexual offences before.</em><br><br>In Singapore, according to Section 375, rape is committed when a man has sexual intercourse with a woman, against her will, without her consent, or if her consent was illegally obtained. Sex is also rape when the victim is a girl under the age of 14.<br><br>Molest is prosecuted as the outrage of modesty in Singapore when it involves criminal force, according to Section 354.<br><br>Incest, sex with animals or corpses, child prostitution, and child pornography are also punishable offences in Singapore. More information can be found in the Penal Code. Homosexual intercourse is prohibited under Section 377A of the Penal Code.<br><br>The quantum of punishment for each respective sexual offence, such as the length of imprisonment or sum of fine, can also be found in the Penal Code itself.<br><br>The above is only a summary of some of the offences related to sexual conduct in Singapore. It does not mean that sexual acts not cited here are necessarily legal.</p></div>

              <p>SINGAPORE - She often wakes up in cold sweat, haunted by the nightmares of crying babies reaching out to her.</p>
              <p>"I blame no one but myself," says the guilt-ridden financial consultant, who has had three abortions.</p>
              <p>In an interview last week with The New Paper on Sunday, Ms Mary Tan, 30, recounts how she regretted her decisions.</p>
              <p>Responding
               to Non-Constituency Member of Parliament Gerald Giam's question on the 
              number of abortions in Parliament last week, the Ministry of Health 
              (MOH) used abortion statistics for the period between 2003 and 2011.</p>
              <p>The
               statistics show that more than half of the women who have abortions in 
              Singapore are below 29 years old. And one in three women who underwent 
              abortions has had previous abortions.</p>
              <p>Ms Tan is one of these 
              women. Her first abortion was about 10 years ago, when she was an 
              undergraduate. She was dating a sales executive, but was also seeing a 
              senior from her university.</p>
              <p>When she found out she was pregnant, she was in a fix.</p>
              <p>Ms
               Tan recounts: "I was not prepared to get married anyway, plus I didn't 
              know who the father was. I was at a loss. "I had my studies to focus on.
               I wasn't sure what would happen if I was forced to quit uni studies. I 
              agonised over it for several days and could only share it with a close 
              friend."</p>
              <p>Her friend's immediate response was: Get an abortion. It's no big deal.</p>
              <p>Time
               was also running out and Ms Tan was worried that the longer she delayed
               taking her decision, the slimmer the chance of aborting. It would also 
              be risky.</p>
              <p>Accompanied by her friend, she eventually went to a gynaecologist's clinic.</p>
              <p>"It was a proper one, unlike what you see on TV, in dramas and shows. Nothing dodgy about it."</p>
              <p>But before the abortion, she had to go through a counselling session with the doctor.</p>
              <p>She was also shown a video which detailed the procedure and warned of its risk. <span style="line-height: 1.538em;">This is part of the process mandated by MOH.</span></p>
              <p>Ms
               Tan says: "I think it was a way of trying to ensure that we knew what 
              we were getting into, and that we wouldn't regret it. "After all, it was
               a life that we are getting rid of."</p>
              <p>The 10-minute video changed her mind - albeit for four days, which included the 48-hour cooling period.</p>
              <p>"I changed my mind and decided to go home. I kept thinking about it and wondered if there was another way out," she says.</p>
              <p>"Look,
               it wasn't a decision I made on the spur of the moment. I had considered
               all the options, weighed the pros and cons. "Between that niggling 
              feeling (of guilt) and my future, I finally picked what I felt was more 
              important - my future."</p>
              <p>She pauses for several seconds, then adds 
              softly: "Yes, when you are young, your priorities are different." It was
               a painless procedure that lasted less than two hours.</p>
              <p>"But I 
              didn't know there were other things that I should have taken care of. 
              For example, I found out only much later (from friends) that an abortion
               is more physically exhausting than giving birth.</p>
              <p>"I didn't take care of my health."</p>
              <p>She also didn't abstain from sex. She says: "I didn't tell my then-boyfriend about what I'd done."</p>
              <p>Six months later, she found out she was pregnant again. That was a blow.</p>
              <p>"I
               thought it was really so ridiculous. There are so many women out there 
              who want a baby so badly but cannot conceive, and it was so easy for 
              me."</p>
              <p>This time, Ms Tan insisted, she "thought over it more intently".</p>
              <p>And because she was certain it was her boyfriend's, she told him about it too.</p>
              <p>"What
               I didn't expect was he'd be so excited. He immediately proposed and 
              said we could get married right away. "I was speechless. And fearful."</p>
              <p>She
               adds: "He was really happy, but I was not. And I struggled over how I 
              should let him know I wasn't ready to settle down." What followed was 
              several days of chats, cajoling, negotiations and then, arguments.</p>
              <p>She was in a dilemma.</p>
              <p>"On one hand, I was pleased he wanted to assume responsibility, but I felt he didn't think of me," says Ms Tan.</p>
              <p>"I
               was a student, while he was working. He didn't have any idea of the 
              kind of sacrifices I'd have to make, which included having to cope with 
              what others would say or think of me.</p>
              <p>"Not to forget my parents would kill me if they found out."</p>
              <p>She
               adds: "He even told me if I didn't want the baby, I could just have it 
              and then give it up to him. He was that adamant," recalls Ms Tan.</p>
              <p>It
               was during one of their more heated debates over whether she should 
              speak to a counsellor that she blurted out: "What's the difference? It's
               not like this will be my first abortion."</p>
              <p>The revelation came as a
               blow to her boyfriend and he just walked off without a word. For the 
              next three days, he didn't respond to her calls.</p>
              <p>Unaware that her 
              boyfriend needed the time to cool down, she thought he was avoiding her.
               Angry, she made an appointment with another gynaecologist.</p>
              <p>It was also then that she was told the pregnancy didn't seem healthy and she was actually advised to consider an abortion.</p>
              <p>"Frankly,
               I don't know if things could have turned out differently had it not 
              been for that condition... maybe yes, maybe not. Who knows?" she says, 
              shrugging her shoulders.</p>
              <p>By the time Ms Tan's ex-boyfriend, who wants to be known only as Kevin, contacted her a week later, it was too late.</p>
              <p>What
               angered him, he tells The New Paper on Sunday in a phone interview, 
              wasn't that she had cheated on him, but that she made her decisions 
              without consulting him.</p>
              <p>"Not once, but twice! She took away a life, one that could have been the product of our love without my permission."</p>
              <p>He
               says he has forgiven Ms Tan "after so many years" even though he still 
              thinks about how life for them could have been. Kevin adds: "Until 
              today, when I see babies or little children, I'd wonder what it'd be 
              like if we had our baby.</p>
              <p>"The general perception is that abortion 
              is very female-oriented, but men, like myself, do have to live with the 
              pain or even, guilt."</p>
              <p><strong>Afraid of losing a promotion</strong></p>
              <p>Ms Tan says she is aware of Kevin's feelings. </p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">"But
               it wasn't like I didn't feel guilty or sad. I think I merely suppressed
               those feelings and refused to give it much thought." </span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">Until three years ago, when Ms Tan found out she was pregnant again. Again, she wasn't ready.</span></p>
              <p>"I
               had just been told I was being considered for a promotion at the bank 
              and I felt a pregnancy then would have impacted my career path in the 
              wrong way. I just wasn't prepared to lose (the promotion)," she says.</p>
              <p>And to ensure she was not making another wrong move, she shared the news of her pregnancy with her boyfriend.</p>
              <p>Ms
               Tan laughs derisively, and then says: "I was a coward. I wanted him to 
              be the one (to decide) so I didn't have to live with another burden of 
              guilt. Deep in my heart, I knew he'd say give it up because he's always 
              made it clear he doesn't like kids." The recurring nightmares came six 
              months after that abortion.</p>
              <p>"I'd dream of crying babies, asking me
               'mummy, why did you kill me?', or that of a baby with outstretched arms
               asking to be carried. It was terrible," she says with a shudder.</p>
              <p>"It was also then that all my guilty feelings surfaced and I nearly broke down."</p>
              <p>After
               sinking into depression for several weeks, she finally confided in an 
              aunt, who promptly advised to seek help - in a religious ritual that 
              will lead the infant spirits to rest and give them a chance for 
              reincarnation.</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">Says Ms Tan: 
              "After two rituals - one for the first two abortions and another for the
               third - I felt somewhat better and the nightmares have recurred less 
              often."</span></p>
              <p>When asked if she had considered giving them up for adoption then, she shakes her head firmly.</p>
              <p>"No,
               definitely not. For one, I didn't want to go through the nine months of
               being in a pregnant state, people are bound to gossip about me behind 
              my back.</p>
              <p>"And I would not want to go on with my life, wondering 
              about the babies I had given away, or for them to turn up one day, 
              asking for a reunion. I didn't want to take my chance then."</p>
              <p>But she would lead a different sex life if she could turn back the clock.</p>
              <p>"I'd
               insist on my partner using some form of contraception, since I'm 
              allergic to the Pill," she says. "And that's what I do now."</p>
              <p><strong>At least 48 hours to decide after counselling</strong></p>
              <p>Sixty-five
               clinics in Singapore are licensed to perform abortions, according to a 
              search on the Ministry of Health's (MOH) website. These clinics are 
              spread over the heartland and many are also in town. Dr Ben Choey, 
              gynaecologist at private clinic SBCC Women's Clinic (Clementi), explains
               the details of a typical process for a woman seeking an abortion.</p>
              <p>This is in accordance with MOH guidelines.</p>
              <p>First,
               after the woman makes an appointment, she will go through a 
              consultation, where a doctor reviews her medical history. The doctor 
              talks to her about her previous pregnancies and her use of 
              contraception, if any.</p>
              <p>A scan is done, reviewing how many weeks 
              pregnant she is. If she is between 14 and 24 weeks' pregnant, she is 
              referred to a hospital.</p>
              <p>The patient is counselled. The procedure 
              and its possible risks are explained along with the different methods of
               contraception. These methods can include the morning-after pill, 
              condoms, and the intrauterine contraceptive device.</p>
              <p>She then views
               a 10-minute video titled Abortion - Consider With Care, which is 
              produced by MOH. It reiterates the details of the abortion, warns of 
              possible risks and explains the different methods of contraception.</p>
              <p>She
               is also given two pamphlets to read: The Truth About Abortion, and 
              Contraceptive Methods - Which One Is Best For Me. The woman is given a 
              minimum of 48 hours to think it over and make her decision.</p>
              <p>Dr Choey says that in his experience, most patients come back a week later.</p>
              <p>If a woman decides on an abortion, she undergoes the procedure after signing a consent form.</p>
              <p>Dr Choey says the procedure usually takes 90 minutes.</p>
              <p>Two
               weeks later, the woman returns to the clinic for post-abortion 
              counselling, where she is again advised on different methods of 
              contraception.</p>
              <p>The typical cost for an abortion at his clinic is between $900 and $1,000, says Dr Choey.</p>
              <p>A
               quick check with some government hospitals reveal that abortion costs 
              range from $500 to $750 for Singaporeans who get referrals from 
              polyclinics.</p>

              <p>SINGAPORE - One in three women in Singapore who underwent abortions from 2003 to 2011, have had previous abortions.</p>
              <p>This is according to statistics from the Ministry of Health (MOH).</p>
              <p>Of
               the 11,940 abortions in 2011, 3,904 were done on women who had 
              undergone one or more abortions earlier. There were 382 women who 
              underwent abortions for the fourth time or more.</p>
              <p>This scenario was reflected in the statistics for the other years as well.</p>
              <p>Experts say that many women who have had multiple abortions are likely to be ignorant of contraception.</p>
              <p>"Some
               women have misconceptions that certain sexual practices will prevent 
              pregnancy, such as having unprotected sex during a certain time of a 
              woman's menstrual cycle," says Dr Tan Poh Kok, gynaecologist and 
              obstetrician at PK Women's Specialist Clinic, who has 15 years 
              experience in the field.</p>
              <p>He adds: "There is sex education in schools, but I think understanding of sex has not improved."</p>
              <p>Counsellor
               Jennifer Chee from pregnancy assistance and counselling centre aLife, 
              spoke of how she once counselled a woman in her 20s who had undergone 
              five abortions: "She was ignorant of contraception, and treated abortion
               as something 'easy' because she was not aware of the possible effects 
              abortion could have on her body."</p>
              <p>Dr Ben Choey, gynaecologist at 
              SBCC Women's Clinic (Clementi) however had more cutting words. He noted 
              that as these women would have had to undergo counselling prior to 
              abortions, they would have at least a rudimentary understanding of 
              contraception.</p>
              <p>In his view, some have a "couldn't care less" 
              attitude towards contraception or choose not to use contraception 
              because of the possible side effects.</p>
              <p>Women have abortions for a 
              variety of reasons explained Ms Karen Vincent, manager of Pregnancy 
              Crisis Service which supports people who have unwanted pregnancies.</p>
              <p>Among
               them, a sense that they are not financially able to keep the baby or 
              that they need to further their careers and studies before having a 
              child. Their boyfriends may also have abandoned them or there may be a 
              perceived lack of support from the family.</p>
              <p>Ms Chee of aLife notes that many women think that abortion is the only option open to them.</p>
              <p>Doctors warn against multiple abortions, noting that there are real physical and psychological effects.</p>
              <p>Dr
               Christopher Chong, obstetrician, gynaecologist and urogynaecologist at 
              Gleneagles Hospital, explains that repeated abortions can lead to 
              infections of the reproductive organs, and can cause infertility.</p>
              <p>Future
               pregnancies may also be at risk, Dr Chong says: "(Multiple abortions) 
              can also cause the cervix to be damaged and lax, leading to miscarriages
               and prematurity.</p>
              <p>"The more abortions, the womb is more likely to rupture during the abortion process and if one goes into labour."</p>
              <p>Besides physical effects, women may also suffer psychologically.</p>
              <p>Clinical psychologist Dr Carol Balhetchet adds that women who undergo abortions more than once face an "accumulation of guilt".</p>
              <p>She says: "One abortion is emotionally traumatic, as much as the person is prepared. Imagine that multiplied by so many times."</p>
              <p>"Some
               women have misconceptions that certain sexual practices will prevent 
              pregnancy, such as having unprotected sex during a certain time of a 
              woman's menstrual cycle,"</p>
              <p>At least one change seems to be in the 
              offing. Currently, pre-abortion counselling, which was introduced in 
              1987, is mandatory only for Singapore citizens or permanent residents 
              who have passed the Primary School Leaving Examination, have at least 
              some secondary education, and have fewer than three children.</p>
              <p>Responding
               to Non-Constituency Member of Parliament Gerald Giam's query on why 
              women who were less educated were excluded, Health Minister Gan Kim Yong
               indicated that changes were on the way.</p>
              <p>"Some of the criteria are
               no longer relevant and should be reviewed", he said in his reply, 
              revealing that MOH began a review in early March.</p>
              <p>Most experts TNPS contacted agree that the criteria should be reviewed.</p>

              <p>SINGAPORE - Discouraging abortion and encouraging couples to adopt 
              should not be seen as the solution to Singapore's fertility challenge, 
              said Acting Minister for Social and Family Development Chan Chun Sing 
              yesterday.</p>
              <p>He said it is "a very difficult and tricky topic", and 
              social-service agencies that provide abortion counselling have told him 
              that it is tough getting a woman to consider going through a pregnancy 
              only to later give the child away.</p>
              <p>He was responding to calls from
               at least four Members of Parliament (MPs) who urge the Government to 
              look into helping unwed women who are pregnant.</p>
              <p>Currently, there 
              are an average of 12,000 abortions a year - half of them from married 
              women. There are 400 adoptions a year. "Even if we are able to save only
               10 per cent of these abortion cases, that would mean 1,200 more babies 
              in our midst," said Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio GRC).</p>
              <p>Mr 
              Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah GRC) said: "I strongly believe
               that, if adoption is publicised as a comforting, loving, nurturing and 
              voluntary alternative, there will be a reduced number of abortions in 
              Singapore."</p>
              <p>Mr Chan said there are mea- sures to counsel women on 
              the risks and implications of an abor- tion, and written consent must be
               given after a cooling-off period. The ministry will help women make 
              informed choices, but "the decision to carry a baby to term or abort 
              (it) is ultimately a deeply personal one".</p>
              <p>However, unwed single 
              parents will soon stand to benefit. Childcare and infant-care leave will
               be extended to this group from May 1.</p>
              <p>This means that, like other
               parents, they will get six days of childcare leave annually if they 
              have children below the age of seven, and two days if they have kids 
              aged between seven and 12.</p>
              <p>They will also enjoy six days of unpaid infant-care leave a year if they have a child below the age of two.</p>

              <p>SINGAPORE - Mrs Jennifer Heng had her first abortion at 17 and her 
              second at 19. She was a student and just not prepared to be a mother.</p>
              <p>Neither was she prepared for the guilt that would follow her for years after.</p>
              <p>News
               reports on abandoned babies would trigger remorse. Even colleagues 
              joking about labour pain brought back memories. No one knew about the 
              abortions except for her boyfriends.</p>
              <p>Then in 2001, she chanced 
              upon a book by Rachel's Vineyard, a non-profit organisation based in the
               United States which helps people suffering the emotional trauma of 
              abortion.</p>
              <p>"It taught me how to move on," said Mrs Heng, now 37, and a mother of one as well as a pastor at Good Gifts City Church.</p>
              <p>She has also written a book, Walking Out Of Secret Shame, about her past to help others.</p>
              <p>It was in 2011, when she was writing the book, that she met Mrs Rose Boon, a pregnancy crisis counsellor of 20 years.</p>
              <p>Mrs
               Boon had started a local version of Rachel's Vineyard in 2010 after 
              realising there was no similar support group in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Together,
               the two women are working to expand the reach of Rachel's Vineyard 
              Singapore, the only known group here which helps both women and men come
               to terms with going through abortions.</p>
              <p>"If you don't get healing, you can spiral to low self-esteem, hatred, guilt and shame," said Mrs Heng.</p>
              <p>Around 40 people have attended the nine retreats held so far.</p>
              <p>Mr
               David Ong, an MP for Jurong GRC, last month proposed in Parliament that
               a way to boost the birth rate would be to reduce the number of 
              abortions.</p>
              <p>But he also told The Straits Times over the phone that post-abortion care is an area worth exploring.</p>
              <p>"We
               should make sure that they (people who have been through abortions) are
               supported emotionally and mentally," he said. "The challenge is, how do
               we get people to come forward?"</p>
              <p>Pre-abortion counselling is 
              compulsory for Singaporeans and permanent residents with at least 
              secondary school education and fewer than three children. The 
              termination can be carried out only 48 hours afterwards.</p>
              <p>Patients also undergo post-abortion counselling on the day of the procedure.</p>
              <p>But
               the impact of pre-abortion counselling on a patient's decision is 
              "minor at best", said Dr Kenneth Wong of the private Obgyn Centre.</p>
              <p>In
               a Straits Times report last year, doctors said that only between 5 and 
              20 per cent of patients change their minds about an abortion after 
              counselling.</p>
              <p>Dr Wong said most patients have made up their minds before going for counselling.</p>
              <p>One in three abortions carried out in 2011 was also by women who have had previous terminations.</p>
              <p>"Once
               you do the first one, the second one feels simpler," said Mrs Heng, 
              adding that she knew of women who had been through six or eight 
              abortions.</p>
              <p>"Abortion becomes a form of contraception."</p>
              <p>Abortions have been legal here since 1970, and can be performed on pregnancies of under 24 weeks.</p>
              <p>Though
               the number has held steady at about 12,000 per year for the last 
              decade, it has fallen by about a quarter among Singaporeans but 
              increased among permanent residents and foreigners.</p>
              <p>Experts attribute the drop among Singaporeans to better awareness and the use of contraception.</p>
              <p>But for those who go through abortions, some hold on to their guilt for years, Mrs Boon said.</p>
              <p>She
               gave the example of a woman in her 60s who had undergone two abortions 
              more than 40 years ago, but still approached the group for help.</p>
              <p>"It
               is not uncommon for one to experience feelings of guilt and remorse, 
              and to wonder 'what if'. This can take years," said Dr Helen Chen, head 
              of the psychological medicine department at KK Women's and Children's 
              Hospital.</p>
              <p>Mrs Boon observed that men too suffered from the emotional fallout, but had no platform to voice their feelings.</p>
              <p>She and Mrs Heng hope for more discussion in the media about abortion and its effects.</p>
              <p>"In
               Singapore, it's not something anyone talks about," said Mrs Heng, whose
               book was published last year and is available for $12.</p>
              <p>"On the 
              other hand, if you Google 'abortion in Singapore', a whole list of 
              abortion clinics shows up. A whole list of ways, but not help."</p>

              Abortion is illegal in Malaysia and Indonesia with exception for maternal life, health, and/or mental health.
              
              Singapore has the most liberal abortion laws in SEA.
