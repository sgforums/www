              <p>The Singapore Boys'/Girls' 
              Home is a restorative rehabilitation centre for juveniles of ages as 
              young as 13 years old in Singapore. As the juveniles are too young to be
               sentenced to jail for their offenses, they would be admitted to the 
              Boys'/Girls' Home instead.<br><br>The Boys'/Girls' Home main goals are 
              to help juveniles to reform and help them to be and want to be accepted 
              by the society. Their aim is to instill important positive values and 
              qualities in them so that they would become a better person when they 
              are released and not go back to their old ways. Programmes are arranged 
              specially for these juveniles for these purposes.<br><br>The 
              Boys'/Girls' Home, contrary to popular belief, does NOT serve as a jail 
              for offenders who are too young to go to be sentenced to a proper jail. 
              Instead, it is a place where important positive values and social skills
               are reinforced into the juveniles so that they can mend their ways and 
              allow themselves to turn over a new leaf. The Boys'/Girls' Home also 
              helps the juveniles to reintegrate into the society by giving them 
              education in the Home to prepare them for the society and helping them 
              to find schools to continue their education when they are released. The 
              juveniles of the Home are well looked after, with all their basic needs 
              being met. Unlike the prison, the boys are given things to do and are 
              kept well occupied with constructive and educational activities.<br><br>Families
               are also a recognized important factor in helping the juveniles reform.
               When necessary, families would be included in activities such as family
               conferencing where the juveniles' families are called in for discussion
               and understanding. These activities would allow families to understand 
              their son better so that more support can be contributed by them and so 
              that the son can be accepted back to his family.<br><br>The Rehabilitative Programmes by MCYS for Various Offenders<br><br>For First Time Offenders of Minor Offences:<br>The
               first time offenders of minor offences such as shoplifting will not be 
              charged in court but let off with a police caution. The MCYS then offers
               a 6-month voluntary programme. This programme called the Guidance 
              programme focuses and making sure the delinquent avoids the Court system
               by helping the juvenile make amends and avoid commiting another offence
               in the future. This programme involves rehabilitation and counseling 
              with active involvement on the parents part to foster better 
              understanding between parents and child. Its aims are to train the 
              juvenile in the area of self control and responsibility and other life 
              skills. Upon finishing the course, the offender will not be charged by 
              the police.<br><br>For other offenders however, they will be charged in court with the following court-ordered options:<br><br>CSO Stand Alone<br>CSO
               refers to Community service order. The juvenile charged under this 
              order will have to perform a minimum of 40 hours up to a maximum of 240 
              hours of community service. This is a bid to widen their perspective and
               give them a new social outlook as well as to acquire better social 
              skills and find a purpose in life.<br><br>Weekend Detention<br>This is 
              only applicable to offenders under 16 years of age. They will be only 
              required to come on Saturdays at 5.00p.m. until 3.00p.m. on Sundays. 
              During these time periods they will undergo trainings to teach them the 
              skills they need.<br><br>Detention Order<br>The offender must be at 
              least 16 years of age before being charged under this order. The 
              offender will serve a minimum of three months in a detention facility 
              where he/she will undergo a series of courses to equip him/her with the 
              necessary life skills.<br><br>Periodic Training Order<br>This can be 
              implemented as part of probation as long as the probationer is not 
              attending school or working. The probationer will attend a social 
              service agency where he/she will be equipped with social skills and 
              other skills to prepare him/her for work life.<br><br>Probation Order<br>The
               probation order is the most important community-based rehabilitative 
              programme. This is an alternative to sending the juvenile offender to 
              either a detention centre or one of MCYS’s corrective institutes. The 
              probationer will be place under the supervision of a probation officer 
              and will have to comply to the rules of his/her probation during the 
              course of the probation order which is a minimum of six months to a 
              maximum of three years depending on the behaviour of the probationer. 
              The probationer will be allowed to carry on with everyday activities 
              such as going to school, working or even National Service. The 
              probationer will have to report regularly to the probation officer and 
              the officer will help the probationer to correct some of the problems 
              that are related to the offence committed by the offender. The 
              probationers will also have to follow some rules that are part of 
              his/her probation order. One such rule would be time restrictions. Other
               than these rules, the probationer will have to attend courses that have
               been organized for him/her. Parents of this offenders will also have to
               participate in workshops and seminars on parenting, as well as child 
              interaction programmes so as to facilitate better relationships between 
              the children and their parents. The probation officer will gather 
              feedback about the probationer from various sources such as teachers, 
              parents and employers and employees to update the court on the progress 
              of the probationer. If the progress is good, the probationer could be 
              given an early discharge. However, in the result of poor progress or 
              breach of rules, the probationer could have his probation extended or 
              even be charged for the offence for which he/she was placed in 
              probation.</p>
