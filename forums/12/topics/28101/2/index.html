            <div class='col-md body'>Guess the best thing to do now is to wait and c hows ur academic results and at the same time wait for opportunities to get him back if u do love him alot.<br><br>He is the type of man who needs love all the time instead of u giving ur fullest love at one go. If you give your best in one shot, u yourslef would also be tired and thats not gd for a relationship. Keep in contact with him consistantly, thats e impt part.<br><br>Though i agree that exams more impt, to maintain a healthy relationship during exams is to acc him when he is free or in need of u mayb once a week, find a few gd solid hours together. Rest of the time, keep him in contact thru sms and few short phone calls to show that you care. Send cards (online) if u can afford some little time during rest or when u can come online to post these msgs. They might help...<br><br>Else, as adviced as others b4 me, forget him if he does not deserve ur love.
