She might have this thoughts in her mind long time before.. but she jus couldn't find any reasons to tell you.. Now that she can find an excuse and get away with it..<br><br>You see.. she had tried different ways to let you know that she wanted it to end.. Meeting up guys in club and flirting with them.. she thought that you might get angry.. then quarrel then you will suggest for a break up.. But she never know that you loved her that much.. that you can forgive her wrong doings.. She purposely say she's playful to tell you that "Hey, that's me! i'm like this"..<br><br>If she's determined to get out of your life.. she will not turn back! To get her back i guess is rather impossible.. But what can you do.. is that.. you can ask her for the reasons why the sudden change.. At least you have an explanation from her and thus might lessen the pain you had..<br><br>The kind of life that you might be giving her isn't what she wants.. Maybe she feels that she still wanna enjoy her life more.. And not being tied down so fast.. Are you providing her wants or her needs?? Maybe there's one thing she's looking for.. Shower with your care and concern is not enough.. Suggest that you have a talk with her.. not now.. cos she wont pick up your call.. maybe some time later.. found out what's the reason behind.. and from there you can also learn something what you missed out.. or what you did not notice all the while when you both are together.. This might be a very precious lesson to learn.. Be glad that it crossed your path before..<br><br>True love? Different people interpret differently.. Or see it differently too.. In any cases... the one you loved most might not be the one you'll be with for life.. Maybe she jus doesn't suit you.. Love comes and go.. Somep people happy some people sad.. People often never realised that there's another door open for you.. when one closes!<br><br>"Happiness does not depend on outward things, but on the way we see them..

            <div class='col-md body'><br>1. Only you can answer that question.<br><br>2. You must be quite young unless you are damn keen to settle down into marriage, everything your age is not very firm. You still have many years ahead of you, to live a better life and get a girl who treasure you and you treasure her too.<br><br>3. Is she worth it? Worth all that pain? Seriously, take my word, you are better off without such a kind of person in your life. You will have less problems to deal with.<br><br>4. "love" is an over used, over rated and ridiculous thing. Its not the spark or what crap hollywood sells. But you will know it when it finds you. And you ould not know "love" without suffering and you would not call it "love" when it hits you.<br><br>5. You might wanna grief, and be sad over things, but do move on and not move backwards. Reflect over things if you had done anything, or that you were misled. Its a discovery process so that you are better prepared for the next time you find that someone.<br><br></div>

You know the bare truth of the entire happening. I can't comment and "pity" you based on your version. Then again, i can't say you're lying... so my advice is that we all fall down again and again... just gotta learn to pick yourself up and move on.<br><br>All the best! [you lost a girl whom don't love you (or not she won't do this to you), but she lost a guy whom will love and dote her (i presume)], so, who's at a greater loss? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> </div></blockquote>Tough as it sounds, the reality of things is u got 2 suck it up n move on. In the short term ,this might sound like heartless advice. But wat can't kill u will only make u stronger. Learn from this experience... who knows mayb later in life, u might look back n laugh at this episode.</div>

She refused to take all my phone calls and the worst thing is that she didn't even break up with me face to face , it was just sms and one last phone call . She even confessed to me that while she was with me , she still went to MIRC to meet other guys . During the nites when i thought she was sleeping , she was actually going clubbing and kissing guys that she had met up there . I was totally devastated by the turn of events . She even commented that she did it because she was " playful" . This is the one and only love of my life . I gave her everything , my heart , my soul and everything that she asked for . I was was even intending to get married to her in a year's time , and now she is dumping me for another guy . The weirder thing is that i m still waiting for her to come back to me . Maybe after playing the field for a few years , she might realise the folly of her ways and come back to my arms . I really love her a lot! Help!<br><br>She also confessed to me that this guy can never give her the life that i have given her , she had given up a comfortable life with me when she knows that i can shower her with all the love and concern that she needs?<br><br>Is there no more true love in this world? What happened to eternal love? I am still trying to pick up the pieces but it's so painful . I still love her a lot!
