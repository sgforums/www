            <div class='col-md body'><strong>1 Corinthians 13</strong><br>If I speak in the tongues[a] of men and of angels, but have not love, I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal. 2If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have a faith that can move mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. 3If I give all I possess to the poor and surrender my body to the flames,[b] but have not love, I gain nothing.<br><br>4Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. 5It is not rude, it is not selfseeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. 6Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. 7It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.<br><br>8Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away. 9For we know in part and we prophesy in part, 10but when perfection comes, the imperfect disappears. 11When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I put childish ways behind me. 12Now we see but a poor reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known.<br><br>13And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.<br></div>

She refused to take all my phone calls and the worst thing is that she didn't even break up with me face to face , it was just sms and one last phone call . She even confessed to me that while she was with me , she still went to MIRC to meet other guys . During the nites when i thought she was sleeping , she was actually going clubbing and kissing guys that she had met up there . I was totally devastated by the turn of events . She even commented that she did it because she was " playful" . This is the one and only love of my life . I gave her everything , my heart , my soul and everything that she asked for . I was was even intending to get married to her in a year's time , and now she is dumping me for another guy . The weirder thing is that i m still waiting for her to come back to me . Maybe after playing the field for a few years , she might realise the folly of her ways and come back to my arms . I really love her a lot!

I'm not sure if I'm dumped, but I'm sure I lost. Seriously, only you know what you want! I too posted some topics and was overwhelmed with advise and condolences. However, the MOST important decision maker now is yourself. Maybe you can take a look at the topic I started, and see if it helps.<br><br>Trying to pick up is indeed the toughest part.
