              <p>Supposed to know what you want/have a sense of motivation in life?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Pretty troubled by this question coz i'm just like living one day by one day. Slacking, going to school, studying. All just for....</p>
              <p>nothing ( i tink ).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Like there is no destination in life. Just go to the workforce via the uni route, no passion in what i'm doin, watch the high flyers in my class clintch 5-figures starting pay jobs and thinking i can never do the same, see the rich people in my school enjoying life w/o needing to worry bout career paths coz they got all the networks (i.e people wan to get to know dem coz they are well, rich).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And if u're wondering, yes i haf frens, i'm not some loner and my social life is pretty good i would say, but at the end of the day something is missing not because i feel lonely, just coz i feel that i'm just living my life this way as there are no other choices.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do give some advices i'm starting to think the world is a very very superficial place to live in. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/unused/rainbow.png" alt="rainbow.png"></p>

              <p>*sorry , accidentally pressed enter =X,</p>
              <p>get in touch with your strengths, start doing things that you like . You have a good social life, that's considered grade A , but having a passion/ interest would make it A+ . You have to change your mindset about joining the workforce after graduating as a mundane thing, treat it as a challenge.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It would be a boost if the job you're finding lies in your strengths. eg. If you enjoy socializing, you can apply for a job dealing directly with customers. The world can only be superficial to live in if you dont map out your own future clearly in your mind.</p>

              <p><br>Thanks for the reply, yea i reali hope i can find this key to the door asap.</p>
              <p>My strengths are really nothing to holla bout, it's sumwhere around the line of being able to make people laugh and another being atheletic.</p>
              <p>And i believe thats about all? But i dun see myself making a mark in the entertainment/sports industry so another dead end i guess.</p>

              <p>Stay in the US, seriously Ed. Your parents just want you to return to Singapore for the sake of seeing you. Yes, the living standards in Singapore is considered one of the best in the world. But take in mind our news are censored. Unlike in the US where there's free 'journalism'. Signapore has an excellent healthcare system in place and offers plenty of entertainment.</p>
              <p>However, prices of cars here is increasing every year ( we're a small little red dot kay) .  You need to purchase a COE ( Certificate of Entitlement,which is based on a bidding system , that can reach up to 10k USD since many people are bidding for it ) before being able to purchase a car.</p>
              <p>If you want to throw away your independence, return to SG, otherwise stay on in NY.</p>

              <p>Go attend career talks. Meet up with people from various fields. Find out how their job is like. Learn from their experience. Picture yourself in their shoes. Is that what you want in life?</p>
              <p>There's no point comparing others' life with yours, since we all have different paths to trek. While you may see the perks, you might not have noticed the dark side your friends had to go through.</p>
              <p>Most of us aren't born rich. We aren't lucky to have such parents. But that doesn't mean we can't create riches for ourselves. With sound financial discipline and grabbing good opportunities, you may be where their parents are one day.</p>
              <p>It took me three long years while I was at my previous job to finally realize what I wanted to do &amp; where I wanted to go. When that "eureka" moment comes, put in all your heart &amp; soul to pursue your goal. Live with neither regrets nor doubts from then on.</p>

              <p>I can say i'm pretty much lost in life, so i'm turning to things like spiritual meditation and such.</p>
              <p>I'm around the range of 21-22 and i feel quite bad to be not achieving anything at this point in time except to be studying because everyone else is doing so.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>If you have been doing things half-heartedly, try doing things with heart and soul. It is possible to arouse passion by getting yourself into it.</p>
              <p>Expand your viewpoint in how you have been leading your life and try proactively for a change by reinventing yourself, change your environment or do something that you think that you will never do.. something random, fun and healthy.</p>
              <p>Hope this helps.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

              <p>Hi TS,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I used to think the same things.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I asked myself.... "whats the meaning of life?"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'm not religious so i'll give you my answer of it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The meaning of life is to live life through. Disappointed? You should be.... however it is bitter medicine that you must swallow and <span style="color: #ff0000;">learn to accept. </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">And that's where you begin to search for a soulmate. Someone that can engage you "intellectually" and share the burden with you that you are very much alone in this world. Friends could do it for awhile.... but they are unable to be with you 24/7 especially when they find their own soulmates and build their own family units.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is hard to accept that life has no "deeper" meaning ... but it is easier to do it with a soulmate who you'd luv to chat with.... and is there 24/7 for your needs <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png">.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Everything will seem brighter then.... and life will be more enjoyable.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>On the topic of choices:</p>
              <p><em>There is no "road less taken" there is simply the road, choices and
              life...and for it to make "all the difference" all you have to do is
              live the choice you make, all you have to do is follow your heart and
              enjoy the chasing of your dreams, this does not make your path any
              different than anyone else's.</em></p>

              <p>You'll find that the Eureka moment, as you describe it, is a bit of an illusion.  Yes, you could well experience that moment when things finally come together, but looking back from that point, you're likely to find that it's the crossing of a threshold following a gradual buildup.</p>
              <p>That point you're looking for in the future is made in the present.  If you're too busy thinking about that point instead of being right here, right now, you're going to miss the seemingly small opportunities that ultimately bring you to that point.</p>
              <p>Live for the moment.  That doesn't mean going about with reckless abandon - it means making sure you're 100% present wherever you are.  Anything less than that is a waste of time, and life's just too short for that sort of thing.</p>
