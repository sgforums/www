Can consider me... I think having a friend to talk things out is not too much to ask for...? By the way, how old are you...? If you're gonna start telling me all those 'funnie funnie' LOVE stories, I'm sorry to say... Maybe should try someone else?  :p Other than that I should be ok...? &lt;- If I can afford the time....<br></div>
