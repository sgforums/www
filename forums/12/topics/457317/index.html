              <p>Hello Kingbanana, it is not that we do not respect them, it is them not respecting us. Look, this is our country (I'm a singaporean born), but what makes them have the right to do whatever they like? Let's just say I rent a room from your house, you expect me to show some respect and not just litter everywhere, expecting you to clear right? I'm not insulting you or anything, I am just saying. Yes, people should respect others first, but you must respect the owner or the ruler first.</p>
              <p>Btw check your mailbox. I sent you my email.</p>

              <p>Hello Kingbanana, it is not that we do not respect them, it is
              them not respecting us. Look, this is our country (I'm a
              singaporean born), but what makes them have the right to do
              whatever they like? Let's just say I rent a room from your house,
              you expect me to show some respect and not just litter everywhere,
              expecting you to clear right? I'm not insulting you or anything, I
              am just saying. Yes, people should respect others first, but you
              must respect the owner or the ruler first.</p>
              <p>Btw check your mailbox. I sent you my email.</p>

              Yes I understand :) Just like the Spratly islands.the Philippine government owns it and the ruler of those islands but..someone from the other side of the world is not respecting our rights over our territories..

              I will not deny that one..yes,the politics back in the Philippines is kinda not in good condition.I admit it.that is true.But among those corrupt Philippine government officials,there are "few" good guys who are really serving the Filipinos with sincerity and whole heartedly.
              
              But I am not saying that it is all bad news in the Philippines..there are lots of good news  about our country,the only thing is,bad news about poverty among other things which labels the Philippines in bad shape sells best in the international media..and sometimes,it is being so sensationalized..so sold out that the international community forgets to view the other side of the Philippines.

              <p>Well, the media works this way. They are always biased on certain points. Just like the USA, everyone is always looking up to them, but many do not know they are heavily in debt! That is why they are planning to go to pointless wars just for resources. If I am not mistaken, one of them is Iraq. Iraq is one country that refuses to sell oil to the USA and they stand very strongly on their choice.</p>

              <p>Well we have the Chinese food, Malay food and the Indian food. Oh we also have the Western food.</p>
              <p>There is no best food, it is just preference. For Chinese food, it is usually chicken rice, char siew rice (Pork meat, i think), fishball noodles etc.</p>
              <p>Malay food, we have the Nasi Lemak, Mee soto etc</p>
              <p>Indian food, we have Roti Prata, Mee Goreng (Indian red fried noodles), Nasi Goreng (Fried rice) etc.</p>
              <p>For western food, we have french fries, chicken chop, burger, fish and chips etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There are tons of variety, and I can't list them all down, but do try them out!</p>

              I have tried the Roasted Chicken Rice with the Chili Sauce and its soo good :) Also i have discovered that the Mcdonalds here has chili sauce and its also too good to be true for someone who came from a place where chilies are so loved! We dont have chili sauce on Mcdonalds stores back in the Philippines,but unlike here,our Mcdonalds serves rice.Last week I ate char siew buns..I dont remember the exact name but it says char siew pao.Tried also the Bee Hon although we also have stir fried noodlles,the difference is,here,the noodlles are thiner and finer which is super okay.Yesterday I ate Roti and Muton,too spicy but also very nice.Ohh..I forgot,one more thing,charcoal buns with red bean paste is yummy with Soya milk!
