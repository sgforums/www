            <div class='col-md body'>Biz, first and foremost, think about what it says about you.<br><br>She gets a mysterious note from someone she doesn't know.  Is that romantic?  Maybe.  Does it say you lack boldness? Probably.  What are the implications either way?<br><br>In the first case, so it's romantic.  What happens next?  Will you then approach her face-to-face immediately, or do you want to wait?  Will the timing make you look desperate or look like a wimp?  If you wait for a while, what's she thinking in the meantime?  Does she try to imagine who this mysterious person is?  Will you match up to that image?<br><br>In the latter case, if you are seen to lack boldness at this first stage of the game, how much confidence are you giving her that you are prepared to take on the leadership role that is expected of the male every once in a while in a relationship?<br><br>In your position, I'd seriously rethink my strategy, rather than focus on what to write.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Firstly, know thyself. Are you merely infatuated with her, or is it the real thing? Are you able to see the both of you together in the future? Are you prepared to accept rejection? Seriously, you have to understand yourself first and what you're looking for in a partner even before you make your first move.<br><br>One of the best ways would be to get to know her through a friend or friends. That way, she won't feel awkward and shy away from you. Try not to be too aggressive as well, as you would definitely scare her away. Establish a solid foundation as friends before taking the next step. That way, your friendship structure with her won't wobble too much after you make your next move.<br><br>Hope this helped, and good hunting!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

You have plenty to lose by this.<br><br>Okay, so if she looks pissed, maybe your message has popped through onto her screen just as she's in the middle of something important.  So you're just going to get up and take off?  If she's half bright she'll notice you watching her and put two and two together.  If she sees you seeing the look on her face and taking off, you're telling her you're gutless.  Hell of a first impression to make, isn't it?  First impressions may not be everything, but screw it up and you've just made your job a lot harder, and you may also just have lost the game at the opening move for no good reason.<br><br>A bold start is half the battle won.  Do something like you've got all God-given right to do so, and more likely than not people around you will fall in line.  Move tentatively or timidly, and you'll get no respect or cooperation.  If you move timidly and things don't go your way, the apparent loss will be magnified.  Conversely, move boldly and if things don't go your way, it won't look like it's a big deal to you.  Give that positive impression and even if things don't work first time round, it leaves you with a possible second shot later down the track when circumstances may be more in your favour.<br><br>That boldness also inspires confidence.  Going out to get what you want sends out the clear message that in a relationship, you are  capable of driving the progress of the relationship (that's the leadership I'm talking about).  Give a wimpy, tentative or indecisive  first first impression, and despite your best qualities, she may say no thanks because you're giving the impression that she could end up dragging dead weight.</div>

Both of us same year, different course but same school. Met her while doing  community work as part of our non-core module. The thing is I started knocking into her in campus pretty regularly, at least once a week. These are mostly by accident though I do check on her time table to see if we could meet in campus while moving around to get to classrooms for lessons as well as to create one or two meetings.<br>But now... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> all over liao. Ask her out many times but kena rejected time and again. Only managed to get her out once.  Think she has a bf as I've seen her many times with this guy.<br>Unlike the previous semester, I only see her once so far this semester.</div>
