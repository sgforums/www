            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by Jean3:<br>Emm, is it true that guys by nature are more advancing whenever there is opportunity or the ambience, and of course i mean towards their girl only?</blockquote>Physical intimacy comes quite naturally to many couples in a healthy relationship. By the very nature of their instincts, yes, guys are usually the ones who initiate physical contact with their partners.<br><br>However, thanks to their upbringing and other external influencing factors, there are also the exceptions -- the shy guys who would rather wait for their partners to make the first move.<br><br>Times are changing, though. One wouldn't be too surprised if the same rule could be transferred and be applicable to the opposite camp one day.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In general people are more open towards sex as compared to the past. I expect your boyfriend, being experienced, may have a more liberal attitude to sex within a relationship, while you're conservative.<br><br>But if you're not ready, you're simply not.  All other external factors should not affect your decision with regards to intimate physical activities, and you shouldn't feel overly guilty or pressured about it.  And while it may annoy your boyfriend (hey he's human), he should still respect and accept your decision and attitudes.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Jean3:</div><div class="quote_body">Maintaining love without getting physical, possible?<br><br>I am recently starting my first relationship with a guy whom is older and have experience in long term relationship before. I am serious abt this r/s. But I am unsure abt whether, is it possible to maintain the relationship without any sexual activities? Not even those...well, so call hand job? Correct me if i am wrong. There is no specific reason for me to say a 'No" to this but jus wana to wait for a longer period maybe after a yr or two, but how can i negotiate this with him then?

You sound like you don't mind physical intimacy, but you are scared of getting pregnant. So tell him to use a condom. He may promise to be more careful, but when he is at the height of ecstasy, he probably wouldn't remember his mother's name, less even yours.<br><br>"No glove. No love." If you don't want to protect yourself, then it may be advisable to get mentally prepared for either motherhood or an abortion.</div>
