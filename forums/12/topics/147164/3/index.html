But for now, it's best to thread on this topic wisely.<br><br>Cheers  </div></blockquote>Oops sorry...didn't mean to influence any possible decision of the posters.<br><br>Felt that way after viewing some similar posts in the forum. IMHO, in a relationship,most guys tend to place higher importance on physical intimacy than girls. They feel deprived and a little unbalance if they are doing less than their previous relationship. Without the intense feeling arising from physical contact, it doesn't make them feel like they are in a relationship.<br>Just like girls, once they have given in, it is hard for them not to do that in the second relationship as it doesn't seem "fair" to their next bf.<br>I have no solution to that but I just feel that breaking up might not solve the problem that could exist in another relationship.<br><br>Temptations are everywhere. Even a seemingly proper, philosophical guy could be looking out for sexual pleasures. It's human nature?<br>I used to think that a guy who has "played" it all will be faithful, and will not be tempted. Alas, it's not the case(Hence, aren't guys the same?).<br>Most guys instinctively look out for instant stimulations/pleasures. These are important to them, be it visuals (sexy babes), fantasies (uniform temptations), ONS whatever. Since these are available almost readily.. young, pretty, sexy girls doing it for free... why can't their gfs do the same? So guys protest to their gfs, without taking into account their feelings/ values. Not all girls are as open-minded. Not all girls are willing to cross the boundary before marriage. That's when guys would feel that the girls are not loving them enough and keep pressuring them.<br><br>How many "serious" relationships could we have in a lifetime? If all other aspects are fine, tell him how you feel, frankly and observe his reaction. The most ideal way would to be able to work things out together.<br>However, it's also important not to lose yourself and your values in the process. You have your family to think of, you have yourself to think of...showing that you love him in other aspects may help. But it may be really hard to restrict him totally. (A fren even suggested to his gf that he could outsource that portion. Would that be fine with u?)<br>So be prepared for the worst. At the end of the day, you must be able to face yourself, with or without another bf.</div>

It is human nature.<br><br>Men -- at least the strong-willed ones -- could curb their nature, but none of them -- at least the truthful ones -- could deny it. It's there, all the time. And because it's always there, it's exactly like what you said, wherever they look, "temptations are everywhere". The testosterone kicks in, and the men face a constant struggle battling their biological instincts.<br><br>We could, however, look at it from a rational, male-driven point of view. If not for sexual desires, how would men be driven to "be fruitful and multiply"? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"To deny our own impulses is<br>to deny the very thing that makes us human."<br>-- Mouse, "The Matrix"</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Jean3,<br><br>I really regretted starting the heavy petting. Because now bf finds it ridiculous to stop doing it (despite knowing I'm feeling insecure and frightened).<br><br>Of course, there would be temptations at times, but both parties need to stand firm. And the guy should be understanding towards the gf if she is not willing to advance to another level of intimacy.<br><br>I have absolutely no idea what I can do. Feeling so frustrated, disappointed and troubled. And it's affecting my health and work.<br><br>Sob... Sob...</div>

I always feel that both relationship moving towards intimacy, is all starting from both feelings towards each other; of course we have to be responsible to ourselve.<br>That is nothing wrong or right to get to intimacy with ur man, but only u know what u are doing &amp; prepare in any consequence that arrive(muz be MATURE!!!)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>
