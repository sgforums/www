            <div class='col-md body'>My fren found out tt he was position 96 in the whole sch, and was very very unhappy abt it cuz he wanted to be the top 50. But I was telling him, aim simple. I believe aiming simple means can meet target easily.<br><br>I'm sure most of us aim for 4 As and 2 Ds in the A levels. But tt's all. Y aim for sth higher, like getting the top 50? Having a target or goal to work towards is good, but when u dun reach it, dun need to worry. I was aiming to top maths in sch, but the prob I faced was like u, careless mistakes. Caused me like 10+ mks. Carelessness always happen, and it is very difficult to prevent.<br><br>Exam stress comes abt if u worry and set urself to high a target. Study correctly or incorrectly matters a bit. But by ur As, Cambridge are not creative at all. They always repeat qns, so juz do TYS can already.<br><br>This is juz some suggestion, no need to take into serious consideration.<br><br>------------------<br>Thomas Edison definition of genius :<br>"1% inspiration, 99% perspiration"</div>
