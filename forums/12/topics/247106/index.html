Especially in some scenarios that things went wrong and you've done something wrong...<br><br>Maybe in this context, you might need do something really really touching to her and slowly bring the words to your mouth and say it to her...<br><br>Time can be an essence but time can also be a killer... She might be patient but patience might run out...<br><br>If you really treasure her, remember one thing that man always like to do: compare her with your ex... Don't do that... Since you're with her now, give her the trust and love that she deserves...</div>

Act on her likes and dislikes and give some surprises once in a while when she least expects it... For example, if you can remember when was the date that both of you were together as an item, spring her a small surprise maybe a dinner plus a movie and walk her home, at her doorsteps, kiss her and tell her "I love you"...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
