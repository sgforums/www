Do i still wait?</div></blockquote>Haiz...do not wait, what are you hoping to achieve by waiting? Do you really think she will come back to you again?<br><br>Okie...that was pretty depressing to know. Well, you can always go after her again. All you need is remember what caused your relationship to fail in the first place and make sure you bloody change yourself so that you don't repeat those mistakes again. If you really love her, why not love her all over again? This time it will be different....much more difficult for her to accept you again. But if you managed to win her heart this time around, please do treasure her and don't make her sad again.<br><br>Well, usually guys don't go after the same girl again...dunno why also. But it doesn't means you cannot do it lah. If you really love her, inspire us by making the impossible possible. Can do it or not? If cannot, then move on lah.
