So whatever happens, always choose the path which will brings you happiness. Discard away all your troubles and be happy, cos if you are happy...it will sub-consciously influence the people around you and they will be happy too...including her. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>
