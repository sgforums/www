I treat it as nothing, pretending that nothing happen hoping him to change back. come back to me when he had his fun. but this went on for 2 yrs, not with the same ger but differnet gers. I tried hinting him that i know about them wanting him to admit and ask for forgiveness. but no he continued.

            <div class='col-md body'>To answer to the question:<br><br>Well when he's in his army I thought he will changed cos normally guys enter army will think more more maturely. but he's totally different from all the guys I've known. he actually made me wait for him when he book out by going out with other gers and once he even did something which I can't forgive him by having sex with someone he not long. Coming to think of it Its so dirty u know? thats the main reason for me to wanting to give up this relationship . cheating on me by having other gers is alright cos that time i think he will change but I was wrong. Way too wrong...........So stupid of me</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>continue from where I've stopped.<br><br>The guy <span style="text-decoration: underline;">X</span> I knew from my workplace is a someone whom I've always wanted someone who care for u alot won't let you down. Someone whom will always be there for you when u need. We chatted on the phone meet up for movies, I told him about the things that happened to me and <span style="color: red;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A</span></span><span style="color: #444444;"></span>. he will cheer me up telling me that its not over at all. all i have to do is stand up and continue.<br>I listened to him and then we ended up being together. He's great so great that I'm willing to give up anything for him.<br>But 1 day when we were outside shopping I came across <span style="text-decoration: underline;">A</span> when <span style="text-decoration: underline;">X</span> is in the toilet. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">A</span> told me 1 thing, he said ' I won't let you 2 get together so easily, I'll break you 2 up in no time.'<br>I didn't tell X about it cos I'm scared he'll be angry but he found about it after that.<br>Yes i admit that i did answered <span style="text-decoration: underline;">A'S</span> call but all i wanted to do is to ask him to give up no matter wat we can't be together. But then <span style="text-decoration: underline;">X</span> mistaken that i still cannot forget about <span style="text-decoration: underline;">A</span> but the thing is I already forget about him. I just wanna <span style="text-decoration: underline;">A</span> not to call anymore , to do anything to harm the relationship between me and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">X</span>.<br>Then our relationship very shaky after that, will tend to quarrel even over the smallest thing. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">A</span> tried all means to get between us by calling me, talking to me, smsing me and will even wait for me outside my school.<br>I tried avoiding from A but he really had his means to find me. No matter how i hide he still be able to find me.<br><br>Then things seemed to get bettEr when <span style="text-decoration: underline;">X</span> forgives me and we return to normal. He dotes me alot buys me things, lots of things. Everytime there for me. Loves me alot alot and I love him too. I loved him till the extend that no 1 can.<br><br>But all happened again when we're about to be together for almost 1 yr somethings happen. I was in school having my in school project attachment then lecturer scolding then <span style="text-decoration: underline;">A</span> keep calling. I so angry cos no reason lecturer came in scolding shouting. so noisy then somemore i so moody. then i no think so much, I sms to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">A</span> telling him wat he wan keep calling for wat, but he no reply anything.<br>In the evening <span style="text-decoration: underline;">X</span> asked for my hp to spot check and he saw the sms. he very angry and then we broke off. cos he said he can't trust me anymore he dun feel secure with me at all. like anytime will do things to hurt him lor. but the fact is i didn't i just dun want <span style="text-decoration: underline;">A</span> to call or wat lor but why can <span style="text-decoration: underline;">X</span> think about it? I tried explaining but he dun wan to listen to any reasons. Wat to do?<br>Why can't he think of all the happy moments we've had instead of the unhappy things?<br>I loved him alot lor too much to bear to leave him. These few weeks I've been struggling not to be too sad in front of my frens I dun wan them to worry about me. But I can't do it anymore, I've bottled it all up too deep until I cannot stand it anymore. I love him but why must he do this to me? Why can't he love me like b4 forget about all the unhappiness and think about the future and not the past?</div>

You should have told him everything earlier.<br><br>You know, somebody gave you trust, is all in your hands whether you want to maintain trustworthiness. ItÂ’s not that he canÂ’t think of all the happy moments in the pass, but he will feel very hurt when he thought of the happy moment, because at that moment, you are cheating behind him when he is happily with you (thatÂ’s might be what he thought, even you didnÂ’t mean to cheat him).<br><br>Cheat can be lead to imagination, he will fill all unanswered questions with imagination, a small problem or misunderstanding can amplified to a big big issue.<br><br>I think you and your love one really lack of communication.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hey girl, no matter who is at fault I feel that you ought to look at your own faults.  You keep on pin-pointing A for coming between you and X.  Are you sure you are a "perfect" gf?  have you done nothing wrong to let A get the wrong idea?  Have you done anything to make X angry?  Think over it and stop saying what a sad state you're in.  Everyone has their bad days but still they got to move on.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>since the day you and A broke off.. you shld have stop any contact with him, ignore his call and sms, soon he will get tired of it and stop doing those stupid stuff. But you never, you still answer his call , reply his sms. You shld tell X that A went to wait for you outside the school , i m sure X will know what to do. But you never do anything like that, and now is too late. Anyway, i think if you still wan X back, tok to him... tell him the problem you are facing, if he love you, he will understand. Gd luck to you ! Hope everything will be alright for you</div>

Well explaining is too hard for me..... I've get over A just that I dunno how to put it to him in a nicer way without hurting him that time to ask him not disturb me again. But wat ever I said no 1 will believe me cos all will think that I put my story up in the forum so as to let ppl pity me and so X will come back to me but I didn't.</div>
