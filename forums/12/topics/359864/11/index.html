              <p>oldkid: you claim that you can forgive once, but he's likely to
              betray again. personally i think you, i or anyone of us not in
              position to judge if or not he will cheat again. how do you judge?
              based on his bad excuses? or on the large amount of discriminating
              evidence? or is you know him personally?</p>
              <p>if is the last, you obviously have bias and agenda. otherwise
              you have no support for your statement.</p>
              <p>is up to ts to decides if she believe that he remain faithful,
              not up to us. all i advise is 2nd chances. how many couples managed
              to survive a tough period because of a 2nd chance? otherwise, many
              many husband/wives would have divorced after one mistake
              already.</p>
              <p>but like oldkid say, if he does cheat again, dump him without a
              second hesitation. he didn't learn his lesson once, and he won't
              ever learn it.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>i do apologise if i appeared to be bias or have agenda. i simply put myself in her shoes. ts had supplied alot of evidence of his straying on page 1 and i just imagine what i will do if i was her. sorry. :p</p>
              <p>personally, i feel that pple will judge, discreetly or openly. which is why from judging, conclusions are reached and solutions are offered. there's no such things as "rights to judge" or "no rights to judge". we do not bear the pain of TS or share the responisibilty with TS. TS will need to make a sound judgement of wat to accept and wat to refuse.</p>

              <p>totally agree dendenmushi. no matter how much pain or unjust we may feel for TS, we must never give absolute senarios. we can give possibilities but never absolute. also we must account for the fact that wat's impt at the end of the day, everyone happy.</p>

              <p>deadweightheart seems to be in a difficult position. obviously
              not many girls can forgive indiscretion, much less with escorts,
              but perhaps can look at it from different angle? he did notcheat
              emotionally, which to some girls is more acceptable.</p>
              <p>from iamsorry's posts, seems quite adamant that its a first and
              last. sounds like something cheats and gamblers say, but everyone
              deserves a second chance? at least</p>
              <p>to deadweightheart: i don't approve of cheating, but i think
              that every relationship deserves a second chance. if you're looking
              for a perfect relationship, i think thats never going to happen
              because before you know that its the perfect one, you've already
              left it cos of 1 mistake.</p>
              <p>short ninja: faithful guys exist. they were once unfaithful.
              strangely i find this so true.</p>
              <p>jian guo gui hai bu pa hei = see ghost liao still not scared
              dark?</p>
              <p>ultimately is still deadweight's choice. all we can do is
              advise. but ppl say quan he bu quan li, only advise to patch not
              advise to leave. their relationship is their's to decide.</p>

              <p>I keep thinking about how he can lie with no remorse, do things behind my back and show no guilt. It speaks volumes about his morals and character. If someone can reciprocrate love and respect with betrayal, what does that say about the person?</p>
              <p><br>My heart may be telling me one thing but I also want to show some self love and self respect. Maybe sometimes we should listen to our brains and not our hearts.</p>

              <p>deadweight: how do you know he thinks that its all fine? i mean, has he tried to give you all kinds of reasons why you shouldn't fault him for patronising these prostitutes? if he has, i think he doesn't feel guilty at all and you should drop him.</p>
              <p>If he's been trying his best to get your forgiveness, maybe its time to show a little generosity. a second chance might seem like nothing much but it could be that ray of light that saves a person and a relationship.</p>
              <p>i agree with jgho, even jailbirds deserve a second chance. i believe if you could take this opportunity and set things straight with him, you could find yourself in a much stronger relationship that has dealt with a major crisis together.</p>
              <p>it is not healthy to simply run off at the sight of any r/s hiccup that pops up and look for another boyfriend. the perfect man you seek will never turn up, because he doesn't exist. everyone will make some mistake at some point in time. </p>
              <p>Don't think of excuses for him. Accept that he has done you wrong, and blame him. And at the end of the day, let him make amends and together, move on. I guarantee your relationship will be stronger for it.</p>
              <p>Love can't fill empty stomachs, but it can make them feel alot better.</p>

              fault him for patronising these prostitutes? if he has, i think he
              doesn't feel guilty at all and you should drop him.</p>
              <p>If he's been trying his best to get your forgiveness, maybe its
              time to show a little generosity. a second chance might seem like
              nothing much but it could be that ray of light that saves a person
              and a relationship.</p>
              <p>i agree with jgho, even jailbirds deserve a second chance. i
              believe if you could take this opportunity and set things straight
              with him, you could find yourself in a much stronger relationship
              that has dealt with a major crisis together.</p>
              <p>it is not healthy to simply run off at the sight of any r/s
              hiccup that pops up and look for another boyfriend. the perfect man
              you seek will never turn up, because he doesn't exist. everyone
              will make some mistake at some point in time. </p>
              <p>Don't think of excuses for him. Accept that he has done you
              wrong, and blame him. And at the end of the day, let him make
              amends and together, move on. I guarantee your relationship will be
              stronger for it.</p>
              <p>Love can't fill empty stomachs, but it can make them feel alot
              better.</p>

              <p><br>I for one am glad you chosed to express your feelings. Many more would be able to share and empathise with such feelings, from both sides, and it would help many more understand the complexities of love and life, just as it would help to put your sorrows into words and see it as a reality coherantly for yourself</p>
              <p>We are only ordinary beings, not celebrities or larger than life personalities. But we all do have similar hopes and dreams. Far too often, we believe, being ordinary people, we are insignificant and only a digit in the huge world we live in.</p>
              <p>But the truth is that each individual life matters, regardless right or wrong, for we are all humans, capable of rationality and emotions. Often our social circle is small, or due to self conceived fears, we dare not voice out, or have a more wider viewpoint to draw from </p>
              <p>This site, with its anonymity, will give one the courage to do so, at least the beginning of healing process into the real world, as we take in and consider wider viewpoints to help the healing, one way or another, to move on to the journey of life.</p>
              <p>Others who don't even have to courage to express it here, will find comfort thru the sharing of your feelings, something which they will relate to, sooner or later, for none lived truly sheltered lives, not even Buddha.</p>
              <p>Take your time to heal, just as your bf will need time as well. Stand back and rationalize what had happened, and in time, a better understanding and a stronger relationship will be achieved, with cooler heads than rushing for a decision,  a decision that can only be made in a more calm and rational environment tempered with the self heal of time.</p>
              <p>I will not support what your bf had done. It is a total act of betrayal, regarless if it is with a pros or other women. A betrayal is a betrayal, no excuses. However, I hope you will take into consideration that he had been honest to you, confessed in full, and had vowed never to do such dishonorable acts again.</p>
              <p>As a man, i would admit that the temptation is great, but IT MUST NEVER be an excuse for failing honour and integrity. Everyone of us make mistakes, for without making mistakes, we will never learn or know what is good and bad, what we lost and what we must treasure, BUT we MUST realized that there IS a price to pay.</p>
              <p>Your bf must understand it too. Heavenly beings may forgive what we had done, but we may not be able to similarly do so, for we are not heavenly beings, only mortals with emotions and feelings. No one owes anyone forgiveness. Forgiveness can only be given by the wronged party with sincerity and naturality, and cannot be forced upon.</p>
              <p>Take your time to reconsider. What you are deciding is something that is vital and crucial, for it will be for life and long term, a life you will be living, not us. I can only say perfection don't exist but is not an excuse to settle for 2nd best. It is what we do to ensure that the 2nd best become the best that matters, and it will take wisdom, patience and courage to make it happen.</p>
              <p>True love is a journey shared by 2 and later with children. Only you can help the one you love just as he will help you too. At times one may falther, but the other will be a source of strength and courage to pull one back up. Life aint never a bed of roses, that's why you need someone close to your heart to make that beautiful journey of life, each time one falls in the mistakes of life.</p>

              is a betrayal, no excuses. However, I hope you will take into
              consideration that he had been honest to you, confessed in full,
              and had vowed never to do such dishonorable acts again.</p>
              <p>As a man, i would admit that the temptation is great, but IT
              MUST NEVER be an excuse for failing honour and integrity.
              Everyone of us make mistakes, for without making mistakes, we will
              never learn or know what is good and bad, what we lost and what we
              must treasure, BUT we MUST realized that there IS a price to
              pay.</p>
              <p>Your bf must understand it too. Heavenly beings may forgive what
              we had done, but we may not be able to similarly do so, for we are
              not heavenly beings, only mortals with emotions and feelings. No
              one owes anyone forgiveness. Forgiveness can only be given by the
              wronged party with sincerity and naturality, and cannot be
              forced upon.</p>
              <p>Take your time to reconsider. What you are deciding is something
              that is vital and crucial, for it will be for life and long term, a
              life you will be living, not us. I can only say perfection don't
              exist but is not an excuse to settle for 2nd best. It is what we do
              to ensure that the 2nd best become the best that matters, and it
              will take wisdom, patience and courage to make it happen.</p>
              <p>True love is a journey shared by 2 and later with children.
              Only you can help the one you love just as he will help you too. At
              times one may falther, but the other will be a source of
              strength and courage to pull one back up. Life aint never a bed of
              roses, that's why you need someone close to your heart to make that
              beautiful journey of life, each time one falls in the
              mistakes of life.</p>

              <p>Thank you xtreyier, your post is very meaningful. It made me realise any decision I make - be it to give up or to forgive - should not be rash.</p>
