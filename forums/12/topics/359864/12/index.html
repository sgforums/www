              <p><br>There's no right/wrong in everything. Its because people like give judgements based on their experiences/knowledge that they have before. There is no ego in love, you can't have all the best things in life.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>Love - when it is a friendly fragrance (loving) in which no one is superior, in which no one  decides  'things', in which both understand and are cognizant of the fact that they are different (personalities with individualities behind the social masks), that both their approach towards life is different, that they think differently, and still, with all these differences, they love each other and yet allow space to evolve without encroaching, without possessing .. without the need to behave or even extract promises for tomorrow - both would remain a mystery unto themselves, and when  the journey and the goal is one - its an existential experience, subjective and yet never dull or certain.

              <p>I just broke up with my boyfriend of 1 year and 5 months because
              I found out that he had hired escorts and even had sex with one
              (only one or so he claims)</p>
              <p>In our the relationship, I'm always the one to talk about our
              future and marriage and he always agrees with everything though he
              has never initiated any talks about marriage, which makes me think
              he's not sincere about marrying me or has never given it any
              thought.</p>
              <p>The thing is he was a virgin so I was his first, and the reason
              he gave for doing what he did was because he wanted to experience
              other female encounters. And he swore that was the first and last
              time. </p>
              <p>I have no idea what I should do or if I should forgive him.
              Because I've had other men before him so I cannot bring myself to
              fault him for what he did. But I have never cheated in any of my
              relationships. On the other hand if he cheated on me once, what's
              to stop him from doing it a second time?</p>
              <p>I really don't know what I should do. I'm mid twenty so it's not
              too late to look for other trees in the forest but I also wonder if
              I believe in him that it will never happen again.</p>

              <p>Forgive him. Don't let his mistake punish you. Be good to
