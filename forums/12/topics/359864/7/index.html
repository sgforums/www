              <p>I looked at the problem from this angle before and that was why I had considered forgiving him.</p>
              <p>I think it's the same crime the only difference is I did not plan for it to be this way whereas he had planned everything, msges starting from February to the deed in March and somemore contacting other escorts right up till last week. All this while he can act like nothing has happened.</p>
              <p>If a murderer turns a new leaf we might be able to forgive him, but what if he was murdering behind your back and sleeping beside you at night?</p>

              <p>hey ts,</p>
              <p>you are talking about marriage in a 1 year old relationship? how much do u know about this guy? dont u know its a little rush to be discussing such issues at that stage of your relationship.</p>
              <p>i sympathise with you the heart breaks u have gone through and i despise those who buy sex be it male or female. simply becasuse its a matter of self control and respect here.</p>
              <p>gucci belt? come on, a relationship is not measured on monetary terms. its give and take and sometimes its only giving so dont expect the other party to always reciprocate.</p>
              <p>u dont necessarily reap what u sow in a relationship. just my two cents.</p>

              <p>Love has nothing to do with what he is or what he has done, it has to do with what u are,, so what are u now, if are hurting - its is your expectations of what he has to be for u or do for u - love is not business, it is as nebulous as the clouds.</p>
              <p>Forgiveness - not because u love him , but because he is another human being with imperfcetions, and u are rich within u - to share ur kindness , to share ur love ......</p>
              <p>The promise of tomorrow or the future is a lie, a BIG lie, live, love and make living a play, seriousness is neurosis, its sickness - people with egos are always serious , heavy hearted</p>
              <p>The next moment is born out of this moment - what u are being  now counts!</p>

              <p>why would i need to pay for her to cheat on me? and beside, what has it got to do with me? i am just stating the fact ard me. load of guys cheated on their wife. Just pay the nite club/ ktv pub a visit. how many of the uncle there are single? do u think their kids all grown up to be sad bastard?</p>
              <p>Just saying that he cheated and the answer is simple. either u carryon working on the r/s to make it work and live with his past errors or simply just dump him and move on.</p>
              <p>and that such thing does happen much more often they we like to believe. Fairy tales are nice thing we were told when young. But dun let that blind ur eye to thing that is happening ard u.</p>
