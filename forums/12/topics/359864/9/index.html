              <p>By the way, is "I am sorry" really the boyfried?</p>
              <p>I thought someone was joking or trolling.</p>
              <p>Anyways,</p>
              <p>For deadweightheart, I recommend that you break up with him.</p>
              <p>You should look at this positively.</p>
              <p>It means that you have fortunately discovered something important before you marry him or spend even more time with him and waste your time.</p>
              <p>So look at it positively, that you have saved urself.</p>
              <p>I wish you good luck in your next search.</p>
              <p>By the way, I recommend that you join a dating site/ dating agency, especially those with membership subscription, over there you can find tons of serious guys with serious intention to marry (not playful immature guys)</p>
              <p>This is good especially since you are in mid-20s also. It's time to get serious.</p>

              <p>Woah, the bf here too? Such a small world isnt it?</p>
              <p><br>I was fortunate to have served in the army for NS. One gets to mix with all kinds of people, and it taught me much of life there, a microscopic fellowship of our fellow citizens of my peers.</p>
              <p> As a boy, i guess we love to experiment, at times bragged about conquests of females. I remembered once i was challenged to walk on the wild side - go geylang to satisfy the raging male testerones levels.</p>
              <p><br>Some believe it is better than to despoil young virgins. So I joined in and walked with them on the dark beckoning streets with beautiful and alluring women smiling at you. Sadly i lost a bet for i could not bring myself to bed such women.</p>
              <p><br>I guess love is more than just a satisfaction of the male need. There is no tenderness or love involved. Only pure jungle needs. I am no animal. It comes with an emptiness, for in that tender moment of fleeting physical contact, love does not exist no matter how hard you pretend, and when it is over, one is back to square one - alone again.</p>
              <p>That pros do not love you, she wants only your money and would gladly open her legs for anyone else who would pay her.</p>
              <p><br>Nothing special, nothing exclusive. Trusts, faith, honour and integrity is a joke. The only perfection with such 'illusion of love' is the emptiness it brings, wherelse, if one can find a good companion, that exchange of physical tenderness holds special meaning, even if it is just to hold hands.</p>
              <p>It is something special, a bond and trust to share an exclusive life together - come what may - hell or highwater, poverty or wealth, sickness or good health. It is something rare in this world where no one trusts anyone else.</p>
              <p><br>To the bf, all i can say you have lost something precious. Love doesnt come easy or to everyone. You had it in your grasp, not an emptiness but a special relationship and precious bond. May you take time to reflect on what you had lost and whom you had hurt.</p>
              <p><br>Should you be forgiven, count yourself lucky. Should you not, then pick yourself up and move on. We must be responsible for our mistakes and pay its price, learn from it and be a better man tomorrow.</p>
              <p>Only you can live your own life. Others such as us can only share what we know from our own mistakes made, so that you do not make similar mistakes. Good luck.</p>

              <p>deadweightheart-I don't know, maybe you are actually enjoying all the attention from the guys here, what with their eloquent definitions of what love SHOULD or should NOT be. I can't possibly blame them anyway, since you painted yourself an online picture of a good-looking young lady in her sexual prime, with earning power and her own ride. Methinks you should get your head out of this virtual drama playing out here. After all this IS a drama, innit? You and iamsorry as the leads, and the rest of us are the extras, the shit-stirrers and rabble-rousers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Cheating is cheating, no two ways about it. It's not more forgiveable if it was a 'sudden passion' thing as a fellow forumer suggested. What if i have sudden passionate feelings when i'm drinking and dancing with girls at clubs every weekend? The way you all tear the guy to bits, it's as if you guys are the prosecution pressing for pre-mediated murder!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you ask me, this is already a foregone conclusion. She will go back to him. How he treats her in the future is a different story. So yeah, all you web jockeys sitting behind your monitor, dispensing 'good guy' advice in the hopes of touching this young lady's heart and getting her number, wake the F up and go back to playing DOTA.</p>

              <p>Let's not be too judgemental nor be overly harsh. Havent we in our life heard or even personally experience such situations ourselves before?</p>
              <p>Put yourself in her shoes. You loved a person, put your faith and trust in her. One day you found out you were betrayed by the one you loved. Havent we know what is betrayal? School, work, social life? Whom amongst us is so fortunate that we know not the pain of betrayal?</p>
              <p><br>Whether real or drama, does it matter on the internet, whereby we know not each other, but only by words and the expression of oneself thru phrases and emotions represented by words? Step away from the computer, and we would never know each other, even if we were to be sharing a table in a foodcourt.</p>
              <p><br>Within anonymity, will one daringly expresses himself/herself, for there is no need to fear, words cannot harm unlike sticks, stones and the condemnation in real life. For those who doubt the veracity of words, then begone and avoid such sites.</p>
              <p><br>What will and have one lost by sharing experiences? What is so wrong if one seeks friendship on the net that he/she must be casted with less than noble effort? What kind of society are we building if we distrust each other even anonymously?</p>
              <p><br>What happens here ends here if one wish and need not go further, for within anonymity, one still has the control situations.</p>
              <p>There is no need to be overly critical of others who only seeks to share, for such condemnation lies not with them, but with the one who condemns, showing a lack of tolerance, insensitivity and a sense of deluded superiority, sadly proving absolute immaturity.</p>
              <p><br>We as a society are facing a rising divorce rate. Let us within our capacity help in ways we can to bring a better understanding, so that more be aware and take courage in relationships and forming families. They are the rocks of stability for a society and civilisation to grow.</p>
              <p>But more important than society or civilisation IS THE INDIVIDUAL. This is a beautiful planet despite its flaws and imperfectness, even if one does not move beyond the village, and no govt or society wants anyone to be lonely or alone. Life is meant to be shared in order that it may be meaningful to our very existance.</p>
              <p>A twinkle of the eye, a smile, a hug, the warmth of the one you love and you loved, tears away the pain and suffering of a day's slog and gives strength with courage to face another tough day.</p>
              <p>The journey of life is never easy for anyone, regardless rich or poor, but with loved ones, it becomes bearable and meaningful. No one, absolutely no one, needs to be alone or must face it thus, for despite our difference, we are the same humans, race with similar longings.</p>

              <p>Not forget the past but for Uncle Sam to marry the mother he must accept her past if not don't marry her.</p>
              <p>Not
              to forget the past but understand that the past is something you cannot
              change so if you have it in you to accept then don't come back and say
              that you want revenge.</p>
              <p>Mother slept with father in the past, some may forgive that. <br> But what is Mother married Uncle Sam and still sleeps with father? There's the difference.</p>

              <p>deadweightheart-I don't know, maybe you are actually enjoying
              all the attention from the guys here, what with their eloquent
              definitions of what love SHOULD or should NOT be. I can't
              possibly blame them anyway, since you painted yourself an online
              picture of a good-looking young lady in her sexual prime, with
              earning power and her own ride. Methinks you should get your head
              out of this virtual drama playing out here. After all this IS a
              drama, innit? You and iamsorry as the leads, and the rest of us are
              the extras, the shit-stirrers and rabble-rousers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Cheating is cheating, no two ways about it. It's not more
              forgiveable if it was a 'sudden passion' thing as a fellow forumer
              suggested. What if i have sudden passionate feelings when i'm
              drinking and dancing with girls at clubs every weekend? The way you
              all tear the guy to bits, it's as if you guys are the prosecution
              pressing for pre-mediated murder!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you ask me, this is already a foregone conclusion. She
              will go back to him. How he treats her in the future is a different
              story. So yeah, all you web jockeys sitting behind your monitor,
              dispensing 'good guy' advice in the hopes of touching this young
              lady's heart and getting her number, wake the F up and go back to
              playing DOTA.</p>

              <p>I'd admire your courage to find the answers in online forums, cos it's hard to get objective answers or sometimes even getting confused, but then again, we thank you for sharing.</p>
              <p>While waiting for AndrewPKYAP to answer your thoughts, let me share with you some of my views.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I feel it is not the character that attracts unfaithful guys, rather the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">environment</span> and the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>character</em></span> of the guys that stirs the unfaithfulness.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Example (A)</p>
              <p>If the R/S/work/family env gives him stress, he meets another girl, diff from what he encounters, he finds comfort, or some "getaway" just by being with the girl, then unfaithfulness may creep in.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Example (B)</p>
              <p>The guy is indecisive type, dunno what type of girl he wants, so he "experiments".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Example (C)</p>
              <p>The guys likes thrill, like being "in love", cos his current R/S has stabled, so unfaithfulness may creep in.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Example (D)</p>
              <p>The guy is too nice to every girl, can't differentiate "love" and "being friendly", may end up unfaithful if a girl throws her arms to him.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Example (E)</p>
              <p>The guy ended up with his current girl due to responsibilty, not love, cos if he breaks with the girl, he will be obstracised by ppl, or overcome by guilt. Then when he found an outside girl which he can "click with", unfaithfulness will creep in.</p>
              <p> </p>
