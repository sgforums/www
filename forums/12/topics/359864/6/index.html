              <p>that isnt true. More then most ppl like to believe, alarmingly, there are quite a number of women whom knowingly allow their hubby to cheat outside with pros.</p>
              <p>Better to have him cheat with pro and return at the end of the nite then have him keep a lover outside and not returning home. Men are known to b able to seperate sex from love. That's how they felt. Not saying that is right or wrong.</p>
              <p>Just pointing out that for a marriage to work, it doesnt mean that there is only just ONE way, the traditional one.</p>

              <p>I dun sleep around. I had 2 previous relationships but they didn't work out. My previous one was 4 years you think I wanted it to end? I am faithful in my relationships to the point that I sacrifice knowing other guys because I would feel I had cheated even if I gave my number to a strange man.</p>

              <p>This is an act of being unfaithful and in a long run, i am very sure complicated problems will arise .. AND no, most guys dunno how to difference sex and love .. Just one demand from the sex buddy .. There goes your r/s.</p>
              <p>As for the case u mention then there's no point in marriage already. Why even marry to commit ? We haven put into consideration of STDs.</p>

              <p>It's a frightening thought that a man would visit pros while he has already a gf. Worse if he readily admits to it and give stupid and immoral excuses.</p>
              <p>What is he treating you as? A piece of rag? And you dare trust your future with him?</p>
              <p>Perhaps immorality and liberalism is the way of life nowadays. It gives one freedom, but the price one pays is often painful, not only for the hurt of oneself when the realization of emptiness strikes. It hurts others too, for faithfulness, trust and integrity is still desired, no matter how liberal we may become.</p>
              <p>Forgive him by all means, but not because you fear being left alone. You are more appreciated than you will realize. Forgive him, but not because you do not want to go thru the hassle of building up a relationship again. You owe it to yourself to get a good man ( not perfect man for he dont exist).</p>
              <p>Forgive him only IF HE CAN ASSURE YOU HE IS REMORSEFUL AND VOWS NEVER TO HURT YOU AGAIN.</p>
              <p>If he can't even take this simple vow, tell him to get lost.</p>
