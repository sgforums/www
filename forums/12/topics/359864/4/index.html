              <p>this is my first relationship so essentially its my first

              will definitely consider it based on the relationship.</p>

              <p>What has money and use of your personal computer gota do with your beat up relationship ?</p>
              <p>What is done .. is done.. but I think it is only fair you let her sleep with another man.. even if just for one night.</p>
              <p>If you are so giving.. and remorseful.. I suggest you pay for a giggolo so that she may enjoy the night on your expense. </p>
              <p>If you can forgive her and take her back as your girlfriend.. after she gets to enjoy herself.. then it is only fair.. that she accepts you back and forgive you too.</p>

              <p>I just broke up with my boyfriend of 1 year and 5 months because
              I found out that he had hired escorts and even had sex with one
              (only one or so he claims)</p>
              <p>In our the relationship, I'm always the one to talk about our
              future and marriage and he always agrees with everything though he
              has never initiated any talks about marriage, which makes me think
              he's not sincere about marrying me or has never given it any
              thought.</p>
              <p>The thing is he was a virgin so I was his first, and the reason
              he gave for doing what he did was because he wanted to experience
              other female encounters. And he swore that was the first and last
              time. </p>
              <p>I have no idea what I should do or if I should forgive him.
              Because I've had other men before him so I cannot bring myself to
              fault him for what he did. But I have never cheated in any of my
              relationships. On the other hand if he cheated on me once, what's
              to stop him from doing it a second time?</p>
              <p>I really don't know what I should do. I'm mid twenty so it's not
              too late to look for other trees in the forest but I also wonder if
              I believe in him that it will never happen again.</p>
              <p>Any opinions or words of advice will be deeply appreciated.</p>

              <p>I came to this forum because I couldn't confide in friends because I still spared a thought for you.</p>
              <p>I admit in the start I was very tempted to forgive you but I know love is blinding me and I cannot make rational decisions when I'm not clear-headed.</p>
              <p>Putting my thought down in words has made the picture so much clearer. I think in my mind I know the right decision just that I was trying to deny it.</p>
              <p>The bitter fact is simply that you do not love me that much. If you loved me why did you feel the need to compare? I'm not shampoo you can't try out others then decide that you like the old one best. Women are not objects and feelings are not meant to be toyed with.</p>
              <p>Even after your liasion with that escort in March you were still in contact with other escorts and you say you will change? I feel like slapping myself for entertaining thoughts to forgive you.</p>

              <p>I am the guy in question.</p>
              <p>I do not defend my actions because I believe that they are
              wrong.</p>
              <p>But I am begging you, please please please give me 1 chance. I
              have not been the best boyfriend, but I really do love you.</p>
              <p>Marriage has been a touchy subject that I've never broached
              mainly because I feel that you have this perception that I'm not
              ready for it, so if and when I bring it up, I fear you might think
              I'm just trying to fu yan you.</p>
              <p>I am younger than you, but that doesn't make me any less
              interested in getting married.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This will be the first and last time I ever make this mistake.
              While people might claim that when there's a first, there's a
              second, I know that this will never occur again, because I've
              realised how much you mean to me. This relationship means more to
              me than anything I can ever find.</p>
              <p>I don't ask that you forgive me right off. I will prove to you
              that I can change.</p>
              <p>I will change. I will be better. I really really do love you.
              Please give me a chance.</p>

              clearer. I think in my mind I know the right decision just that I
              was trying to deny it.</p>
              <p>The bitter fact is simply that you do not love me that much. If
              you loved me why did you feel the need to compare? I'm not shampoo
              you can't try out others then decide that you like the old one
              best. Women are not objects and feelings are not meant to be toyed
              with.</p>
              <p>Even after your liasion with that escort in March you were still
              in contact with other escorts and you say you will change? I feel
