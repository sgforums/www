              <p>But it's also not correct to suffer everything in silence. Would you tell a woman who was beat up by her husband to not be calculative because she has to accept that his only bad point is violence? Emotional hurt is not any less than physical hurt!</p>

              <p>No, you have plenty of chances..</p>
              <p>For every girl you decide to have a relationship with.. you are given ONE chance. So if you have 10 relationship.. you have 10 chances.</p>
              <p>So what else are you complaining about ?</p>
              <p>You had your chance.. with your girl.. and you blew it.. now if you want another chance.. you need to find another girl.</p>
              <p>If your girl go sleep with another man when she is with you..are you going to say "oh I give you another chance." ?</p>
              <p>If you think everyone else must show respect for you.. when you dont' show respect for others.. you are essentially screwing yourself over.</p>

              <p>But I am begging you, please please please give me 1 chance. I
              have not been the best boyfriend, but I really do love you.</p>
              <p>Marriage has been a touchy subject that I've never broached
              mainly because I feel that you have this perception that I'm not
              ready for it, so if and when I bring it up, I fear you might think
              I'm just trying to fu yan you.</p>
              <p>I am younger than you, but that doesn't make me any less

              <p> </p>
              <p>This will be the first and last time I ever make this mistake.
              While people might claim that when there's a first, there's a
              second, I know that this will never occur again, because I've
              realised how much you mean to me. This relationship means more to
              me than anything I can ever find.</p>

              <p>-_- you know, there's a reason why we call these sort of stuff personal relationships. she may need to let steam off here but you? shouldn't you be discussing your problems with her offline? whats the point of forgiveness from faceless people you don't even know? you think the same people asking for people to die faster in another thread are going to coming in here and sayang you?</p>
              <p>anyway this kind of thing is proven by action not mouth say only. your presence here would only incite people making things worse. want forgiveness pls do it offline.</p>
