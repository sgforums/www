              <p>I just broke up with my boyfriend of 1 year and 5 months because I found out that he had hired escorts and even had sex with one (only one or so he claims)</p>
              <p>In our the relationship, I'm always the one to talk about our future and marriage and he always agrees with everything though he has never initiated any talks about marriage, which makes me think he's not sincere about marrying me or has never given it any thought.</p>
              <p>The thing is he was a virgin so I was his first, and the reason he gave for doing what he did was because he wanted to experience other female encounters. And he swore that was the first and last time. </p>
              <p>I have no idea what I should do or if I should forgive him. Because I've had other men before him so I cannot bring myself to fault him for what he did.

              <p>I really don't know what I should do. I'm mid twenty so it's not too late to look for other trees in the forest but I also wonder if I believe in him that it will never happen again.</p>

              <p>In his handphone he had also smsed a few other escorts but he said it was just to get them to send pictures to him. He has a collection of pictures of girls but I think it is a very normal guy thing. On the other hand if he was so into girls I'm afriad he will be more suceptible to temptation and hence stray more easily.</p>
