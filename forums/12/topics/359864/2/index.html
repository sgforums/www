              <p>yeah I saw your post too. This is what happens when you marry the
              unreasonable demanding girlfriend? no offense intended, that was just a speculation. I think you should let her have a
              small taste of life without you then she'll truly appreciate you.A relationship should always have mutual respect from both parties.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Or
              you could try communicating with her. Communication is very important
              and you should never try to guess what another person is thinking or
              jump to conclusions.</p>

              I feel for you.
              
              Its not nice for a gal to be talking abt marriage or the future as if the gal is so desperate. The guy should be the one with the intiative. I think he is giving a lot of reasons and the more reasons he give, the scenario just feels worse. Please don keep thinking that bcos u did certain things in the past, it gives him the authority to do things now. It DOES NOT work this way. Its different as you were not with him then!!! 
              
              As many had said, if he can do it now, while u are still together, he can and will definitely make the same mistake in the future. At the end of the day, being together for one year plus is nothing. Since you have broken up, you should move on. You are still young and there are many trees available. Jia you ba!

              <p>Dump him. He is a jerk. What does he mean by saying he wanted to experience other female encounters? If he truly loves you, he would not even want to experience other females. If he thinks about other females (friends or strangers), that is fine, cause sometimes a guy would think about such things and fantasize. But what the hell is he trying to do, when he said he wanted to experience other female encounters? This is totally absurd.</p>
              <p>I had a gf and I love my gf only. What ever female encounters I had, I did it with my gf. Though I do think about some other girls sometimes, I stay true to my gf. Even during photo takings with my very good female friends, I do not even put my hand across their shoulders because I want to stay true to my gf.</p>
              <p>There are somethings a bf should do only to her gf and not to other female friends. Your bf is a total jerk because he slept around with other girls while still being with you. He had betrayed the trust in the relationship and has let this relationship down. Therefore, you should not harbor any hopes of getting back together with him. Once the trust is broken, it can never be repaired.</p>
              <p>Stop finding excuses for yourself so that you can go back to him. This is plain stupidity. So what if you have had other guys before. That was all ya past relationships. The difference is this jerk slept with other guys while in relationship with ya. Whereas you slept with those other guys you had when you are not with this jerk.</p>
              <p>So forget about him and give yourself a new lease of life. No point crying over spilled milk. Just be firm and break off the relationship. The pain will go off after a while. Fuck this man.</p>
