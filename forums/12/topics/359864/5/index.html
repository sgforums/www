              <p>The problem is that for guys who stray... tendancy of them straying again is very high, especially when they earn forgiveness...then after that they will take their gf for granted and it becomes a vicious cycle coz forgiveness is earned by begging, crying and grovelling</p>

              <p>Heh, u remind me of one of the korean movie i've just watched recently. The title is "Seducing Mr. Perfect". I think u must watch the movie. The lesson is don't "give" too much to your guy. He will take it for granted cos he knows you're always be around for him. </p>
              <p>A cheating partner is a very unforgivable regardless of whatever EXCUSES he has. </p>
              <p>DUMP HIM. Since you are so pretty and attractive, you can always find a new guy. </p>

              <p>if i get this chance i will not make the same mistake again. talk is

              <p>why are people so quick to give the death penalty to everyone that makes a mistake?</p>

              <p>Ms.shells: you think i didn't think of it? i will if she tells

              <p>if i get this chance i will not make the same mistake again.
              talk is cheap yes. but i can't use actions to prove anything if i
              don't get the chance.</p>
              <p>why are people so quick to give the death penalty to everyone
              that makes a mistake?</p>
              <p>do you think that once a criminal always a criminal? have none
              of you made mistakes??</p>
              <p>I really really regret my actions. This will never happen again.
              i'm just asking for one chance to prove myself.</p>

              <p>Everyone make mistakes .. And they learn .. From your case, learn from this and treat your future gf better but i seriously doubt so .. Cos u simply can't take control down south. At the point of undressing and going into action .. U got a few mintues to back off but did u? No, u didn't.</p>
              <p>U dun deserve any chances at all cos its just gonna bring more damage to her.</p>
