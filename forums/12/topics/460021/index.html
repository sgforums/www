              My supervisor had been attacking my personal life and making fun of me/ talking about me to my co-workers. And on an occassion, he yelled at me and used the word "FCUK" and used discriminationg word against my race. I had reported it to his supervisor but he did not do anything.

              I filed a formal complaint with HR and they told me they would be in contact with me to investigate this claim. I have followed up with them several times and the only response I receive is that they are too busy right now because of vacations and conferences that are planned but will follow up with me soon.
              
              Then HR asked me to attend a meeting with HR &amp; supervisor. They asked me to QUIT.  I did not have any other choice but to QUIT. I tried to meet with MOM to see if MOM can help. But MOM can only help those salary brackets are lower than my salary.
              
              What should I do? I quit my job because I cannot deal with the way this company acted on me.

              Selva, after reading your message, I think your supervisor and the HR were quite in cahoot in their decision to terminate you. I see what you are going through were like those other foreign workers that had experienced from their management.
                  
              If you are a Singaporean, your supervisor would not dare to treat your that way and the HR will not simply asked you to resign. How long have you been working for that company? Were you still under probation and yet to be confirmed? Were you holding S-Pass or EP Pass? Did they pay you according to your salary that was stated in your application form and in your IPA letter during your S-PASS or EP Pass documentation varification, registration and card processing? Did your former company deducted the levy from your salary? 
                  
              Which MOM office did you go to make that complain. MOM Headquarter at Bendemeer Road or at EP office near Boat Quay or at Work Permit Service Centre at Tanjong Pagar Complex at Pansir Panjang Road? Because if your former company had infringed any of the MOM law pertaining to monthly salary and levy, they could be in trouble if you had complained to the MOM- Special Branch Unit while you were still employed. Probably there was a good reason why your HR had requested for your resignation instead of terminating you within 24 hours.

              <p>Singapore does not protect its employees. It is a harsh place to work.</p>
              <p>In malaysia, the laws protect the employees. Working in malaysia is like playing baseball, strike 1, strike 2 and strike 3...you are out. So you got 3 chances. If you still kanna sack, you can always go to arbitration of which the chances of courts winning is much higher.</p>
              <p>It appears the HR supports/side this supervisor, they seek to fix you up. Likely that your supervisor didn't like your work performance. In singapore, if you complain against your superiors, highly likely they will fix you up. The employers there are evil. So don't do anything formal...until you really really know how the company works.</p>
              <p>Sorry to say lah, there's nothing you can do. But you can prolly seek revenge like wait for your supervisor leave office that time, place a sack over his head and whack him as many times as you can or scratch his car or puncture his tires.  </p>
