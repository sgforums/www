              <p>You have no say in whether to serve NS or not, so just serve it and take the time to think about your future career. You may also take the time to consider whether you will want to continue studying in private unis or not. </p>
              <p>There is no point in keep thinking about how the girls are outside working and earning more than you right now. You should take your mind off this by focusing on other stuffs such as your army training, as well as the things I mentioned above. </p>

              <p>When I was a recruit (in 2002), I was earning $240 per month.</p>
              <p>And while inflation has increased prices since then, the rise in NS allowances have more than compensated. $240 to $420 is nearly double. Don't tell me that the consumer price index has doubled since 2002.</p>
              <p>If the CPI is too hard for you to understand, then figure this out: has the price of chicken rice doubled in the years from 2002 to 2010?</p>

              <p>Life is an eternal journey and never a destination. What you are going through is only temporary. Tell yourself that there are better things to come when you pass through this phase in life. Stop comparing yourself with others! Your life is yours alone to live.</p>
              <p>TS needs to change his mindset. So what if you are not Chelsea or Man United steamrolling everyone? So what if you are only Blackpool? Upsets happen every now and then, don't they? Toughness in mental attitude is what TS needs. Mental toughness will be the key to winning life's battles!

              <p>i suspect ts isn't complaining about low pay, but how he's
                  unable to stand on an equal footing with his peers (esp dating)</p>
              <p>in other words, if other girls his age earns $420 a month too
                  he'll be perfectly fine with it =D</p>

              <p>Equal footing?</p>
              <p>Like I said, his peers in his section, platoon, company, and BMTC are on the same footing as he is.</p>
              <p>And dating? He doesn't have to fight with girls to date guys, no? Unless he's 302, of course..... </p>
              <p>And if girls are earning more, then, well, other recruits are also earning $420, aren't they?</p>

              <p>If you think it's unfair to get $420/month and serve two years of your life, then what about all the other mothers' sons in your section, platoon, company, and BMTC? They get $2k allowance and can quit at any time ah?</p>
              <p>Why compare yourself to the girls? Shouldn't you be comparing yourself to guys?</p>
