            <div class='col-md body'>think u might want to ask yourself if you prefer to work in the public or pte sector in future. for the former, a f/t local deg will be an advantage. it is darn difficult to get into the public sector with a p/t overseas deg, almost impossible.<br><br>as for employers in the pte sector, many have learnt that paper qualification is not the most important. what's more impt for job seekers is how they fare and present themselves during the interview. even if ur paper qualification is not as impressive as others, if you are able to create the impression that you are The One for the job, you can still get it.<br><br>the job mkt still favors pple with experience. thus, a p/t deg course will help to clock some experience at the same time.<br><br>gd luck!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks<br>I guess there are a lot of things to consider. However I'm more in favour of the P/T course though most of the people around me seem to think otherwise. A degree is just a piece of paper that helps you get the interview. After that it's all up to you. But I realise a lot of employers are employing fresh grads these days. Probably due to the fact that they ask for less salary then experienced pple. Besides, should I wish to leave and be a quitter, would a degree from Aussie be more valuable than one from Sg? After all, there are some people who still do not seem to know where that tiny speck of dust is on the globe.[/code][/quote]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmm...I have a friends who could get into local unis but chose to take up part time degrees instead....I guess the trend in going for local unis is changing...the 3 or 4 yrs is not going to secure a job...thus many opted for part time study are shorter in duration and doesnt really make a difference...after all what you learn in school isnt really going to be what you will apply in your job...maybe only that 10% bit?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>is ur income now so important??? just ask urself that... u want to earn more for this 4 yrs... or earn more the the rest of ur life??<br><br>yes, sg education system sucks.. that is why local u are still more recognised in sg.. especially in GLC..<br><br>and about the talent vs paper thing... forget it.. unless u are born really really really really good u wont even have a chance to step into their company so where got chance to prove ur talent??<br><br>but if u still die die think that piece of paper is not so important.. then my suggestion to u is.. then why waste that 3 or 4 yrs now? just go work now ...if u are really that good, u still can make it one... so save ur money and time.. better right?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In terms of international recognition, I think both are on par. It's just tat the local uni is cheaper. But if i study P/T, I can work and gain experience. Tough though. Working F/T and studying P/T.<br><br>Besides at the age of 25, I feel terrible about relying on my mum for pocket $. And working P/T while studying F/T stinks too. and if I work P/T and study F/T, tats just like a reversal of roles when compared to the P/T degree. And I get less income and job exp tat is totally unrelated.<br><br>Still undecided though, a part of me wishes to experience varsity life. though i think it's somewhat similar to poly life. Compared to P/T courses, at least the local uni has better infrastructure and support. a proper system.<br><br>And i can get to know more young girls!!! hahaha <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I can tell you this much - be prepared to have no life if you choose part time study.  I am nearing the end of a part time course and I've just about had it.<br><br>I stuck with this course even though I know that public sector organizations discriminate against part time overseas degrees, because I don't believe that education is just about getting the certificate.  That's bullshit.  Of course, to be fair and practical, without the piece of paper, you're in no man's land too.<br><br>If I were you, I'd seriously consider what kind of future you envision for yourself and decide the best way to reach it, regardless of whether it's through a local university (F/T) or an overseas institute (P/T).  If your parents can afford to support you and are willing to do so, just take their help.  Money can be earned later.  IF not, there's always part time work which gives you some income, and allows you time to focus on your studies, and if you can manage your time, to have some fun too.<br><br>[/b]</div>
