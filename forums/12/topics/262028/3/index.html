            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by mistyblue:</div><div class="quote_body">What's the point talking to hb? grin and bear it loh. I took to the bottle. Its easier and less consequence.<br><br>Family relationships are complicated and people sometimes keep things in their heart that they should not. So let them be as long as they are happy. They do their part that they can give. You do your part as a DIL. That is enough.  In the past, my BIL dumps his kids with us 99% of the time so that he and his wife can sleep, shop and enjoy life and even when my MIL is not feeling well or need rest - their kids are with us. I was the bad guy and told them off that their kids are not welcome all the time. In a week, at least keep them home over the weekends. In a way, I hope I help the kids but my MIL and BIL/Wife resented what I did and really gave me a hard time. Besides, I must say, I never liked kids, worse are loud kids, and worse are kids who are not disciplined, most worse are kid's parents turn a blind eye to every nasty thing their children do. my BIL kids and my BIL/Wife fall into that category.<br><br>But even with using my MIL service, my BIL's wife was never thankful of her and made use of her to sell some of her M'sia's stuff with requirement to return 100% of profit. I don't believe my BIL contribute anything to my MIL as they are always short of money but seems to afford branded things well. Its their personal priority. However, for whatever reasons they do not want her, I know it fully well myself. My HB choose to think her as endearing even with the nonsense she says. But even with all these thing, they are very close knit family and I had always feel like an outsider among them. So what can I say. LPPL loh.<br><br></div></blockquote>Sounds like your MIL is venting her anger on you that on heaped upon her by the other SIL.<br><br>From what I see it, you are too unconfrontational to the point of being a sponge a doormat and let your MIL walked all over you.<br><br>Sigh, I know it's easier said than done but sometimes it is really easier done than said if you are more firm with yourself<br><br>Let's not go back to the past of you made the wrong choice of choosing this man as your husband for you were too blindly in love to observe his surrounding like his parents and blah blah blah. As what they said no point crying over split milk. The 'IF ONLY I'VE DONE THIS AND THIS' phrase doesn't apply here anymore.<br><br>Right now we should tackle your present situation and how to go about it. Ask yourself these questions<br><br>1) Is your marriage worth hanging on? - If not DIVORCE! Wipe the slate clean and start all over again. Short term hurt is better than long term hurting.<br><br>2) If not divorce, do you think you can live in this kind of condition for the rest of your lives? Please take note you did say your MIL is ONLY 50s. Not that old at all unless touch wood she kena accident and one leg kick immediately.<br><br>3) Do you seriously think taking to the bottle will really clear up all these problems? I am very sure you already knew the answer if you are a rational person from the posts you have posted (not just this but others as well). You jolly well know that it will only add on to your problems and misery and on top of that give your MIL one more reason to look down on you and one more excuse to tell your hubby how really useless a person you are. Do you really want that?<br><br>The whole world and this AA community and offer and talk to you about cock and bull story but ultimately it's up to you to be strong and make your stance. Don't show the world that you are a strong capable woman who can handle her own life. <span style="font-style: italic;">SHOW YOURSELF that YOU ARE CAPABLE OF HANDLING YOUR OWN LIFE. </span><br><br>Take a day when you think you are ready and face the mirror and tell that woman in the mirror you are your own mistress and the solution is in your hand. Go for it girl!!!</div>
