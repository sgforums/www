Then she also make comments that I never take care of my husband and always give him problem and make him come fetch me at work etc (I never asked my husband and he volunteers when he feels like it). My MIL also accuse me of trying to kill her with my cooking and now I don't cook and she is angry I never take up cooking to help her out. When I hide in my room, my MIL complains to my husband that I am unfriendly and I have to keep my doors open but anyways even with doors shut, she walks in on us and sometimes when we are in the middle of something.  Either way, I am fuked.<br><br>I try to put up. Some times, its just too much. I feel more stressed at home. My husband is not appreciative that I had given way and he said his whole family gave way to me. Then I got nothing to say loh, I can only think I am difficult person. Sometimes I think perhaps can move out on my own. Leave my husband with his family. Sometimes, I think maybe if I fall out the window, then everything settled.

FIL gambled away the money, MIL supported the house on her own. FIL colon cancer, MIL supported him and paid medical. BIL/SIL insisted to move out and my HB take over house. MIL fork out money to top up for the house. I know she wants attention. I know she feels that I am taking her son away. I know she is trying to hold on and etc. I know she wants to feel important and needed. I think maybe she is also experiencing monopause. I know and I try to understand. But when she does things or say things that cause us to quarrel or that she constantly speak ill behind me while act so "nice" in front of my hb and other people. Then I can only keep my distance because I will not be able to handle her, she wants to win and I will let her win. I cannot be bothered anymore.<br><br></div>

She complains alot to my husband and this creates stress for him. She treats me differently when my husband is around or not around. Treats herself as the queen of the house - the living room, kitchen and everything is arranged in the manner that suits her - so I stay in my room.  She cooks but sometimes I wish she does not cause, some stuff are not edible at all like fish slice with potato soup. Her cooking, I don't really like and she likes to do it over the top and in huge quantities that we throw away lots cause no one can finish. And she leaves all the cookingware allover unwashed till weekend then maybe when I feel like it, I clean up after her. My husband and I are the maid cause she eats and drinks everywhere and leaves the cups and bowls for me to collect and wash. Everyone gives in and she's always right. The kids my MIL take care are my BIL kids. So I don't give a damn if she teach them the wrong things or does not discipline them.  I just hope they grow up quickly and stay away from my place. my FIL is a quiet man. My MIL had commented that she is and will always be the one and only one to boss people around and she will be the one and only one to throw tempers.<br><br>I can accept everything but I find it hard that even as I try to give in, she is still unhappy that at times I reject doing things or didn't know she kept food for me and she will complain and make such a drama out of small thing as if the world is going to end. The worse part is my husband listens and he is after all her son, so he agrees and supports her. So there is no contest or conflict there. At times, I feel like moving out on my own. There are good and bad, but it depends on individual personality. My MIL and my character are direct opposite. I like peace and quiet and non-confrontational. She is loud and brash and over the top controlling with a strong aggressive shrew confrontational style. Its nothing wrong. Its just her. And its just me and we both rub each other wrong.<br><br></div></blockquote>you said "good and bad", what are the good things?<br></div>

So she is somewhat reinforcing her treatment of me because I did not quickly do the rabbit thing and make a dozen off springs.<br><br>I had told my HB that if he wants kids, and he does and he must know my physical limitation, then he should not complain if he choose to continue on. If he wants a off spring badly, he can choose to have affairs out there and once there is an off spring, I will be more than happy to step out of the r/s, accept a divorce. Besides, looking at the way my MIL takes care of the kids, I don't really think I want my kids under her influence.<br><br>I didn't like that my HB talks to my MIL/BIL/everyone about the issues in our marriage and everyone start to treat me in a manner to "fix" me and teach me how to behave and give way to the family and HB. That's why I find I get strange comments how to improve my r/s from people around me and I really don't know the context or where are these comments coming from. I really feel strange and violated at times that people make judgements and it always seem I am the one at fault. And all along I thought that my HB always say he just talk cock only and his family don't take it seriously. Actual fact is people do take these kinds of things seriously and that they take action especially when he is not around. I told him before that how can he keep talking about our problems with the MIL when we should be solving it. I don't know if he got it. Yes, my MIL didn't like me much after hearing things from him and various people. Same as your SIL. We can do perfectly ok things and there are small skirmish in marriage life  but my MIL will over-react and she always protect her son over a outsider. So now I find my outlet in bottles.  Well worse case scenarios will just be either divorce or death. Choosing one is a simple matter of opportunity.<br><br>My HB told me not to stress him. I understand there is a special r/s going on with my HB and his mom way before I enter the picture. I didn't want to stop their r/s but I don't want that r/s to affect my r/s with my HB. However, it cannot be helped with my MIL as such a dominating character.<br><br>Truth is that MIL forget that they were once daughters. My MIL always get her way even with her own mother. She never had to live with her own MIL and she has 'names' for relatives she does not like and especially those from her husband side.  She lived a blessed life but it does not extend to me as far as she is concern, her son is the most important. DIL can always change. It does not matter to her at all since she just get to enjoy the benefits from having her son around and a DIL to serve her needs. Women can be vicious to each other  especially when the one with less power can be manipulated to serve self interest.<br><br>About maids, I ask my HB if I can sometimes get part time help because at times, I just want a break. He refused on ground that he does not feel comfortable that there are strangers in the house. So I lan-lan have to do everything myself.<br></div>
