Then ur MIL and PIL will have the house. Think they are waiting for that.  Ur grandma chase them away bcos she wanted to rent out the whole unit.<br><br>Lesson is nvr live with in laws...<br><br>Misty Blue:<br>agree with jojo. Is it bcos divorce is a taboo in our society? You think you are serving your sin here? Your MIL and PIL has neither been a gd thingy too. Just bcos they hold the title MIL and FIL, u got to tolerate them. The more you being gd to them, the more they take advantage of you. Just MIA. Leave the house.</div>

She complains alot to my husband and this creates stress for him. She treats me differently when my husband is around or not around. Treats herself as the queen of the house - the living room, kitchen and everything is arranged in the manner that suits her - so I stay in my room.  She cooks but sometimes I wish she does not cause, some stuff are not edible at all like fish slice with potato soup. Her cooking, I don't really like and she likes to do it over the top and in huge quantities that we throw away lots cause no one can finish. And she leaves all the cookingware allover unwashed till weekend then maybe when I feel like it, I clean up after her. My husband and I are the maid cause she eats and drinks everywhere and leaves the cups and bowls for me to collect and wash. Everyone gives in and she's always right. The kids my MIL take care are my BIL kids. So I don't give a damn if she teach them the wrong things or does not discipline them.  I just hope they grow up quickly and stay away from my place. my FIL is a quiet man. My MIL had commented that she is and will always be the one and only one to boss people around and she will be the one and only one to throw tempers.<br><br>I can accept everything but I find it hard that even as I try to give in, she is still unhappy that at times I reject doing things or didn't know she kept food for me and she will complain and make such a drama out of small thing as if the world is going to end. The worse part is my husband listens and he is after all her son, so he agrees and supports her. So there is no contest or conflict there. At times, I feel like moving out on my own. There are good and bad, but it depends on individual personality. My MIL and my character are direct opposite. I like peace and quiet and non-confrontational. She is loud and brash and over the top controlling with a strong aggressive shrew confrontational style. Its nothing wrong. Its just her. And its just me and we both rub each other wrong.<br><br></div></blockquote>I feel sorry for you. I understand exactly how you feel to live with someone so different.<br><br>You can choose you husbands, but you cannot choose his family.<br><br>Headache isnt it...<br><br></div>
