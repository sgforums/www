When I try to avoid or is just doing my things like cleaning or whatever, my MIL comes over and makes comments such that i like cleaning so much therefore she is justified to leave everything for me to clean up. Or when I come home late, she makes comments that I have an affair outside and is enjoying myself. Then she also make comments that I never take care of my husband and always give him problem and make him come fetch me at work etc (I never asked my husband and he volunteers when he feels like it). My MIL also accuse me of trying to kill her with my cooking and now I don't cook and she is angry I never take up cooking to help her out. When I hide in my room, my MIL complains to my husband that I am unfriendly and I have to keep my doors open but anyways even with doors shut, she walks in on us and sometimes when we are in the middle of something.  Either way, I am fuked.<br><br>I try to put up. Some times, its just too much. I feel more stressed at home. My husband is not appreciative that I had given way and he said his whole family gave way to me. Then I got nothing to say loh, I can only think I am difficult person. Sometimes I think perhaps can move out on my own. Leave my husband with his family. Sometimes, I think maybe if I fall out the window, then everything settled. Its not easy.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well good for you.<br><br>If you know that your PIL are ok and just need some attention and people around them. You can take some time to be with them or do things together with them. Maybe you can go visit places they like. Old folks like to visit temples or go eat dian xing. I volunteer to help my MIL with her temple volunteer work for the CNY by helping the cooks to prepare the Vegetarian Lou Hei YuShen.  In the past, I make yang-mei rose tea which is helpful for blood pressure issues.<br><br>Actually I was really stupid and didn't realise that my husband and his mother confide in each other. My MIL will complain to my husband and my husband will tell our problem to my MIL. Then some times get get comments from them that I don't understand the context and where it is coming from. Then one day I arrived home at the same time with my FIL and they both do not know I am back. I went into my room and sat there to listen to the conversation going on in the next room until my husband realised I had come back. Upsetting isn't it. Not all husband put their spouse ahead.  The mediacorspe show "Ai Qing Shuang Ren Chuang" had a bad MIL. My MIL often use that character to remind me how fortunate I am that I have a good MIL.<br><br>I try to think of good things and stay happy. Otherwise I do get more sh!t than I can handle. Its complicated.<br></div>
