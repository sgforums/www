Not many of us realise that we are being productive while we sleep.<br><br>The problem is remembering the dream vividly so that you can unlock its message and apply it to whatever is affecting you in waking life.<br><br>The earliest examples of dream interpretation come from the Bible.  The most famous biblical dream is Pharaoh's dream about the seven fat and thin cattle and the seven fat and thin ears of corn, which Joseph interpreted as a prophecy of seven years of abundance and seven years of famine.<br><br>Joseph's interpretation had a huge impact not only on Egypt but also on the future of dream analysis.</div>

Dream interpretation is very general, as the same dream can have a different message for each individual dreamer.  It is best to use the dictionery of dreams as a guide only.<br><br>Ideally, break down the dream into symbols, archtypes, common elements and images first and then work out the more specific details.  Follow your instinct, relating the dream to your concious life and using all the information from books, design your own individual guide to your dreams.</div>
