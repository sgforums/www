            <div class='col-md body'>You are smart enough to actually dodge it, the one who uses the fist is ALWAYs the ultimate loser, let me tell you my scenario.<br>Once there was a guy who banged into me(Technically it was both banging at the same time). And he scolded vulgarities and after that said, "You better watch out". Cool, And what did he do? Seriously if you wanna beat this guy up, you should keep the thinking to yourself and not PROCLAIM it loudly like putting on your BLOG. And he did, and woohooo i printed it down and showed to the school tommorow AFTER he confronted me in school. Cool, At this point i feel that Im utterly the most despicable asshole EVER.<br><br>I went to pretend to the teacher and said that i was feeling traumatized from the experience and i feel that my school life would be affected badly. I feel that i am in danger, I am being COMPROMISED. Cool?<br><br>What happened in the end? As he SCOLDED vulgarities, HE CONFRONTED ME. Hey he even took out a weapon, i bring him to police station. GG. But he did'nt beat me. What was the verdict?<br>Thereotically i was at fault as i banged him as well and quarrelled. But in the end, i was told that i should be careful next time by the OM, and they will try to protect me. And him? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Punishment, Severely.<br><br>My whole point is, If they wanna scold you. Hey? Let them scold, best is you take tape recorder then you record everything they say. Wa lao, then you purposedly go make it big, go tell your teacher or something. EVEN if its outside, as long as they are PEOPLE from the school, They'll get something back <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">.<br><br>Or rather, if they wanna beat you. I teach you a way, tell them this (Works best if you have insurance). "Eh you want to beat me right, You think carefully la hor. If you are rich i dont mind . If you aren't , seriously you break my finger break my arm hor . Every part of my body is INSURED, so you can try, You'll just be POORER".<br><br>But of course, you must see the scenario also. If you wanna fight, Sure of course can. But please, Fight for a bigger purpose.</div>
