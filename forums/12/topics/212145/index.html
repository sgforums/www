Ignorance is bliss.<br><br>Kids... its understandable they behave rather "big" at times. Think back when we (the elder ones) were their age... 14, 15, 16+++. How would we behave when we were dat young? I noe I be "humji" like TS and avoid trouble. There may be some of us who once behaved similar to dat.<br><br>Y? Peer pressure? Sense of belonging? Feel like being hero/heroine? Impressive?<br><br>I sympathize with these youngsters coz they could not get the love or sense of belonging in their family or good frens, so they behave liddat, mix with bad influences juz to attract attention. All they ask was for someone to listen to them and understand how they feel, but... not all families or frens or teachers can provide that...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>it takes more guts to resist a fight than to really fighting it...<br><br>and i agree...if u want to kan them...fcuk them...u can do it all u want when your gf is not with u...cos your gf's safety is the utmost importance...<br><br>do not feel that u are a wuss just because u didn't stand up for her...try to think her safety is the most important...if u confronted them...there will be a chance that she would get hurt in the scuffle..u wouldn't want her to get hurt isn't it?<br><br>alternative...if u really buay tahan...talk to her...ask her if she wants u to confront her...then if u think u have to confront them...or she ask u to...then ask her to alight at the next station...then u have a "talk" with them...<br><br>but always try to avoid it la...sometimes it might turn out to be a endless downward spiral....</div>
