            <div class='col-md body'>Look, one guy after another, they came and go from my life. After i managed to forget about this guy A, which I fell in love but he neevr accepted me at all, I started to befriend this guy B and started to go out with him a few times.<br><br>Yes he's a model, yes he's handsome, but as time goes by i feel it's not just his looks that attracted me. When I was down, he came to accompany me. He treats me nice when we go out, but sumtimes i wonder he just treats me like a little sister. He broke up with his gf recently so when I confessed to him and he did not give me a reply, I wonder if he is just giving second thoughts, coz he may not feel very secure coz of his broken family. But then, sumtimes I feel that he's too lazy, stingy, and he doesn't take the initiative to msg me. And he acts suspiciously whenever looking at msges on his handphone in my presence. I feel that I have done a lot for him without receiving any reciprocation.<br><br>Then recently, this guy C came into my life and he's so funny and a great person to talk to. We never run out of topics to talk about, and he's also a really nice person. We chat everyday till 2 to 3 am before we both sleep and continuing SMS-ing each other. But he's like so damn tall, I feel like a dwarf beside him. He is an indonesian chinese, and an aspiring pilot. It means he has a bright future. This is important for me coz I have an illness and I want sumone who is financially stable enough in future to take care of me you see. But he still dunno about my condition.<br><br>I'm so confused. Despite Guy B's weaknesses that I see which overpowers his strengths, my heart still feels more for him. Perhaps it's the time that we got along tt made me see the lousier side of him. I'm scared of falling for the wrong person. I do not want to be seen as a two-timer. I want to dedicate all my feelings to only one person, but i do not know hu. Recently guy B has been nicer and gives me an occasional call or a sweet msg. Though I want to forget him thinkin that he may not be the right choice for me, I still yearn for him deeply. Should I try to "like" Guy C more? I know this sounds wierd....but I juz wanna make the right choice.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Why should you try to like anyone more?<br><br>Let your heart do the thinking in affairs of Love, and your head comes in only when you're looking for a husband/long term relationship.<br><br>It seems like you really want to be in a relationship. Although that is not a bad thing, maybe you should wait things out a bit, and see how the situation goes. Waiting and watching can help more than rushing headfirst, especially in areas where affairs of the heart are concerned.<br><br>You don't have to like B more, nor like C more.

In the end.. both you will not choose.. or you wont even get both.. Are you sure you are ready for a r/s?? Or you jus wanna find someone who you can depend on becos of your illness.. or your loneliness?? If one really loves who you are.. it doesn't matter whether you are ill or not.. Its the heart that counts.. the sincerity..<br><br>You aren't two-timing.. as you haven't even got into any r/s with either one of them.. Be rational and think about.. YOu are too soft-hearted.. Every guy that comes into your life.. you fell for them.. jus be cos they showered a little concern and care for you.. Are you sure this is what you call love??<br><br>Firstly you must ask yourself.. Why do you wan to get into a r/s??<br><br>Cheers..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

A man who looks good and your heart feels more for him, against one who can communicate well and has a decent future in which your security is there to grasp - Romance VS Social Reality.<br><br>What's it about making a wrong choice? In fact, we will never know if it was the right choice until the relationship ends for any reason. (Break up or death). You make your pick, <strong>on considering WHAT do you want in a man</strong>. If you are driven purely by emotions, likely, you would pick B without much hestitation because he is the man that you are emotionally vulnerable to. But the problem is... does he share the same intense liking? Or is it just a thinking on your part?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> C is a valid choice if he has interest in you and likely, he has.<br><br>You see, woman often display passive nature in The Chase (worst if it is Cancer, Scorpio or Pisces), because of the natural psyche formation of being a woman. If you rather stall and wait for either one to take initiative and win you, this movement is cause purely by the effect of karma. If you already strengthen yourself and decide for your choice on who you want, it's a different thing altogether. Free will is exercised and you wouldn't be blaming anyone for making a choice you may regret in the future.<br><br>P.S: No choice is a wrong choice - we shape our preception.

DON'T try to like him. be decisive. if u like him, means u like him. and vice versa~ yes, he have a bright future ahead for him and any fortunate lady who becomes his wife is indeed a blessing.<br><br>just my 5 cents worth of thots, hope tat u won't be offended by any of my comments. im not offering u any suggestions, because, "u live your own life". we can't make decisions for u to choose how u wan ur life to be. remember this "we can only open paths of options for u, and not bringing u in"<br><br>`follow your heart`</div>
