              <p>Hi all, I reside in chai Chee area and I've been staying here for 2-3yrs. Every weekend, both Saturday and Sunday, between 10-1pm, there will be a group of Malays practicing their drummings with many other instruments and singing along too. It has been happening for years without fail every week. I've tried to be tolerant for as long as I could alrdy but it is getting out of hand and I've just given birth and the noise every weekend is unbearable and stressful. I've tried complaining to Town council but as they practices only on weekends, the officers in change are aways not around. When I call back on weekdays, they say they r looking into the matter and all. But it's been months since I've made a report and nothing has been done. Today, they played for 3hrs straight with singing and all. I stay on the 3rd floor and its really agonizing. My child gets really cranky and cries non stop every week at this time. I'm really at my wits end. Town council says they are from an RC, practicing for their performances. Seriously, don't they have a designated place to do their practices? Why choose the void decks? Oh, and also, the teacher of the group stays on the 2nd floor. Seen him around many times. Whatever it is, there s no excuse to do this every single week. Amy Cheong's issue was due to one week of noise and she lost it. The residents around chai chee has been living with this for years and every single week! Please help me. I'm really going bonkers. As much as I respect them and what they r doing, it is really very very incorrect to do this for years and years to come. Please advise me someone. </p>

              <p>you live there for 2 - 3 years, were they there before you moved in? may be that is the reason why the previous owner sold the flat to you.</p>
              <p>what about those who have been living there for years, on the 2nd floor, the 3rd floor, 4th floor? all have the same problem?</p>
              <p>You should find out first with all the details before you decide what actions you can take. Otherwise you get rid of the drummers, come the lion dancers, otherwise there are the funneral wakes and the weddings. These are what void decks are for.</p>

              <p>Town council called me up this morning. They told me they have been trying to find a place for this group of malays. They are said to be their own private club, which is in no way connected to any RC or CC as previously mistaken. </p>
              <p>Summerhill: They are dressed every saturday and sunday, as if to attend a wedding to perform or something. And according to the Town Council, they are usually there to practice their kompangs and all before heading to wherever they are suppose to be, like a malay wedding or performances. And I secretly think they earn big bucks cos they r there EVERY WEEK! </p>
              <p>Town Council said there has been a few complains, even the MP is aware of it. And Town Council officers did go down on numerous occasions to speak to the man(teacher) who lives on the 2nd floor, but he would always say ok and that they'll stop, but the following week, the vicious cycle continues. Town Council mentioned they did try to get a room for them, had one, but they refused to move there for their practices because they would need to pay rental. </p>
              <p>I only moved in 2-3 yrs ago with my husband. He didn't do anything about it previously because he has grown accustomed to the noise. But I'm not. And never will be. Why should I?! Why should any of us?! Weddings underneath the void decks are not that bad. It only happens like once in many months. This, happens every weekends! It's totally unacceptable. </p>

              <p>They can't do it? But they've done it successfully these 2-3 yrs already. :p Sometimes, they would move to somewhere else, like the basketball court that is right in front of the block. No difference at all as the sound travels blocks away. </p>

              <p>Oo. Becuz it's quite disturbing if they do at void deck.if they wanna do, they hav to do softly. Or either go to a park if they wanna play louder. Maybe doing so at a void deck every alternate week is better and more considerate.</p>

              <p>No, they don't go to the park and no, not even on alternate weekends because it's still not right to do their practices in public like that. And it seems like a permanent thing given that it's already been years. </p>

              <p>Town council called me up this morning. They told me they have
              been trying to find a place for this group of malays. They are said
              to be their own private club, which is in no way connected to any
              RC or CC as previously mistaken. </p>
              <p>Summerhill: They are dressed every saturday and sunday, as if to
              attend a wedding to perform or something. And according to the Town
              Council, they are usually there to practice their kompangs and all
              before heading to wherever they are suppose to be, like a malay
              wedding or performances. And I secretly think they earn big bucks
              cos they r there EVERY WEEK! </p>
              <p>Town Council said there has been a few complains, even the MP is
              aware of it. And Town Council officers did go down on numerous
              occasions to speak to the man(teacher) who lives on the 2nd floor,
              but he would always say ok and that they'll stop, but the following
              week, the vicious cycle continues. Town Council mentioned they did
              try to get a room for them, had one, but they refused to move there
              for their practices because they would need to pay
              rental. </p>
              <p>I only moved in 2-3 yrs ago with my husband. He didn't do
              anything about it previously because he has grown accustomed to the
              noise. But I'm not. And never will be. Why should I?! Why should
              any of us?! Weddings underneath the void decks are not that bad. It
              only happens like once in many months. This, happens every
              weekends! It's totally unacceptable. </p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Musicians earn very little and income is often unstable, unless they are some big-shot musicians. So what if they are there every week? It is not everyday they get to perform and people usually pay less than $300 for such performances and it have to be split among to group, thus it will not benefit them to pay rental. </p>
              <p>I think the best solution for you is to take the baby out for walks on that time lah. For 3 hours only, bring your kid to Macdonals to enjoy the air-con and maybe buy him some happy meal. <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="icon_cool.gif"> </p>

                              <p>Hi all, I reside in chai Chee area and I've been staying here
              for 2-3yrs. Every weekend, both Saturday and Sunday, between
              10-1pm, there will be a group of Malays practicing their drummings
              with many other instruments and singing along too. It has been
              happening for years without fail every week. I've tried to be
              tolerant for as long as I could alrdy but it is getting out of hand
              and I've just given birth and the noise every weekend is unbearable
              and stressful. I've tried complaining to Town council but as they
              practices only on weekends, the officers in change are aways not
              around. When I call back on weekdays, they say they r looking into
              the matter and all. But it's been months since I've made a report
              and nothing has been done. Today, they played for 3hrs straight
              with singing and all. I stay on the 3rd floor and its really
              agonizing. My child gets really cranky and cries non stop every
              week at this time. I'm really at my wits end. Town council says
              they are from an RC, practicing for their performances. Seriously,
              don't they have a designated place to do their practices? Why
              choose the void decks? Oh, and also, the teacher of the group stays
              on the 2nd floor. Seen him around many times. Whatever it is, there
              s no excuse to do this every single week. Amy Cheong's issue was
              due to one week of noise and she lost it. The residents around
              chai chee has been living with this for years and every single
              week! Please help me. I'm really going bonkers. As much as I
              respect them and what they r doing, it is really very very
              incorrect to do this for years and years to come. Please advise me
              someone. </p>

              Hi, which part of Chai Chee do you stay in?
              
              I stay at Chai Chee too and I can attest to the noise level that has been going on for the past few years. The Town Council is not effective in ensuring the Chai Chee estate is conducive for rest nor for folks who need to study and work from home. The Bedok South Police Post is not effective as well in controlling the rowdy behaviors that have been happening in the wee hours of every other morning at the void deck.
              
              On top of that, this estate is often dirty and it just looks so old and unkempt.
              
              My only advice is to move out of this slum area asap.

              <p>Hi Melistar, </p>
              <p>       Tell me about it...i am on the 2nd floor, right above the void deck...its now been four years + since i moved here...like u, i had been there when my boy was five months i went thru such agony. he was a cholic baby some more. no sleep for the baby means no sleep for mommy as well. </p>
              <p>In fact i just googled this topic today, after all the agony last nite, due to a celebration that went on until 12.00pm. in fact they dint stop with just that, after 12, they were dragging the chairs and stacking them with such loud noise, i am back to office with a migraine. I was afraid to go down and tell them anything, coz it might be taken in a different perspective- like racial concerns etc. And somemore I have given up writing to the town council coz they will ask us to be tolerant. My tolerance has worn out....if the open hall is free by any chance, there are these people who drink there and make cluttering noises with beer tins and bottles.Only God knows what permanent solution can i hope for....but worst case, i ll have to move out of there. and in Sg, finding a new place is not a easy peice of meal..thats more tormenting!!Yes like u Melistar...i too feel like doing stupid things, when I can't take the noise levels!!</p>

              <p>Hi to all who had noises at their void deck,</p>
              <p>I had chinese uncles in the morning cow peh cow bu abt their sore lives and mats at nite playing guitar, singing terribly. I've also complained to stat boards and even call the police, but they just say they will look into the matter. So this had been going on for the past 4 yrs ever since I moved in.</p>
              <p>But strangley, I noticed those thugs who had been making noise had mellowed down abt a fex months ago. The reason I think is because I went gym since 2012 and I had gained 20 kgs of mass. Now when I go downstairs and stare at those old chinses(I chinese also so dun call me racist) thugs, flex my arm abit, they will know who not to mess with. So less noise from them.</p>
              <p>For the young mats, I go to bed at 10 pm sharp and according to my mum, I snore like a pig. You know mats hates pigs rite, so they stop singing after they hear my snoring.</p>
              <p>So guys, end of the day try to get a bodybuilder like me who can show some muscle or snore like a pig to stay at your block. Better than call police.</p>
