I confronted a few muslim friends who told me the same thing . he said that mostly JC students are the ppl who likes to backstab people. It must be something wrong about singapore's education system. How many times have u seen people giving up their seats for pregnant womans or they simply close their eyes and pretend to sleep. The society is turning to where oneday, when u are raped on the streets and people just run away. the day will come. I got some feedback from similar forums that says even they ignore them they will still be pulled into the troubled waters, so what does this proves of the mindset of singaporeans? especially the selfish and cunning chinese.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmm I do behave differently in different environment with different people. I don't do it on purpose, it just happens. Like if I am happy or if I am stress. of course I behave differently. And yes its common to talk about people behind their back but if its really how you feel does that counts as backstab?</div>

Countries will be attacking each other everyday. Alliances will be broken. You won't even trust your own parents then.

I guess the talk now goes a bit out of point. Sometimes, I feel it is rather sad thing for singaporeans to be killing one another and making use of them and chucking them away when not needed. I got one JC colleague who once good friend before, we go out and I accompany him when ever he is sick and try to get help whenever possible. But now guess what? he betrayed me, he talk something bad about the guy but still be good friend of him and in the end I lose out.
