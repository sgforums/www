You are being controlled by her and is not a good thing. It's like having sex and she's taking the lead. You confessed your feelings to her and *pop* you end up hurting yourself. Now the best thing u could do is to "act" busy when she calls you or sms you. Whenever you are on the phone with her, pretend that you got something to do and have to put her down. ignore her for a week or so. make her miss you. dont call her on valentines day, see if she calls you. </div></blockquote>well, thanx for ur advise dude,  i have already moved on and stopped calling her. Instead, sometimes she calls me occasionally and jokingly asked y am i nt calling her and she always the one making those calls? Though i still answer her calls, but tats mainly because i do not want things to turn ugly in the sense that i still believe in our friendship n do not want to aggravate it but tat does not mean she can take me for granted and gains attention from me whenever she wants to. I still have my pride and shall not be an idiot clinging n waiting for her...</div>
