            <div class='col-md body'>haha...hey i think so too, "needles".  i guess i was blinded by my affection her then. I failed to understand her well and ended up hurting myself. Actually she's pretty good as a frenz lar. Just that she's just too attention seeking ( she herself admits so) and probably too selfish, do you guys think so? well, i tried not to have any negative feelings about her intially because it would seem i'm being petty after rejection, but somehow, i began to analyse the situation and realise perhaps i have been made used by her whenever she needs attention  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

What opinions do you wish to know.. i believe you already have the answers yourself.. but you jus wanna make sure whether you're making the right move anot.. I will suggest that you both stay as friends better than as an item...<br><br>She knows how you feel towards her.. To say it bluntly.. she's taking you for granted.. She likes to be in the centre of attraction of everyone.. That includes you too! She likes being loved by people.. and get all the care and concerns from people too.. Like what you mentioned.. she's a attention seeker.. what is the reason of her refusing to tell anyone about her relationship?? Is it really that awful or bad?? If she were to be with you.. would you also experience such things too.. Since you know how she's like.. If you really wanna be with her.. you have to withstand her doings.. llike what she did to her bf... and to you..<br><br>Stay as friends would be the best choice for you both.. They only look for you for a reason.. cos she knows that you definitely will not reject her in any ways.. Cos reason simple..

I failed to understand her well and ended up hurting myself. Actually she's pretty good as a frenz lar. Just that she's just too attention seeking ( she herself admits so) and probably too selfish, do you guys think so? well, i tried not to have any negative feelings about her intially because it would seem i'm being petty after rejection, but somehow, i began to analyse the situation and realise perhaps i have been made used by her whenever she needs attention  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> </div></blockquote>Friend is good.

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanx for the advice guys <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> in fact, i have already started to move on though we r still remaining as close friends. I tried not to let my negative feelings abt her affect our friendship. I can understand why she's opening her options Afterall, she wants to be fair to hereself but on  the expense of others. Anyway, i think its kinda contradicting or maybe ironic that to let her know that i'm still ard as a frenz and she can always look for me when she has problems but i dun wanna give her the attention i used to in the past. Just wondering if i'm narrow minded in this matter.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My advise to you is just move on in life and find a new chick. You are being controlled by her and is not a good thing. It's like having sex and she's taking the lead. You confessed your feelings to her and *pop* you end up hurting yourself. Now the best thing u could do is to "act" busy when she calls you or sms you. Whenever you are on the phone with her, pretend that you got something to do and have to put her down. ignore her for a week or so. make her miss you. dont call her on valentines day, see if she calls you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hey joai,<br><br>i'm in the same predicament as you.<br><br>the only difference is that i'm still hanging on. hanging on a very slim hope that she may one day accept me.<br><br>i know that i should not be a 3rd party. however, she told me that her bf treated her like dirt. she even said that we can be together provided both of us are single.<br><br>i tried my best to treat her good. cheer her up when she is sad. do silly things. i even broke up with my gf. everytime i chat with her, my face is smiling, but my heart is bleeding.<br><br>but up till today...haiz<br><br>i know i am silly. i even told myself not to wait for her anymore. haha. juz kidding myself.<br><br>so cheer up la. at least u saw light already</div>
