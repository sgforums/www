            <div class='col-md body'>In response to walesa's qn: What are the "weird" characteristics that you have since observed?<br><br>Well,he's getting a little bit "touchy"(NOT the molesting kind la. ha)with me lately. Firstly,remember the mosquito bite? That was the 3rd time he touched me <strong>lightly</strong>. The 1st time was when i was ordering food to eat and he was just standing behind me. We were sharing the food and he let me choose the toppings. Before i started ordering,he used his finger to tap my shoulder and told me to choose the toppings. The 2nd time was touching my  hand(the one with mosquito bite) too,to ask me to look at something. And when i asked for a tissue from him,he had to fold it nicely before giving me. I told him to jus give it to me w/o folding and my other friend(who was with us) joked that the guy in question wanted to wipe my mouth for me. This was meant as a joke,but the guy then "played along" and tried to wipe for me. BUT i didnt let him do so la. It's so embarrassing.<br><br>And the other time he touched me was when i was doing my work silently,he walked past me and used his finger to touch my hair and muttered some crap which totally made me O.o???<br><br>Anyway,thanks for everyone's prompt replies. I think i jus have to wait and see if he will really keep his promise to celebrate our bdays together.<br></div>

Firstly,remember the mosquito bite? That was the 3rd time he touched me [b]lightly</strong>. The 1st time was when i was ordering food to eat and he was just standing behind me. We were sharing the food and he let me choose the toppings. Before i started ordering,he used his finger to tap my shoulder and told me to choose the toppings. The 2nd time was touching my  hand(the one with mosquito bite) too,to ask me to look at something. And when i asked for a tissue from him,he had to fold it nicely before giving me. I told him to jus give it to me w/o folding and my other friend(who was with us) joked that the guy in question wanted to wipe my mouth for me. This was meant as a joke,but the guy then "played along" and tried to wipe for me. BUT i didnt let him do so la. It's so embarrassing.<br><br>And the other time he touched me was when i was doing my work silently,he walked past me and used his finger to touch my hair and muttered some crap which totally made me O.o???<br><br>Anyway,thanks for everyone's prompt replies. I think i jus have to wait and see if he will really keep his promise to celebrate our bdays together.<br>[/b]</blockquote>Personally, I'd say the third touching incident differs from the first two a little (the first one could mean little, especially if he had been standing behind you - I mean, it can be normal human reaction to tap on someone gently to attract his/her attention?) and perhaps says something?<br><br>But as some others have mentioned, perhaps he's shy and you could certainly get the answer you want more easily by being more proactive in the approach(ie.take the initiative and lead him on to reveal his true intentions instead of waiting passively for him to do something)?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
