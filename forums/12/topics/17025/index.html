            <div class='col-md body'>Celestine, it all lies with how she set her priorities. Seems like she has chosen BF to you. Either u 4give her &amp; let her be like that for the time being, or u can choose to give up this friendship. The 1st option needs time for you, 1 day she will understand the importance of friends.<br><br>Frankly speaking, I used to be like that when I have my 1st relationship. But then my gf 4give me (she is really sad &amp; angry) &amp; thru several barriers, out friendship is better &amp; we understand each other better more now.<br><br>Celestine no matter what, a 2nd chance is always needed. Dun feel sad/angry 1st. Treat her wif an open mind &amp; heart.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
