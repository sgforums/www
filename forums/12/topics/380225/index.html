              <p>your choice..</p>
              <p>if you choose to do the year again, take this month or so to do some analysing on where you messed up.. talk to counsellers if you have to.. check your study technique and your time management...</p>
              <p>if you choose to go to the polytechnic, it's a whole new ballgame.. you are not spoonfed so much as the JCs.. you are expected to do a lot of things yourself as you are considered a "tertiary student" and not a secondary student... and also see above.. analyse what you did wrongly..</p>
              <p>whatever it is, stay in school..</p>
              <p>this could be a wake-up call which you get a second chance at.. in life, you rarely get such a chance... grab it.. and don't bother about "seeing your peers" and all that shit.. that's trivial compared to your education...</p>

              <p>Do u enjoy and think u can cope well in the JC environment? If u do not like it or can't manage it well, no point retaking another year. Poly is a totally different environment. Alot less stress but it does requires abit more pushing on ur own since the lecturers won't push u that much but most poly students are able to cope well and still have a very enjoyable poly life.</p>

              <p>Hi Chipperboy,</p>
              <p>The first thing you should ask yourself is that whether you are coping with JC syllabus or not. If you find that such a learning environment is not suitable for you, you may want to switch over to a poly instead.</p>
              <p>Going to a poly need not be a bad thing, as you can read from my post on this thread:</p>

              <p>I got a junior who went to JC, failed his promos, retained another yr and still failed. After that he gave up on JC, went to poly and hes doing great there, final year and his GPA is gives him a very good chance of local uni.</p>
              <p>Its a case of whether you can really find something that suits ur way of studying. I've known a number of cases of ppl who quit JC after 1 yr and they excel in poly where the environment is more suited to their style of learning.</p>

              <p>Repeating one year in your Junior College will help to remind yourself NEVER to surrender to all the distractions in your life again</p>
              <p>It's a small setback and sacrifice you had to pay to learn how to become more focused towards your dream in your future.</p>

              <p>I got a junior who went to JC, failed his promos, retained
              another yr and still failed. After that he gave up on JC, went to
              poly and hes doing great there, final year and his GPA is gives him
              a very good chance of local uni.</p>
              <p>Its a case of whether you can really find something that suits
              ur way of studying. I've known a number of cases of ppl who quit JC
              after 1 yr and they excel in poly where the environment is more
              suited to their style of learning.</p>

              <p>Are you joking? He did not manage to even get through for the second round...</p>
              <p>I heard that schools would most probably give these sort of students a second chance via re-examination or straight promote (close one eye)</p>
