Normally this problem occur in people who doesn't have much picture of their future and what they want to do with them.<br><br>To lead a more meaningful life - try do something you wouldn't do normally (like volunteering for example), or take up classes, hobbies, etc. You need to expand your mind, your social circle and basically yourself. Things can't come to you being interesting forever; its you who keep the things interesting.<br><br>P.S: Are you Aries, Cancer, Libra or Capricorn? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>

She has suggested a break up with me recently but i just could not let it go so we patch things up again. I am a slightly overweight guy where i can say i am not good looking at all. But cos i used to be from a rich family, i have that extra confidence in myself, thinking that i am better than most of the people around me. Naturally, i always feel i deserve someone better than my gf or leading a better life than now. I only completed my O levels but the business venture i am handling for my dad allows me to earn many times the income i will get for a job based on my qualifications.

            <div class='col-md body'>I am a late starter in life. I dun start falling in love, have no ideas what jeans are like and what an ATM card is under i turn 21. I live a sheltered life for most of my life until when the economic crisis hit us then i have to learn to do many things myself. I cant even get around my neighbourhood taking public transport cos i will lose my way. Not even MRT. I tried loving someone with all my heart but it did not work out and the ones besides me are not the one i really want.<br>The last 3 years i was leading a life of hell. I was not able to fend by myself and get a job and have to get by doing temp jobs. Its only now that my income is more stable and learnt that being normal is a blessing too but i still feel its not enough. Maybe i am just finding someone here to confide in so please do not avoid me if possible. Thanks.</div>

Sagi! why didn't I thought of that - nothing could interest you forever.<br><br>Ok, lets be serious for once. Your gf of 3 years didn't understand you BECAUSE you didn't allow her a chance to. You didn't see what your flaws and limitation are because like what you said, you led a sheltered life. Everything is spoonfed and given like it was the norm.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Reality sunk in and you realise that you can't live like that forever. Your shyness is because your EQ wasn't properly developed during your younger days. You felt that you didn't need to because like your material possession - it should come naturally to you. Of course, it's a great mistake and wrong preception. What deserve someone better than your gf and better life?
