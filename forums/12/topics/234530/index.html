            <div class='col-md body'>Alright, this isnt really my problem, since I am already done and over with my studies... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>But anyway I am teaching now, and one of my students have been doing poorly in his studies. I have given my class 2 exams so far, and he has failed both of them. I asked him to resit the test, but he refused. After that he started missing his classes and when I called him to ask why, he said he has a lot of other things to do.<br><br>I told my manager about this and he contacted his parents, who in turn contacted me just now to tell me about his situation. Basically he feels like giving up in his lessons and feel that he will never pass the exams. And his parents said that he has been mixing with the wrong type of friends who told him that education is not important, since a lot of uneducated people also can make it big nowadays...<br><br>Now the parents want me to encourage him and talk to him so that his interest in his studies will be renewed  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> He has been forced to come for his lesson tonight and I guess I have to talk to him about this...but I do not know how to encourage him (I have done that before, but don't think it is really that successful).<br><br>Any ideas?</div>

I have given my class 2 exams so far, and he has failed both of them. I asked him to resit the test, but he refused. After that he started missing his classes and when I called him to ask why, he said he has a lot of other things to do.<br><br>I told my manager about this and he contacted his parents, who in turn contacted me just now to tell me about his situation. Basically he feels like giving up in his lessons and feel that he will never pass the exams. And his parents said that he has been mixing with the wrong type of friends who told him that education is not important, since a lot of uneducated people also can make it big nowadays...<br><br>Now the parents want me to encourage him and talk to him so that his interest in his studies will be renewed  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> He has been forced to come for his lesson tonight and I guess I have to talk to him about this...but I do not know how to encourage him (I have done that before, but don't think it is really that successful).<br><br>Any ideas?</div></blockquote>Tell him that INDEED some people managed to make it BIG without much or any cert... But NOT everybody can do that.... Without the cert, if he can't make it BIG through the 'shortcuts' in life, he'll have NOTHING... With the cert, at least he still can DO much even if the 'shortcut' doesn't work... It's like buying an insurance and backup....? And if he doesn't get his cert now, in the future it'll be TOO LATE to REGRET.... There're 2 TYPES of people who 'supposingly' can have a chance to 'make it BIG'... Tell him he can go ASK THEM PERSONALLY... One type is those BIG BOSSES (he might not be able to get too near them)..... The OTHER TYPE is QUITE EASY to talk to... Those ah peks working in coffeeshops... Washing toilets and sleeping on the road... Those type he can go ask for 'advices'....<br><br>And ask him this final question... If he can't even complete a diploma.. What are the chances that he can 'make it BIG' in this complicated wrold out there...?<br><br>Also, maybe he's just lacking in confidence to face his studies... BOOT him UP on that PLEASE!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> Tell him AT LEAST he TRY... There'll still be a CHANCE... CHANCE is what people GIVE TO THEMSELVES and OPPOTUNITIES what they GRAB... End of the day if he couldn't be bothered... You'll still be a teacher, but his future is in HIS OWN HANDS....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>be patient, wait, dun put him down.. help him with his notes abit. dats about it. i think u can't do anything much. teachers and students have that barrier that is impossible to dissolve overnight, if ever at all, and its there for a reason. if necessary, fail him.<br><br>i juz wanna say, if somehow he decides to buck up and put in effort, maybe after failing, give him another chance, if you can.</div>
