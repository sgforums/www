            <div class='col-md body'>well i guess the problem now lies with the student mentality and not with you. your student has given up and only he himself can realise and start over again. you may buy him a house or a car to study but these incentives are only temporary and it might not even motivate him to study. perhaps you should try to frighten him with facts of life. such as not all uneducated people make it big. and don't forget if you don't have talent and you're uneducated, how different are you from those roadside sweepers.<br><br>and what is his mother doing? all talk no action and expects you to work a miracle out and get his son to score in english.<br><br>well just another few of my suggestions..<br><br>i feel 3 hours is just simply too long for any student to concentrate. i don't really know how your teaching system goes but do give them breaks every now and then. but not too long.<br><br>get his mother to motivate him by saying if he scores a certain grade in english the mother gets him something he likes? or perhaps a dinner treat? you only get to spend those few hours with the boy in school. the mother spends the rest of the boy's time at home.<br><br>btw does this boy hand up his homework and all? if he does try to encourage him by saying keep it up and all. hope this helps  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
