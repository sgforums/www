You can try bring the horse to water but you can't make it drink. Firstly, the teacher and student has problem communicating. Secondly, the student has decided that it is not worth his time to continue in this course but missing out on lessons. Lastly, there isn't enough time to deal with his linguistic disability as well as his lack of studies.</div></blockquote>We all think she hit the limits, but only she herself know very well where is the limit. If the student is really bent on giving up, then the family and upper heads should know it too, but still shouldn't give up, for the student may some day be back? In any case, that's all can be done on Rainee's part, but being patient still is possible.</div>

Find some time alone to talk to him about it. Tell him you wanna train his guts because its important in his life.</div>
