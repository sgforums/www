              <p><br>your obstacles are the guys and girls friends. have them out of teh way. this lady your colleagues where you know here. shouldn't be too difficult to have a time alone wiht her noone around and pick up conversation? trust me sometimes it is better not to have to manyyof the 'friends; in teh way. leran to hunt alone. you should build up your finaancial stability. any wise later to be a wife knows this is important factor. if you have a decent car for transport moving aourd is good. but only if you can afford it - you know yourself. otehrsiwe you can forget about girls who only thinks about cars - they lazy to walk.</p>

              <p><br>I drive a very lousy old toyota car. The car was a 1990s model.</p>
              <p>It is not the difficulty of having time alone with her. In fact I can imagine if I can be aggressive. But the world doesn't work like this. I have seen a friend at school used to be very aggressive and desperate. He wanted to go after the most pretty and popular girl at school, only to be taught a big lesson. Know what? Fact is she didn't like him at all so she chose the most undesirable girl at school to go harass him every day. He was forced to date that girl. I could the misery in his face.</p>
              <p>I think first move is to show your sincerity in making friends. So trick is, is to try to make my conversation more formal, friendly and short. THis is to make her at ease. Maybe one short 5 min small talk can give a big future impression. If she is interested to talk to me in the next round we meet again, she probably come over and chat. If not, then I suppose I didn't make that much of an impression, move on. So, thank goodness, I didn't offend anyone or make anyone think that I am up to no good.</p>
              <p>About waiting to build one's own security, I think one should not wait until one is established because by then, one doesn't have the time to seek relationship. I have known a guy who is rich, have career, live in his own million dollar condo and drives a merc, yet he is single because he is too busy with his work.</p>

              <p><br>Yes just small talk and make it short.</p>
              <p>Let me tell you a funny story. One night after a meeting at a friend's house, we bunch of people decided to go to a restaurant to eat. So at first one of them told us to go this restaurant. Because i was new to the gang, I didn't want to hang around to talk at the house, I jumped into my car and went straight to the restaurant. There's one girl, she's only 25, but really beautiful and has long hair. She also has her own car (thanks to her rich dad) and she went straight to the destination. The others decided to car pool.</p>
              <p>By the time I reached the restaurant, she also reached it the same time. So we both went in and waited for some time. I had a small chat with her. I thought this was bizarre, me sitting with that beautiful and awesome looking girl. Then after 30 minutes, nobody turned up. She was beginning to show concern and worry. I inform her that maybe we got the wrong place? So she decided to call the rest of them and ask them where they went.</p>
              <p>It turns out that the rest of the gang decided to change the venue of the restaurant to another place (nearby), they all thought me and her left home early. She ask them to quickly come to this restaurant because she and I were there.</p>
              <p>Then in 15 minutes they all came and joined us. I can see she was quite uncomfortable sitting opposite of me for 45 minutes so when she saw her friends came, she was so relieved.</p>
              <p>At the end when we finished our meals, she said goodbye to everybody, except me. Was that a deliberately done to ignore me? I have no idea.</p>
              <p>Then as I backed out my car, I accidentaly blocked her car which was on the way out. So I moved back my car into the parking place and make way for her. She panicked and her car accidentaly collided with the curb causing some scratches to her bumper. I decided to come out and try to help her to align her car. But she drove off so quickly before I could do anything.</p>
              <p>So this was bizarre but to say the least, I was innocent ! I think I was set up. It wasn't really my fault. I didn't delibrately end up with her one to one.</p>
              <p>Gulp, I hope she doesn't think i am a desperado.  </p>

              <p>Sometimes I think talking to ladies is something mysterious.</p>
              <p>Me as a guy, I totally don't understand. SOme guys may just say that it is plain rude and some just totally write it off.</p>
              <p>For instance:</p>
              <p>1) A lady send out an invitation to all of us to attend a function. I answered to say that I wasn't free because I had something else to do. The next week when we all went out for lunch in the weekend, she invited everybody to her place for swimming (her own pool - she is rich btw) and she deliberately ignored me. I just don't know how i offended her. Could women react on so trivial matters? or am i just being sensitive?</p>
              <p>2) Then the other day my boss instructed me to ask this lady about her work since she is manning a call centre. I could not understand the nature of the process so in order for me to do my work, I have to query her. Next thing i know, she got very black face at me. Then morning she came into office she greeted to everyone except me. She even invited everyone at her section for her brother's wedding except me. One weekend I decided to come to office to finish up some work. She was there too along with another co-worker. As i was coming into my cubicle, she couldn't see me so she thought only her and her colleague was at the office so she decided to gossip a bit. She was complaining about me always asking so many questions.</p>
              <p>Then after 20 minutes i decided to get up (from cubicle) to the phocopier machine and photostat somehting, she looked surprised to see me, and became worried. She even came over and ask me "how am I?"</p>
              <p>I felt a bit uncomfortable because she gossiped about me.</p>
              <p>Conclusion - i just don't understand women. Why they get so offended easily on trivial matters?</p>

              <p>No, I didn't do anything. I just try to be friendly that is all. When she ended up with me one to one in that restaurant, all I just did was to be as reserve as i can but at the same time open to conversation. Maybe i was too over-reserved.</p>

              <p><br> I drive a very lousy old toyota car. The car was a 1990s model.</p>
              <p>It is not the difficulty of having time alone with her. In fact
              I can imagine if I can be aggressive. But the world doesn't work
              like this. I have seen a friend at school used to be very
              aggressive and desperate. He wanted to go after the most pretty and
              popular girl at school, only to be taught a big lesson. Know what?
              Fact is she didn't like him at all so she chose the most
              undesirable girl at school to go harass him every day. He was
              forced to date that girl. I could the misery in his face.</p>
              <p>I think first move is to show your sincerity in making friends.
              So trick is, is to try to make my conversation more formal,
              friendly and short. THis is to make her at ease. Maybe one short 5
              min small talk can give a big future impression. If she is
              interested to talk to me in the next round we meet again, she
              probably come over and chat. If not, then I suppose I didn't make
              that much of an impression, move on. So, thank goodness, I didn't
              offend anyone or make anyone think that I am up to no good.</p>
              <p>About waiting to build one's own security, I think one
              should not wait until one is established because by then, one
              doesn't have the time to seek relationship. I have known a guy who
              is rich, have career, live in his own million dollar condo and
              drives a merc, yet he is single because he is too busy with his
              work.</p>

              <p>I recall last time when I was 22 years old and we were all in one social meeting. Then came this guy, he was 35 years old. All of us was around 22 to 25 years old. Nobody wanted to talk to the poor 35 year old guy. Then as we were having supper at a friend's house, I overhear two girls whispering, making fun of the 35 year old guy. He looked lost sitting at the sofa. After two to three meetings, he never came.</p>
              <p>So now I know how it feels like to him. I am the old man now, mixing with all the young people.</p>
              <p>Sometimes, some guy will come over and ask me what is my age and then ask me whether I am married or not. Then he will talk about all the pretty girls there. Make my face pale with embarassment. I just answer him I am in my 30s. Not sure if he was making fun of me. Next week I came back again and saw the same guy, he didn't bother to talk to me, he just kepo to ask my age. I mean, is it rude to ask somebody your age? Especially if you ask a woman her age? Same goes for guys right?</p>
              <p>It is not only the age factor. I am also having a lot of trouble understanding the opposite sex. When i was young, when I get close to some girls, some of them will go and play some jeolousy games. Like pretending to go out with some guys and make it openly known so she makes sure I know about it. I am not sure, if she was trying to repel me or make me pursue her.</p>
              <p>I have a question:</p>
              <p>1) Does courtship usually means two people falling in love? No need to chase, just friendship between a guy and a girl blossom to become a relationship?</p>
              <p>Or</p>
              <p>2) Does one actually have to chase a girl and play the "game"?</p>
              <p>I got a friend, he last time liked this girl a lot who work in a bank. So he pursued her, gave her presents/gifts and took her out to restaurant for 4 months. She just play hard to get. He called her a lot and text her a lot. She likes to play sms but she also liked to seduce my friend's other friends. She once, called me out of the blue and ask me to join her for a movie (one to one). I didn't want to join her because I knew my best friend was pursuing her at the time. Then came after 4 months of pursuit, she broke my friend's heart, when she accepted the engagement ring from another guy (a son of a biz man) who is much richer than my friend. Conclusion: Does a guy need to play the "game" to obtain his prize?</p>

              <p>All girls wanna be chased by guys. Even when they don't see u as a potential partner, they still like to be coaxed and chased. Unless the girl is very frank and honest, she won't say no to your "chasing" because it feels good and help boost their self-confidence. </p>
              <p>As a guy, your job is to sift out those who just wanna use u, and identify those who r genuinely interested in recipocrating ur love.</p>
              <p>Learn to let go, when u meet a "user". This is applicable to girls too. Don't blindly chase after the girl, that's probably what happened to your friend with a broken heart. </p>
              <p>When u hang out with a younger group, understand that younger guys may see u as a threat. When they act in offending manner, they are inwardly insecure. So really, the problem is not u, it's them and their insecurities. So, just shrug it off and enjoy the socializing. After all,they r all on the hunt for chicks, they gotta do what they can to level the playing field for themselves.</p>
              <p>When  a girl is ready to settle down, she'll look for a sense of stability,safety and security. If u can exude these kind of qualities, your chase is half done, all u need is chemistry and luck.<span style="-webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.296875);  "> </span></p>

              <p>I am 38 this year and still single. Reason being that i had a
              motorcycle accident when I was 27 and I needed a couple of ops
              to replace my hip and spinal corrections. As a result, I had to
              spend a long time at home to rehabilitate from my injuries. I
              didn't work for 4 years. Now I am back and working as usual but I
              notice everybody who is 27 to 29 is earning as much as I am
              earning, well maybe I earn a bit more. I notice all my friends are
              already married and have kids. I want to move on.</p>
              <p>Recently I met a 27 old lady and I find her
              attractive. I just want to know if someone who is 10 years younger
              than me would like a person like me. I am not rich but at least i
              have a car. I am kind of concern because there's a lot of younger
              guys than me and she may pick them out.</p>
              <p>I am a bit concern if I can settle down because age is catching
              up. I know I shouldn't feel the suspense but this is how it is when
              everybody is married and attached except me.</p>
              <p>I am a shy guy and don't like to make advances. I just want
              to know her better.</p>
              <p>1) So would it be logical for me to just make friends with
              her first? See her response </p>
              <p>2) Rather than make my move and ask her out?  </p>

              <p>I respectfully disagree. </p>
              <p>Here's why.</p>
              <p>When a man is in his 20s, he like woman in her 20s.</p>
              <p>When he becomes 30s, he like women in their 20s.</p>
              <p>When the man turns 40s, he like women in their 20s.</p>
              <p>When he age to 50s, he like women in their 20s.</p>
              <p>If u r really as smart as I think u are, u will understand why it's better to be with an older man. </p>
              <p>When a man stil loves u, he will give his life for u, but when he is done with u, he tell u pls go and die better.</p>
