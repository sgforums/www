              <p>But first of all, before trying, can you take the agony of defeat, lost and unable to get kind of feeling, because Love unlike work or stock or make up which is tangible, you lost or cannot make it, still can move on and try harder.</p>
              <p>For Love, it can hurt you emotionally for the rest of your life if you are not prepare for it.</p>
              <p>Before going into Love, ask yourself, are you really game for it, if not, do not mess with it, it can end up tragically for both parties. 27 for girl like us is not young, and 37 for a man is also certainly not young. already one leg inside the coffin</p>

              <p><br>In UK and Australia - retirement can go as far as 67. Who knows? Maybe some day Singapore will extend retirement to 70 because people are getting healthier. So you can still work like a dog and raise kids.</p>
              <p>I know one man who got married at 50. Then he got two sons. Now the son is 35. He is 85. Oh -recently he passed away. But gist of story is - he was a building contractor - so he found a way to raise his family at 50.</p>

              @jojobeach
              
              Another big WTF from you.  Your posts are so RIDICULOUS &amp; SENSELESS !! 
              	
              What is this irrelevant nonsense of girls fertility you are blabbering about? 
              
              Are you even a certified gynaecologist to make that kind of a statement?
              
              
              So you are implying that TS should only focus on young ladies since they are the ONLY ONES who can give birth ?!  What is going on in that head of yours?  You almost sound like a mamasan promoting a young girl brothel website !!
              
              30 plus then cannot give birth meh ? If Zoe Tay at 40 plus is still popping out kids, then why cant other women at their 30s?
              
                
              
              Do you know you are indirectly condemning women in their 30s with your posts ?
              
              The logic presented from your remarks is:  guys should target women only at their 20s, so women who are unattached at their 30s should be left on the shelf right?
              
              Goodness, are you even a woman for god's sake? 
              
              Whose side are you on ?!  I am really suspicious of your agenda here !!
              
              
              
              
              
              And where is your ludricous rationale that getting a pretty girlfriend will guarantee you a good looking kid?  If you look like shlt yourself, even your husband is Brad Pit or Tom Cruise, your kids wont end up any better either way !! 
              
              
              Whether my gf is ugly, fat or short, what business is it of yours ? My gf can be Fiona Xie, or can be Patricia Mok, So long as I like,  who are you to huan lor ?
              
              
              If there ain't so many male  jerks n cheaters in Sg, then SG women no need to be picky.  
              
              YA right, as if!   Just freaking admit sg girls are VAIN!  Sg women are picky even if it is a nice guy !! They find decent &amp; responsible guys dull and boring !
              
              
              
              Your comment just goes to depict how conceited of a person you are !!  Going for looks &amp; money.  Please do not put me on the same level as you ok ? Why should i fear about telling my children of what i told TS ? Children should be taught correct values and principles !!
              
              I certainly dont want my children to grow to become a vain and stuck up beach like you right ?
              
              
              
              
              All in all, your stupid comments do not address the needs of TS at all!! 
              
              What TS needs is companionship !!  You and many others seem to forget the fact that TS is almost 40 !!  He needs to be realistic !!!  Fine if he is still a young guy with plenty of chances, but the fact is hes not !!
              
              His top priority is to get a gf first !!!  Things about setting up a family or even having kids will not materialize when he doesnt have a girlfriend in the first place !!!
              
              
              
              
              @speakoutfor
              
              
              I am motivating him and waking up TS idea !!  At least I am giving him genuine advice ! 
              
              It doesnt matter TS takes it or not ! They are just options to try !!  
              
              There is always a chance when you try!! Whether positive result yield depend on the individual !!
              
              I am not doing this for the benefit of myself !!
              
              
              Blah blah blah, Xiao P is this, Xiao P is that. Dont listen to Xiao P this, Dont listen to Xiao P that. That is all you go about saying throughout your entire idiotic post !!
              
              You are just like a god damned broken record, keep repeating the same shlt over and over !!
              
              
              What constructive comments have you given to the TS anyway? 
              
              Goofballs like you really love to run their mouth without thinking of the consequences !!
              
              
              
              Hell, for sure TS can listen to you, continue targetting younger, good looking women !! 
              
              But if he does not score one when he is 40 in a couple of years, who should TS be blaming then ? You ? 
              
              
              Do you have the BALLS to come out and take responsibility for his predicament then ?
              
              
              If you dont, then Know your role and Shut Your Mouth !

However, when one dies they may reborn in heaven/ hell/ humans/ hungry ghosts, etc. If lovers cannot die together, it is advisable not to wait for each other and one should go for reincarnation first because the longer u linger on this earth, you may unconsciously do some bad deeds that may affect your chances of a good rebirth and may push you further apart from your loved ones when he/she cannot meet you in the same realm.</span></p>

              <p>And where is your ludricous rationale that getting a pretty girlfriend will guarantee you a good looking kid? If you look like shlt yourself, even your husband is Brad Pit or Tom Cruise, your kids wont end up any better either way !!</p>
              <p>Whether my gf is ugly, fat or short, what business is it of yours ? My gf can be Fiona Xie, or can be Patricia Mok, So long as I like, who are you to huan lor ?</p>
              <p>If there ain’t so many male jerks n cheaters in Sg, then SG women no need to be picky.</p>
              <p>YA right, as if! Just freaking admit sg girls are <span>VAIN</span>! Sg women are picky even if it is a nice guy !! They find decent &amp; responsible guys dull and boring !</p>
              <p>Your comment just goes to depict how conceited of a person you are !! Going for looks &amp; money. Please do not put me on the same level as you ok ? Why should i fear about telling my children of what i told TS ? Children should be taught correct values and principles !!</p>
              <p>I certainly dont want my children to grow to become a vain and stuck up beach like you right ?</p>
              <p>All in all, your stupid comments do not address the needs of TS at all!!</p>
              <p>What TS needs is companionship !! You and many others seem to forget the fact that TS is almost 40 !! He needs to be realistic !!! Fine if he is still a young guy with plenty of chances, but the fact is hes not !!</p>
              <p>His top priority is to get a gf first !!! Things about setting up a family or even having kids will not materialize when he doesnt have a girlfriend in the first place !!!</p>
              <p>@speakoutfor</p>
              <p>I am motivating him and waking up TS idea !! At least I am giving him genuine advice !</p>
              <p>It doesnt matter TS takes it or not ! They are just options to try !!</p>
              <p>There is always a chance when you try!! Whether positive result yield depend on the individual !!</p>
              <p>I am not doing this for the benefit of myself !!</p>
              <p>Blah blah blah, Xiao P is this, Xiao P is that. Dont listen to Xiao P this, Dont listen to Xiao P that. That is all you go about saying throughout your entire idiotic post !!</p>
              <p>You are just like a god damned broken record, keep repeating the same shlt over and over !!</p>
              <p>What constructive comments have you given to the TS anyway?</p>
              <p>Goofballs like you really love to run their mouth without thinking of the consequences !!</p>
              <p>Hell, for sure TS can listen to you, continue targetting younger, good looking women !!</p>
              <p>But if he does not score one when he is 40 in a couple of years, who should TS be blaming then ? You ?</p>
              <p>Do you have the <span>BALLS</span> to come out and take responsibility for his predicament then ?</p>
              <p>If you dont, then Know your role and Shut Your Mouth !</p>

              <p><br>You talk about BALLS when you have none. I think people like you are too afraid to pursue always sitting at home daydreaming about a girl - no guts. Courtship is about taking risks. You are telling TS to go after ladies his age. I say why not go after younger ones after all he is surrounded by them. Common sense would dictate that of course - he should not outrightly pursue them. All I am just saying is that - if he has the chance to get close to someone - and if she response positively - there is no harm in making a closer friendship.</p>
              <p>No I won't shut up. Why? Because this is a forum. You have no right to tell me not to write here. TS want ideas and I give him some.</p>
              <p>Younger doesn't have to be pretty. I am telling him to open his options. 28 or 29 yrs old is not a young girl - they are already mature and prepared for marriage. This is the ripe age. No wonder I have to repeat like a broken recorder because you never read properly. You are like that grandpa sitting on the rocking chair daydreaming - people talking to you - come into your left ear and then come out of your right ear. Never listen. I never tell TS to seek immature age girls like 21 or even 25 years old because he wants marriage whereas those girls still want to fool around. I am telling him 28 or 29 or even 30 is not so bad. This is the age of consenting adults.</p>
              <p>Goofballs like you are risk adverse and only want to protect your already endangering territory. Why? Because you can't get your very own young girls and you thimnk somebody older and more mature may threaten your position.</p>
