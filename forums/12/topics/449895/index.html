              <p>I am 38 this year and still single. Reason being that i had a motorcycle accident when I was 27 and I needed a couple of ops to replace my hip and spinal corrections. As a result, I had to spend a long time at home to rehabilitate from my injuries. I didn't work for 4 years. Now I am back and working as usual but I notice everybody who is 27 to 29 is earning as much as I am earning, well maybe I earn a bit more. I notice all my friends are already married and have kids. I want to move on.</p>
              <p>Recently I met a 27 old lady and I find her attractive. I just want to know if someone who is 10 years younger than me would like a person like me. I am not rich but at least i have a car. I am kind of concern because there's a lot of younger guys than me and she may pick them out.</p>
              <p>I am a bit concern if I can settle down because age is catching up. I know I shouldn't feel the suspense but this is how it is when everybody is married and attached except me.</p>
              <p>I am a shy guy and don't like to make advances. I just want to know her better.</p>
              <p>1) So would it be logical for me to just make friends with her first? See her response </p>
              <p>2) Rather than make my move and ask her out?  </p>

              <p>Yesterday I went for a gathering at a friend's house. We were sitting in a group and then there was an empty seat next to me. She came late and almost sat next to me but she changed her mind and decided to sit at the far end corner with the other ladies.</p>
              <p>Then as we spoke I notice she became friendly to some of the guys and didn't pay much attention to me.</p>
              <p>Me being shy I didn't know how to response.</p>
              <p>So ah well, guess she didn't take so much notice of me after all.</p>

              <p>Ask not if your wealth is good enough to attract her, but whether she is interested only in your wealth.</p>
              <p>However
                   much or little you may have, some girls are out to have a good time at 
                  your expense and will act sweet until you can provide no more.</p>
              <p>There are many good girls out there, hopefully she's one, so why not ensure you've picked one of them. You must know in our culture, a psyche of "husband provides, wife enjoys" is in many girls and their parents. and in your position, working to support a wife who doesn't contribute is out of the question.</p>
              <p>Such a match is in any case unhealthy and not a recipe for true joy in life, it would be better to be alone or even look lower for a girl who has a healthy view of love and life.</p>

              <p>So far I have not been able to speak to her and she is always in the crowd of the other ladies and she sometimes talk to the married/attached guys. We single guys are very much left in ourselves at the other side of the room.</p>

              <p>I don't know her that well. All I know is that she's in software sales. I think it is quite a decent industry, i hear she doesn;t need to do entertaining excessive, like drinking or karaoke.</p>
              <p>Sorry to say, I am not wealthy because I didn't work for 4 years due to my motorbike accident and having to recuperate from my back and hip surgeries. During those hardships it was my parents who stood by me and paid for my medical bills. I still bear the scars but they are not apparent unless i take off my shirt and pants.</p>
              <p>I am looking for a nice lady to settle down. I am not a player because as i said i am a very shy guy.</p>

              <p>actually abit sad because as a player, i think the good guys should get the girls but they all stick to the guys who are rubbish and cannot give them a future. sometimes dunno how the girls think. even had times where being merciful tell the girl we won't have future and they still waste time waiting. weird lah, dun understand girls.</p>

              <p>I am 38 this year and still single. Reason being that i had a
              motorcycle accident when I was 27 and I needed a couple of ops
              to replace my hip and spinal corrections. As a result, I had to
              spend a long time at home to rehabilitate from my injuries. I
              didn't work for 4 years. Now I am back and working as usual but I
              notice everybody who is 27 to 29 is earning as much as I am
              earning, well maybe I earn a bit more. I notice all my friends are
              already married and have kids. I want to move on.</p>
              <p>Recently I met a 27 old lady and I find her
              attractive. I just want to know if someone who is 10 years younger
              than me would like a person like me. I am not rich but at least i
              have a car. I am kind of concern because there's a lot of younger
              guys than me and she may pick them out.</p>
              <p>I am a bit concern if I can settle down because age is catching
              up. I know I shouldn't feel the suspense but this is how it is when
              everybody is married and attached except me.</p>
              <p>I am a shy guy and don't like to make advances. I just want
              to know her better.</p>
              <p>1) So would it be logical for me to just make friends with
              her first? See her response </p>
              <p>2) Rather than make my move and ask her out?  </p>

              <p><br>Agree.</p>
              <p>I am thinking of just making small talk. Like if I find out a lady is working as a doctor, I just ask about her vocation and how it relates to my problem such as if I suffer from sinus problem. Usually I join this bunch of people, we just have a drink and talk. But I notice the guys are bunched up in one place and the ladies bunched up in another place, so its difficult to get into conversation with the ladies.</p>
              <p>My thinking is that if I can just observe one of the guys go over to talk to the ladies, I would just slowly nudge into their conversation, firstly, listening to what they say. Perhaps I can register their conversation and next round of conversation in the later weeks, I can turn it into my own conversation with the ladies. For instance if one of the guys ask a lady about where is the best gym to exercise. I just listen and then go back home ask friends and check the internet about gyms - then next week, i try to turn it into my conversation with that lady.</p>
              <p>Also I better time my conversation. After just like 5 min if she don't show any interest to go on, I better move to the next conversation with someone else.</p>
              <p>This gathering is not exactly a dating gathering. Its a gathering among young working youths. So some people may not like it if I shower too much attention to a lady, maybe she doesn't like that too.</p>
              <p>But at the end of the day, I just got to be friendly to both guys and girls. Also, to take into account that I sure face some rudeness if i try to make conversation with the guys and girls. Maybe they just aren't interested to talk to a newcomer like me. Got to be thick skin a bit.</p>

              <p><br>your obstacles are the guys and girls friends. have them out of teh way. this lady your colleagues where you know here. shouldn't be too difficult to have a time alone wiht her noone around and pick up conversation? trust me sometimes it is better not to have to manyyof the 'friends; in teh way. leran to hunt alone. you should build up your finaancial stability. any wise later to be a wife knows this is important factor. if you have a decent car for transport moving aourd is good. but only if you can afford it - you know yourself. otehrsiwe you can forget about girls who only thinks about cars - they lazy to walk.</p>
