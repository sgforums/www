              <p>As the older more mature guy, u should take some initiatives to gain admiration instead of sitting around like a "poor old guy".</p>
              <p>Be the big brother. Take the lead to socialize and be friendly. </p>
              <p>At your age, u have much more to offer than a young body.</p>
              <p>Girls making fun of u do not mean they don't like u. At least u r getting some attention from them. If u r pessimistic, u will resent it. If u r positive , u will take advantage of it. It's all a matter of perspective and how u react.</p>
              <p>All girls wanna be chased by guys. Even when they don't see u as a potential partner, they still like to be coaxed and chased. Unless the girl is very frank and honest, she won't say no to your "chasing" because it feels good and help boost their self-confidence. </p>
              <p>As a guy, your job is to sift out those who just wanna use u, and identify those who r genuinely interested in recipocrating ur love.</p>
              <p>Learn to let go, when u meet a "user". This is applicable to girls too. Don't blindly chase after the girl, that's probably what happened to your friend with a broken heart. </p>
              <p>When u hang out with a younger group, understand that younger guys may see u as a threat. When they act in offending manner, they are inwardly insecure. So really, the problem is not u, it's them and their insecurities. So, just shrug it off and enjoy the socializing. After all,they r all on the hunt for chicks, they gotta do what they can to level the playing field for themselves.</p>
              <p>When  a girl is ready to settle down, she'll look for a sense of stability,safety and security. If u can exude these kind of qualities, your chase is half done, all u need is chemistry and luck.<span> </span></p>

              <p>Thank you for the tip.</p>
              <p>I just want to verify further.</p>
              <p><em>As a guy, your job is to sift out those who just wanna use u, and identify those who r genuinely interested in recipocrating ur love.</em></p>
              <p>Sometimes it is hard for an inexperienced guy like to me to sift out. I wonder is it that the only way to find out is when a lady is very responsive to me?</p>
              <p>I get a lot of confusing mixed messages. At times, there is this naughty girl who always call me out to join her for late night parties but when I am there she disappears, only to meet her other friends there. There was even one time she asked me out for dinner. But at the time i was too busy for work. Then she started to try to play jealousy games, she deliberately hold anotehr guy's hand when she saw me coming then as I turn my head around, she released his hand. Then some friends were organizing a birthday party for me, she didn't turn up but she ask one other female friend to come to meet me. It is as if she is playing hot and cold at me. Her female friend seems more interested in me than her. It was then i suspect she is just playing around with me. However, i have not done anything nor even ask her out. And this is the moment YES, i learn to let go.</p>
              <p><em>All girls wanna be chased by guys. Even when they don't see u as a potential partner, they still like to be coaxed and chased</em></p>
              <p>Yes. But as a guy i really dislike playing the game. I have seen some of my guy friends suffer huge humiliation and didn't even get the girl. I would want to chase the girl of my dreams if I can be sure myself that she like me and not just trying to fool me around. Question is, how am I going to tell if she is really interested in me or not?</p>
              <p><br><em>When u hang out with a younger group, understand that younger guys may see u as a threat. When they act in offending manner, they are inwardly insecure. So really, the problem is not u, it's them and their insecurities.</em></p>
              <p>Yes i sense that too. I think I got to be assertive when during our meetings. Especially among the guys. Its like watching NatGeo when the alpha male gorrila or lion is trying to assert itself. Of course I am not trying to be bully or be a leader, I am just telling them that I am not somebody who can be pushed around. I got to do that or else I am in risk of being bullied or obstracized. It is going to be a tall order because as i said i am a shy guy. So I got to find a way to make myself stand out.</p>
              <p><em>When  a girl is ready to settle down, she'll look for a sense of stability,safety and security.</em></p>
              <p>I think i can do that but problem is most of the other guys can do that too. There is also one other guy, he is very successful in his career, it is rumored he opened some bakeries and he now drive a BMW. But he is just 28 and single. Trouble is, he has a speech impediment problem, everytime he speaks he stammers. And he is very quiet. But the girls in the group hardly speaks to him. I guess security and stability isn't the only thing they are looking for. THey are probably looking for a CHAMPION? Somebody who would chase them to ends of earth, somebody charismatic and somebody adventurous. Sigh.......not only i have to be a better provider than the rest of the herd (the competition) but I also have to be adventurous and charismatic. I just came out of a 4 year hiatus because of my motorbike accident. I walk with a slight limp. What girl is going to like me? I can't even escort her around in the shopping mall because of my injuries. Sigh.....</p>

              <p>Allow me to ask you something.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why are you not hanging out with people your age but people much younger?</p>
              <p>Obviously people in the same age range will gather together because they share similar mentality and interests.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>An older individual like you naturally gets shot down and outcasted. You also dont want to hang out with a bunch of ah peks and ah mas too. Whats so surprising about that?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Besides, why would you wanna woo girls when there are a lot of unnecessary competition around ? Thats so dumb !!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I wont want to chase after any girl when i know theres some other guy supposingly richer and younger than me, then worry at the back 'Oh i dunno if she'll pick the better guy'. Obviously shes gonna pick him !!  Duhh !!!  Wouldnt you ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You should also lower your expections and requirements !!  You are almost 40, you said that yourself !! And yet you are still eyeing for those candy and cute barbie dolls in their 20s ?</p>

              <p>Its not that I want to end up like this. All the people my age, I know are already married. I so happen to know these bunch of people who are much younger than me and I want to increase my social circle.</p>
              <p>I don'[t know of any social group that is my age, apart from those friends of mine who are already married.</p>
              <p>Let me tell you how I end up this way. 5 years ago I had a severe motorbike accident and I had to undergo numerous surgeries. I could not work for 4 years. I had to stay at home and could not go out socialise and could not go out to work (cannot even get up from bed, in pain, had to wear a back brace and in crutches). Now I am much better after hip replacement, 4 screws into my spine and physiotherapy, I can go back to work.</p>
              <p>THis is why I am now in my mid 30s and not married. Now I am making up for loss time.</p>
              <p>Maybe there are women in their 30s but for me to meet them, I have to go for dating agency.</p>
              <p>What I don't understand why an older guy cannot be with a younger lady? I am not saying that I do not want to seek somebody my age. But why is it so taboo for guys to observe older guys seeking younger ladies? I am seeking younger ladies because they are proximately within reach. I haven't met anybody my age, honestly. So far...</p>

              <div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Oldkamhouse:</div>
              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Thank you for the tip.</p>
              <p>I just want to verify further.</p>
              <p><em>As a guy, your job is to sift out those who just wanna use
                  u, and identify those who r genuinely interested in recipocrating
                  ur love.</em></p>
              <p>Sometimes it is hard for an inexperienced guy like to me to sift
                  out. I wonder is it that the only way to find out is when a lady is
                  very responsive to me?</p>
              <p>I get a lot of confusing mixed messages. At times, there is this
                  naughty girl who always call me out to join her for late night
                  parties but when I am there she disappears, only to meet her other
                  friends there. There was even one time she asked me out for dinner.
                  But at the time i was too busy for work. Then she started to try to
                  play jealousy games, she deliberately hold anotehr guy's hand when
                  she saw me coming then as I turn my head around, she released his
                  hand. Then some friends were organizing a birthday party for me,
                  she didn't turn up but she ask one other female friend to come to
                  meet me. It is as if she is playing hot and cold at me. Her female
                  friend seems more interested in me than her. It was then i suspect
                  she is just playing around with me. However, i have not done
                  anything nor even ask her out. And this is the moment YES, i learn
                  to let go.</p>
              <p><em>All girls wanna be chased by guys. Even when they don't see
                  u as a potential partner, they still like to be coaxed and
                  chased</em></p>
              <p>Yes. But as a guy i really dislike playing the game. I have seen
                  some of my guy friends suffer huge humiliation and didn't even get
                  the girl. I would want to chase the girl of my dreams if I can be
                  sure myself that she like me and not just trying to fool me around.
                  Question is, how am I going to tell if she is really interested in
                  me or not?</p>
              <p><br> <em>When u hang out with a younger group, understand that younger
                  guys may see u as a threat. When they act in offending manner, they
                  are inwardly insecure. So really, the problem is not u, it's them
                  and their insecurities.</em></p>
              <p>Yes i sense that too. I think I got to be assertive when during
                  our meetings. Especially among the guys. Its like watching NatGeo
                  when the alpha male gorrila or lion is trying to assert itself. Of
                  course I am not trying to be bully or be a leader, I am just
                  telling them that I am not somebody who can be pushed around. I got
                  to do that or else I am in risk of being bullied or obstracized. It
                  is going to be a tall order because as i said i am a shy guy. So I
                  got to find a way to make myself stand out.</p>
              <p><em>When  a girl is ready to settle down, she'll look for a
                  sense of stability,safety and security.</em></p>
              <p>I think i can do that but problem is most of the other guys can
                  do that too. There is also one other guy, he is very successful in
                  his career, it is rumored he opened some bakeries and he now drive
                  a BMW. But he is just 28 and single. Trouble is, he has a speech
                  impediment problem, everytime he speaks he stammers. And he is very
                  quiet. But the girls in the group hardly speaks to him. I guess
                  security and stability isn't the only thing they are looking for.
                  THey are probably looking for a CHAMPION? Somebody who would chase
                  them to ends of earth, somebody charismatic and somebody
                  adventurous. Sigh.......not only i have to be a better provider
                  than the rest of the herd (the competition) but I also have to be
                  adventurous and charismatic. I just came out of a 4 year hiatus
                  because of my motorbike accident. I walk with a slight limp. What
                  girl is going to like me? I can't even escort her around in the
                  shopping mall because of my injuries. Sigh.....</p>

              <p>Every relationship take 2 hands to clap. If she is non responsive, obviously she thinks u r not right for her. A woman have a mind of her own, she knows what she like or do not like. U cannot force her to like u. </p>
              <p>As for that "naughty"girl, I think it's quite obvious she is trying to set u up with her friends. If u appreciate her effort, simply go with the flow n enjoy their company.If its her u r interested in, just let her know that while u appreciate her kindness , u really do not wish to hang out with a bunch of strangers. But she is likely not playing mind games, she probably wish to not reject u too blatantly. So it's good u recognize her "subtle" rejection and backed off on your own. </p>
              <p>But really, perhaps u need to re-evaluate the kind of girls u seem to be attracted to. Party girls r obviously not suitable for u, even tho u r looking to make up for lost time. </p>
              <p>U hav to accept that phase of ur life is gone, n u simply cannot relive it. </p>
              <p>Be more realistic in ur expectations, n perhaps u will have better chance of success.</p>
              <p>To stand out from the crowd, u need to understand ur strength n focus on that. Shore up ur weakness. Hiding ur talents n good points is like flirting with a girl across the room in total darkness.</p>

              <p>Of course you can woo younger girls. Nobodys there to stop you !! But what are your chances? Know your limits lahh. Be practical ok ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Buck up your career, earn as much money as you can 1st. Then go SDN, St James or what lah. You are driving a car, that makes you at least marketable to the typical materialistic girl out there.</p>

              <p>Honto ni, you are already 38. You should be already mature enough to know where to find the girls loh.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Playing blurr or shy gets you no where loh. At your age, you better have a plan liao.</p>

              <p>You talk like so easy liddat. Everybody prefer to get somebody their age. Couple in their late 30s even harder to produce babies. Woman want younger guy - couger woman. Man want younger woman - uncle? You call people uncle? Have some respect man. Maybe one day you become uncle like him looking for swimsuit girls. You talk kok like so great like tat. One day sure kena karma.</p>
              <p>I got two cousins. One marry at 38 another at 37. And their wives are same age as they are. 5 years later still barren.</p>
              <p>Depends on what a man wants in his woman. I think this uncle you speak is seeking fertility. He want somebody younger to produce babies. It is higher risk if couple are same age and in their mid 30s.</p>
              <p>I think he is doing it right. Gurls like blur guys. If he is aggressive and pursue younger gurls- his desperation will surely scare them away. Don't you know this?</p>

              <p><br>Sorry I don't eye "candy and cute barbie dolls". In fact I wanted to get to know this other lady, she's 34. But she's kind of making herself hard to get. I tried to talk to her during a dinner outing, ask her what she does so and so forth. But she kept talking to her other lady friend sitting next to her about make up and going for spas. And then she seems to be even more interested in a 27 year old guy sitting next to me. She totally ignored me and started to flirt with the 27 year old guy. The 27 year old guy not knowing her age (because she look youthful) liked the attention, I can see that he was very into talking and making jokes with her. So I suppose older women also like younger men.</p>
              <p>I don't want to be an ah pek hanging out with younger people but all the people my age, I know, are already married and have no time for me.</p>

              <p>Please be fair to me, ahem the uncle. I never say that I am seeking a girl in the lookers division. In fact the naughty girl I speak of, she is quite on the overweight category. I don't mind looks but character, getting along and kindness is very important to me.</p>
              <p>This is why I am not the go-getter type. I am more preferring to know the lady better so I can see what she likes, her hobbies, her character and her heart.</p>
              <p>I didn't think about getting children but it be great to start a family. I wouldn't mind adopting kids if that is the alternative option.</p>

              <p>Xiao P,</p>
              <p>Please do some research first before tok rubbish can ?</p>
              <p>Women start losing their fertility about 25 years old, some start as early as 21. There's also environmental factors that can affect fertility rate in females. We all live in a high stress society the food we eat contains plenty of artificial chemicals. By 35, a woman is considered high risk pregnancy. That means the chances of miscarriages n down syndrome baby goes up fast after this age. </p>
              <p>And please lah, u r a guy right ? Dare u claim u do not go for looks ? How many of ur girlfriends r ugly fucks ? </p>
              <p>Also, do u really want to have babies with a very ugly girl ? What's ur child gonna look like ? As ugly as u , her or both ? What's gonna happen when he/she grows up ? R u gonna tell your child what u told this uncle now ? Get real kid.</p>
              <p>Sg women hang up to sell ? If there ain't so many male  jerks n cheaters in Sg, then SG women no need to be picky. </p>
              <p>Yes I agree, it's hard to woo Sg girls, they r harder to bed because they r not stupid. Most r educated n possess some critical thinking.</p>
              <p>Thats why guys don't like women with a brain. Stupid ones r indeed easier to bed. But ur children will be just as dumb, so what gives ?</p>
              <p>As for girls going for guys with money n career, what makes u think those guys r easy to get ? They r rich because they r smart. R u a rich guy Xiao P ?</p>

              <p>@jojobeach<br><br>I am just relating the facts to TS so he can realise his situation here.<br><br>Actually tonnes of Sg women hang up to sell, dont try to deny it.<br><br>And dont freaking try to convince me a sg girl in particular will take a guy, an older guy for that matter if he doesnt have something like a prosperous career or some money to offer on the platter somewhat.<br><br>Come on loh, I did tell the guy to go look for women his age range, didnt I ?<br><br>Look at his posts. Hes not just eyeing for younger women, but particularly the ones in the LOOKERS division !! Tell me that is not almost impossible. Hes hungry yet hes still picky at the type of fish he wants to eat !<br><br>Girls like BLURR guys  ...  ?    {-_-"}         ^5 motoway.<br><br>Goodness, how did you ever come out with this logic?<br><br>So TS is blurr enough not to be attached at 38, and you still want him to continue being blurr til his old age?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><br><br>@speakoutfor<br><br>3 letters describe you very well :<br><br>W. T. F.<br><br>And you are a seriously big one for that matter.<br><br>Our dear TS has even problems securing a gf and you are wobbling your tongue about birth issues? How do you even talk about having children when you dont even have a proper companion in the 1st place ?!<br><br>Try going to find a gf with having babies in mind. You either scare her away or get kicked all the way back to Timbutuk !!<br><br>You know, at the very least, I am offering constructive advice to the TS, Yah i am blunt. So what ? The truth hurts !!  How else can TS see the truth and wake up his idea ?<br><br>While you ... you really have a forked tongue man !! Damn your words are pure venom !!<br><br>You are ENCOURAGING him !! Thats the worst bloody thing to do !!! You are hinting at him, go get younger girls cos they can still give birth. What do you take women for? Pigs in the farm?<br><br>What does TS getting a gf got to do with your cousins not being able to give birth?!  Are you implying that if TS find a similar age lady, they cant have kids? Are you doubting the testicular fortitude of TS here? God, you are evil.<br><br>But I guess if your cousins cant give birth must have got to do with your lousy family genes. Its YOUR karma, not mine  =P<br><br>Going on, if TS takes your advice, continue hunt for younger gals and get rejected, played around, wastes even MORE time, should TS come and strangle your throat then?!<br><br>And whats wrong with calling him uncle? You make it sound as if calling him uncle is akin to murder !! Uncle could be an address in respect !!</p>

              <p>Xiao P Xiao P. You are speaking like a typical small child. No wonder you are called Xiao.</p>
              <p>Respect? The way you call him sound more like you are trying to disrespect him. Doesn't take a genius to see that. Is that how you greet your parents at home? You sure show a very bad upbringing based on your rudeness.</p>
              <p>Actually I was making it up. it wasn't my cousins. it was my friends. I said cousins to protect their identity. I guess they must married to women related to you. Xiao P - that explains the defective genes. </p>
              <p>You are giving bad advice. Oldkamhouse don't listen to this smart alec. You are saying that Oldkamhouse got no hope and he gotta look for people his age? There is nothing wrong with seeking life partner for wanting kids. That iswhat a family is all about. Xiao P is too immature to understand.</p>
              <p>Ex girlfriend? No wonder she is your ex. The rude manner in which Xiao P speaks - no lady in proper mind can stand his aggressive/narcissistic/hopeless behaviour. Giving all the wrong advice. Everybody should have some glimmer of hope. This is not false hope. I really think Oldkamhouse have a shot at somebody younger. It is not impossible. Why not try? Why must it be somebody at his age.</p>
              <p>Xiao P is an angel right? He only claims that he looks for ugly girls. Yeah right. Oldkamhouse is a human being - he is a guy. At least he is being honest. Xiao P - don't BS to us and tell us you seek ugly girls and give advice to Oldkam to go for older women (maybe Xiao P want all the young girls to himself knowing good people like Oldkam have stolen all his opportunity).</p>
              <p>In the same way - educated women want to seeek more educated and richer guys. Is there anything wrong with that ? No.</p>

              <p>How big your social circle will be is entirely up to you !!  Your incessant excuses of only being condemned to young, nice looking girls because they are the only girls you know is exceedingly lame.</p>

              <p>Do you know that Facebook is a great tool to know girls ?</p>

              <p>Facebook? That is the worst place to seek life partner. Anybody can simply creat a fb account and claim to be somebody. Another ridiculous advice.</p>
              <p>You calling him uncle. Very rude. How you feel like I call you little boy,.</p>
              <p>Hey little boy. Your advice is very immature. You talk like it is so easy to find a girl. You think they are what? Supermarket items to be bought over the shelf ah?</p>
              <p>Little boy. Obviously you don't know meaning of people who go out there to work. Where people got so much time to seek more social circles? People work 5 days a week. Not like you relying on your parents to buy you your playstation and gundam toys.</p>
              <p>What is wrong with this younger social circle. It is not as if he is hanging out with kindergarden children. Look. These people are adults although they are in their 20s - they are mature enough to get married and make important decisions - they are not underage children. I know you are little boy and want a lot of parental protection butunlike you - oldkamhouse's social circle are more matured.</p>
