              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">What a romantic thought. However, when one dies they may reborn in heaven/ hell/ humans/ hungry ghosts, etc. If lovers cannot die together, it is advisable not to wait for each other and one should go for reincarnation first because the longer u linger on this earth, you may unconsciously do some bad deeds that may affect your chances of a good rebirth and may push you further apart from your loved ones when he/she cannot meet you in the same realm.</span></p>

              <p>Wow wow. Getting angry aren't you. You sound like those moronic pimple face kids still suffering from puberty.</p>
              <p>There are gurls age 27 and 28. What is wrong with those? Time and time I tell you again but you still don't understand. You still think he is after those early 20s. Give him benefit of the doubt. Haiz. You must be one of those virgins who never seen a nude lady before or even talk to a lady - you are so naive.</p>
              <p>FYI I am only 24 and yet I am encouraging TS. Why? Because this is a free world. We must be optimistic. Not like you - you are so negative - just look at the way you write - like an angry napoleon with no experience with women at all.</p>
              <p>I am giving TS opportunity to get to know gurls around him better. Like just talk - that is all. It is good opportunity to socialise. If not pursue a relationship course - no harm to make friends or even acquaintances. No it is not bound to fail. Rather than not sit there idly try to mix with them lah. Yes step out of the comfort zone - take the challenge. Not go after somebody his age.</p>
              <p>I got balls wat. What prove you have I got no balls? U dont even know me.</p>
              <p>You are so damn wrong. Men in their 40s have higher market value because they are more financially stable and they can provide security.</p>
              <p>Haha. No wonder. You know you are EL LAMO because you always remind yourself that you are LAME as you flip the dictionary every day to tell yourself so. So little self esteem. No wonder you are so risk adverse and inexperienced. Go give advice to the kindergarden because you know almost next to crap. And settle your puberty problems first before you talk adult stuff.</p>

              <p><br>Lots of profanities. Looks like you are perturbed. Read your ridiculous post complaining about racial harmony with immigrants. You must be angry not only because a lot of older mature guys are getting the chicks but also immigrants are better than you in grabbing the local chicks.</p>
              <p>Just look at the way you speak - like a chimpanzee - screaming profanities - cannot control emotions.</p>
              <p>Walk the talk? I have walk the talk - my gusto have won me many chicks over time. Maybe he has higher taste that is why he is still single or he may be too busy at his work place and not making big enough effort to find the proper soul mate. Who knows?</p>
              <p>But you are assuming that he failed. Social circles are shrinking as he said so could be that he hasn't got opportunity to meet the right girl.</p>
              <p>Wah just because I advice him to be more pro-active - that makes me a moron? Do you even know the meaning of the word moron? Chimpanzee screaming profanity again. He has to take risk and be more adventurous. We must learn portfolio investment. Learn to mitigate risk. Got to go out there and try. That is what is important.</p>
              <p>And you are giving wrong advice. Negative / pessimistic / low self esteem person is what you are.</p>
              <p>I am giving him a positive outlook and be more optimistic.</p>
              <p>More optimistic. More positive outlook.</p>
              <p>More positive outlook. More optimistic.</p>
              <p>How you like that? Parrot enough?</p>
              <p>Better than you jumping up and down like an immature chimp shouting profanities. Uh Uh Uh... as a result of envy of older and more capable men and immigrants. Just like a moronic chimp complain complain complain. You remind me of the chimp in the zoo screaming at people but nothing is done.</p>
              <p>Be broad minded young guy like me. I allow TS to give a shot for younger gurls.</p>
