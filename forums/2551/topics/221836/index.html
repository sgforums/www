            <div class='col-md body'>The following is written by Riiyer, found in the same thread as the druid sing-along post.<br><br><blockquote><br>Â“To be or not to be, that is the question!Â”, the druid marveled, sitting on one of the empty pizza boxes as Blizzard devs sketched out a new game.<br><br>The warrior, standing proud and tall, was the first to answer:<br>Â“Be, of course! Wear your fur proudly and tank with the best of us! Together, we will keep the squishies safe!Â”<br><br>The shaman appeared ruffled by the disturbance, but soon replied:<br>Â“You too are servants of nature. Your shapeshifting is different from our totem system, but it has merit. Be, and let us together fight those who would defile nature!Â”<br><br>The paladin, roused from his stupor, was the next to respond:<br>Â“Interesting. We have little in common, but all will beg us to join their groups for our buffs. LetÂ’s not disappoint them! Be!Â”<br><br>The hunter, attempting to tame the druid and failing cried out:<br>Â“Be! Anything with this kind of power must be useful!Â”<br><br>The rogue slipped from the shadows and evaluated the druid, stating:<br>Â“A class that can come with us on stealth runs, and heal and tank as well?! We like it, so be!Â”<br><br>The priest, serene and calm, responded:<br>Â“Your battle resurrection, heals over time, and mark of the wild bring much that we lack. Be, and let us wield entire parties as our weapons.Â”<br><br>The warlock, not quite keeping his eyes off his succubus, spoke:<br>Â“Eh, I think youÂ’re a little silly with your whole nature-lover deal, but I canÂ’t argue with innervate, either. Be, and our power shall be magnified a hundredfold!Â”<br><br>The mage, clever and haughty, had his own voice:<br>Â“Bah! WeÂ’ll take the crit aura, you silly things! Might as well be.Â”<br><br>And so the druid was heartened, with visions of grandeur and waffles filling his mind. He would be loved and respected by all, welcome in every camp.<br><br>But then the dev asked: Â“WTF are druids for? They canÂ’t do anything as well as their parent classes, thereÂ’s just no demand for +spelldamage leather or tanking leather, and they look damn silly.Â”<br><br>Â“Good point.Â”, the CM responded. Â“ItÂ’s not like theyÂ’re going to care-weÂ’ve been inuring them to this for a long time. We just force players away from druids so we donÂ’t have do deal with making leather drops for anything other than rogues. Hell, give some other class innervate, and no one will miss them.Â”<br><br>The druid, alarmed by this, turned to his comrades. But they turned their back on the druid, laughing as they said Â“Cry more.Â”<br><br>Only the paladin and the priest had any sympathy for the druid, but when priests were given an innervate and blessing of kings both buffed and made trainable, they forgot the lonely druid, standing alone in the void.<br><br>He soon disappeared altogether, mourned by no one. Until one day, when a young night elf asked Â“Mommy, where are those big owl things with the funny dance?Â”<br><br>His mother responded sadly, Â“I donÂ’t know, my child. No one has seen them for a very long time. There is a legend that they will one day return, with their great Alamo and Plainswander leading the way to a new era of glory for Azeroth. But no one knows if and when that day will ever come, as they have left nothing to mark their passing. They were supposed to have been a good people, always willing to help those in need, and guilty of nothing save wanting to exist. No one knows what happened to them or why, least of all the druids themselves. But some hope that the legend is true, and that they will return someday.Â”<br><br>The childÂ’s eyes glittered as he saw in his mind the glory that once was, and could be again.<br></blockquote>I only have one thing to say~~<br>Once a druid, always a druid, no matter how shafted or weak we are.</div>
