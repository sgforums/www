            <div class='col-md body'>Ya I also did create a new level 1 NE warrior to play with other half when she started a new priest. The problem was we did quests together outside of instances alright. But the moment she had to do an instance, I will be on my pally twinking her thru &gt;_&lt;<br><br>Anyway, I abandoned my NE warrior at level 40, and re-rolled a gnome one! Gnome warriors are so much more fun. I did, however, take a very long time to level up my gnome to 60.<br><br>The only thing you could do for your other half is to try to get to play a low level character. But like you said, he totally has no inclination on plating computer games at all, so it be tougher to convince him. Some people really dun see the fun in playing games, so it might be impossible.<br><br>That said, I feel that raiding 2 nights a week is not a big deal. I remembered that he has shift work? Has that changed? 2 nights a week is barely acceptable. In your case, it be best to have only one character. I can't see how you can juggle more than one.<br><br>I always wondered at some friends who can have 3 characters epically geared. I wonder how they manage the time. In on of the hardcore guilds on my server, it seems that some players never sleep at all. They can juggle 2 characters in 2 different hardcore raiding guilds and fulfil all of the raid timings.

I wonder how they manage the time. In on of the hardcore guilds on my server, it seems that some players never sleep at all. They can juggle 2 characters in 2 different hardcore raiding guilds and fulfil all of the raid timings. Amazing I tell you!</div></blockquote>usually these r the students or those who have no life. it is actually very easily achieved.<br><br>take my fren for example. he is a student. he raids at 4pm with a guild doing naxx. at 9pm he raids with another guild duing Aq40.<br><br>His mage is fully tier1 when he stopped playing it a year ago and his warrior is fully tier 2 since last month. both if his guild raid more than 4days a week so he berry hard core <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> we end up nagging him to study.<br><br>as for me, i'll be doing the same once my mage hits 60. then i will look for a guild doing MC and start gearing her up. then my priest gonna go to some BWL/AQ40 guild to get her full tier 2 (priest drops have been bad for my ex guild. i've been fully tier 1 for one year liao). 2 days a week on each guild = 4days a week, monday farming, tuesdays is movie/ pak-tor nite, saturday is sleep in and do own stuff day. okie wat <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To accomplish 2 hardcore guilds up to BWL is ok. But to reaching Sapphiron on 2 different guilds is unbelievable. Sigh, some people.<br><br>Ya, many of em are students, I know that. I personally know one fella who has an American guild and an Aussie/Asian guild and he is an officer of both em and contributes equally. Too ridiculous to have no life outside of the game.<br><br>Elindra&gt; Like that is quite unfair, cos you do spend time with him. But you should allocate one Friday a month to him for quality time. That would be a nice gesture.</div>
