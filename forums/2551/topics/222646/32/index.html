            <div class='col-md body'>that is sound advice. on our wipe night last week we started to have problems when mages get graved, i guess screwing up the nova rotations. furthermore, none of the mages are frost specced so we rely extensively on nova for snaring. 2 mages got graved=2 novas left. once we ran out of novas the murlocs just run around free hitting on 5-7 AOErs. we lasted maybe about 6-8 waves of murlocs before all the AOErs are down.<br><br>i suppose a prot pally is the obvious answer to rounding up the murlocs for easy AOEing but the RL is too resistant to the idea of having a pally tanking. i hope he takes to the idea of having tanks leading the 2 grps of murlocs to a aoe pit at least.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Yvlaine:</div><div class="quote_body">I need to know whats the issue causing your raid to die before being able to best give suggestions.<br><br>However, off the top of my head, we use 3 mages and 3 locks.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by $lave:</div><div class="quote_body">that is sound advice. on our wipe night last week we started to have problems when mages get graved, i guess screwing up the nova rotations. furthermore, none of the mages are frost specced so we rely extensively on nova for snaring. 2 mages got graved=2 novas left. once we ran out of novas the murlocs just run around free hitting on 5-7 AOErs. we lasted maybe about 6-8 waves of murlocs before all the AOErs are down.<br><br>i suppose a prot pally is the obvious answer to rounding up the murlocs for easy AOEing but the RL is too resistant to the idea of having a pally tanking. i hope he takes to the idea of having tanks leading the 2 grps of murlocs to a aoe pit at least.<br><br></div></blockquote>We dont really work on Frost Nova rotation to keep aggro off non-tanks. It relies too much on mages not being graved, or dead. Frost Nova is good for freezing them at a spot (aoe pit) for a short initial period. Tanks are expected to grab and hold aggro firmly from that point.<br><br>The warrior that holds aoe aggro best has Improved Thunderclap.<br><br>Yes, prot pallies work wonders here. We started our first few kills with a prot pally for one side of the murlocs. However, since then we've been able to do it with pure warriors for murloc tank teams.<br><br>Just make sure AoEers dont go psycho till 4-5 secs, allowing for tanks to grab and hold aggro well. The more the aoe, the lesser time spent on murlocs, the more the time on Morogrim.</div>
