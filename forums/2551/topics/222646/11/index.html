I have frens who PVP for 1 week and they have all the HWL gear. For folks who can't get into raiding guilds or dun even have tier 1 gear, this is a good opportunity to gear up.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ohhh forgot to add. Asiasoft estimates there are 40,000 WoW players in Singapore. Finding a guild that raids asian time is not difficult.<br><br>For example:<br>Dragonmaw has more than 5 Asian-SG time zone guilds.<br>DOOM<br>Revanche<br>Makan<br>Circle of Kakis (i think they and Makan have merged)<br>DEFY (Aussie time zone. good for students who r escaping parents detection :twisted)<br><br>and many more splinter off to form their own small guilds when BC arrives.</div>

You can make use of this time to create your alt and then when it is lvl 60 you can put a request to make your warrior your main if you want. Plus, you can sponge off the hunter for gold etc<br><br></div>
