But when you consider less than one month to chiong pvp or else it useless after TBC, you kinda become not so interested. Especially when GM was achieveable with casual PvP with last week honor gain system within that 1 month timeframe. Shot down by 30% makes casual PvP not so viable anymore within one month, when aiming for GM weapon. I'm not too keen to grind PvP that hard. If you gave me another 3 months until TBC will be released, then I would definitely be more keen.<br><br>I guess it depends on your current gear. My paladin is nicely outfitted so it becomes not so critical.<br><br>But for my warrior, getting the epic shoulders - only 12k+ honor is easy with casual pvp. I'm quite comfy with my paladin's current equipment - within 64-65, you'll find nicer blues/greens as compared to current in-game epics. I'm kinda aiming to equip my warrior alt with almost full 60 epics, so far my plans is highly achieveable within the next one month with 20 man run rewards and drops and the Epic PvP shoulders. My warrior alt with full 60 epics definitely makes the 60-64 grind easier.<br><br>You must note that the nice PvP reward armors after TBC does not come from general PvP, but from Arena matches. All you can get with general PvP is the blue level 70 PvP set. The epic level 70 PvP set (known as the Gladiator) is achieveable only through Arena wins, from what I understand.<br><br>The saving grace of the general PvP rewards for post-65 is probably the epic gems available for purchase.</div>

Hybrids get the short end of the stick, because they have factor in their raid purpose as well as for soloing.<br><br>Hybrids are any class with a function other than DPS'ing.<br><br>Warriors - Tanks<br>Priests - Healers<br>Druids - Healers<br>Paladins - Healers<br>Shamans - Healers (although in TBC they can almost behave as a full DPS class)<br><br>Warlocks, Mages, Rogues and Hunters are all very fortunate for their main goal can simply focus on DPS gear and equipment.<br><br>Paladins are fortunate that T2 is spell damage, or else they're equally screwed like Priests.<br><br>Perhaps a saving grace is that in BC, all Tier equipment can be chosen towards a different playing focus. Although at the end of the day, healing classes are just gonna be forced to choose healing gear. Pallies I guess are luckier as they are not expected to be main healers and can get away with spell damage gear rather than pure healing.<br><br>All I can say is that being a priest, you typically need a close group of friends to assist one another for every situation. My wife is lucky like that. Any thing her priest needs done, she'll bug me to assist her.<br><br>I note that in BC, alot of gear is centric towards a tanking paladin. This is certainly new ground, one that has been typically ignored.<br><br>I'm having serious temptations to go Shammie <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>
