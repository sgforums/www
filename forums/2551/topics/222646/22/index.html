            <div class='col-md body'>speaking about keeping the guild together.... i've had a couple of people quitting the game since TBC too, for different reasons. some simply got bored, and some i suspect are unhappy about not getting kara raid spots.<br><br>also, going by how raids now are so reliant on consumables, and it takes easily &gt;50g(that's if u're cheapo like me, use pots only and no flasking) for repairs per raiding night, i wouldn't be suprised if more raiders got burnt out sooner than later, and that's only made worse by the marginal upgrades in gear that drops from raid bosses.<br><br>see, the blue gear from the 5 men instances are not improved much by karazhan drops, yet the difficulty from Shade of Aran onwards is scaled alot higher than the +2 stam or +3 damage upgrades we get from gear. and actually if people bothered to do heroic dungeons, kara drops are sidegrades at best.<br><br>i saw my first prince kill last raidweek but it was done with the main raid group. strangely it's easier than aran, although it relies on alot of luck. ie. the placement of the infernals and if the boss decide to suddenly do a few crushing blows consecutively.. if they heng heng drops away from the raid, prince is practically a free kill. then...last night tried Nightbane and IIllhoof, the optional bosses. wipe like crazy. i can't see how they could be done with semi casual players honestly. bring 1-2 imcompetent players and that's it &gt;.&lt;<br><br>that said.... i'm going to make all my alts herbing and alchemy ^^<br><br></div>
