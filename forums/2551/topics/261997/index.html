            <div class='col-md body'>Ok, here i come with my thoughts.<br><br>To answer your question, 1stly we must determine your level as well as gear.<br><br>If you are pre-60, then without question go arms. Fury implies dual wield and the miss rate for DW is 24%. This would mean you require alot of + hit equipment and this is pretty much non existant pre-60.<br><br>Arms best benefits the use of a 2-hander and is subjected to the regular 5% miss rate which isnt too prohibitive.<br><br>Now if you are already post-60 the question now becomes, are you PvP/Arena focused or more towards PvE/raiding? If you are PvP, then go Arms. If PvE, then Fury.<br><br>However, with TBC, warriors are nerfed from the perspective of tanking/true dps. Fury warriors are no longer accepted as DPS classes in raids, especially in Kara. They can be considered post-Kara like SSC onwards, but that would mean your guild has to carry an unoptimised raider like you.<br><br>On the tanking front, you have to have Shield Slam to be a credible tank. This was significantly changed in TBC. Pre-TBC, arms or fury warriors could get away with just 13 points in Prot to get Defiance. But now with poor revenge/sunder scaling, warriors cant tank without shield slam.<br><br>Seriously, if you are leveling a warrior up, I suggest going a pure DPS class. Less worrisome in every aspect. The only true role a warrior has in TBC is to be a tank. Feral druids out perform in every way as an OT. If you don't intend to tank, don't go warrior. Unless you are satisfied with solely being in the arena and not much else.<br><br>Also do take note that weekly respecs are quite common. I know many warriors who are full prot during their raiding schedule and then switch to full Arms when the weekend hits. Respec cost at 50g, compared to daily quests netting 80-90g for a couple of hours is nothing these days.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>kara should be a non issue considering how much it has been nerfed. but key fights in kara, like Aran(who still occasionally gives trouble) for spell interrupts/high dps and nightbane for /assist targeting on the skellies still allow fury warriors to be useful.<br><br>also, consider arena season 2 gear and how easily it can be obtained. 90+dps 1handers for about 1+mths work. that should help tremendously in terms of gearing up.<br><br>if a guild min-maxes their raid setups consistently, it's likely to be less enjoyable being in 1 for the long-term anyway. imagine 5 rogues in a raid this month and 5 warriors in the next &gt;&lt;<br><br></div>
