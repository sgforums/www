            <div class='col-md body'>I have the version from 2004.  It is very good.  May also have a 2005 stashed somewhere.  SM teas are surprising good.  So far, the LBZ, MYC, DXS, and this PNLS have stood out.  Have lots more to test.  The chun jian seems quite good too.  Have not gotten to the YCC.<br><br>BTW, was told that the Menghai secret aroma is also very good.  Will be getting the sample soon.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div>
