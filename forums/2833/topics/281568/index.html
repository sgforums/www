            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Guys. I was brought to this place by a friend. This unique restaurant, though has been heavily feature in various magazines and papers, but I'm sure there are still many that are not aware of.<br><br>Its located on the slope of Club Street,along the row of shop houses. When I first stepped in, I thought to myself, "Oh well its going to be one of those Fri nites." But when we were about to make our order, I was rather amazed that they don't have any menu at all.<br><br>After the sumptuous meal of Mahi-Mahi and top grade wine, I spotted this cabinet. I should say its a East meets West kind of decoration/setup with the use of the owner's own tea collection and wine.<br><br>We had the honour that night to be treated to his 35 yrs old pu-er. Yes... Simply honoured !<br>I know you must be excited as to how the taste is like now.<br><br>I picked up the cup and smelt the tea, it did not give out much of an aroma. At that moment I thought to myself, "Sure or not ? 35 yrs? "<br><br>I sank my lips down for a tiny sip.... Ouch! Scalded my tongue.... I tasted nothing on my first mouth. The thing with this cup is that is that, its a double layered cup thats insulated by air. Therefore its easy for one to forgot the tea is hot.<br><br>I decided to let it cool for a moment, looking through the transparent tea cup, trying to spot if there's any "Zha". Being more careful this time, I took a 2nd tiny sip. Hmm..... I took a bigger sip. The feeling and the taste of it....<br>Oh Man....<br><br>Though I'm a newbie to tea appreciation, its unlike any which I've taste before. Imagine this, have you every apply those chinese medical oil for your bruises? Take tat smell and taste and lower it down by about 10 times. The amazing part of the tea is, the taste of the tea flow as one from the mouth to the throat. No taste of the tea lingers before once you've swallowed the mouthful of it. Its like the flow of mecury, so fluid. The 2nd brew was even better with as the taste of the tea becomes more prominent.<br><br>However, I decided to opt out after the 2nd brew as I was feeling "drunk". I'm not sure if the tea experts ever get "drunk" from tea. For me its a fantastic night.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sure thing kevin. Its at 54 Club St. Be prepared to get tipsy by either the wine or the tea there. The comfortable and relaxed ambience simply encouraged you to drink more. But don't take my words for it now, try it out yourself. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I just realised that we met at chinatown during one of the tea sessions.</div>
