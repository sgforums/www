              <div class="post-body entry-content">Liang Court is one of the places where Singapore's Japanese expatriate population congregate. Liu Hsiang ç•™é¦™ (which translates as "Lingering fragrance") is a cute little shop on the 3rd floor of Liang Court, and seems to be perpetually full of Japanese women taking classes in tea-appreciation.<br><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wTL8DFXmbh4/SYmyBTdco4I/AAAAAAAAAJY/GBvuHm_ifSw/s1600-h/Liu+Hsiang.jpg"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5298962172051497858" style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; width: 200px; cursor: pointer; height: 150px; text-align: center;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wTL8DFXmbh4/SYmyBTdco4I/AAAAAAAAAJY/GBvuHm_ifSw/s200/Liu+Hsiang.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br>The shop layout is very pretty, with porcelain on one side and tea on the other. The tea is attractively packaged and each packet has instructions printed on the back (tasting notes, amount of tea, water volume and temperature, infusion times and so forth).<br><br>We bought 25g packet of their <em>Iron Buddha</em> (the shop's translation of é�µè§€éŸ³ tiÄ›guÄ�nyÄ«n, which is more usually translated as "Iron Goddess of Mercy") for SGD9 (USD6.40), which was cheap, but a waste of money. The tea was past its sell-by date and had been re-roasted in an attempt to revive it. While it retained a little of its characteristic floral fragrance, this did not last beyond the second brewing. The leaves were tightly rolled, but had not survived well the mistreatment and fell to bits when coaxed open by the hot water.<br><br>The other tea we tried was the intriguingly named, <em>Unseen Heaven</em> ä¸�è¦‹å¤© (or, 'The Heavens are not visible'). It is a dark oolong, and the leaves are only loosely rolled, in keeping with most dark oolongs. The label says it is from Mount Wuyi in Fujian Province, and like most other Bohea oolongs, the fragrance is much milder and smoother, but with the same smokey dried-fruit sort of fragrance. Unfortunately, my palate is not sufficiently refined as to be able to distinguish between the different Bohea teas, and they all taste the same to me. This is my fault entirely, because I do not really like the style, so comments and corrections are welcome!<br><br>I could not find much information on the tea, but what I could find is translated here: "Beside the path that follows the JiÇ”lóngjiàn ä¹�é¾�æ¾— (mountain stream of the nine dragons), there is a rock, the east side of which is a recess and water from the stream pools within it. There are a number of old tea trees planted by the side of this rock which are said to enjoy the shade of the mountain and the light of the morning sun (é«˜å±±ä¹‹é™° æ—¥é™½ä¹‹æ—©). Here, the air is fresh, the situation is cool and moist, and the tea is therefore unusually good. A learned man described this place as 'The Heavens are not visible' and these words are captured on the side of the rock."
