            <div class='col-md body'>Hi everyone.<br><br>This is a call for one and all to start contributing tasting notes on all the chinese tea that you drink everyday.  Nothing very complicated.  Perhaps do the following:<br><br>1.  Identify the tea<br>2.  What utensils used<br>3.  What water used<br>4.  Temperature of water<br>5.  Time of steepage<br>6.  Taste of tea over the brews<br>7.  Your personal feeling.<br><br>Or make it simpler.  Just do 1 and 7.  Hehe.<br><br>What do you all think?<br><br>Views guys. or ladies.</div>

              <p>Too new in tea drinking must not try and dislike a tea everyone like. I think you were right about not pouring water directly onto the leaves.</p>
              <p>I was trying out the CNNP 6111 Jingmai Big Tree 2007. Forgot about yr comments when I first brew, I had a better 1st drink after 2 wash.  I next tried yr method, it was better. I m neutral to CNNP 6111 nothing spectacular. I return to the Mengku MYC 01, I found my taste buds again. I prefer the MYC to the 6111.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Langcang black gold purple bud 2006 to me had a unique taste, I never had before. It had a strong tannic after taste but very sweet after that.  It tasted medicinal (can I gather it was Camphor???) Anyway it was unique to me, something that I will try after I am more experience. Right now mmmm....</p>

              Hi guys.
              
              So sorry no sound no sight.  Couldn't get in.  Hence now registered a new nic.  hehe.
              
              I am surprised that the DXS tea tasted such.  Will try and revert with comments tomoro.  My previous experience wasn't like that. 
              
              Want to meet at my office to try the teas?

              <p>Kevin,</p>
              <p>Thanks. Langcang is unique but then again didnt drink enuf to differentiate though.  It had a medicinal taste. Very oolongish deep colour.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Tried also the Menghai Dayi 7262 2007 Ripe. 1 brew was like Jet Black. Again maybe my way of brewing... Drinkable but I put my $ on the 2006 Menghai Fu Hai tea sold at D'Art.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>DXS - plse dont take my word for it... Could be my 'cooking' of the tea.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Grrr..... if Thur Tras st tea session is on.. going to miss it. Going to Yangon Thurs....</p>

              Yo Kev,
              
              Which message?  I will check again.  BTW, this Thursday I am busy closing a deal. Heard that you tried the MYC001.  Comments? 
              
              BC, looks like you are having great fun testing all the teas.  That is so good.  Please continue commenting on them as you test them.  Appreciate the commentary.
              
              OK, I will try to arrange for another session soon.  Will have some interesting stuff to try for sure.  I still have the braided cake.  :)

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>Doing my best. I brought in 12 samplers and some cakes fm Dragon. Trying to taste n hopefully solve some of the green cake mystery. Bought a travelling Gaiwan set and a travelling kettle. Yangon cant be more interesting than my hotel room with 3 - 4 packets of various Tea leaves.</p>

              <p>Hi BC, hope you are having a good trip! If the water supply in the hotel makes the tea taste different from what you usually get, you may consider Volvic mineral water, or any other with a low calcium content of about 20msg and below...</p>
              <p>Bai Cha Tang? Seems like many people are into Bai Cha Tang...hmm...</p>

              <p>Hey Seb,</p>
              <p>Yup, did try the MYC001 along with the Chun Jian 07.  Between the two, the MYC001 is a better performer with more texture in the liquor, depths and nuance. the Chun Jian 07 seemed pale and light by comparison.</p>
              <p>I'd like to compare the MYC001 and 002 to see how they match up, and hope to document that in here if I can post pictures, or on my blog. Probably after CNY...or we can do it at your office one of these sessions? I'll be brewing them extra thick, so be forewarned... </p>

              Hi guys.
              
              Kev, I am surprised about the chun jian. When I tested it, it was intense.  Must try again.  As far as the myc is concerned, I tested the 001 and 002 side by side.  Still prefer the 001. 
              
              Let's find a day to go to the office to test.  Not a problem.  Can we post pics here?  I have all the mengku pics.  :D
              
              BC, I checked and there is no mention of the word mangshi. Will be great if we can find a nice tea factory.  BTW, your dehongs and teapot are with me now. :)Message me when you are back.  Will pass the tea to you.

              <p>Hi Seb,</p>
              <p>Thanks for replying within the timing on the email. Anyway Dehong is the Autonomous region in Yunnan. Luxi is the County and Manshi is the town. This is where the airport situated in. So that's settle.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We have the right region now hopefully it's the right factory as according to him there are a few factories.  Irregardless of which factory if he knows one of them it equates to more tea to taste....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Will try and call him to wish him during the holiday (wicked of me!!) and hopefully get info...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hope to meet up and take the Dehong soon...</p>

              <p>Hi guys, finally back to normalcy after the CNY.</p>
              <p>So here's my 2 cents on my tasting. ( Hope i could get tasting notes from others on what I drank so as to zero my tasting buds)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Mengyang Gouyan Classical 99 Green Cake 2007</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1st few brew was very volatile (perhaps too much leave but I tend to put more) Was strong. colour was deep yellow. </p>
              <p>After the 5th brew onwards good pleasant taste.  colour nice golden yellow.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Cheers... back with more tasting note... tell me to stop if you guys felt bored...</p>
