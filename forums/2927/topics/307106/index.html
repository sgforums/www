              <p><span>SINGAPORE: The world's biggest observation wheel is ready to spin
              in Singapore on Monday night, with corporate clients paying thousands
              of dollars for the "inaugural flight", the company said.
              <br> <br>At 165 metres or 42-storey high, the Singapore Flyer will be 30
              metres higher than Britain's London Eye, said Great Wheel Corp, which
              built the Singapore attraction.
              <br> <br>"We're actually ahead of time and on budget," David Beevers,
              general manager of the Singapore Flyer, told AFP from the waterfront
              site. "It's all systems go."
              <br> <br> The wheel will start twirling just before dusk Monday evening, at 1230 GMT, organisers said.
              <br> <br>The attraction's first three nights were sold out, Beevers said.
              Companies and individuals paid S$8,888, an auspicious number in Chinese
              culture, for the first rides.
              <br> <br>"Through the month of February... it's a whole series of private
              events each day that's going to allow us to ramp up to full opening
              March 1 for the public," Beevers said.
              <br> <br>Groups of between 600 and 1,000 people were expected at the initial
              private events, Beevers said, with a formal opening to take place on
              April 15.
              <br> <br>Unlike cramped, old-style Ferris wheel carriages which hang in the
              open air, the Singapore Flyer and other large observation wheels
              feature fixed "capsules".
              <br> <br>The 28 capsules -- about the size of a city bus -- are
              air-conditioned and can hold up to 28 people. Passengers can walk
              around and will not feel movement or vibration during the 30-minute
              ride, the company said.
              <br> <br>"You can put over 1,000 people an hour on the wheel," Beevers said,
              adding that they expect to host about 10 million people a year.
              <br> <br>Among the first clients will be SG Private Banking. The
              French-based global private wealth manager has booked 11 capsules for
              Wednesday night for its annual staff celebration of the Chinese New
              Year, said Pierre Baer, the company's Singapore and South Asia chief
              executive officer.
              <br> <br> Developers of Singapore Flyer said there was no comparison between a giant slowly-rotating observation wheel and a Ferris wheel.
              <br> <br>"We don't use the F-word," Florian Bollen, the chairman of
              Singapore Flyer, told reporters during a preview of the attraction last
              year.
              <br> <br>For S$29.50, walk-in passengers will get a 360-degree view of up to
              45 kilometres across the island republic and into neighbouring Malaysia
              and Indonesia on the 30-minute ride, the developers said.
              <br> <br> Higher-priced tickets include food and drinks.
              <br> <br>Bollen's Singapore-based company, Great Wheel Corp, is also
              building wheels in Beijing and Berlin which will edge out the Singapore
              Flyer as the world's biggest when they begin turning in about two
              years, he said.
              <br> <br> The London Eye, which opened at the turn of the century, was the first of the new generation wheels, Bollen said.
              <br> <br>Singapore's wheel is located across from the Marina Bay Sands
              casino complex, set to open in 2009, and is near the pit area of a
              Formula One Grand Prix street race to be held for the first time in the
              city-state in September.
              <br> <br> Lacking natural attractions, the wealthy island nation has embarked on a major campaign to spruce up its tourist appeal.
              <br> <br>A record 10.3 million visitors came to Singapore last year, an
              increase of 5.4 percent over 2006, the Singapore Tourism Board said.
              <br> <br> By 2015, the country aims to draw 17 million visitors and to earn S$30 billion in tourism revenues.
              <br> <br>The Singapore Flyer project, worth about S$240 million, is a
              private venture backed mainly by German investors. But Bollen said it
              received strong marketing and other support from the city-state's
              tourism board.
              <br> <br>Bollen said his company was the only bidder for the project
              designed by Kisho Kurokawa Architects and Associates of Tokyo, along
              with Singapore's DP Architects.
              <br> <br> The wheel was built by Mitsubishi Corp and Takenaka Corp of Japan.
              <br> <br>The Singapore Flyer is being marketed as a venue for activities
              ranging from business meetings to weddings. Packages for Valentine's
              Day are also being offered.
              <br> <br>Though a majority of revenue is expected to come from corporate
              clients and travel agents, the Flyer's marketing agent said 20 percent
              will be reserved for walk-in customers.
              <br> <br> Shops, restaurants and a tropical rainforest are among the attractions at the site that passengers can explore before "takeoff".
              <br> <br> Beevers said some of the retail and food outlets will be open by Monday and most should be ready by month's end.
              <br> <br> Ultimately, Bollen said, the experience was "all about the view."
