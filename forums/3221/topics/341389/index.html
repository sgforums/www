              <p>I was waiting for a parking lot along Upper Serangoon Rd. This place was very crowded and I waited for more than 15mins - still no sign of a lot. Finally a lot occupied by a taxi uncle was available. I moved my vehicle forward to make way for the taxi. While I trying to reverse into the lot, a toyota MPV "SGT 1676E", speed into the lot and seized it. I tried to tap horn him to signal to him, but he ignored me. I tapped on his driver window but he chose to ignore me again by looking in his In Car Entertainment system. Finally, he answered to my call and ask me what I want. I explained to him that I was parking into this lot when he dashed his car in. Guess what was he reply? He said "I have parked in already what you want....., not happy call TP summon me lah" (exact word coded).</p>
              <p>Together with the driver was his wife and 2 children. They stayed in their vehicle for quite awhile before heading to a "mixed rice" stall. This is not over yet. While his wife left the passenger seat, she said: "I see where you stay, Ang Mo chu, I remember your car plate anything wrong with my car, i will call police. (The driver added, Don't be childish lah.....") She knew that their barbaric action is despicable and worried of retribution or revenge . If their conscious is clear, do you think she needs to make such comment?</p>
              <p>What happen to Singaporean?? This couple seem educated but their behaviour is despicable. Next time if their children was caught stealing, they might say Well Done !!!</p>

              <p>this is very common ...  I had met quite of few of them and some even want to fight we me ...  today, I went hawker stall alone.  I found a  table and ordered my food.  The hawker give me a pair of chopstick, a spoon and a small plate of chille sauce.  Seeing this, I left my sun glass and went to buy drink.  When I returned, there were piles of plates on my table where originally it was cleaned.</p>
              <p>The hawkers scolded the three gentlemen with tie for placing the bowls and plates on my table when it was obviously clear that my table is taken and occcupied.  They don't even apologise went I returned..  what have you to say to that ?  Btw, I mentioned 3 men, they may or may not be Singaporeans... </p>

              <p><br>I don't think it the education system but rather how the parents bought them up and in turn how they teach their children.  TS mentioned there are two children in the car and they continue their behaviour..  how do you think the children will think ?</p>

              <p>This scene says alot on how far Singapore lags behind in terms of social graciousness.. Even simple thing up cleaning up after you finished your meals in the foodcourt, we need campaigns before we do it. We have been brought up tis way that someone will clean up after we finished the food.. Anyway they are paid to do it. But do we actually need them if we could show some social mindness to clean up??</p>
              <p>Our education system is definitely faulty. They do not focus on character buildup, social responsibility, civic mindness etc.. this is evidenced by how the youngsters behave. The age these youths start to commit their first crime seems to be lower and lower. </p>
              <p>Of cos, parents also play an important part. Its a vicious cycle.. If parents do not show proper guidance and played a bad role, these kids will definitely follow. Since you can do it, why I cant!!?? Probably the parents of the driver also showed bad example to him when he is young, which resulted in such uncouth behaviour. I pity him in fact.. next time when his kids grow up, they will behave the same.. But can our society continue to tolerate or accept such actions.. or his kids AGAIN like him condemned by the society???? Probably he should have kept this kind of barbaric actions when he is on the bed with his wife.. she will appreciate it more than others.</p>
