IT support?<br><br>(and a word about startups. you really need some good business models else you can't convince people to join in.. )<br><br>archer<br><br></div>

How you express yourself - whether you speak objectively or just use a personal point of view and hurl abuses - all these will be used as a gauge of your maturity level and attitude.<br><br>thus it becomes very important to be able to critise and evaluate objectively without using getting personally involved.<br><br>hope these tips help.<br><br>archer<br>~p.s. when you graduate har? can let me know via email?</div>
