If the international bodies at large can understand the english used, i wouldn't think that there is a problem with their english.<br><br>If you are talking about their accent, well, I've been working for 2 years, and have had quite some chances to interact with computing staff of various nationalities.

Your lecturers can play a part, but the amount of influence that they play is very limited: its always up to you how much you want to study and whether you want to clarify things with your lecturers and tutors instead of bitching away.<br><br>archer<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Jia lat.. now instead of having a forum for us to say something which we won't get "lectured" for , we have ARCHER...wat a wet blanket!<br>Can someone pls ask him to STOP LECTURING US?!<br>Things are different then and now.<br>Wat I said is purely out of my own experience. I don't expect you to agree but PURRRRLEEEESSSEE!!!!Don't gimme all those crap that I see from the comp sci BBS lah.<br><br>Archer first blabbered:<br>well, in the first place, no one forced you to enroll in computer science right?<br><br>secondly, school life is pretty much what you make of it. If you choose to be miserable, you will be.<br><br>thirdly, no one asked you to delay your lab projects and programming assignments till the last minute.<br>___________________________________________<br>Firstly , how was I suppose to know how FUCKED UP the tutors and system here is?<br>Secondly , I'm pretty much adjusted to the way things work here , THANK YOU VERY MUCH , I'm NOT some "tortured" computer science students...life is wat you made of it ...yaya.. I noe that lah... Don give me this kind of counselling SHIT.<br>AND THIRDLY , cs1101 labs are done ON THE SPOT. And like I alreadi said , I sometimes find 1102 lab better to handle.SINCE WHEN DID I SAY THAT I DID MY LABS LAST MINUTE?YOU GOT MY POINT WRONG , ARCHER.<br><br>archer ALSO wrote:<br>ah.. what an amazing motivation.. in that case, why do you bother about the lecturers? just take all the easy modules, go take all the IS modules and graduate, knowing nothing about the CS things.<br>____________________________________________<br><br>ONCE AGAIN , you are missing the point here.<br>I did NOT say that CS stuffs are unimportant.<br>But one thing you brought up is wat some people think -- that jus becos they do some CS modules they can look down on IS modules.<br>They think that they are GOD ...well things cannot be compared this way.Just like some people they are great at Maths and poor at Art and vice-versa.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Heyz.. i'd juz graduated from SOC too and i must say i do understand how u guys feel. Nutting beats being de 1st party yeah? Din like those PRC nor Indian lecturers where i had a hard time adjusting to their accents but we gotta learn to adjust to our environment sometimes too, no?<br>Frankly speaking, what Archer said has a point too. Itz part and parcel of life that we lament whenever we are unhappy abt something. Let it out; den, let it go. The more u choose to harp on it, de more miserable u're gonna make urself to be.<br>Frankly speaking, i aint much of de studious-type while i wuz still in SOC. In fact, i've had labels such as "Chiongster", "slacker", "eat-snake-queen" all tagged on me. SOC is not totally all work and no life. Your life is what u make it out to be. U choose to enjoy, juz be sure u know when to pace urself and catch up on ur work too. Itz all up to u. Have fun, Good luck and work hard  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
