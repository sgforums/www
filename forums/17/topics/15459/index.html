            <div class='col-md body'>stupid for banning the game or for wanting to play it? as far as i'm concerned its one form of stupidity countering another. stupid avenues are specially designed for stupid people lest they channel their stupid energy in socially or culturally stupid ways. and because of the level of stupidity involved, another greater level of stupidity is needed to curb it. not big deal. *yawn*<br><br>as long as there are stupid people there will be stupidity. fact o' life.<br>cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Half Life bloody?!? Get a life, I have no intention to be rude, but where did all these parents live in all this time? In a well? Thye think are Sadako or what? They should go out and see what the other games are offering, more gore, more violence, and the amount is exponientially immerse compared to Half life. I shall not give titles, least some other parent  shall read this and another game is than Ban. The Banning of Kingpin, has already cause dissapointment in a lot of gamers in Singapore, now that half life is ban, a major outrage might even  occur. Pls, I plead to the government, to open their eyes, to investigate the matter, totally, before we become the laughing stock of the world.<br><br>Haven't we always wanted to become the leading country in innovations and technology? Then how can we achieve such status, if we are to commit such folly? The education of children begins at home, it is the respondsibilty of the parent rather than the government to teach the children of how to differentiate between real life and the virtual world. Those who blame others when their children go astray, were never fully respondsible for their children, but rather they are shifting the blame from the oppressors to the oppressed. A Question here, are we progressing or are we regressing, to see things move around you does not mean that you are moving too. But rather you might be the one standing still.<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Just my $0.02 worth.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hee hee hee... I've posted in the petition to support the ban... read my reasoning below:<br><br>"This is one of the most impressive thing the censorship board have done in recent years. In the first place, why was DOOM and ULTIMATE DOOM not banned? And of course Wolf3D was one of the violent game of all time, why was it allowed in Singapore? But I do see improvement here in the banning of Halflife.<br><br>I hope the censorship board here applies some consistency, and ban Command &amp; Conquer(Tiberian Sun) as there are also plenty of Blood Violence inside.<br><br>And you know, RPG games like Diablo, Might&amp;Magic, Dungeon&amp;Dragon must also be banned. They advocate group violence, which is worse then Halflife, becos in Halflife, you control one person to kill. In those RPGs, you control a gang! This is going to psyche the Singapore youth into forming triads, which must be stopped of course!<br><br>I sincerely hope the consistent banning of such violent games will help Singapore prosper into a peaceful and serene heaven as opposed to the mass violence that we hv seen in western countries. Good luck!"<br><br>Not bad huh... at least we help make singapore a safer place to live in...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> The idea here is, if you want to play halflife, cross the causeway!   :p<br><br>------------------<br>Whens the end coming?

            <div class='col-md body'>I find it VERY unreasonalbe for half-life to be banned. I dun play that game but my roommate does, i saw him playing the game and find nothing wrong with it other than the gore.<br><br>But what is Ha;f-life's gore compared to doom, quake and the like.<br><br>Konami's PS game Silent hill is gory, so is REsident Evil. And they are available.<br><br>Rogue Spear, one of the closest to reality games, is also available. Though not so much gore. It is very realistic, if the Censors are scared about influence to the kids, does Rogue Spear influence too??<br><br>I find the Censorships have double standards when it comes to this matter. Not only on games but movies too.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I wonder why they never ban Hello Kitty?!? Well here is my argument.<br><br>HL shows animated violence, but Hello Kitty is causing real violences!<br><br>HL have life like blood, but Hello Kitty is causing blood to flow.<br><br>HL cause kids to hang around in LAN shops for hours. Hello Kitty causes aunties, uncles, young and old, ma and women, students and working professionals, to all queue for the kitty hours in advance, wasting precious time and money. Production and the economy decline because more people take leave to queue for Hello Kitty, Public services are disrupted, the police were called in, glasses were broken, and more siao lah were discovered. And Hello Kitty was not ban?!?<br><br>Talk about being rational, I am no trying to stereotype hello kitty buyers into the categories mentioned above, but my point being that the government should too not stereotype HL players into kids that hang around LAN shops and causing them to have poor results. At least, we dun queue up outside the LAN shop to play HL yet.<br><br>------------------------------------------<br>Just my $0.02 worth.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i strongly protest against the ban which i think is wrong. for the reasons why it should never be banned, i think, it is better for those interested to visit<br><a href="http://games.pacific.net.sg/halflife/" rel="nofollow">http://games.pacific.net.sg/halflife/</a><br>for more info and reasoning.<br><br>i wanna give my opinion on some of the people on this forum, sorry if i offend anyone in the process but i still gotta say it<br><br>1) Terence<br>i think u shld keep u mouth shut if u got nothing constructive to say. it is obvious how shallow and ignorant u are just by looking at u comments. u call gamers stupid, i dun think so, it is not so easy to be a good gamer but anyway i dun think i wanna discuss it cause u dun seem to have any gaming experience so it is too deep for u shallow head. to save yourself from a miserable existance, maybe u shld start with some real old games first, play tetris lah anything deeper will be too tough for u<br><br>2)Eck, sigh, wat u say is so dumb. u think the ban will only affect LAN shops? think again man, the reason why they ban HL is because it is a damn popular game now. so if they show that they can ban HL, then they can move on to easily ban every other game, Q3, UT. and when they are done with these 1st person shooters, they will ban all the other games, C &amp; C, Diablo, u name it, they ban it. People like u who think the ban is not gonna affect u shld think twice, cause soon, they will start knocking at u door and confiscating all you games. soon, u can join terence in playing tetris cause anything more is excessively violent. see how u like it then. and dun even think abt the game arcade, u think they will still be open? i dun think so.................<br><br>3) Bochup<br>i dunno wat to say to u, u must be a loser who gets picked on by professional games when u game right? else u will not welcome the ban. my point to u is, if u have not tried something before, u shld not give any opinions and try to be so righteous. u should cross the causeway not us gamers cause at malaysia, they got no HL servers, so t will be best for u! go there and climb trees and pluck banana. to think that there is a link between gaming and violence is extremely wrong. i dun think i want to convince u otherwise but maybe u go to this web site and take a look and see wat they say abt half-life first and then u go try the game first then u can say your opinion.<br><a href="http://games.pacific.net.sg/halflife/" rel="nofollow">http://games.pacific.net.sg/halflife/</a><br><br>I am sorry if anyone feels angry or think i am rude, fact is, u people should think before u say anything. and well, i will be glad to give anyone a lesson or two in half-life, counter-strike or Team Fortress. those that never heard of these games, never mind, never mind, stay ignorant and stay shallow, go pluck bananas and coconuts !</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What with S'pore's push to be a global IT hub,this high-handed move prompted by the ludicrous whim of some high-ranking MOE official not only exposes the ugly side of backdoors politicking that we never see,it's as good as shooting the fledging local game development industry in its newborn feet.<br>What with so much talk these days about the gov's effort to infuse creativity at all levels of society,opening up the society to new ideas,gearing up for a knowledge-based economy and hoping to attract overseas talent,do they have any idea of the kind of convoluted signal they are sending to people locally and abroad?<br><br>Extremely discouraged game developer,<br>EA-NYP Games Innovation Studio.</div>
