            <div class='col-md body'>How can Singapore aspire to become the region's IT Hub if MITA is so inadequate in handling computer issues?<br><br>A game banned and even the ban is not stated in a clear cut way. What a joke, Half-Life was banned by MITA even before MITA had taken a look at the game. Only when an appeal was made after the ban that they decided to properly evaluate Half Life.<br><br>Another recent issue handled inadequately was the JC Girls website issue. SingNet's public statement was also a joke. They stated that before removing a website, SingNet will contact the customer to enquire about the customer's intentions clearly first, but in the next sentence, SingNet said it IMMEDIATELY removed the JC Gilrs website when it got phone calls from the public. So what happened to contacting the customer first?<br><br>Singapore's officials involved in IT really need to grow up.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Assuming the people with whom we have vested our trust(read:votes) and hard-earned dollars(read:taxes) to govern the country with due respect to the democratic process are reasonable and well-educated(which I have no doubt they are),I am left to surmise that the real motive behind this ban must largely be attributed to backdoors politicking - the likes of which we S'poreans would like to think are only relegated to the ranks of 3rd world countries.<br>Let's face it,the justifications thrown up by the BFC are at best ill-founded,lame and fraught with inconsistencies.And it's pretty plain to everybody that this ban isn't really about the game itself,but is merely a front to hide the politicking playing behind closed curtains.<br>Give the BFC the benefit of the doubt,I'm pretty sure it's all too aware of the ludicrousity of the decision to ban HL on the grounds of excessive violence...who knows,when(if at all) they finally get their politically-muddled heads sobered up and start acting professionally and ethically,BFC will no longer be synonymous with the stigma of being a "narrow-minded parent" but instead be accepted as a politically-correct instrument of a true democratic gov.<br><br>Fledging local game developer.</div>
