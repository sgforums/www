            <div class='col-md body'>For those of you who plays F-Zero AX in the arcades (only Lot 1, Bishan Junction 8, and Causeway Point arcades have them), or F-Zero GX at home on your GameCube, here's a reason why you should start training.<br><br>"FORMAT<br>The mode of competition will be Time Attack. Basically, there will be 5 tracks chosen (a la grand prix), and every 5 competitors will take turns to run through each one of them (meaning, the 5 competitors have to run through the first track before we proceed to the 2nd one).<br><br>Time ghosts of each competitor's run will be saved, and will be activated for the following competitor's run. Hence, the last person to run through the track will benefit from racing against the save ghosts of all 4 of his competitors, and so the order in which the competitors run on the tracks will be reversed on every track (i.e. the first person to run the first track will become the last person to run the second track, and the first person to run the third track, etc).<br><br>For every track, the participant with the best run/time will be awarded 10 points. The second, 7 points. The third 5, fourth 3, and the last 2 points. Anyone who's retired (either off-course or machine brokedown) will not receive any points for that track. No retries will be allowed.<br><br>The winner of the group will be the one with the most total points at the end of all 5 tracks.<br><br>Here are the five tracks for the preliminaries, in the order that they will be tackled:<br><br>1) Aeropolis: Multiplex (Ruby Cup)<br>2) Port Town: Cylinder Wave (AX Cup)<br>3) Cosmo Terminal: Trident (Diamond Cup)<br>4) Mute City: Serial Gaps (Sapphire Cup)<br>5) Greenplant: Spiral (AX Cup)<br><br>Depending on the number of participants, either the winner of each group, or the winner and 1st runner-up of each group in the preliminaries will be entered into the Finals. The same rules from the preliminaries apply, but the 5 courses have changed. They are:<br><br>1) Port Town: Long Pipe (Sapphire Cup)<br>2) Fire Field: Undulation (Diamond Cup)<br>3) Lightning: Half Pipe (Emerald Cup)<br>4) Aeropolis: Dragon Slopes (Diamond Cup)<br>5) Big Blue: Ordeal (Emerald Cup)<br><br>Additional rules:<br>- Machines: all customised and original pilot-exclusive machines are allowed. No restrictions. Participants may choose a different machine for each and every race.<br>- Techniques: all special techniques allowed. None will be penalised.<br>- By participating, you are giving the organisers the copyrights to your ghost saves and replays taken during your play.<br>- Rules subject to change without notice. Still, I'll notify you if the change is significant.<br>- No restrictions as to who can participate. EVERYONE IS WELCOMED!<br>- All matches will be done on the NTSC/UC version of F-Zero GX.<br>- GameCube original controllers will be provided. However, participants are allowed to use their own third-party peripherals, including the Logicool Speed Force.<br><br>Technically, at the F-Zero GX tournament, everybody is a winner. Download ghost saves, replays, custom emblems, and swap knowledge at the event!!<br><br>However, the champion of this tournament shall nevertheless walk away with a devilish grin, after narrowly defeating rival speed demons, thanks to his newfound ability to game anywhere!<br><br>Prizes:<br>Champion - a GBA SP<br>1st runner-up - one game (on any console) of your choice*<br>2nd runner-up - a controller, or any peripheral with similar value, of your choice.<br>*subjected to availability at i-CON<br>Note: All prizes are tentative, subjective to the number of participants. If the number of participants is below 16, then the scale of the prizes will change to reflect the turn-out. Prizes sponsored by i-CON PTE LTD.<br><br>Registration fees is $15 per entry/person. Yes, for 15, you can pit yourself against the rest of the local F-Zero pilots and see where you stand in 5 or 10 dramatic races, and also stand a chance to win a GBA SP, a game, or a peripheral. The experience will no doubt be a fresh and exciting one.<br><br>DATE: December 6 and 7<br>TIME: Afternoon<br>VENUE: i-CON PTE LTD<br>ADDRESS:<br>175 Bencoolen Street, #01-20 Burlington Sq, Singapore 189649<br>Opening Hours: 11am - 11pm daily<br>For enquiries, please call 6336-8776<br>MAP: <a href="http://www.i-con.com.sg/#" rel="nofollow">http://www.i-con.com.sg/#</a><br><br>REGISTRATION DETAILS<br>Registration begins now, all the way until the 31st of November.<br><br><strong>To register, please send an email entitled 'Pilot Registration' to <a href="mailto:fzero@chengkai.sggamers.net" rel="nofollow">fzero@chengkai.sggamers.net</a> with the following details:</strong><br><br>Name (as in NRIC):<br>IC no.:<br>Date of Birth:<br>Contact number:<br>Mailing Address:<br>Email address:<br><br>Note: the email address you provide MUST be the same as the email address you use to mail the application in.<br><br>The $15 registration fee is to be paid only on the actual day of the competition, at i-CON.<br><br>Feel free to email to <a href="mailto:fzero@chengkai.sggamers.net" rel="nofollow">fzero@chengkai.sggamers.net</a> as well, should you have any queries. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Number of tournament participants is limited to 32. Please register early to avoid disappointment.<br><br>See you at the race tracks!<br><br>P.S. the success of this tournament will decide the fate of a Mario Kart: Double Dash LAN tournament. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">"<br><br>Apparently, it also seems that if at least 5 people would like to use the GameCube Logicool Speed Force wheel (which is something like the arcade steering wheel), the organisers will provide it.<br>@ _ @</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Haha, before F-Zero AX, the last arcade game I was crazy about was..... Capcom Vs SNK 2. @ _ @ Okay, so CvS2 is relatively newer than Virtua Striker 2... but still.<br><br>Anyway, have you tried AX? You might want to. It may change your perspective on how racing games should be like. The speed is I N T E N S E!!<br><br>Let me quote that guy on the Guiness beer ad: 'Get that job! Get that girl! Get that house! Get that GBA SP! Someone's gonna do it. Why not you? Never try, never know.'</div>
