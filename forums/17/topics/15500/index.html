            <div class='col-md body'>Well, the problem lies in the price of DVD players in Japan. This is the main reason why consumers in Japan get PS2. DVD players in Japan are far too expensive as compared to the price of a PS2.<br><br>Taking that into consideration, PS2 is still superior to DC in many ways. Esp talking about graphics. The processing power of PS2 is far greater than DC. The 32 megs of RAM in PS2 in comparison to 16 megs of RAM in DC makes it a even better machine.<br><br>Now perhaps u wanna say its a more difficult machine to develop for? Yes, to a certain extent. However, Sony has given developers great tools for the developing of games. They even send down their own programmers to go down to teach the game develepors ways to make games run better and more beautifully.<br><br>Now for DC. DC is great in the aspect that its the first to incorapate a modem into a console. And yes, the first ever internet RPG is out in stores now. No doubt its very cool but things wun get better if SEGA does not release the broadband adapter soon into the market. Only with broadband capabilites will internet gaming excel.<br><br>Thats all for now.<br>Till then..<br><br>Yours Forever,<br>Jiang Chen<br><br>------------------<br>"Jiang Shi De Li Liang Shi Lai Zi Ai, Bu Shi Hen."<br>(The strength of a vampire comes from love, not hatred)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Jiang Chen:</strong> they sent their programmers cause the devs still are having a damn hard time makin games for this machine... im not talkin about just makin games ere... im talkin about optimising the games.<br><br>PS2 has only <strong>1MB</strong> of VRAM. the 32 megs u mentioned is just the main mem. the developers are having a hard time to cope with the oh-soo-low VRAM... the only way is by swapping the grapic stuffs to and fro the VRAM and the main mem. while the devs can swap since the bandwith is high right now, but ask yerself for how long?<br><br>broadband adapter. i dun really care if sega releases this thing. cause theres no use ere in Msia (maybe in Spore also) since itll be way too expensive...<br><br>i have a Dreamcast. i planned to buy a PS2. y? simple. Sega keep releasing AAA titles. and not just AAA titles, unique original AAA titles. in other words, games that u never imagined before.<br>Jet Gring Radio: Vandalism....<br>Seaman: Cool tamagotchi for gamers...<br>Sonic Adventure: damn fast 3d...<br>Samba de Amigo: just play it with maracas...<br>Phantasy Star Online: ONLINE(not yet thou..).<br>Crazy Taxi: Try play the arcade version...<br>and last but not least...<br>Soul Calibur: best balanced fighting game. period. i wasted RM5 per day for 6 months in the arcades because of this game alone.<br><br>and i have all these games. plus arcade games on DC. thats a big plus point for DC. but ill probably buy PS2, but not right now. maybe later a year or two. but right now, <strong>DREAMCAST IS THE KING.</strong> im having a really good time right now, playing Marvel vs Capcom 2, SNK vs Capcom, DOA2, Soul Calibur, SF3, Silent Scope, Daytona, and [insert arcade game here] in my living room.<br><br>fuuh.... and to think this is just my first post in ere...<br><br>------------------<br>Now say it with me... fuuud is guuuud...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>youre right C-fu...ps2 is lack of vram and its 32meg ram is not good too. cause it cannot compress data like dreamcast did. so ps2 will have to make all its data straight without compression ans it will use a lot of space and time.<br>it is not that i dont like ps2 but now it seems the programmer still not yet figure out ways to fully utilized it. as a result all the games end up not anti aliased like what dreamcast has done. every games in ps2 has jaggies.<br>ps2 is a machine thats is very powerful but as always i will stick to my dreamcast because of their aaa's title and wait when the ps2 will show their power in future..<br><br>one more thing if u guys really lke this kind of forum i think u all shall go to  <a href="http://www.cloudchaser.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.cloudchaser.com</a><br>it is a forum where many gamers all around the world discuss...<br><br></div>
