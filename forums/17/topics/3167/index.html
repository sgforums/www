            <div class='col-md body'>The best RPG so far (for me), sorted :<br><br>1. Final Fantasy 7, it is a pioneer of all 3D pre-rendered games, is really a masterpiece. The storyline is very fun too.<br><br>2. Legend of Dragoon, play it ! You will miss it so much ! Unlike FF7 which I can finish it in 1 week, this Legend of Dragoon take me 2 weeks. Nice storyline too ...<br><br>3. Xenogear, I love how Squaresoft included gundam style of robot in their games. The battle is fun, all is in full 3D environment (except the characters).<br><br>4. Vagrant Story, if you like Diablo, I told you ... this is 2 times better.<br><br>5. Final Fantasy 8, Squaresoft started to include romance in their RPG. Nice ! but, the battle is too boring, especially when drawing certain magic from monster ... The graphic is nice though ...<br><br>Final Fantasy 9, I never play this game before, but the character design is very childish, I don't like it... Even somebody give it to me for free, I would not bother to play it...<br><br>Chrono Tiger II, I play for 1 week then get bored...<br><br>I think SquareSoft must developed a RPG which include :<br><br>1. Realistic characters (not cartoon with big-head-childish-typo like FF9), FF8 is just nice !<br><br>2. Have romance-kind of story, just like FF8<br><br>3. Nice battle, just like FF7, perhaps with Xenogears/Legend of Dragoon battle style too.<br><br>4. Good storyline like FF7+FF8+Legend of Dragoon, and don't end too fast. Xenogears is a good example, I took 1 month to finish it ! Breath of fire III is another good example too, very long story, but no romance though...<br><br>5. Don't include too much characters like Chrono Trigger, it confused gamers to choose which one is their favourites. Just 5-7 main characters like FF7 are fine, basically can only choose 3 players when go battle.<br><br>6. Multilinear storyline is fine too.<br><br>7. Monster appears not randomly like FF7/FF8, but make it appears like Chrono. Battle will occur if only player touch the monsters.<br><br>8. To make it even more interesting, I think it is better to include feature like Front Mission II, let every player has its Robot, player can upgrade the parts (like leg, arms, gun, backpack, engine, etc). This will be fun ...<br><br>Anyone agree ?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>1. Realistic characters (not cartoon with big-head-childish-typo like FF9), FF8 is just nice !<br>y should they? so u mean, if they make an RPG with cartoony heads, the game will suck? wow i didnt know that.<br><br>2. Have romance-kind of story, just like FF8<br>dude ur a grrl or what?<br><br>3. Nice battle, just like FF7, perhaps with Xenogears/Legend of Dragoon battle style too.<br>Active TurnBased battle is FF-standard. u want VS kinda battle? go play VS lah.<br><br>4. Good storyline like FF7+FF8+Legend of Dragoon, and don't end too fast. Xenogears is a good example, I took 1 month to finish it ! Breath of fire III is another good example too, very long story, but no romance though...<br>so goood story = romance? sheeeesh<br><br>5. Don't include too much characters like Chrono Trigger, it confused gamers to choose which one is their favourites. Just 5-7 main characters like FF7 are fine, basically can only choose 3 players when go battle.<br>Since when do ppl get confused to which character is better??? they can always choose.... maybe ur fussy man.<br><br>6. Multilinear storyline is fine too.<br>FF4-6 has them, 7 is a bit linear, 8 n 9? pshhhhh<br><br>7. Monster appears not randomly like FF7/FF8, but make it appears like Chrono. Battle will occur if only player touch the monsters.<br>Leave that to Chrono franchise.<br><br>8. To make it even more interesting, I think it is better to include feature like Front Mission II, let every player has its Robot, player can upgrade the parts (like leg, arms, gun, backpack, engine, etc). This will be fun ...<br>no. this wont be FF.</div>
