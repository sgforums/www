            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>I bought a PS2 a few weeks ago without gathering enough information and realised that I was tricked by the retailer.<br>It was partly my fault for not gathering enough information but anyway I hope that no one else will get tricked.<br>Below are the following lies that the person told me.<br><br>1) He claim that ALL PS2 games do not support PS controllers and I found out that some actually do,luckily I did not buy another controller as most of my games actually support the PS controller.<br><br>2) When I asked him whether my set is a Japan set that can play original games from Japan he told me that it is. I have heard quite a number of bad things about Pal machines about how they get their games later than US versions and Japanese versions. Unfortunately I did not know the way to checked whether the set is from Japan or at least USA. I only found out recently when I saw the number SCPH-30004 on my machine and realised that I was tricked. It was partly my fault for not finding the method to check which region the PS2 is from. The problem is I already got my friend to buy a ORIGINAL Japanese game Shin sangoku Musou 2 and the game could not work. Some of you might asked why I would buy a original game the problem is that the copied version of the DVD games are in CD-rom format and there are missing music,endings,FMVs and stages from the game. Another reason why I might not be playing FFX as I can't play the original and since the game is in DVD format if I'm not wrong the FMVS is likely to be missing from the CD-rom version.<br><br>3) The retailer also told me that my PS2 would be able to play my old PS games but when I tried they could not boot and then he told me that DVD region X does not support PS games and then say that no one plays PS games on PS2. What a lame excuse.<br><br>4)Now on to DVD region X. I have actually wanted to buy the Action replay as a boot disc but the retailer told me lies like the action replay card will damage your memory card slot and that that in turn will damage your memory card. He then told me that DVD region X will cost 50 dollars more and I bought it. Later I found out from my friends and from web sites online that DVD region X is actually cheaper than Action replay. Thus if you still want to play your PS copied games on your PS2 do not buy DVD region X but if you still want DVD region X to watch DVD movies from all regions do INSIST on a price cut.<br><br>Anyway this will be the first and last time I will be posting on this board. I hope that you will spread the message to your friends who intend to buy a PS2 in Singapore.I bought my set from Sim Lim Square's shop #01-47.<br>I know I shouldn't name the shop but the retailer was too treacherous and I hope no one else would be tricked. Lasly I also hope that if anyone wants to buy a PS2 that they would check that they are getting a Japanese version or an American version and yes please check the serial numbers to make sure. You can easily find out the serial numbers on the web, do not make the same mistake that I made.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You are so unlucky, anyway i got a PS2 myself on sat at Sim Lim Square too, but I did not modify it. I have research quite alot from website and hearing reviews from ppl. Although I pay a little bit more, I ensure that my US set is sealed and only open infront of me.<br><br>even if you buy a unmodified set, please make sure that it is real unmodified, some shops resell sets that is having a problem after they can't modified it. although it is a bit cheaper, who knows what will happen<br><br>Please be more careful, everyone, modified set is dangerous...<br><br>---------------------------------------------<br><br>May the force be with you</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi ppl! got a quest. recently bought a U.S. ps2 from sim lim and kindof gotten tricked. the guy told me that after modifying the set, i could play any games. however, i soon realised that i couldn't play dvd copied games. heard that i had to modify it again. went to a shop and found out that in order to play copied dvd, on top of modifying, had to buy an action replay v1.99 as well as an original dvd game to boot the copied game. changed my mind as i already had a action replay v2 and felt that it would cost 2 much. do any of you guys know of any solution to play copied dvd at a cheaper price or something? or do i have jus have to wait till a later modification comes up?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi!<br><br>I just came across this site by chance and saw this interesting article.<br><br>I own a PS2 myself and will share my 2 cents worth of knowledge to all who intend to buy one in the future.<br><br>Currently, there are 3 different types of PS2 systems in the market:<br>Â•	PAL (UK)<br>Â•	NTSC Â– J (JAP)<br>Â•	NTSC Â– U/C (US)<br><br>And because of security issues, games will not run outside of their own markets (unless modified).<br><br>Before I touch on modification, let me make it clear that any form of modification will require the system to be opened, a chip to be installed and soldered.<br>Please keep in mind that these modifications are done locally, most of the time by the shops themselves. So if you really intend to get a modified one, do get from a shop you trust.<br><br>That being said, let me introduce 3 main types of modification:<br><br>1)	NeoKey / External Mod / USB Mod<br>2)	Orriga Chipset<br>3)	Messiah chipset<br><br>The first form of modification is the cheapest of all. Known as a Neo Key or External Mod or USB Mod, it cost only about $60. However, it is also the worst mod chip of all.<br>This mod chip requires an adaptor to be plugged into the front of the PS2 via the USB ports and the installation of a single jumper wire inside the system.<br>Please take note that this mod chip only allows the system to playback copy CD-ROM games. Copy DVD games cannot be played at all. If we were to do a simple check, you will realize that most PS2 games are DVD games. So this makes the Neo Key a lousy mod.<br><br>The Orriga chipset is an improved version of mod compared to the Neo Key. This requires no external adaptor but needs numerous wires to be soldered onto the motherboard. This modchip allows the system to playback CD-ROM and DVD games. BUT the booting of the system to play copy games is very tedious. To play CD-ROM games, we need to boot the system with either a Gameshark 2 or Action Replay 2 disc, after which we will need to swap the bootdisc with the CD game we want to play. If we want to play copy DVD games, we will also need an original DVD game with a larger capacity of the copy DVD game to boot up the system.<br>All being said, the Orriga chipset is not very stable. Feedback from friends is that it will cause systems to hang quite often. Costs is around $200.<br><br>The final modchip (messiah) is the one everyone is supposedly waiting for. It still needs major soldering of wires but the good thing is that after the modification, the system is supposed to behave like any original system. All games: originals, imports, copy CD-DVD ROMs can all be played without needing to do any disc swapping. Cost is around $200. However, please take note that this chip is designed specifically for the PAL system and thus may not work on JAP or US models.<br><br>With so much said, some of you must think that I have tried all the different types of mods. No. I am a true gamer and I only play originals. On many occasions, the idea of modifying my system did cross my mind. But I never did want anyone to open my system and start putting extra wires especially since I paid so much money for it.<br><br>So the question now is if you intend to buy an original system, which should you go for?<br>This I cannot decide for you as each has itÂ’s pros and cons. What I can do is provide you with some insights of each system.<br><br>First of all, when we purchase a console, itÂ’s intention is to play games. So the first objective you should keep in mind is that the system should have the games you want.<br>Most games do appear in all systems, itÂ’s just a matter of when. The release dates of JAP and US games is usually not that far apart. The one major consideration is that JAP games are mostly in Japanese. And unless you can understand itÂ’s language, it might not be worthwhile to pay so much and in the end not knowing exactly what the game is all about.<br><br>Jap games are slightly cheaper (about $10 - $20) than their US counterparts.<br><br>If you were to shop around for games, you will notice that the majority are NTSC Â– U/C. This means that the game is intended to run on US machines. I should estimate that in Singapore currently, about 50% are US games, 35% JAP and only 15% UK games.<br><br>For me personally, I bought a US machine because I want to appreciate every game I play. The only and biggest setback is that Winning Eleven 6 is not out for the US markets. I guess soccer is just not their game.<br><br>PAL systems are not very popular in Singapore and there arenÂ’t many games available for it either; at least not many locally.<br><br>To end off, whether you want purchase an original PS2 system or a modified one is all up to you. I hope my article can help you make a better choice and at the same time avoid being cheated.<br><br>Thanks.<br><br>Andrew<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well , i was indeed very lucky not to buy my Ps2 in Sim Lim Square last year. I was nearly tricked by those idiots you people talk about. In the end i bought my Ps2 at Toa Payoh. I bought from them an NTSC U/C set without being modified.... I trusted them as they explained to me everything about the modifications and Dvd region codes....<br>Hence i got my set modified by them. It's indeed very safe as i see the retailer modifiying my set with my own eyes, making sure that nothing bad happens. From then on i'm able to play all games from all regions including DVD format games.....but the setback was i had to use a bootup disc. Though it's quite troublesome, i was thankful that i wasn't tricked....<br>However i have a question for andrew, as what you had stated, i got myself a orriga chip right?....however the retailer only used two wires to connect the chip up and my system never hang....what does this mean?<br>To all those wanting to buy a PS2 now.....my advice is buy an US original system.....then decide on whether you really want to modify your system cos it's kind of dangerous to modify them....Another arising problem might be, after you modified your system you may not be able to log on into the internet with the network adapter that is out now in the US.<br>By the way, anyone interested in playing online games on PS2??<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Caremount,<br><br>It's good to know that you are happy with your new PS2 system and that everything runs well.<br><br>To answer your question, I'm not entirely sure whether yours is an Orriga chip (it could be a better chip which does similar functions). The most important thing is that your system runs well and that's great. I have not tried running on an orriga chip myself, the system hang issue was brought to my attention from a friend of mine.<br><br>If for any reasons in the future you might want to change to a no-swap mod, be sure to read up on it on the internet before deciding on anything.<br><br>It's quite easy, just go to www.google.com and search for PS2 mod or equivalent and you will get to see an entire list of documents relating to modifying PS2s.<br><br>Hope this helps!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Regards,<br>Andrew</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Andrew,<br>Was reading what u wrote and i'm totally impressed with your knowledge on the game console. But i have read other acticles about people modifying their sets and lots of them get cheated in the end. I really hope to be able to play all games from all regions(including dvd cpoied games...) but if in that case... who can i trust in our money seeking salesman in singapore... any shops that u recommend. I have PS2 from aussie...so is it the same code as the UK sets? So which mod chip should i go for? Thanks... awaiting your reply</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi gfac,<br><br>Sorry for late reply. Was very busy with work as of late.<br>First and foremost, let me address your issue of playing region free games. Remember, whenever anyone tampers with your system (opening it) there is a certain amount of risk involved regardless of however experienced they may be. Under normal circumstances, it should be fine.<br>I do not think I should help anyone promote their products or services here but my advise is to shop around and talk to people in order to learn more about the services and products.<br>Do not just look at the prices people offer but instead ask more into it (e.g. what type of chip is being used, is it autoload...etc.)<br>A good place to read up would be via the internet. You can find loads of information pertaining to PS2 and the various modifications available.<br>Hope this helps a little.<br><br>oh yes... I believe both the australia and UK PS2 runs on PAL.<br><br>Regards.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is better to shop around and explore your options before buying a PS2 hastily. But i found the comic shop in Toa Payoh ( The one with 2 floors) to be quite trustworthy with their goods and the salesmen there(The twins) are rather knowledgeable with their trade.</div>
