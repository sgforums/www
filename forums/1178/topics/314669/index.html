            <div class='col-md body'><p>Hi. I am a first year student. Anyone had difficulties facing PBL? As in find it hard to cope wih the system. At first i am ok with presenting but after 1 week, i dont quite enjoy it anymore. Its like doing presentations for 5 days. Why cant we do reports or do at least 1 presentation for each module. And somemore its graded daily. For someone who may be moody or silent for that day, isnt he/she gonna lose out during presentations. Cant the whole system be abit more flexible. I grow very bored after doing this over and over again. I usually lose focus on the problem and thus i dont understand the whole thing. Everytime I present, my mind will lose focus and become blank. I am very lost at the moment and I need advice and tips to survive PBL. Thanks. Your every help and advice will be appreciated. :D</p></div>

              <p>There is too much PBL in republic poly. Unless you are 'siao on', 'desperate to score good grades' or naturally talkative, you are going to get tired of PBL in that poly.</p>
              <p>Personally, i believe even other polys (ngee ann, singapore poly etc) are also moving towards more PBL, presenting. However, they put a check on the maximum % presenting and project can give.</p>
              <p>So for them, their total Ca calculation is like</p>
              <p>Tutorial and participation 30%</p>
              <p>Project or test 30%</p>
              <p>Exam 40%</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The good thing for Republic poly students is they dont need exams.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Too much of a certain thing is never a good thing at all. Last time, NTU's certain modules' grading is 100% exam. What if you have stomachache that day lol.</p>

              <p>To survive PBL: Read just enough to get the gist of what the problem is asking you to learn on, then participate on bare minimum during the 1st, 2nd and before the 3rd meeting, do 1 or 2 slides and understand them very clearly and present them as per normal.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To excel PBL: Active participation is a bare minimum, you've got to participate well throughout and be attentive. And for the problem itself you've got to read everything thoroughly and understand everything, do a couple of slides and present them. Ability to answer questions that is not directed at your slides/or what you've presented will be a plus point.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway, you'll learn with time. In year 1 i present chunk loads  full of words and nothing but words but gradually i replace them with words and illustrations. It helps alot because facilitators wants to know that you know your stuffs (very evident if you can present illustrations without referring to anything) or just reading out from your slides.</p>
