              <p>My today's RJ (for B215, Financial Accounting) is:</p>
              <p>"What learning obstacles did I face today?  Who are the assets and liabilities in your team.  Justify."</p>
              <p>The liabilities part is more of backstabbing lo... But today my whole team did a very good job and effort.... So I will say something like there is no liabilities in my team..</p>

              <p><br>Talking about backstab part, my today's RJ question for Financial Accounting module is:</p>
              <p><strong>Question:</strong>Evaluate your members (including yourself), on the level of competency they have for the module.  Justify your evaluation.</p>
              <p><br>And probably, this is 1 of the longest RJ I have written so far throughout my life in RP... (Notice I didn't backstab any people but to really help them as my team is really very cooperative and in a way all of us have done our best =)</p>
              <p><strong>Response:</strong><br>I will evaluate on myself first follow by my teammates.<br><br>For myself, I find that I am actually quite strong in<br>this module, probably due to my prior knowledge that I<br>have gained during Secondary 3 to 5 when I took up POA<br>(Principles of Accounting) as 1 of the subjects. I<br>actually scored quite well in most of my POA tests and<br>exams, at least a B grade, and also have quite a strong<br>foundation in the area of calculations, I actually refer<br>to my Ten-Year-Series (TYS) book that I have bought, and<br>keep practicing the questions until I really fully<br>understand the whole concept, and also for the fact that<br>I did actually coach my peers who were weak in this<br>subject and it helps to enhance my learning as well in a<br>way that I can recap all the knowledge and concepts that<br>I have learned so far.<br><br>For **person B**, I find that she is actually quite weak in it,<br>but she really puts in 100 of her effort and hardwork<br>to try to understand the concepts behind it as much as<br>possible. It's a pity that she did not take up POA as 1<br>of the subjects for upper secondary level, hence she did<br>not have prior knowledge of accounting and foundation<br>before this module (Financial Accounting). However, she<br>is very helpful in this team in a sense that she really<br>tries her very best to help out in whatever she can do,<br>such as doing up the PowerPoint slides while the rest of<br>us are trying very hard to figure out for the<br>calculation part in all the accounts that we did.<br><br>For **person C**, I find that he has a very strong foundation<br>and prior knowledge in accounting. He told me before<br>that he scored a B grade in his O level exam for POA,<br>and he has a strong determination and confidence that he<br>would be able to get all the calculations for all the<br>accounts and ledgers right. He is also very helpful in a<br>way that he would help the weaker ones to make sure that<br>they really understand the whole concept of a particular<br>thing, and having initiatives to start the discussion<br>going during the first meeting after the problem<br>statement for the day is being released. <br><br>For **person D**, I find that he is actually quite weak in<br>it, although he took POA as 1 of the subject in upper<br>secondary level, but he did not score well during the O<br>level. His foundation is actually not too bad because he<br>has been exposed to the accounting concepts through POA,<br>just that he needs to practice more, just like<br>Mathematics when we also practice more to gain a better<br>understanding and foundation in the subject. He’s<br>actually quite helpful also in a way that he tried his<br>best to help to solve the problem.<br><br>For **person E**, I find that she also has a very strong<br>foundation and prior knowledge in accounting. She also<br>scored the same grade as me during the O level for POA.<br>She is also very determined and willing to help her<br>teammates whenever they need any help in understanding<br>the concepts in accounting. She also has the initiative<br>to start the discussion going during the first meeting<br>after the problem statement for the day is being<br>released, as usually, we would be sitting down there<br>waiting for other teammates to start the discussion.</p>
