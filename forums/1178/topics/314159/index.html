              <p>Would really like to hear your feedbacks or complaints about the bus
                  services that you frequently take to school, and hopefully, when the
                  next RP student forum coming up, we will be able to voice out all our
                  feedbacks (especially negative ones, be it SMRT or SBS Transit) to the student councillors so that actions can be taken...
                  If NUS forum can do it so successfully for their Service 151, I can't see why we cannot do it for ours also... I shall start my ball rolling...</p>
              <p>7:50am is the usual time I reach my house bus stop (Blk 270, Bt
                  Panjang Rd, the bus stop just before BKE for those who know). At about
                  7:55am,
                  1 Service 966 and 1 Service 963 bus arrived together (usually is
                  TIB565U for Service 966 and TIB726Y for Service 963). There was once in
                  this week which both buses ARRIVED and SKIPPED that bus stop TOGETHER
                  and hence leaving a crowd of people waiting for buses which brings them
                  to Woodlands, at least about 30 - 45 people were affected at that point
                  of time (worst case if raining).</p>
              <p>In less than 5 minutes after that, a Service 187 bendy bus arrived,
                  and from less than 20 people standing, to "packed to the entrance
                  door"...</p>
              <p>Woodlands Regional Interchange is even more worst! With the poor
                  efficiency of SMRT Buses, and for a pathetic fleet of 2 bendy buses and
                  2 rigid buses for Service 902 + some pathetic Service 169 bendy which
                  many non-RP people taking it also.. Clever people who reached Woodlands Regional Interchange at around 8am onwards, will queue for Service 169, as waiting for Service 902 = waiting for DEATH in Chinese = waiting to be LATE for lesson...</p>
              <p>What I have been thinking all the while, is that Service 161 and 168 to be amended to ply Republic Polytechnic during morning peak hours at least, to ease the crowd for Service 902 since SMRT Buses as a company, is well known for POOR EFFICIENCY and SCREW things up especially during peak hours...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>How about your views?</p>

              <p>As for the 169, I think that it greatly affect the adults who are going to work. Because of us students, they are not able to get onto the bus and so they will have to wait another 10 min for another 169 to come by.</p>
              <p> Reply to your topic hahas... Hmm yes. i think that they shld get other bus service during that peak hour. to prevent this crowd.</p>

              <p>Me thinks it won't be successful. One reason is because RP is only 2 bus stops away from Woodlands station. About half the population walks to school from the station. The rest take bus. On rainy days, it's an execption though...</p>
              <p>Besides... RP has already catered a bus for us... not too sure on the frequency.</p>

              <p><br>Service 902.. The frequency is seriously screwed up and on average, if a person stand at Service 902 queue and wait for that service, it will take abt 2-4 Service 902 buses in order for you to be able to board on it, which also means, if you start queuing up at around 8:10am onwards and your reporting time is 8:30am, then 95% you will be LATE for lesson. Moreover, RP system has taken away the privilege of 15-minutes grace period... Hence, to play safe, we have to reach Woodlands Regional Int (for those who taking Service 902) at least half an hour before our lesson starts...</p>

              <p>Actually to say, for that 1 hour its okay for them to add on a few more buses on service.</p>
              <p>The frequency of  bus coming is low. Thus that the reason for the long queue wad..</p>
              <p>And partial reason for people walking to sch is because they feel that they will be late waiting for the bus.</p>
              <p>However TIB, u does not have to wait till 4 bus that bad.. around 2 bus usually u can go up liaos. unless u very unlucky. the second bus which come is those short ones</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>SMRT is one of the oddest companies around. 169 is forever having a long queue during peak hours, but the frequency is bad. And to add on... only a portion of 169s are bendys, the rest are just normal buses. On the other hand, some buses (especially the 900 odd ones), have pretty regular frequency and most of them are bendys.</p></div>
