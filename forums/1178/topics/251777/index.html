            <div class='col-md body'>PBL are used in medical programs in university, not sure about singapore though. But i know med sch in US adopt this learning method. And there is no ranking of polys. If a guy from SP gets a GPA of 2.5, it means his dedication to his work will be 2.5 and i seriously doubt the employer will hire this particular guy.<br><br>Students from other poly will be the same. They copy each other reports just like students in RP copy each other ppt. So give PBL a chance. Don't go around bashing if you don't really know much.<br><br>Btw, i'm a graduate from RP and offered a course in NTU biological science. So there's no discrimination at all. It all boils down to your academics result.</div>
