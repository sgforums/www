As you'all know I have been posted to RP/Biomedical Science, I not very sure will I adapt the PBL(Problem Based Learning) style in RP.<br><br>In Secondary School, the method of teaching is by pumping students with all those text-book information, and at the end of the month we'll have class test/exam.<br><br>While RP teaches student using the PBL method, the grade is base of <span style="color: red;">daily performance</span> and some tests.<br><br>I am not very sure will I adapt to the new PBL environment.. I am very comfortable with memorizing hugh amount 'model answer' provided to me when I am in Secondary School.<br><br>How? How? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> I scared I'll die inside there leh.. I still wanna go Local Uni leh.</div></blockquote>Take it slowly. Since they don't take all daily grades and tests into accounts, spend those days wisely to rest. Out of 16 daily grades, 14 are taken into account. Out of 4 tests, 3 tests are taken into account.<br><br>In total, you will have 3 rest days, if they don't crash...<br><br>Just a run through of PBL so as to get you prepared:<br><br>When you reach school in the morning, the first thing you download is called Problem Statement. They are usually in the form of presentation files or Word documents. Read through the scenario crafted.<br><br>Once your classmates and facilitator arrive, you will start the first meeting. You will discuss with your team mates and share with them your knowledge. All these knowledge will under a column called What You Know. Your team mates will also share their own knowledge with you. What You Know also comes from the problem statement itself.<br><br>Next, read through the problem statement again. Are there anything you don't know? What about your team mates? Put those questions under the column What I Don't Know.<br><br>The last column is What I Need to Find Out. What you need to find out is the problem thrown to you at the beginning of the day, and what you don't know that could lead to solving the problem given. Not all questions under What I Don't Know will necessary lead to solving the problem.<br><br>Then you will be given a break. Usually until 10.30am.<br><br>Second meeting will start. In between the break and second meeting, you are expected to work on some parts of the problem, like reading through some resources (given to you usually) or go online and do some research. If worksheet is given, you will be expected to finish a number of questions. These questions are usually leading questions, which will lead you to solve the day's problem.<br><br>At the second meeting, you will present some sort of findings. Not a formal presentation, just need to say out what you have found out so far. No right or wrong at this stage as well, the facilitator just need to know how you guys have progressed. If you guys are stuck, he/she will give a hand to lead you guys in the right direction. Also, questions are asked and answered at this stage, so prick up your ears and start typing or writing down.<br><br>Second meeting usually ends at around 11.30am to 12.30pm. Then you guys go for lunch and prepare for presentation at 2pm. You need to present what your team have found out, how this leads to solving your problem (not necessary needed)<br><br>During presentation, be prepared for questions. Your classmates or facilitator may question your logic, you should be able to explain why you think it is this, and why not that. Use some common day applications as examples to further illustrate will strengthen the explanation.<br><br>The last part is your facilitator's presentation, known as 6P. Basically, the 6P is what you guys have covered and supposed to have learnt, and other things if you guys didn't cover it as expected.<br><br>6P can also be downloaded at the end of the week. For Semester 1, not a lot of 6Ps to be downloaded. Just Maths, Science and the Cognitive 6Ps can be downloaded. For Semester 2 onwards, all 6Ps will be available for download.<br><br>Your day will end around 3.30pm to 4pm. Year 1 tests start at 8.30am.<br><br>One hint for cognitive, it's not easy. It's about your thinking skills and your persuasion skills. Some people can persuade well, thus doing well in daily grades. Some perform well in thinking skills, thus doing well in tests. There are a few rarer ones who can persuade as well as think. It's one of the killer modules, but also one of the fun ones. Twisting of facts have never been more fun in this module.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

In RP, there's no point vomiting out everything, you must apply what you know. There's no right or wrong, the process you are going through is much more important.

And seriously wrong, and maybe that's way so many people fail to learn.<br><br>Answers are not a must here. Sometimes answers are even given out blatantly to you, only to lead you to find out more about something.<br><br>For example, in your Computing module, there will be a few lessons whereby you are given the codes. Rather than telling you how to code, you are supposed to explain the what those codes do to produce the results. And to test your understanding, your facilitator might twist it a bit.<br><br>For example, this bit of VB code is given to you:<br><br>Private Sub btnOK_Click(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles btnOK.Click<br>'Display a message box greeting the user<br>MessageBox.Show("Hello, " &amp; txtName.Text &amp; _<br>"! Welcome to Visual Basic .NET.", _<br>"HelloUser Message"<strong></strong>)<br>End Sub<br><br>You will be asked to explain what this bit of codes does. Why do you use Private Sub? What's btnOK? What is the end results? Once you have explained, you will be asked to run the codes and see what it does.<br><br>If your facilitator deems fit, he/she may tweak it and ask you to show something similar.</div>
