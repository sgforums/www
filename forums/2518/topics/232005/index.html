            <div class='col-md body'>Well, to the many out there, Im sure most of you guys have played counterstrike before, but how many really know how counterstrike came about?<br><br>Now lets have some history lessons on <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">CS</span></strong>  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Counter-Strike BETA 1 was released on June 18th, 1999 to a small crowd of fans. CS was one of the first mods for Half-Life. CounterStrike was actually created by a bored college student living in california.<br><br>CS has been one of the most successful early installments of online first person shooters ever created. Since years ago, during the period whereby CS was first introduced, other FPS relied upon death match style multiplayer games. Where the strategy in death match games only went as far as getting as many kills as possible, while trying to avoid you own demise. Other variations were capture the flag or destroying opponents base, these were basically some of the earlier versions of FPS. The official release of CS was in year 2000.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What made CS such a hit?</span><br><br>During that time, CS was considered to have one of the best graphics around which was approximately 7 years ago, when it was first released. It had a simple gameplay style, whether you knew how to play or was a total sotong to it, all you had to do was buy a gun, and anyhow clicking on the enemy. Other games which was also a hit, were Red Alert and Soldiers.<br><br>Red Alert was not such a big hit was also because a certain time was needed to learn in which way were buildings supposed to be built, and which recruitments were the best, but CS only had 1 thing, buy a gun.<br><br>Moreover, Counter Strike wasnÂ’t created for fame and fortune, but was rather given away as a free modification for ValveÂ’s Half Life. Unique in so many ways, Counter Strike was the first, and to my knowledge only game ever solely designed and created for multiplayer, and nothing else.<br><br>Earlier versions of CS, made it easy for teamkilling due to the likeness of Counter-Terrorist and the Terrorist.<br><br><img src="http://img157.imageshack.us/img157/3654/counterstrikesn5.jpg"><br>This was much rectified only in later versions such as 1.1, even beta2 did not have much corrections done to its body specifications.<br><br>Other latest screenshots:<br><br>This is more of source.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br><img src="http://img157.imageshack.us/img157/9966/counterterroristis2.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://img293.imageshack.us/img293/5262/piczjy4.jpg"><br><img src="http://img157.imageshack.us/img157/3/picz2op5.jpg"></div>
