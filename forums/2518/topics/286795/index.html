Proposals are submitted by potential host cities, and visits are made to each location to inspect the proposed venues.<br><br>The evaluation criteria for potential host cities is divided into four main categories : location/financing, availability/suitability of facilities, event infrastructure, and promotion. The following are the weightings given to each category.<br><br><img src="http://www.worldcybergames.com/images/6th/inside/a24_graph.gif"><br><br>Each category is judged upon a number of sub-criteria that are all related to the information that is outlined in the following guide to manual preparation. The sub-criteria are judged on a 1-5 scoring system, with 1 being the lowest favorable grade and 5 being the highest favorable grade.<br>These sub-criteria scores are combined and multiplied by their corresponding weightings to produce a final overall score. To qualify for the final phase of host city consideration, a minimum score of 75% must be achieved.<br><br>The visitations to these final qualifying cities shall serve to eliminate any widely varying consideration factors, and streamline the final evaluation scoring process.<br>This evaluation process is done internally by the WCGC, and results are strictly protected from public view to protect the privacy of the candidate host cities.<br><br>Thus, the host city for the World Cyber Games is selected each year after consideration of a comprehensive range of factors to maximize the experience, impact, and enjoyment of all participants involved.</span><br><br><span style="color: green;">World Cyber Games Host City Venue<br><br>2001 - Seoul (Capital City Of Korea)<br><br>As the capital city of Korea for over 600 years, Seoul is a fascinating city blending the modern story as can be seen in the historic relics of gung Heunginjimun (Dongdaemun).<br><br>The changes in the seasons can also be experienced in the capital city thanks to the breathtaking landscape provided by the mountains which surrounded it, most notably Nam Mt.(Namsan), and the Han river(Hangang) which can be seen from almost any point in the city.

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: green;">WCG PC-based games<br><br>Counter Strike is a fast-paced shooting game pitting some of the world's top elite forces against terrorists. The game is oriented mainly toward multi-play and has a training mode where the user can become familiar with the features of the game. Though Counter Strike is categorized as an FPS game, the main distinction of this game is that team play and working as a team is the key factor to success rather than just pure individual ability. This game offers a strong, almost unsettling, sense of realism, which makes it that much more exciting to play and watch.<br><br><a href="http://www.sierra.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.sierra.com </a><br><a href="http://www.vivendiuniversal.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.vivendiuniversal.com </a><br><a href="http://www.valvesoftware.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.valvesoftware.com </a><br><a href="http://www.turtlerockstudios.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.turtlerockstudios.com</a><br><a href="http://www.steampowered.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.steampowered.com</a><br><br><img src="http://www.worldcybergames.com/images/6th/statistic/screenshots/shot_cs_07_570_428.gif"><br><br><img src="http://www.worldcybergames.com/images/6th/statistic/screenshots/shot_cs_03_570_428.gif"><br><br>FIFA series is the most famous soccer game in the world.
