            <div class='col-md body'>INTEGRITY CAN MAKE YOU EASY MONEY!! IT WILL!!! BUT YOU<br>HAVE TO FOLLOW IT TO A LETTER FOR IT TO WORK!!!!<br>A little while back, I was browsing through newsgroups, just like you are now, and<br>came across an article similar to this that said you could make thousands of dollars<br>within weeks with only an initial investment of $6.00! So I thought," Yeah, right, this<br>must be a scam", but like most of us, I was curious, so I kept reading.<br><br>Anyway, it said that you send $1.00 to each of the 6 names and address stated in the<br>article. You then place your own name and address in the bottom of the list at #6, and<br>post the article in at least 200 newsgroups. (There are thousands) No catch, that was<br>it. So after thinking it over, and talking to a few people first, I thought about trying it.<br>I figured what have I got to lose except 6 stamps and $6.00, right? Like most of us I<br>was a little skeptical and a little worried about the legal aspects of it<br>all. So I checked it out with the U.S. Post Office (1-800-725-2161) and they<br>confirmed that it is indeed legal! Then I invested the measly $6.00. Well GUESS<br>WHAT!!... within 7 days, I started getting money in the mail! I was shocked! I figured<br>it would end soon, but the money just kept coming in. In my first week, I made about<br>$25.00. By the end of the second week I had made a total of over $1,000.00! In the<br>third week I had over $10,000.00 and it's still growing. This is now my fourth week<br>and I have made a total of just over $42,000.00 and it's still coming in rapidly. It's<br>certainly worth $6.00, and 6 stamps, I have spent more than that on the lottery!!<br><br>Let me tell you how this works and most importantly, why it works....also, make sure<br>you print a copy of this article NOW, so you can get the information off of it as you<br>need it. STEP 1: Get 6 separate pieces of paper and write the following on each piece<br>of paper "PLEASE PUT ME ON YOUR MAILING LIST." Now get 6 US $1.00 bills<br>and place ONE inside EACH of the 6 pieces of paper so the bill will not be seen<br>through the envelope to prevent thievery. Next, place one paper in each of the 6<br>envelopes and seal them. You should now have 6 sealed envelopes, each with a<br>piece of paper stating the above phrase, your name and address, and a $1.00 bill. What<br>you are doing is creating a service by this. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY LEGAL! Mail the<br>6 envelopes to the following addresses:<br><br>#1) Scotte Wade<br>P. O. Box 22326<br>Tampa, FL 33622-2326<br><br>#2) Syed Muaz<br>No 54, Jln USJ 4/1M,<br>47600 Subang Jaya,<br>Selangor, Malaysia<br><br>#3) Elmer Howard<br>P.O. Box 462<br>Auburn, ME 04212<br><br>#4) Anthony Popante<br>1624 West 4th Street<br>Brooklyn, NY 11223<br><br>#5) CASTILLO<br>8011 N. 7th ST. #1035<br>PHOENIX, AZ 85020<br><br>#6)David Tran<br>2637 Ortega St.<br>San Francisco, CA. 94122<br><br>STEP 2: Now take the #1 name off the list that you see above, move the other names<br>up (6 becomes 5, 5 becomes 4, etc...) and add YOUR Name as number 6 on the list.<br>STEP 3: Change anything you need to, but try to keep this article as close to original<br>as possible. Now, post your amended article to as many newsgroups as you can. (I think there<br>are close to 24,000 groups) remember, the more you post, the<br>more money you make! ---DIRECTIONS -----HOW TO POST TO<br>NEWSGROUPS------------ Step 1) You do not need to re-type this entire letter to do<br>your own posting. Simply put your cursor at the beginning of this letter and drag your<br>cursor to the bottom of this document, and select 'copy' from the edit menu. This will<br>copy the entire letter into the computers memory. Step 2) Open a blank 'notepad' file<br>and place your cursor at the top of the blank page. From the 'edit' menu select 'paste'.<br>This will paste a copy of the letter into notepad so that you can add your name to the<br>list. Step 3) Save your new notepad file as a .txt file. If you want to do your postings<br>in different sittings, you'll always have this file to go back to.<br>Step 4) Use Netscape or Internet explorer and try searching for various newsgroups<br>(on-line<br>forums, message boards, chat sites, discussions.) Step 5) Visit these message boards<br>and post this article as a new message by highlighting the text of this letter and<br>selecting paste from the edit menu. Fill in the Subject, this will be the header that<br>everyone sees as they scroll through the list of postings in a particular group, click the<br>post message button. You're done with your first one!<br><br>Congratulations...THAT'S IT! All you have to do is jump to different newsgroups<br>and post away, after you get the hang of it, it will take about 30 seconds for each<br>newsgroup! **REMEMBER, THE MORE NEWSGROUPS YOU POST IN, THE<br>MORE MONEY YOU WILL MAKE!! BUT YOU HAVE TO POST A MINIMUM<br>OF 200** That's it! You will begin reciving money from around the world within<br>days! You may eventually wany to rent a P.O.Box due to the large amount of mail you<br>will receive. If you wish to stay anonymous, you can invent a name to use, as<br>long as the postman will deliver it. **JUST MAKE SURE ALL THE ADDRESSES<br>ARE CORRECT.**<br><br>Now the WHY part: Out of 200 postings, say I receive only 5 replies (a very low<br>example). So then I made $5.00 with my name at #6 on the letter. Now, each of the 5<br>persons who just sent me $1.00 make the MINIMUM 200 postings, each with my<br>name at #5 and only 5 persons respond to each of the original 5, that is another $25.00<br>for me, now those 25 each make 200 MINIMUM posts with my name at #4 and only<br>5 replies each, I will bring in an additional<br>$125.00! Now, those 125 persons turn around and post the MINIMUM 200 with my<br>name at #3 and only receive 5 replies each, I will make an additional $626.00! OK,<br>now here is the fun part, each of those 625 persons post a MINIMUM 200 letters with<br>my name at #2 and they each only receive 5 replies, that just made me $3,125.00!!!<br>Those 3,125 persons will all deliver this message to 200 newsgroups with my name at<br>#1 and if still 5 persons per 200 newsgroups react I will receive $15,625,00! With a<br>original investment of only $6.00! AMAZING! When your name is no longer on the<br>list, you just take the latest posting in the newsgroups, and send out another $6.00 to<br>names on the list, putting your name at number 6 again. And start posting again. The<br>thing to remember is, do you realize that thousands of people all over the world are<br>joining the internet and reading these articles everyday, JUST LIKE YOU are now!!<br>So can you afford $6.00 and see if it really works?? I think so... People have said,<br>"what if the plan is played out and no one sends you<br>the money? So what! What are the chances of that happening when there are tons of<br>new honest users and new honest people who are joining the internet and newsgroups<br>everyday and are willing to give it a try? Estimates are at least 20,000 to 50,000 new users,<br>every day, with thousands of those joining the actual internet. Think about this! If you<br>gamble your money away in a casino or a race track, or maybe just the lottery...WHY?<br>Because we all want more $$$! RIGHT? So we risk our money! Playing it against the odds!<br>NEED MONEY? Well if you have any logic and 6$ You will! You think this is a<br>gamble? maybe! But its not odds your up against; INSTEAD YOUR OWN INTEGRITY!<br>You NEED MONEY? Play FAIRLY and HONESTLY, WITH FULL INTEGRITY!<br>And you will be making some SERIOUS CASH!!!<br><br>$GO FOR IT$<br><br></div>
