            <div class='col-md body'>Well, it would seem that life has dealt me another tragedy.

It would take at least six months for the ligaments in my knee to grow back, maybe more. And after that, I'll have to go for physiotherapy to regain its flexibility. All that might take up to a year. My only goal now is to walk again.<br><br>As for the SAF, screw them.<br><br>So, too bad, I won't be able to attend for any outings for the time being.

Indeed, SOC is inherently dangerous. I hope someone would have the cow sense to modify it, but I don't expect the SAF has any cow sense anyway.</div>

Had the same identical experience as you in 1995. Same SOC, same balancing beam. It was raining heavily prior to SOC. Rain stopped minutes earlier and I was in the 1st detail at SISPEC SOC ground, Pasir Laba camp. Was the 1st one to reach the Beam. The landing area(sand pit) at the end of the Beam was compacted by the heavy rain and lobangs were formed. Dislocated my left knee seriously with both ACL ligaments torned and menicus teared. Went for 2 operations and now have 2 screws in my left knee. 13 stiches and months of physiotherapy. Were in crutches for weeks too. After 5 years left leg muscle(upper) still slightly smaller than the right. Be prepared for the initial difference between ur legs and I hoped ur injury wasn't as serious as mine. Understand exact how you feel and the pain you had went through. Take care comrade and get well soon.<br><br>Don't worry too much. Time will heal all wounds. Now I can still lead an active lifestyle. Can still play beach volleyball at Sentosa, basketball, go gym, swim, cycle, bowl, backpacking, canoe, rock climb, run......after girls  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Juz came back from climbing Gunong Belumut in Johor. A very strenuous and demanding climb for experienced and amateur climbers alike. Was devastated after the injury and demoralised too. Can email for my help and advise if needed. Best wishes.<br><br>------------------<br>Everyday is a special day, do something special b4 u end this day!!!<br><br>[This message has been edited by Ding (edited 18 December 2000).]</div>

You know, your circumstances were very similair to mine. The darn SOC was wet from rain, and the sand under the balancing beam must have been compacted hard. Just bloody great right? Anyway, after reading what happened to you, I must admit that your injury is definately much worst than mine. I didn't need to go for any operations, and I didn't require any stitches either. I busted two of the ligaments, tore one of them 2/3 and another one 1/3. As well as the menuiscus and carthilage and the whole damn lot. I'm going through the psychio now with my knee in a knee brace. This is really going to take a long long time. But you know better. Yeah, can't wait to run again. And go to the gym again. And be normal again. Tell me, did the SAF discharge you, or were you posted to a service unit? I hope they discharge me for good so that they can stop wasting my time.</div>

Oh man, this is sure getting to be something. Seems like injuries sustained during NS is much more prevalent than I had expected. Anyway, cheers to you my bai kah comrade-in-arms!
