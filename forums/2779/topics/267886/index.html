In North America, it was first made available bundled with Metroid Prime Pinball, but is now available through promotions or as a stand-alone purchase. The accessory was released in a different way in Europe due to a delay of the European release of Metroid Prime Pinball. Various DS games supporting it (Metroid Prime Hunters, Mario &amp; Luigi: Partners in Time, and the recent 42 All-Time Classics, aka Clubhouse Games) had been released in Europe before the accessory was readily available under an 'official' release. However Codestorm, Nintendo's UK customer services contractor sell original-DS-style Rumble Paks as a spare part for a little under Â£10. The accessory was officially released as a pack in with the game 'Actionloop' in the UK.<br><br>Although the Rumble Pak works with both the Nintendo DS and the redesigned Nintendo DS Lite, it protrudes from the Nintendo DS Lite when inserted. For this reason, a smaller version of the Rumble Pak is available in Japan, which is flush with the system when inserted. It was initially available in just black, but other colours produced by 3rd party manufacturer eWin, such as white (see picture), have been released. Other colour variations and releases in other regions have yet to be announced.<br><br>List of Nintendo DS games supporting the Rumble Pak<br><br><strong>  * Clubhouse Games (aka 42 All-Time Classics in Europe)<br>* Custom Robo Arena<br>* Diddy Kong Racing DS<br>* Elite Beat Agents<br>* Hotel Dusk: Room 215<br>* The Legend of Spyro: A New Beginning (DS version)<br>* Actionloop (aka Magnetica)<br>* Mario &amp; Luigi: Partners in Time<br>* Metroid Prime Pinball (bundled with rumble pak)<br>* Metroid Prime: Hunters<br>* Moero!

In Small Screen Rendering mode, the contents of the page are displayed in a single column fitting the width of the screen - for example, a page featuring two columns of text side-by-side would be displayed as a sinlge column, one after the other. In Overview mode, a scaled-down "Overview" of the page is displayed on the touchscreen with a small selection box which can be moved around using the stylus. The contents of the selection box are displayed on the top screen at their full size. This selection can be brought into the touchscreen to click on links, enter text in boxes, et cetra.<br><br>The Nintendo DS Browser connects to the Internet through IEEE 802.11 Wi-Fi wireless networks or hotspots using the built-in Wi-Fi capability of the Nintendo DS. Home users can connect to the Internet either using their wireless router or by using a Nintendo USB Access Point. According to the browser's manual, the system is free to use at "Nintendo retail hotspots only": the Wi-Fi access points installed in Nintendo DS kiosks in stores. Attempting to connect to a The Cloud or BT Openzone hotspot launches the payment interface, although this doesn't happen on many other servers. The Nintendo DS browser will connect to the free Wi-Fi service in Norwich, UK. In Australia, Nintendo has teamed up with telecommunications provider Telstra to provide free access at over 1,000 wireless hotspots nation-wide.<br><br>Nintendo has partnered with Internet security company Astaro to integrate web filtering technology into the Nintendo DS Browser. Called Astaro Parental Control, the technology acts as a proxy filter, providing the option of blocking inappropriate content. This is provided free of charge and can be activated through a simple menu option.<br><br>As far as browser capabilities, the Nintendo DS browser does have support for JavaScript in web pages, but not Adobe Flash. Also, due to the limited storage space, most other dynamic media, such as videos or sound, will not work in the browser.</div>

Few adapters can do this under Windows, as Windows lacks both the software necessary to configure a soft AP and capable drivers for natively supported hardware.
