            <div class='col-md body'>1) The stretch of road outside the famous Orchard Country Club with lorries parking. The speed limit is ONLY 60KM/hr although it has 3 lane!!!!(Tat time i gunna there with speed of 85km/hr...gunna 6 demerit + $140 fine. sian 1/2)<br><br>2) The road going in and out of Seletar dam. Mod car please beware 'cos it's a dead end.<br><br>3) In front of Khatib MRT station. (Where the speed camera is at) I was quite surprise to see road block there 'cos it's a straight road but I've gunna there b4.<br><br>4) Outside Yishun Safra. There is a nice place spot around the bend.<br><br>5) Yishun Park. Very near Yishun Safra. It's a very deserted area and it's outside Northbrooks Secondary school.<br><br>6) Outside Katib Camp Main gate. That time have seen them camping there when I'm performing guard duty there in 1998 during my NSF days . Both side of the road is fav spot for TP.<br><br>7) Road going to Gambas Ave (Woodland) when you go pass Chong Pang naisi lemak and wanted to turn Left to woodland. Near the hot spring entrance at seletar air base.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> Blk 367, Yishun Ring Road. Near the canal.<br><br>9) Mandai Road. Think needless for me to elaborate some more...<br><br>10) Mandai Ave. Near Mandai Crematorium.<br><br>11) Lentor Ave. The main stretch of road leading to Yishun after you exit from SLE.<br><br>12) Woodlands Ave 12<br><br>13) AMK Ave 5. Exit from CTE from city (can be weekly event)<br><br>14) Lornie Road right after Japanese association, both way<br><br>15) PIE towards Changi, camera under Lornie flyover<br><br>16) PIE going Jurong, exit to Clementi Ave 6. Beware of TP awaiting for you at the bus stop (almost like alternate day affair)<br><br>17) Lim Chu Kang road, they like graves visit...<br><br>1<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> Changi - Loyang Industrial Main road<br><br>19) Marina South<br><br>20) Bedok Reservior Road (every weekend affair)<br><br>21) Upper Thomson Road - the stretch between Yio Chu Kang Road/Upper Thomson Road junction to entrance of SLE.<br><br>22) Changi Perimeter Road- The road behind Changi Airport Runway. Plenty of bushes and construction boards to hide. Was stopped once to check my license, literally pop out from nowhere. I thought I saw ghost wearing a white gown.<br><br>23) Orchard Boulevard Road, outside Orchard MRT &amp; Borders, up to the former Marco Polo Hotel<br><br>24) Dunearn Road &amp; Bt Timah Road - TP are there to book motorists who Q on main road waiting to enter petrol stations offering discounts, and at the same time book speeding motorists. No speed limit sign boards there, so I presume speed limit is 50km/h on this 3 lane road - absolute madness<br><br>25) The main road infront of Singapore Expo.<br><br>26) Tampines Ave 1 (along Temasek Poly) towards Bedok Reservior Rd as well as the other side - 50km/h stretch<br><br>27) SLE (towards TPE/CTE) - around the bend near Upper Thomson exit<br><br>2<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> ECP (towards Changi Airport) - TP hiding under the bridge (@Katong exit before Marine Parade); u will not be able to see TP cuz there is a hideout lane under that bridge<br><br>29) ECP (towards Changi Airport) - The bend after Bayshore exit<br><br>30) Nicholl Highway - the bend near Old People's Association Field<br><br>31) Dairy Farm Road - often deserted. It leads to BKE on 1 direction and bukit timah rd on the other (both side have 2 lanes). Speed limit stated is 60km/h, and there is a sign stated "SPEED CHECK AREA". At first thought they put there for fun, but 2 wks ago, there was an operation. Many drivers got caught!! Be careful! It looks a little like N-S highway.. Very nice to speed but not worth..<br><br>32) Tamah Merah coast rd - SAFRA country towards changi village. Speed limit 70km/h. Speed prone area for drivers going towards changi V for supper.<br><br>33) Tamah Merah ferry terminal towards Changi Naval Base. Spped limit 60km/h. Lots of lorries. Overtaking act common.

Upp Bt Timah road, the stretch outside Bt Timah Hill, BOTH directions. 4 overhead bridges..good place for TP to camp, esp immediately coming out from the tunnel. Tunnel speed limit is 60, but both stretch of road right after and b4 the tunnel is 70, so ppl tend to 4get..seen a few times liao, FD and Glen on class95 also got say..<br><br>57. Upper serangoon road - heading towards Potong Pasir the first bridge<br>after the the MRT station. The love to station during day time.<br>Polar<br><br>58.
