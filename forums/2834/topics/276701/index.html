It will make things worst !!!<br><br>Think woman !!! If he want sex - he does not need to marry you, he can go geylang everynight have a few round every night !!! he marry you is not for sex ! You listen to your friends keep thinking of sex in your mind - no wonder - your husband see you also run !!! Put yourself in his shoe work so tired and stress come back - still have to face and fight off a sex hungry and desperate wife ..... think !!!<br><br>Sometime jobs can be very stressful... what he may really want is from a wife  is to just do the basic , let him have a simple meal, bath and sleep ... if you keep thinking and trying more ... gal you just making things worst .<br><br>Why don't you just cool down and stop listen to friends ... just give him want he need for a while and see ... maybe that what he needs at the moment ...<br></div>
