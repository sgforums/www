Do you have to go through infantry training first before undergoing guards conversion course?<br><span style="color: blue;">infantry, guards and commando officers go through the same OCC training and commission together. guards officers subsequently go for GCC. afterall guards are just more specialised trained and "elite" infantrymen.</span><br>5) Anyone who has been through Ranger Course care to share what it is like or about?...what is it for and stuff... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><span style="color: blue;">there is currently a thread in Military Nuts on the ranger course.   </span><br>6) Naval Officers!...what kind of jobs do u guys actually do?..care to share ur job scope?...the officer job descriptions they have is really kinda vague..like naval officer..speaks volumes abt the job ehz...=p...<br><span style="color: blue;">i believe they do publicise and promote the different naval officers, e.g. naval engineering officers, technical officers, etc. </span><br>Thanks guys!</div></blockquote>instead of starting a new forum, you could have posted your questions <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=forum_display&amp;forum_id=1390" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br><br>anyway you do seem like you are interested in all 3 services. still trying to decide?</div>
