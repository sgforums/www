              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: From January next year, the Medisave Required Amount 
              (MRA) in the Central Provident Fund (CPF) will be raised to S$38,500 
              from the current S$32,000.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The MRA refers to 
              the amount that must be set aside in the Medisave Account, after the CPF
               Minimum Sum requirement has been met. </span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The CPF Board said 
              those who have met the CPF Minimum Sum and have an MRA shortfall at the 
              point of withdrawal have to make a top-up to the Medisave Account.<br><br>This can be done with part of the balances from the Ordinary Account and/or Special Account to meet the prevailing MRA.  <br><br>CPF
               said the requirement for members to set aside the MRA in their Medisave
               Account is to enable them to have enough savings to meet their 
              healthcare needs during old age. <br><br>Central Provident Fund members 
              will also continue to enjoy a risk free interest rate of four percent on
               their Special and Medisave Accounts (SMA) for the next three months, 
              from 1 January to 31 March 2013.<br><br>The interest rate on their Retirement Accounts (RA) for the whole of next year will also remain at four percent.<br><br>The
               CPF Board said this was in line with the government's announcement in 
              September that it would maintain the four percent per annum floor rate 
              for interest earned on all monies in the Special and Medisave Accounts 
              as well as savings in the Retirement Account until the end of next year.<br><br>Savings
               in the SMA currently earn either 4 percent or the 12-month average 
              yield of 10-year Singapore Government Securities (10YSGS) plus 1 
              percent, whichever is the higher. <br><br>The interest rate on SMA savings is adjusted quarterly, based on interest rates on 10YSGS over a preceding 12-month period.<br><br>Since
               the average yield of the 10YSGS plus 1 percent, from 1 December 2011 to
               30 November 2012, works out to be 2.49 percent, the SMA interest rate 
              payable to CPF members from 1 January 2013 to 31 March 2013 will be 
              maintained at the current floor of 4 percent, CPF said.<br><br>New RA 
              savings are invested in SSGS which earn a fixed coupon equal to either 
              the 12-month average yield of the 10YSGS plus 1 percent at the point of 
              issuance, or 4 percent, whichever is the higher, adjusted yearly.<br><br>CPF said given the lower 10YSGS yield, new RA savings will earn a fixed coupon of 4 percent.<br><br>- CNA/al</span></span></p>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think if the government didn't raise the retirement age of Singaporean workers from 45 to 55 and then later to 65 now, I seriously feel that the government wouldn't face this problems of ageing Singaporeans and their medical expenses. They should have let the Singaporeans to retire at the age of 55 which I think is reasonable and release the whole sum of their CPF to retired Singaporeans and let them decides what to do with their money. In the 70s and 80s, the CPF contributions used to be 25% from employees and 25% from the employers. Sometimes I feel that maybe the retirement age was increased probably there is insufficient funds in the CPF to pay up the retired Singaporeans of their CPF which their employers too had contributed to their workers' CPF to the government in the CPF. What I see now in my CPF is only figures on paper. What most working Singaporeans now want is the full payment of their CPF upon their retirement. That is our hard earn money throughout the years. I hope the opposition parties can use this agenda to win votes in the next general elections.</div>

              Don't worry most retired Singaporeans know what to do with their money hence at this present moment the banks are thinking offering credit cards to retired Singaporeans. We can always work on contract basis or part time to keep ourselves active you know.
