              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Parental Liability for Competition Law Infringements </strong></p>
              <p>The EU General Court provided a reminder on May 17, 2011, that parents are responsible for the behaviour of their subsidiary companies, since the latter are usually not treated as independent companies.</p>
              <p>In judgments involving the Elf Aquitaine group, the court confirmed, in accordance with existing case law, that there is a rebuttable presumption that a subsidiary wholly owned by its parent company does not freely determine its own conduct on the market. Such a presumption also applies where a parent company owns almost all of the share capital of its subsidiary. Elf Aquitaine held more than 97% of the shares of its subsidiary Arkema France, and did not furnish evidence capable of rebutting the presumption of parental control. Arkema France's breaches of competition law could therefore be imputed to Elf Aquitaine.</p>
              <p>The court also confirmed that, when setting fines, the EC has the power, but is not obliged, to impute the responsibility for an infringement committed by a subsidiary to its parent company. This issue can be important for example following a disposal, since a vendor which is treated as having controlled a former subsidiary can find itself the subject of a fine for competition law breaches of that subsidiary (for the period up to completion of the sale).</p>

              <p><strong>Fare-change formula "ensures operators remain productive"</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Transport Minister Lui Tuck Yew has said the current 
              fare adjustment formula for public transport ensures operators will 
              remain productive.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>He explained that 
              while the formula incorporates the rate of inflation and wage increase, 
              it also takes into consideration a productivity factor of 1.5 per cent.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Mr Lui was speaking on the sidelines of a community event on Saturday.<br><br>He
               said: "So if there is no inflation for the year and there is no wage 
              increase, then the fares will come down by one per cent, which means 
              that we put an incentive on the operators to make sure that they are 
              productive, and that's what the formula does. <br><br>"The most 
              important point I want to emphasise is we have to allow PTC (Public 
              Transport Council) to study what the operators have come up with, and 
              they will decide in due course."<br><br>His remarks come after 
              Singapore's two public transport operators SBS Transit and SMRT 
              submitted applications to the Public Transport Council to adjust bus and
               train fares.<br><br>Mr Lui assured that the PTC will evaluate their applications and moderate them accordingly.<br><br>- CNA/ir</span></span></p>

              <p><strong>Fare-change formula "ensures operators remain
              productive"</strong></p>
              <p><span><span>SINGAPORE: Transport Minister Lui Tuck Yew has said
              the current fare adjustment formula for public transport ensures
              operators will remain productive.</span></span></p>
              <p><span><span>He explained that while the formula incorporates the
              rate of inflation and wage increase, it also takes into
              consideration a productivity factor of 1.5 per
              cent.</span></span></p>
              <p><span><span>Mr Lui was speaking on the sidelines of a community
              event on Saturday.<br> <br> He said: "So if there is no inflation for the year and there is no
              wage increase, then the fares will come down by one per cent, which
              means that we put an incentive on the operators to make sure that
              they are productive, and that's what the formula does.<br> <br> "The most important point I want to emphasise is we have to allow
              PTC (Public Transport Council) to study what the operators have
              come up with, and they will decide in due course."<br> <br> His remarks come after Singapore's two public transport operators
              SBS Transit and SMRT submitted applications to the Public Transport
              Council to adjust bus and train fares.<br> <br> Mr Lui assured that the PTC will evaluate their applications and
              moderate them accordingly.<br> <br> - CNA/ir</span></span></p>

              <p>Judging by public backlash, they may allow a smaller increase instead of what was requested by the transport companies.</p>

              <p><strong>PTC to track affordability factor when deciding fare adjustments</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Public Transport Council Chairman Gerard Ee said the 
              "affordability factor" will be tracked when looking at fare increases 
              proposed by Singapore's two main public transport operators.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Mr Ee, who was 
              speaking on Channel NewsAsia's revamped discussion programme "Talking 
              Point", said the council will not just "blindly" look at the fare 
              adjustment formula.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>He said the amount 
              of money that people spend on public transport is monitored, and that 
              over the last few years, a smaller proportion of household income is 
              being spent on public transport.<br><br>On a suggestion that operators 
              wean themselves from oil dependence by exploring eco-friendly 
              technology, Mr Ee said it's something that can be looked into.<br><br>"The
               use of electric buses and all that, it will come. It will definitely be
               there and we are very close to that event. Technology is improving very
               rapidly and I'm looking forward to the day where we have cleaner 
              environment through the use of electric vehicles," said Ee. <br><br>Viewers can catch the new season of "Talking Point" on Sunday night at 10.30pm, Singapore/Hong Kong time.<br><br>- CNA /ls</span></span></p>

              <h1 class="headline">Netizens against transport fare hike: Yahoo! poll</h1>
              <p>The results of a recently-concluded <em>Yahoo! Singapore</em> poll has revealed that almost all netizens are against SBS Transit and SMRT's application to raise fares.</p>
              <p>A total of 14,787 respondents participated in the three-day poll, 
              which asked what they thought about SBS Transit and SMRT's application 
              for a fare increase.</p>
              <p>13,920 <em>Yahoo!</em> users, or 94 per cent of the respondents, 
              indicated that the transport services provided by both companies has had
               little improvement over the years, despite increasing their fares a 
              number of times.</p>
              <p>Both operators submitted their applications for fare adjustment to the Public Transport Council
               (PTC) last Monday. The increase is calculated using the annual fare 
              adjustment formula recommended by the Government-appointed Fare Review 
              Mechanism <span id="lw_1310900279_4" class="yshortcuts">Committee</span>.</p>
              <p>The formula takes into account the <span id="lw_1310900279_0" class="yshortcuts">consumer price index</span>, wage index and productivity gains.</p>
              <p>Four per cent of of the respondents appeared more understanding of 
              both transport companies' plight in dealing with rising costs and <span id="lw_1310900279_6" class="yshortcuts">inflation</span>. The remaining 2 per cent of respondents were not concerned about the potential fare hike.</p>
              <p><span id="lw_1310900279_1" class="yshortcuts">SBS Transit</span> said it is spending S$268 million to purchase 600 new buses, scheduled for delivery in 2011 and 2012.</p>
              <p>The operator has purchased a total of 2,050 new buses since 2006 as 
              part of its fleet renewal exercise. The buses cost about S$854 million, 
              said SBS Transit.</p>
              <p>For the financial year 2011, SMRT's energy cost increased 17.5 per  
              cent to S$122.4 million due mainly to higher electricity and diesel  
              prices, as well as the expansion of the rail network with the opening of
                Circle Line Phase 1 and 2, said the operator.</p>
              <p>Its manpower costs have also increased because of a 0.5 percentage  
              point increase in employer CPF contribution rate to 15 per cent in  
              September 2010 and to 15.5 per cent in March 2011.</p>
              <p>SMRT also hired more staff because of the Circle Line opening and to 
              operate additional train and bus trips. The operator introduced 420 
              extra train trips from March and increased the number of bus trips by 
              5.4 per cent.</p>
              <p>The application for a price increase has led to Member of Parliament, Denise Phua, to comment on her Facebook page, "I am concerned that the transport operators are asking for permission from the PTC for fare increase."</p>
              <p>While there are good reasons like the rise in operating costs, Phua 
              suggested that it could be time for stakeholders to "deeply study the  
              underlying assumptions on how this industry is structured and how prices
               are fixed and applied".</p>
              <p>"Yes, I have heard that public transport is best run by private operators (for efficiency and <span id="lw_1310900279_2" class="yshortcuts">cost management</span>) but can there be better <span id="lw_1310900279_5" class="yshortcuts">hybrid systems</span> which might work better than today's?" she questioned.</p>
              <p>"Would a third-alternative system be possible to provide even more 
              incentives especially to Singaporeans not just to relieve their cost of 
              living; but also in applying the principle that membership (being  
              Singaporean) has its privileges" she added.</p>
              <p><em>Yahoo! Singapore</em> understands that the PTC will study and deliberate on both operators' 
              applications and will inform the public of the outcome once a decision 
              is reached.</p>
