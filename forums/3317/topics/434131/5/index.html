              <p><strong>Govt will ensure public transport fare hike, if any, is

              <p><span><span>SINGAPORE: Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has
              weighed in on the ongoing debate concerning the public transport
              fare review.</span></span></p>
              <p><span><span>He said that a review is necessary from time to time
              and increases cannot be helped.</span></span></p>
              <p><span><span>Speaking at a National Day light-up ceremony at his
              Teck Ghee constituency on Saturday, Mr Lee however noted that the
              Public Transport Council (PTC) is currently doing its work and
              urged Singaporeans to relax.<br> <br> Mr Lee said the government's interest is to ensure that the country
              has a good transport system that Singaporeans can afford.<br> <br> But he added that transport companies would have to be allowed to
              break even so that they can provide a good and efficient
              service.<br> <br> Mr Lee said that the government will also make sure, through the
              PTC, that when the fares are raised they are reasonable and
              justifiable.<br> <br> - CNA/ir</span></span></p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Fare hikes 'help bus workers and operators'</h1>
              <p>FORMER labour chief and minister in the Prime Minister's Office Lim 
              Boon Heng waded into the public transport debate yesterday, explaining 
              why fare increases, while unpopular, are necessary.</p>
              <p>If bus fares were never allowed to go up, transport operators might 
              not have enough 'to invest in new buses, and quality of service must 
              drop'.</p>
              <p>Speaking at a delegates' conference of the Singapore Shell Employees'
               Union, he noted that fare increases also went towards funding pay rises
               for workers.</p>
              <p>'You know raising bus fares is unpopular. But if we cannot 
              raise bus fares, how will that impact your fellow workers? I am sure you
               will understand that it is not fair if they cannot get wage increases,'
               he said.</p>
              <p>'But their wage increase will be funded by fare increases, which adversely impact the public.'</p>
              <p>Mr Lim, who left the Cabinet after the May General Election,
               said that in the absence of productivity improvements, a 3 per cent 
              wage increase for workers meant that fares had to go up by 1.5 per cent 
              because labour costs make up half the total operating costs for buses.</p>

              <p><strong>Liberalising bus services may lead to "cherry-picking": Lui Tuck Yew</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Transport Minister Lui Tuck Yew has shot down the 
              opposition National Solidarity Party's (NSP's) proposal to introduce 
              more competition among public bus operators here.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The NSP had said bus
               services should be liberalised. It argued that private operators, 
              regardless of size, be allowed to apply for licences to ply any of the 
              routes, based on business considerations.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>This way, the party said, bus services could be more responsive to commuter needs.   <br><br>However,
               Mr Lui said such a move would only lead to "cherry-picking" of the 
              profitable routes among transport operators and might not benefit 
              commuters.<br><br>He said: "Then the challenge would be - what happens 
              to the non-profitable routes? And in the end, would commuters end up 
              having to pay more overall - because they may pay less on certain 
              routes, but overall on the longer routes, the less profitable routes, do
               they have to pay ... more?<br><br>"So that aspect needs to be 
              considered further. When we look at the possible contestability of 
              routes, which is really a complicated issue, it's really about packaging
               routes together rather than allowing people to select those they most 
              prefer.<br><br>Mr Lui added that currently, bus operators are obligated to run services on less profitable routes.<br><br>He
               explained: "Today with SBS and SMRT, we know there are some routes that
               are profitable, some are really in a sense loss-making, but for which 
              they are obliged under the USO - universal service obligations - to run 
              buses, and there are certain routes that are breaking even. <br><br>"And
               so there is a certain amount of cross subsidy that is taking place from
               the profitable routes to the non-profitable routes."<br><br>The Land 
              Transport Authority has taken over the role of central bus planning and 
              its latest quarterly review of bus services saw 17 service improvements.<br><br>- CNA/al</span></span></p>

              <p><strong>Fares for buses and trains to go up</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Public transport fares will increase from October 8 - concurrent with the full opening of the Circle Line.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The Public Transport Council (PTC) announced on Friday that it has approved an overall adjustment of one per cent.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The increase is 
              significantly less than the maximum fare adjustment of 2.8 per cent 
              public transport operators SBS Transit and SMRT wanted.<br><br>The rise 
              translates roughly to two cents more per ride for adults using ezlink 
              card, one cent more for senior citizens with concessionary cards, and 10
               cents more for cash payments.<br><br>Students or children will see no change in bus and train fares, whether they pay in cash or by ezlink.<br><br>However
               from October, concession hours for senior citizens will be extended to 
              the full-day throughout the week. Their fares on the North East Line and
               Circle Line will also be adjusted downwards.<br><br>An estimated four in 10 senior citizens will see fare savings.<br><br>PTC
               chairman Gerard Ee said: "We wanted to see how we can help at least one
               sector of the commuters, and for a number of years now we have been 
              hearing requests especially with a growing number of senior citizens in 
              Singapore and we are focused on the senior citizens group.<br><br>"We 
              are pushing very hard for people to continue working past retirement, we
               know we are a rapidly ageing society so it is a pressing need to 
              address that quickly, so senior citizens get priority for this year."<br><br>Overall, 85 per cent of commuters will see an average increase of 15 cents in fares per week, said the PTC.<br><br>The last time fares were adjusted upwards was in 2008.<br><br>Back
               then, the PTC approved an adjustment of 1.7 per cent which translated 
              to a fare increase of about one to three cents for commuters.<br><br>The
               council had taken into consideration Singapore's economic outlook and 
              the affordability of public transport. It found the economic outlook has
               remained positive with the latest forecast for GDP to grow by five to 
              seven per cent.<br><br>The latest unemployment rate also remains low, at
               2.1 per cent. The monthly public transport expenditure as a percentage 
              of household income has also dropped in the past seven years from 5.3 
              per cent in 2003 to 3.7 per cent in 2007.<br><br>The PTC said it had balanced commuters' interests and the operators' viability when deciding on the quantum.<br><br>Mr
               Ee said: "Inflation has crept up; we have been receiving feedback from 
              commuters about various things, and we are hard-pressed to say that we 
              should avoid the full 2.8 per cent. After taking everything into 
              balance, we decided to cap it at one per cent.<br><br>"We actually 
              looked at all the feedback from commuters. Commuters are not happy about
               a range of things, commuters are obviously going to face a range of 
              things with inflation over five per cent already. So we started from 0 
              to 2.8 and we actually worked out and looked at all the various factors 
              and how do we achieve a balance."<br><br>The one per cent adjustment translates to S$15 million in extra revenue for SMRT and SBS Transit combined.<br><br>Meanwhile the SMRT is dangling more carrots to better distribute crowds during morning peak hours at train stations. <br><br>It
               currently offers a 10-cent discount for commuters who exit from 
              designated stations within the city area before 7.30am. The discount 
              will be tripled to 30 cents and the time extended to before 7.45am.<br><br>The
               discount scheme will be partly funded by the estimated S$5 million the 
              SMRT has set aside to work on schemes to incentivise commuters to shift 
              their travel times away from the peak periods. <br><br>The SMRT has 
              committed to conduct joint trials with the Land Transport Authority 
              (LTA) on demand management measures. More details will be announced when
               ready.<br><br>To help the needy cope with the fare adjustment, the 
              government and the public transport operators have set aside some S$4 
              million to fund some 200,000 public transport vouchers. Application for 
              these vouchers begins next month.<br><br>- CNA/cc/fa/ir</span></span></p>

              <p><strong>Fare increase "fair and balanced"</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Minister for Transport Lui Tuck Yew said the one-per 
              cent fare increase, announced last Friday, is a fair and balanced 
              decision by the Public Transport Council (PTC).</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Mr Lui was speaking 
              on the sidelines of the launch of an exhibition at Changi Airport to 
              mark 100 years of aviation in Singapore.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>"The PTC had a difficult task in balancing between the needs and interests of the different groups," Mr Lui said. <br><br>"And
               I think it has done an admirable job. I was particularly pleased that 
              the concession for the senior citizens has been extended to the whole 
              day.<br><br>"I was speaking to residents, both young and old, in the 
              last few days since the fair revision. They highlighted that this was 
              one of the areas very worthwhile to do."<br><br>Mr Lui noted there is still a number of improvements that can be made to bus services.<br><br>These include making the services more reliable, buses less crowded and with a shorter journey time. <br><br>He said a solution would be to introduce more buses and to see how public transport can get greater priority on roads.<br><br>He
               added a comprehensive review on bus services by the Land Transport 
              Authority will address how the government can play a bigger role in 
              boosting capacity.<br><br>"Left to the companies alone, I don't think we will see this take place at the pace we want to see.  <br><br>"Hence,
               I think part of the review by LTA is to see at what speed we ought to 
              see this implementation taking place in the coming years and how the 
              government needs to step in to play a role beyond what it is today, to 
              bring this about."<br><br>The review is expected to be completed by the fourth quarter of this year.<br><br>-CNA/wk</span></span></p>
