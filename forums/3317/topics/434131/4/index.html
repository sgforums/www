              <h1>Netizens against transport fare hike: Yahoo! poll</h1>
              <p>The results of a recently-concluded <em>Yahoo! Singapore</em> poll has revealed that almost all netizens are against SBS Transit
              and SMRT's application to raise fares.</p>
              <p>A total of 14,787 respondents participated in the three-day
              poll, which asked what they thought about SBS Transit and SMRT's
              application for a fare increase.</p>
              <p>13,920 <em>Yahoo!</em> users, or 94 per cent of the respondents,
              indicated that the transport services provided by both companies
              has had little improvement over the years, despite increasing their
              fares a number of times.</p>
              <p>Both operators submitted their applications for fare adjustment
              to the Public Transport Council (PTC) last Monday. The increase is
              calculated using the annual fare adjustment formula recommended by
              the Government-appointed Fare Review Mechanism <span>Committee</span>.</p>
              <p>The formula takes into account the <span>consumer price
              index</span>, wage index and productivity gains.</p>
              <p>Four per cent of of the respondents appeared more understanding
              of both transport companies' plight in dealing with rising costs
              and <span>inflation</span>. The remaining 2 per cent of
              respondents were not concerned about the potential fare hike.</p>
              <p><span>SBS Transit</span> said it is spending S$268
              million to purchase 600 new buses, scheduled for delivery in 2011
              and 2012.</p>
              <p>The operator has purchased a total of 2,050 new buses since 2006
              as part of its fleet renewal exercise. The buses cost about S$854
              million, said SBS Transit.</p>
              <p>For the financial year 2011, SMRT's energy cost increased 17.5
              per cent to S$122.4 million due mainly to higher electricity and
              diesel prices, as well as the expansion of the rail network with
              the opening of Circle Line Phase 1 and 2, said the operator.</p>
              <p>Its manpower costs have also increased because of a 0.5
              percentage point increase in employer CPF contribution rate to 15
              per cent in September 2010 and to 15.5 per cent in March 2011.</p>
              <p>SMRT also hired more staff because of the Circle Line opening
              and to operate additional train and bus trips. The operator
              introduced 420 extra train trips from March and increased the
              number of bus trips by 5.4 per cent.</p>
              <p>The application for a price increase has led to Member of
              Parliament, Denise Phua, to comment on her Facebook page, "I am
              concerned that the transport operators are asking for permission
              from the PTC for fare increase."</p>
              <p>While there are good reasons like the rise in operating costs,
              Phua suggested that it could be time for stakeholders to "deeply
              study the underlying assumptions on how this industry is
              structured and how prices are fixed and applied".</p>
              <p>"Yes, I have heard that public transport is best run by
              private operators (for efficiency and <span>cost
              management</span>) but can there be better <span>hybrid
              systems</span> which might work better than today's?" she
              questioned.</p>
              <p>"Would a third-alternative system be possible to provide even
              more incentives especially to Singaporeans not just to relieve
              their cost of living; but also in applying the principle that
              membership (being Singaporean) has its privileges" she added.</p>
              <p><em>Yahoo! Singapore</em> understands that the PTC will study
              and deliberate on both operators' applications and will inform the
              public of the outcome once a decision is reached.</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Ministry to focus on transport service quality</h1>
              <p>TRANSPORT Minister Lui Tuck Yew has singled out the quality of 
              service (QOS) delivered by transport operators as the issue he is paying
               most attention to.</p>
              <p>In a Facebook post on Tuesday, he noted that while train and bus trips have been increased, more needs to be done.</p>
              <p>One thing his ministry is examining is how much to reduce intervals between trains during off-peak periods, he added.</p>
              <p>Currently, trains on the North-South and East-West lines run every five to six minutes at non-peak hours.</p>
              <p>He said that current QOS standards for buses are not 
              stringent enough, and his ministry and the Land Transport Authority are 
              studying how to tighten them.</p>
              <p>Currently, operators must ensure that at least 80 per cent 
              of bus services and 90 per cent of feeder services depart from bus 
              interchanges and terminals no later than every 10 minutes during weekday
               peak periods. There are also benchmarks for reliability, bus loads and 
              safety.</p>

              <h1>Ministry to focus on transport service quality</h1>
              <p>TRANSPORT Minister Lui Tuck Yew has singled out the quality of
              service (QOS) delivered by transport operators as the issue he is
              paying most attention to.</p>
              <p>In a Facebook post on Tuesday, he noted that while train and bus
              trips have been increased, more needs to be done.</p>
              <p>One thing his ministry is examining is how much to reduce
              intervals between trains during off-peak periods, he added.</p>
              <p>Currently, trains on the North-South and East-West lines run
              every five to six minutes at non-peak hours.</p>
              <p>He said that current QOS standards for buses are not stringent
              enough, and his ministry and the Land Transport Authority are
              studying how to tighten them.</p>
              <p>Currently, operators must ensure that at least 80 per cent of
              bus services and 90 per cent of feeder services depart from bus
              interchanges and terminals no later than every 10 minutes during
              weekday peak periods. There are also benchmarks for reliability,
              bus loads and safety.</p>

              <p>If he says the service quality needs to improve, then that means it is not efficient in the first place.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Already privatised for so many years but still inefficient with jams, irregular services or whatnots with so many commuter complaints.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The "privatise to be efficient" argument they are telling us is not working leh.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On a side note, as with most problems, this was caused by the massive indiscriminate influx of people into the country over the last few years.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Reducing that number will solve at least partially most of Sg's social problems. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              			<br><br></h1>
              <p>PRESIDENTIAL hopeful Tan Kin Lian wants the Public Transport Council 
              (PTC) to delay fare hikes until transport operators improve the quality 
              of service.</p>
              <p>He echoed public complaints about operators SBS Transit and SMRT.</p>
              <p>Members of the public have expressed unhappiness that the 
              two operators are seeking to raise fares with no improvement in service.
               They have complained about crowded buses and trains, and unreliable 
              service.</p>
              <p>Mr Tan wrote on his blog: 'I echo the views of the public 
              and wish to ask the Public Transport Council to delay any fare increase 
              until the public transport operators can provide more capacity and 
              improve the standard of service, namely to provide a more comfortable 
              ride with shorter waiting and travelling time.'</p>
              <p>He also urged Transport Minister Lui Tuck Yew and the Land 
              Transport Authority 'to take urgent steps to revamp' the public 
              transport system.</p>
              <p>Mr Tan, a former chief executive of insurance cooperative 
              NTUC Income, has in recent years suggested ways to improve public 
              transport, including more regulation.</p>
