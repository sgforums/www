              <p>Female sexual dysfunction - which is claimed to affect up to two 
              thirds of women - is a disorder invented by the pharmaceutical industry 
              to build global markets for drugs to treat it, it is claimed today.</p>
              <p>Drug companies have invested millions in the search for a female 
              equivalent of Viagra, so far without success. But while doing so they 
              have stoked demand by creating a buzz around the disorder they have 
              created, according to Ray Moynihan, a lecturer at the University of 
              Newcastle in Australia.</p>
              <p>Corporate employees worked with medical opinion leaders, ran surveys 
              aimed at portraying the problem as widespread and helped create the 
              diagnostic instruments to persuade women that their sexual difficulties 
              deserved a medical label. But sex problems in women are far more complex
               than they are in men, encompassing lack of desire, lack of arousal and 
              lack of orgasm and the drug industry's narrow focus is failing them.</p>
              <p>Mr
               Moynihan, who first investigated the drug industry's role in female 
              sexual dysfunction a decade ago, says it illustrates a wider problem 
              about the creation of new diseases, and the widening of existing 
              boundaries for treatment with designations such as pre-diabetes, 
              pre-hypertension and pre-osteoporosis, for which the latest treatments 
              are aggressively promoted.</p>
              <div id="DivContentRect" class="advert" style="position: relative;"></div>
              <p>In his new book, <em>Sex, Lies and Pharmaceuticals</em>, which is previewed in the <em>British Medical Journal</em>,
               he says: "Drug marketing is merging with medical science in a 
              fascinating and frightening way. Perhaps it is time to reassess the way 
              in which the medical establishment defines common conditions and 
              recommends how to treat them."</p>
              <p>In 2005, Pfizer, makers of Viagra, funded a survey which showed 63 per 
              cent of women had sexual dysfunction and that testosterone and Viagra 
              might be helpful.</p>
              <p>In 2006, Procter and Gamble, makers of a testosterone patch for women, 
              sponsored a survey showing one in 10 postmenopausal women had hypoactive
               [low] sexual desire disorder (the company sold its drug business in 
              2009).</p>
              <p>In 2008, Boehringer Ingelheim, makers of flibanserin which is claimed to
               boost the female libido, sponsored a survey which also showed one in 10
               women was in need of help.</p>
              <p>Efforts by the companies to meet the need have subsequently foundered. 
              Pfizer pulled Viagra from the market for women after trials showed it 
              had no greater effect than placebo.</p>
              <p>Procter and Gamble's testosterone patch was rejected in 2004 in the US, 
              over fears it raised the risk of cancer and heart disease and Beohringer
               Ingelheim's drug, flibanserin, was rejected by the US Food and Drug 
              Administration in June on the grounds it had failed to deliver the 
              agreed benefits while carrying the risk of serious side effects.</p>
              <p>Mr Moynihan warns that although the drugs have so far failed, more are 
              in the pipeline and claims that "the drug industry shows no signs of 
              abandoning plans to meet the unmet need it has helped to manufacture".</p>
              <p>A spokesman for Pfizer said: "We currently have no plans to develop medicines for FSD."</p>
