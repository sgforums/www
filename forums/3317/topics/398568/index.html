              <p>Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan has undergone a heart bypass on the advice

              <p>The decision for the surgery, which was carried out on Tuesday, was made
               after Mr Khaw had gone for a coronary angiogram, which is an X-ray test
               to check the blood vessels and chambers of the heart. <br> <br> A spokesperson from the Ministry of Health said Mr Khaw was fit and well
               prior to the operation. <br> <br> She added that the procedure went smoothly and Mr Khaw is doing well now
               and is hopeful of a speedy recovery.</p>

              <p><strong>Khaw recovering after bypass</strong></p>
              <p>HEALTH Minister Khaw Boon Wan had heart bypass surgery on Tuesday and
               is now recovering in hospital.</p>
              <p>He is expected to be discharged in a few days, but will be away from 
              work for some weeks.</p>
              <p>The Prime Minister's Office (PMO) said Mr Raymond Lim, 
              Minister for Transport and Second Minister for Foreign Affairs, will 
              cover Mr Khaw's responsibilities at the Health Ministry for the next 
              three weeks.</p>
              <p>Mr Khaw, 56, who has a history of high cholesterol levels 
              and has been on medication for some years, was advised by his doctor to 
              have the bypass surgery after a blockage was discovered during a routine
               health screening.</p>
              <p>A statement from the PMO said Mr Khaw did a stress 
              electrocardiogram test - which checks arterial blood flow as the patient
               exercises on a treadmill - that turned up an abnormal pattern.</p>
              <p>He was then put through more tests which found 'significant 
              narrowing of a major heart artery'.</p>

              <p><strong>Health Minister posts first blog since heart bypass</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan has posted his first 
              blog entry in three weeks since his heart bypass surgery. </span></p>
              <p><span> In his blog, Mr Khaw thanked his many well-wishers and said he was 
              touched by the love, friendship and compassion shown to him. </span></p>
              <p><span>The minister wrote that a timely CT scan of his heart revealed a 
              blockage in his left main artery, that only a heart bypass can treat.   A
               heart bypass requires the surgeon to split the breast bone, and 
              recovery takes months.   Describing it as a "major operation", Mr Khaw 
              said he's now recovering gradually but steadily, and precautions against
               infection are now his main concern.
              <br> <br> During the recovery period, Mr Khaw will also have to guard against 
              accidental over-exertion. 
              <br> <br> Pictures on his blog show Mr Khaw doing physiotherapy exercises at the 
              National Heart Centre. These include simple stretching and sessions on 
              the treadmill. 
              <br> <br> He goes to the National Heart Centre for cardiac physiotherapy and 
              supervised treadmill exercises.
              <br> <br> These sessions three times a week are about the only time he leaves his 
              house.
              <br> <br> Doctors have ordered plenty of rest and discouraged visits by 
              well-wishers.  So Mr Khaw says he has also been disconnected from his 
              email network.
              <br> <br> He shared how Education Minister and former surgeon Dr Ng Eng Hen made a
               short visit and instructed Mrs Khaw to "lock up" his PC and notebook.
              <br> <br> As he focuses on recuperating, Mr Khaw added that he's beginning to 
              reconnect with the outside world as he enters week four of post-surgery.
               He will do so starting first with Facebook. - CNA/jy</span></p>

              stress test reading, it was obvious to the cardiologists that he would 
              need a coronary angiogram as soon as possible.
              <br> <br> "But I was in denial," Mr Khaw wrote in his blog, titled "Living At 
              Cliff's Edge".
              <br> <br> He said a staff from the National Heart Centre called up a few times to 
              schedule an angiogram session.
              <br> <br> "I played delay tactic," Mr Khaw wrote.
              <br> <br> He said he went to Penang one weekend for Qing Ming (Chinese tradition 
              of ancestral worship at graveyard) and kept the information from his 
              siblings.
              <br> <br> "My sister noticed a package of medicine in my luggage, including 
              aspirin which she recognised and probed. I did not want to alarm the 
              siblings and I still thought that it was all a false alarm, so I did not
               disclose the facts," said Mr Khaw.
              <br> <br> Mr Khaw said he confided in Labour Chief Lim Swee Say who was most 
              alarmed and thought that he was wrong to postpone the angiogram.
              <br> <br> Mr Khaw even intensified his exercise routines to prove that he was in 
              top physical form. 
              <br> <br> "I used to run on treadmill three times a week; I increased it to five. 
              Each time, I ran at my usual pace of 8 km per hour for half an hour," 
              said Mr Khaw.
              <br> <br> The minister said he faithfully carried the Glytrin spray with him 
              wherever he went, but only for a few days.
              <br> <br> "Then I told myself: I am not going to get a heart attack; I am not 
              going to carry this. And I actually left it on the shelf," he said.
              <br> <br> While he had spoken to many patients in denial when confronted with an 
              illness, he said he went through such an experience himself.
              <br> <br> "While it is understandable why I did what I did, it was sheer stupidity
               and madness. I am just fortunate that nothing adverse happened in 
              between," said Mr Khaw.
              <br> <br> Mr Khaw also highlighted the recent comments of a general practitioner 
              (GP) with over 30 years' experience.
              <br> <br> The GP had noted that patients who comply well with his advice, 
              especially in taking the lifelong medication, are largely still around.
              <br> <br> Those with an adverse event, a heart attack or a stroke or some other 
              major complications, come largely from the group who do not, or comply 
              half-heartedly, either in denial or over-confidence of their physical 
              health. 
              <br> <br> "I was stubborn and was not a good patient for nearly six weeks. I am 
              making this confession so that hopefully, it can be a life-saving 
              reminder to others. 
              <br> <br> "Please do not follow my example," said Mr Khaw.
              <br> <br> "Get a second opinion by all means, or even a third. But when the 
              overwhelming medical evidence points to a particular approach, do work 
              with the doctors and follow their advice."
              <br> <br> He is grateful to his doctors who persisted and finally scheduled a 
              session for May 3 for him to sit down with the doctors to run through 
              the evidence and the options.
              <br> <br> "That session pulled me from cliff's edge and got me back on the 
              rational track," said Mr Khaw.
              <br> <br> Mr Khaw underwent heart bypass surgery on May 4 and is recovering well. -

              <p><strong>Don't follow my example: Khaw</strong></p>
              <p>NEARLY four weeks after undergoing a coronary artery bypass graft, 
              Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan confessed on his blog that he had been in 
              denial about his condition and put off going for tests and treatment for
               six weeks, against his doctor's advice.</p>
              <p>In his blog entry dated May 27, Mr Khaw said cardiologists had told 
              him he needed to have an angiogram as soon as possible due to his high 
              calcium score and abnormal electrocardiogram stress test reading. A 
              coronary angiogram would allow doctors to inject a dye into the arteries
               to ascertain blood flow in the heart.</p>
              <p>But despite calls from the National Heart Centre to schedule
               one, Mr Khaw said he put it off and even went to Penang one weekend for
               Qing Ming.</p>
              <p>Denial is quite common among patients, said cardiologists, 
              and Mr Khaw's experience is a reminder not to delay health check-ups and
               follow-up treatments. Most patients experience denial especially when 
              they still feel fit.</p>
              <p>In fact, to prove to himself that he was in 'top physical 
              form', the 57-year-old minister went against his doctor's advice to ease
               up on his exercise routines and did the opposite. 'I used to run on 
              (the) treadmill three times a week; I increased it to five. Each time, I
               ran at my usual pace of 8km per hour for half an hour,' he said.</p>
              <p>The stubborn Mr Khaw also stopped carrying his Glytrin 
              spray, a medicine applied under the tongue to dilate blood vessels and 
              make it easier for the heart to pump blood around the body. He told 
              himself: 'I am not going to get a heart attack. I am not going to carry 
              this.'</p>

              <p><strong>Khaw Boon Wan relates how he went from denial to facing heart problem 
              squarely</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan has continued on in his 
              blog to relate how he went from denial about his heart problem to facing
               it "squarely." </span></p>
              <p><span> In an update posted on Monday morning, Mr Khaw said that he went for a 
              CT angiogram on April 29 which revealed a blockage in the Left Main 
              Artery. </span></p>
              <p><span>At this point, he said, "the revelation ended my denial phase."
              <br> <br> Doctors at the National Heart Centre had also send him many articles 
              about heart disease and treatment options which had been useful to him.
              <br> <br> The next step was to do a coronary angiogram to ascertain the exact 
              nature of the blockage, in preparation for a bypass operation.
              <br> <br> When Mr Khaw and his wife met the medical team on May 3, he said he was 
              "calm and took a detached and clinical approach in the discussion."
              <br> <br> He proceeded with the coronary angiogram that same afternoon, with a 
              view for a bypass the next morning.
              <br> <br> Mr Khaw then went home to pack and took a long shower, and was mentally 
              and physically prepared for the open heart surgery on May 4.
              <br> <br> In his previous blog post on Thursday, Mr Khaw had admitted that before 
              the April 29 CT angiogram confirming the blockage, he had been in 
              denial.
              <br> <br> When early tests showed an abnormal ECG stress test reading and high 
              Calcium Score, Mr Khaw said he played "delay tactic" when asked to 
              schedule the angiogram.
              <br> <br> He even intensified his exercise routine.
              <br> <br> Mr Khaw said he was sharing how he was stubborn and not a good patient 
              for nearly six weeks, hoping it can be a life-saving reminder to others 
              not to follow his example. </span></p>

              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan said his heart bypass 
              surgery four weeks ago took just 52 minutes. </span></p>

              <p><span> Two heart surgeons, Prof Kenny Sin and Prof Chua Yeow Leng took two

              heart-lung machine for 29 minutes. </span></p>
              <p><span> He also used a unit of his own blood for the surgery. </span></p>
              <p><span> Mr Khaw is a regular blood donor and the blood that he donated was still

              <p><strong>'It's wonderful to be back'</strong></p>
              <p>HEALTH Minister Khaw Boon Wan, who underwent a major open heart 
              surgery six weeks ago, returned to his office on Monday to a rousing and
               heart-warming welcome from his staff and colleagues.</p>
              <p>Declaring that it's wonderful to be back at work, Mr Khaw thanked his
               colleagues for having kept the ministry 'running smoothly in my 
              absence, without missing a (heart) beat'.</p>
              <p>'I am proud of them,' he says in his latest blog posting on 
              Monday.</p>
              <p>'While I was away, there were some 800 emails built up in my
               inbox. I have used the last two weeks to systematically reply to the 
              old emails. As a result, I have less than 20 outstanding emails today, 
              not so stressful. Would have been bad, otherwise, for my heart, I 
              presume.'</p>
              <p>While his office remains unchanged, he says his daily 
              routines have undergone some changes.</p>
              <p>'First: I am still on cardiac rehabilitation, with regular 
              visits to the National Heart Centre, three times a week. Just now, I 
              brisk walked 2.5 km on treadmill, besides various stretching and weights
               exercises.</p>
              <p>'Second: I have adopted a fully plant-based diet plan, 
              avoiding all meat, not even fish or dairy products. Today's lunch was 
              bought from SGH food court: salad with no dressing, vegetable sandwich 
              (on wholegrain bread) and fruits. This morning's breakfast was oats, 
              wholegrain bread and fruits.</p>
              <p>'Third: I have cancelled most meetings this first week to 
              allow me to adjust gradually in accordance with my level of physical 
              health.'</p>
              <p>So far, he has been able to cope with his first day at work,
               says the minister, adding that his colleagues have helped to ease his 
              adjustments a lot.</p>
              <p>But his community and political work at Sembawang will have 
              to wait a while longer.</p>
              <p>'I am not physically ready to climb a lot of stairs and do 
              house-to-house visits. I am also not yet able to man the 
              Meet-the-People's Session, but I will start vetting and signing the 
              appeal letters based on the interviews conducted by my Branch 
              activists,' he says in his blog.</p>
              <p>'They are experienced and know how to gather the key points 
              to strengthen the residents' appeals. We will not fail our residents at 
              their hour of need.'</p>
