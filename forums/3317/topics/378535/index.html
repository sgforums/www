              <p>JERUSALEM - Turkey has
              excluded Israel from an air exercise over Turkish territory, leading to
              its cancellation, the Israeli military said on Sunday, in a sign of
              worsening relations between the two close American allies.</p>
              <p>Turkish officials had no immediate comment.</p>
              <p>Turkey,
              a secular Muslim country, has been a key ally to Israel, but relations
              have cooled over Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan's outspoken
              criticism of Israel's three-week offensive in the Hamas-ruled Gaza
              Strip in December and January.</p>
              <p>The military exercise, scheduled
              to begin on Monday in Turkey, takes place every few years with the aim
              of improving international aerial cooperation, the Israeli military
              said.</p>
              <p>"The exercise has been postponed as a result of Turkey's
              decision to change the list of participating countries, thus excluding
              Israel," a military statement said.</p>
              <p>An Israeli political source
              said Turkey had rejected Israeli participation and postponed the drill
              indefinitely after other nations, including the United States and
              Italy, refused to take part without Israel's air force.</p>
              <p>Turkey
              and Israel have enjoyed close military cooperation, including Israeli
              air force training in Turkish air space. The two countries also share
              intelligence and have strong trade ties, including the sale of
              important military equipment.</p>
              <p>Relations were strained after
              Erdogan publicly criticised Israel over the Gaza campaign and walked
              out on Israeli President Shimon Peres at the World Economic Forum in
              Switzerland in January.</p>
              <p>A U.N. report last month found that
              both the Israeli armed forces and Hamas militants committed war crimes
              in the Gaza war, but it was more critical of Israel.</p>
              <p>A
              Palestinian rights group says 1,417 Palestinians, including 926
              civilians, were killed in the war. Israel has said 709 Palestinian
              combatants were killed along with 295 civilians and 162 people whose
              status it was unable to clarify.</p>
              <p>Fourteen Israelis were killed
              during the conflict which Israel launched with the declared aim of
              curtailing cross-border rocket attacks from the Gaza Strip.</p>
