              <p><strong>Lapses &amp; weaknesses in management of public funds in some ministries, govt agencies</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : Lapses and weaknesses in the internal controls over 
              the management of public funds have been found in several ministries and
               government agencies. This was revealed in the Auditor-General's report 
              for the financial year 2009/2010 released on Tuesday. </span></p>
              <p><span> The report also showed the need for greater vigilance in the area of IT security. </span></p>
              <p><span> But the lapses were not as severe as those highlighted in last year's 
              report, which involved millions of dollars that could have been spent 
              more prudently. </span></p>
              <p><span>Some of the areas that came under scrutiny were how well finances were managed and how efficiently resources were used.
              <br> <br> One ministry that did not fare well in financial management was Community Development, Youth and Sports.
              <br> <br> Managing agents of three welfare homes transferred donations of S$34,907
               to the accounts of voluntary welfare organisations (VWOS) - when the 
              money should have gone to the homes.
              <br> <br> At one welfare home, valuables and nearly S$13,000 cash belonging to 
              residents were kept in cardboard boxes and shopping bags in the 
              Superintendent's office.
              <br> <br> The misuse of government payouts meant for patients was also uncovered under the Ministry of Finance accounts.
              <br> <br> Test checks at six nursing homes showed that between 2005 and 2009, as 
              estimated S$1.19 million in government payouts was cashed by the homes 
              on behalf of patients. But one home treated the money as its revenue, 
              while the other five used it to pay for medical treatment and charges 
              incurred by the respective patients, without their authorisation.
              <br> <br> One of the homes also used the money to buy general supplies and equipment such as wheelchairs and safety vests.
              <br> <br> Wastage of public funds was another issue. Here, the Ministry of Defence
               did not fare well. Checks on two camps revealed lapses in the way meals
               were accounted for - there were 63 instances of excess meal orders. 
              These were covered up by personnel managing the cookhouses or servicemen
               who falsified the records. That resulted in unnecessary expenditure of 
              about S$22,000. The report stated that MINDEF has taken disciplinary 
              action against the personnel involved in the falsification of records.
              <br> <br> There was also an instance when revenue due to the government was not collected.
              <br> <br> The Singapore Police Force lost S$648,000 in revenue; for more than 10 
              years, it did not charge town councils and statutory boards a fee of 
              S$25 for every Warrant of Arrest enforced.
              <br> <br> This happened between 1997 and 2009 for several prosecuting agencies.
              <br> <br> As for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, it had over 50 cases of 
              overpayment of salaries, bonuses, overtime claims, medical and dental 
              subsidies to the mission staff, as well as double payment of medical 
              expenses. These amounted to at least $5,800.
              <br> <br> Other lapses observed include non-compliance with government 
              instructions and guidelines such as an officer certifying his own 
              claims. 
              <br> <br> The report said that although the amount of repayments observed from the
               test checks is not significant, the control lapses need to be rectified
               so that the system of internal controls is rigorous enough to ensure 
              that payments made are correct and for valid purposes.
              <br> <br> In the area of IT, security lapses were found in the government 
              accounting system "NFS@Gov", administered by the Accountant-General's 
              Department.
              <br> <br> Over 640 end-user accounts were wrongly given access rights to an 
              application designer tool. Some of the accounts would allow users to 
              modify programs or records in the system. 
              <br> <br> There was also an unauthorised testing of a computer system at the 
              Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority that saw two invoices 
              generated with incorrect amounts.
              <br> <br> The report stated that the lapses should not be seen as reflecting the 
              general quality of the internal controls in the bodies concerned, but 
              they do point to the need for greater vigilance, especially in IT 
              security as government ministries and statutory boards are extensively 
              computerised. 
              <br> <br> A horizontal audit across statutory boards to identify gaps and 
              shortcomings in governance framework and practices was also conducted. 
              And it was observed that in general, statutory boards had in place 
              systems and processes for governance.
              <br> <br> The report will be deliberated by the Public Accounts Committee and 
              where necessary, particular ministries would have to account for the 
              lapses reported. </span></p>

              <p>I know for one thing the cookhouse issue is real, i did BOS duty once and in my camp the BOS have to check that the coys scanned out their indent for meals. Sometimes you get 1-10 deficit thats no problem cos you can justify it by scanning them as out ration. But what happens when 135 people didnt consume lunch?</p>
              <p>This idiot 2IC indented lunch when the coy is supposed to book out before lunch. So he told his COS to scan out 135 people as out ration. Unfortunately for him i stopped him from doing so saying its fraud. COS relented cos i told him i sort it out.</p>
              <p>Monday morning, the 2IC and the cookhouse supervisor call me up and saying i had to pay for the meals cos it wasnt scanned. I wasnt having any of it and i am not going answer for people's error or stupidity. So i told them i am not paying and they threaten with charges blah blah. So i said go ahead, i even willing to face the CO and go court martial for it. In the end the 2IC paid for it. all $600+ worth.</p>
              <p>I don't know how they do it nowdays but this was like 4 years ago and the 2IC was a WO in a training school. He totally hated me with a vengeance after that..I can say its the first time the system was on my side.</p>

              <p>Too Much Food - ST 4/8/10</p>
              <p>A check on 2 SAF camps found 63 instances of excessive meal orders.</p>
              <p>The extra meals, between June and August 2008, were covered up by staff managing the cookhouse or by serviceman through falsification of records.</p>
              <p>In all, the food wastage was amounted to $22, 231.</p>
              <p>This was due to inadequate controls over meal indents and recording of meal consumption, according to the latest report by the Auditor - General.</p>
              <p>Following the findings, the MINDEF convened a higher board of inquiry to investigate the matter. The board has recommended tightening controls to ensure accurate and prudent meal orders.</p>
              <p>MINDEF has also conducted checks at other SAF camps, and taken disciplinary action against personnel involved in the falsification of records. - ST 4/8/10 Pg A5.</p>

              <p>The extra meals, between June and August 2008, were covered up
              by staff managing the cookhouse or by serviceman through
              falsification of records.</p>
              <p>In all, the food wastage was amounted to $22, 231.</p>
              <p>This was due to inadequate controls over meal indents and
              recording of meal consumption, according to the latest report by
              the Auditor - General.</p>
              <p>Following the findings, the MINDEF convened a higher board of
              inquiry to investigate the matter. The board has recommended
              tightening controls to ensure accurate and prudent meal orders.</p>
              <p>MINDEF has also conducted checks at other SAF camps, and taken
              disciplinary action against personnel involved in the falsification
              of records. - ST 4/8/10 Pg A5.</p>

              <p>Seriously, it is only 22k only. What is the issue about it?</p>
              <p>I always have this question in mind. The last time when I indent rations, it cost around $4.5 for breakfast, $5-6 for lunch and dinner etc. But seriously, when we, NSF/NSmen eat these meals, does it really worth that much? I can get a better meal with $2.50 at hawker center.</p>

              <p>I know for one thing the cookhouse issue is real, i did BOS duty
              once and in my camp the BOS have to check that the coys scanned out
              their indent for meals. Sometimes you get 1-10 deficit thats no
              problem cos you can justify it by scanning them as out ration. But
              what happens when 135 people didnt consume lunch?</p>
              <p>This idiot 2IC indented lunch when the coy is supposed to book
              out before lunch. So he told his COS to scan out 135 people as out
              ration. Unfortunately for him i stopped him from doing so saying
              its fraud. COS relented cos i told him i sort it out.</p>
              <p>Monday morning, the 2IC and the cookhouse supervisor call me up
              and saying i had to pay for the meals cos it wasnt scanned. I wasnt
              having any of it and i am not going answer for people's error or
              stupidity. So i told them i am not paying and they threaten with
              charges blah blah. So i said go ahead, i even willing to face the
              CO and go court martial for it. In the end the 2IC paid for it. all
              $600+ worth.</p>
              <p>I don't know how they do it nowdays but this was like 4 years
              ago and the 2IC was a WO in a training school. He totally hated me
              with a vengeance after that..I can say its the first time the
              system was on my side.</p>
