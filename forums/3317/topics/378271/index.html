              <p><strong>Stallholders upset over plans to turn wet markets to supermarkets</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: The Housing and Development Board (HDB) said on
                  Thursday it will consider the needs of residents before approving any
                  application to convert wet markets into supermarkets.
                  <br> <br> HDB also said it will ensure the area retains the same variety of choices, as far as possible, when the application is approved.
                  <br> <br>The possibility of converting a wet market at Marine Parade into an
                  air-conditioned, privately owned supermarket has cast a cloud over the
                  future of stallholders.
                  <br> <br>Lim Lee Chye, a hawker at Marine Parade wet market, said: "After
                  our lease expires, we won't have a say in the decision, so everyone's
                  worried."
                  <br> <br>On the other hand, the Federation of Merchants' Association said
                  supermarkets will add value to the community. This is because they can
                  afford to sell goods at lower prices, retail for longer hours and
                  provide work to younger jobseekers.
                  <br> <br> To retain customers, the association added that stallholders at wet markets must draw on their strengths.
                  <br> <br>Chua Ser Keng, president of the Federation of Merchants'
                  Association, said: "One advantage they have is that their produce is
                  fresher, so customers can expect better quality when they buy from
                  them."
                  <br> <br> Another plus point is the sense of community that stallholders bring to the estate.
                  <br> <br>David Chiang, chairman of Bukit Timah Market Hawker Association,
                  said: "You can see friends drinking tea or chatting. Hawkers are also
                  friendly with one another and sometimes if you don't have enough money,
                  you can put it on your tab."
                  <br> <br> Currently, there are 101 wet markets in Singapore, owned by the National Environment Agency or under private management.

              <p><strong>5 privately owned wet markets to remain as they are even if Sheng Siong takes over</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Five privately owned wet markets won't be converted into air-conditioned supermarkets if Sheng Siong takes over. </span></p>
              <p><span>This is because HDB told MediaCorp, the supermarket chain has expressed taking over the wet markets in their existing state. 
              <br> <br> The wet markets are located in areas like Choa Chu Kang, Bukit Batok and Serangoon North.
              <br> <br> Earlier, stallholders at the Serangoon Wet Market were trying to garner
              3,000 signatures, to petition against the conversion into a
              supermarket.
              <br> <br> Over 600 residents in the area have so far signed the petition which started two days ago. 
              <br> <br> Stallholders said a supermarket cannot replace the relationships between stallholders and residents. 
              <br> <br>Ronnie Pang, stallholder, Serangoon Wet Market, said: "We've been
              here for so many years and we've invested a lot of relationship here.
              We know the residents here. They've been coming here. We know them for
              so many years. I don’t think its fair to both us and the residents.” </span></p>

              <p><strong>Private operator of Sembawang wet market likely to continue lease</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : MP for Sembawang GRC Khaw Boon Wan has said he is
              glad Sembawang will continue to have a wet market to meet the needs of
              residents. </span></p>
              <p><span>But Mr Khaw, who is also Health Minister, told the media at a community event on Sunday that residents must ensure it is viable.
              <br> <br> Mr Khaw said: "Residents will also have to support the wet market,
              because if they just say I want a wet market but they do not frequent
              them...at the end of the day, the operator needs to have business.
              <br> <br>"If they continue the operation and there are very few customers,
              then they cannot support the rental, then it will not be sustainable.
              So I think at the end of the day, it is the consumers who will decide.
              So the residents have now expressed their view that they want wet
              market, then I think they should support the wet market operator."
              <br> <br>For the last six years, a private operator - Sembawang Mart Pte Ltd
              - has been renting the entire wet market at Canberra Road from the
              Housing and Development Board (HDB).
              <br> <br>On September 18, the operator gave its 20 tenants a one-month
              notice to move out, with the intention of transferring the tenancy to
              NTUC FairPrice when its lease ended. <br> <br> HDB had earlier promised that should NTUC FairPrice take over, a
              section would be set aside for fresh market produce, as this is the
              only wet market in Sembawang.
              <br> <br> The stallholders sent petitions to their MP Mr Khaw and residents also requested the private operator renew its tenancy. 
              <br> <br> MediaCorp understands that come Monday, the private operator will apply for a lease extension of three years with HDB. </span></p>

              <p>JUst a penny for thought!!!</p>
              <p>It is important to keep some wet markets in place for its heritage value and fresher food, not forgetting the "good memories" that a child had for accompanying their mum "window shopping" at the wet market. Without doubt, an unforgettable experience for all.</p>
              <p>The disconcerting issue here for the stallholders, would be the likelihood of losing their "rice bowl" in the long run. Should the government intervene, would the wet market business be sustainable?</p>
              <p>Ultimately, by giving the stallholders a month' time is simply too short to make a wise decision.</p>

              <p><strong>HDB clarifies it cannot interfere in sale of privately-owned wet markets</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: The Housing and Development Board (HDB) has said it
              cannot take over the wet markets owned by private operators or
              interfere with the commercial negotiation between the new owner and the
              stallholders when such wet markets change hands. </span></p>
              <p><span> The HDB also cannot "impose new requirements that are more stringent on
              the new owner, compared to those already imposed on the existing one". </span></p>
              <p><span> HDB said this in a statement on Wednesday in response to recent media
              reports on the concerns of some stallholders affected by the sale of
              five wet markets owned by a commercial operator. </span></p>
              <p><span>These five markets are located in Choa Chu Kang Street 62, Choa
              Chu Kang Avenue 1, Serangoon Avenue 3, Bukit Batok West Avenue 8 and
              Fajar Road.
              <br> <br>Some of the stallholders have asked the government to intervene so
              that they can retain their stalls at current rents after the change in
              the commercial owner of the wet markets.
              <br> <br>HDB explained that the existing owner, Heeton, bought four of the
              five wet markets through separate tenders called by HDB in 1994 and
              1996 and one wet market through a resale.
              <br> <br>The existing stallholders are, therefore, tenants of Heeton and not
              HDB. They are also not the former street hawkers who were resettled in
              centres that are now managed by the National Environment Agency.
              <br> <br>HDB said it "understands the concerns of the stallholders that
              there may be changes to their terms and conditions for tenancy after
              the sale of the wet markets to a new commercial owner". But it cannot
              interfere as "the sale of the wet markets is a property transaction
              between two private parties".
              <br> <br>The new owner, Sheng Siong Property, has informed HDB that it is
              prepared to continue renting out the wet market stalls to the existing
              stallholders. It will need to discuss the terms and conditions with
              affected stallholders after the sale of the wet markets is completed.
              <br> <br>For affected stallholders who would like to look for alternative
              stalls, HDB can refer them to vacant market stalls in NEA-managed
              centres.
              <br> <br>HDB will also ensure that the marketing needs of residents are not
              compromised in the process. Hence, it has disallowed the conversion of
              the wet markets to supermarkets based on the reasons explained earlier.
              <br> <br>HDB will work closely with the local advisers, grassroots leaders
              and the various stakeholders to manage the change in ownership at the
              five affected wet markets.

              <p><strong>Sheng Siong will not raise rent at wet markets for first 3 months of 2010</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Sheng Siong Supermarket said on Saturday it will not
              increase rent at the five wet markets that it bought over recently, at
              least for the first three months of next year. </span></p>
              <p><span>Even though plans to convert the wet markets into air-conditioned
              supermarkets have been shelved for now, at least nine out of 130
              stallholders have given up their businesses.
              <br> <br>Sheng Siong bought the wet markets located at Choa Chu Kang, Bukit
              Batok and Fajar Road for over S$20 million. Stallholders at these
              markets get a one-year contract with Sheng Siong, with a one-month
              notice period if the space is needed.
              <br> <br> Some stallholders said they have decided to move out as they are concerned over the lack of certainty about their future.
              <br> <br>This has, in turned, caused some anxiety among those who are
              staying as they feel empty stalls will dampen the overall business of
              the wet market.

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">SINGAPORE: Five wet markets began their new lease with supermarket giant Sheng Siong on Friday.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">But some tenants have left, suspecting rental costs would increase after three months. Moreover, stallholders at some markets reported a 20 per cent decrease in customer traffic.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">At the Fajar Market in Bukit Panjang, five out of 22 stalls have closed down. Among them were those that sold fruits, dried goods and meat.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Other stallholders said that customers stopped going to the markets as they now consider them "incomplete".</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Bek Seng Seow, seafood seller, Fajar Market said: "Look, there is such a small crowd now. It is already hard as it is, maintaining the stall. If there are so few customers and prices keep rising, how can we survive?"</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Tang Sio Hong, vegetable seller, Yew Tee Market said: "The lease will definitely increase. But each year the price will be different. We don’t know how much of an increase, but they will tell us by end—February."</p>

              <p>It is important to keep some wet markets in place for its heritage value and fresher food, not forgetting the "good memories" that a child had for accompanying their mum "window shopping" at the wet market. Without doubt, an unforgettable experience for all.</p>
              <p>The disconcerting issue here for the stallholders, would be the likelihood of losing their "rice bowl" in the long run. Should the government intervene, would the wet market business be sustainable?</p>
              <p>Ultimately, by giving the stallholders a month' time is simply too short to make a wise decision.</p>

              <p><br>not only for cultural benefits. there is actually economic reasons to it as well.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>for instance, small stalls ( which i would like to call monopolistic competitive firms) are highly competitive and caters to a smal group of people. only way they can fight supermarkets is through the quality of their products. hmm, i would say certain stuff are definately much fresher in wet market than in supermarket right? hahah. so yea.. even though price maybe higher than oligopolistic firms like supermarkets. but the former's edge over the latter is quality of products.</p>
              <p>also, if the government allows supermarkets to own too much market share, too much market power may lead to consumer exploitation( in terms of higher pricing/ complacency that leads to less improvement in products/services). however, this case is unlikely as NTUC is a government firm? and the government will step in to control the situation if this arises.</p>
              <p>IMO, wet markets will remain as it is for a long time. but they face stiff competition from supermarkets which may offer better prices.</p>
