              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: The Republic has dropped a notch to fourth place in 
              an annual world competitiveness ranking, with a weaker showing in areas 
              like cost of living and immigration laws pertaining to employment of 
              foreign labour.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>In Swiss business 
              school IMD's annual World Competitiveness Yearbook ranking this year, 
              Singapore fell out of the top three, coming in behind Hong Kong, the 
              United States and Switzerland. Last year, the Republic was third, with 
              Hong Kong and the US tying in first place. </span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The report listed 40
               factors that it considered were the Republic's strengths. These 
              included the unemployment rate, social cohesion, transparency, higher 
              education achievement and finance and banking regulation. In these 40 
              areas, Singapore was ranked between 1st and 6th place, out of 59 
              countries.<br><br>It also cited 24 areas of "weaknesses" - in these areas, the Republic ranked between 34th and 57th place.<br><br>In
               particular, Singapore was ranked 57th out of 59 countries under the 
              cost of living index, while the Republic also ranked 41st for 
              immigration laws and 48th in pupil-teacher ratio in primary education. <br><br>All
               these factors were part of four main categories - economic performance,
               government efficiency, business efficiency and infrastructure - used to
               score a country's competitiveness. <br><br>The report used statistical 
              indicators to measure quantifiable issues and drew from its annual 
              Executive Opinion Survey for qualitative issues, such as labour 
              relations. The survey had 4,210 respondents from 59 countries. The 
              respondents - executives in top- and middle-management with global 
              exposure - were nationals or expatriates in the country, representative 
              of the economy, the report said. <br><br>The report also surveyed 
              respondents on what they perceived were the "key attractiveness factors"
               of the economy: "Policy stability and predictability". "competency of 
              Government", and an "effective legal environment" were the top three 
              factors cited.<br><br>"Effective labour relations" received among the least responses as being a key attractive factor. <br><br>CIMB
               regional economist Song Seng Wun felt labour relations ranked lowly as 
              "it was never an issue" and, hence, was not considered by respondents as
               a key attractiveness factor.<br><br>However, other analysts said the 
              low ranking could be indirectly linked to the Government's moves to 
              tighten foreign labour policies. DBS economist Irvin Seah added: 
              "Low-wage Singapore workers also continue to face a strain and the help 
              given so far, to some extent, is rather limited."<br><br>Apart from the 
              IMD report, other globally recognised competitiveness rankings include 
              the World Bank Doing Business report and the Political and Economic Risk
               Consultancy (PERC) survey. In this year's World Bank report, Singapore 
              ranked first, while in the PERC survey between November last year and 
              March this year, Singapore and Australia generally received the most 
              favourable assessments. <br><br>On the low rating for Singapore's 
              immigration laws, Mr Song attributed it to the Government's recent moves
               to tighten the foreign worker policy, which has made it more expensive 
              to bring in foreign workers. "Going forward, you probably find that wage
               cost will climb, and this is where businesses may have a bit more gripe
               in the next survey," he added.<br><br>Ang Mo Kio Group Representation 
              Constituency Member of Parliament Inderjit Singh said he was "surprised"
               that pupil-teacher ratio was considered a weakness in the economy. 
              Still, he acknowledged the ratio in schools here is high compared to 
              schools in Australia, the US and other Western countries.<br><br>Respondents
               in the survey were also asked to score their country's attitude towards
               globalisation. In this regard, Singapore came in 7th, behind places 
              such as Malaysia (4th), Hong Kong (5th) and Taiwan (6th). <br><br>Mr 
              Singh said: "In terms of venturing into a more diversified group of 
              markets, the Malaysians seem to have done much more than Singaporeans." <br><br>He
               noted that Malaysians have ventured to as far as Africa, while 
              Singapore companies are "concentrated in a smaller base of countries 
              overseas".<br><br>The IMD report also identified challenges that 
              Singapore has to tackle this year, including adjusting to a slower 
              workforce growth and helping small and medium enterprises with 
              productivity and innovation. The Republic also needs to encourage 
              internationalisation and develop new competitive strengths, while 
              building a fair and inclusive society, said the report.<br><br>- </span><span class="path">TODAY</span></span></p>
