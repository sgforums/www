              <p>JAKARTA — Just as the Singapore Embassy in Jakarta opened its doors on Tuesday (Aug 23) for well-wishers to sign a condolence book after Mr SR Nathan’s passing, a small protest was held over the alleged mistreatment of a retired Indonesian senior general in Changi Airport.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Demonstrators from Pemuda Panca Marga (PPM), an organisation linked to the military, showed up to protest the alleged mistreatment of Lieutenant General (retired) Suryo Prabowo at Singapore’s airport last week, the Singapore embassy wrote on its Facebook page. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is believed that around 30 people participated in the protest, though the embassy did not give a figure.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The embassy added that the demonstration proceeded outside without interrupting the signing of the condolence book inside. “We would like to extend our thanks to the Jakarta police for ensuring law and order, as well as the safety of the Embassy during this period,” it said.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Mr Prabowo had arrived in Singapore on August 17 from Fiji on a Fiji Airways plane when he was denied entry to Singapore while he was transiting through Changi Airport. He was interviewed by checkpoint officers, a practice in accordance with screening procedures for border security, the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) said in a statement Saturday.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>“After completing the interview, he was allowed to board his flight,” the ICA statement continued.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>“As part of the immigration clearance process, travellers to Singapore may be subjected to additional interview and/or screening. These procedures are conducted at all of Singapore’s checkpoints,” ICA added.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The incident reverberated to Jakarta. Indonesian media reported that the Indonesian Military (TNI) Chief, General Gatot Nurmantyo, wrote a note to Singapore to protest the treatment of Mr Prabowo.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Some even suggested that Mr Prabowo has been blacklisted by Singaporean authorities.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Arrmanatha Nasir later clarified that Mr Prabowo has not been blacklisted, adding that a similar name may have been the cause behind the unexpected delay. The spokesperson also gave no indication that the Indonesian Foreign Ministry would file a note of protest.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In its Facebook post on Tuesday, the Singapore Embassy in Jakarta took the opportunity to recount one of Mr Nathan’s sayings in relation to the incident.“This was a suitable moment to recall what Mr S R Nathan had once said about the qualities needed to be a successful Foreign Service Officer of Singapore: patience, calmness, modesty, empathy and good humour,” it said. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>“More importantly, he had also reminded us that Singapore Foreign Service Officers must have patriotism and a sense of mission; integrity and honesty; and the ability to carry on with our work, even under pressure. Timeless advice.”</p>
