              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: We can tell a lot about what people regard as right 
              or wrong by their responses to transgressions. In the case of the Amy 
              Cheong incident, it is interesting to note that the primary focus has 
              been on her racial prejudices - while almost nothing has been said about
               her presumptions about class. </span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Her presumption that
               one's right to marry depends on the amount of money one has is as 
              troubling - if not more so - than her narrow presumptions and negative 
              feelings toward Malays.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The relative silence
               about the relationship she draws between money and marriage reveals our
               deeper common sense: One where wealth, worth and deservedness are 
              tightly tethered.<br><br>In The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of 
              Capitalism, Max Weber argues that people born into modern capitalism are
               trapped in an "iron cage" - unable to decide their paths, and compelled
               to work hard, be frugal and accumulate wealth for its own sake rather 
              than as a means to larger goals.<br><br>He perhaps underestimated the 
              degree to which the pursuit and accumulation of wealth can take on 
              tremendous meaning and normative value, with disturbing consequences for
               human beings' sense of themselves and their regard for each other. <br><br></span><strong>THE VALUE OF BEING RICH</strong><span><br><br>In
               Singapore, the recent debates over social spending, education and 
              meritocracy, and population and immigration have brought to the fore the
               need to narrow the gaps between the rich and the poor and to ensure 
              social mobility. <br><br>This seems to be the consensus, even if there is disagreement as to how these goals are to be achieved. <br><br>What
               is less explicit, and where there might be lower degrees of consensus, 
              pertains to how the state and society perceive the value of being 
              wealthy. That discussion has not found a big place at the table of 
              national conversations. <br><br>We seem to have accepted too easily that
               what people can and cannot do in life - including when they can marry 
              or how many children they can have - depends on whether they can afford 
              it. <br><br>It is apt for society to place this worldview under scrutiny. Two recent pieces of news add to the urgency of this. <br><br>First,
               in the Wealth Report 2012, Singapore sits prettily at the top with the 
              highest gross domestic product per capita - a situation that is expected
               to remain until 2050.<br><br>Second, the Prime Minister revealed in his
               National Day Rally Speech that, by 2020, 40 per cent of every 
              Singaporean cohort will comprise of graduates, a significant increase 
              from the 27 per cent today.<br><br>These achievements and targets come 
              at a time when the government acknowledges that we are experiencing a 
              widening income gap. This intensifies the unequal starting point among 
              the haves and the have-nots, harming the meritocratic ideals of our 
              system.<br><br></span><strong>DANGEROUSLY NARROW BAR</strong><span><br><br>With 
              increasing affluence and educational attainment among a significant 
              proportion of society, what is traditionally considered status goods, 
              such as the often talked about 5Cs in Singapore, is constantly being 
              redefined. <br><br>The bar for "success" is increasingly high and, yet, 
              also dangerously narrow. We seem to have a situation where certain 
              sections of society feel a sense of entitlement to various status goods.
               <br><br>Significantly, their practices and values shape social norms 
              that presume certain acts - whether spending on weddings or luxury goods
               - mark people as superior and of higher (human) worth (it is telling 
              and problematic that rich people are now referred to as "high net worth 
              individuals").<br><br>Ms Amy Cheong's remarks should be read as being as
               much class snobbery as racial prejudice. Class snobbery concerns are 
              not unique to Singapore: England's Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg 
              recently warned that "class snobbery is holding Britain back by creating
               a society divided between those born with a sense of entitlement to 
              succeed and others who are 'permanently excluded'." <br><br>It is 
              heartening to witness Singaporeans being comfortable enough to air 
              difficult issues on race, but it would be unfortunate if important 
              observations on social class divisions take a backseat. <br><br>The Amy 
              Cheong episode presents Singaporeans with an opportunity to openly 
              debate the ethics of living in a generally affluent society that has 
              widening inequality. <br><br>How should we value wealth? How do we make 
              sure citizens' rights to fulfilling and meaningful lives are not heavily
               dependent on their abilities to generate wealth? Given that no 
              individual can become rich independent of what society provides, what 
              are the social responsibilities of the haves towards the have-nots? <br><br>In
               a quote attributed to Karl Marx, he mentioned that in examining social 
              inequality, "the least advantaged are the eyes that matter when it comes
               to looking at justice". A truly national conversation will have to 
              examine the category of "least advantaged" through multifarious lenses -
               whether race, age, gender or social class. <br><br>It is time to talk about whether the positions and worldviews of the privileged should be a standard for the rest. <br><br></span><em>Teo
