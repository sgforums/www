              <p>POLICE have arrested a 39-year-old man for making a bomb-hoax call to
               the Police emergency hotline '999'.</p>
              <p>Police said they received an anonymous call via the emergency hotline
               '999' at about 3pm on Wednesday from a man who claimed that he was a 
              terrorist and that Sentosa would be blown up.</p>
              <p>Following the call, security measures were stepped up while 
              investigators from Central Police Division sprang into action to trace 
              the anonymous caller.</p>
              <p>The officers conducted extensive ground enquiries and managed to 
              establish the identity of the suspect. Their efforts paid off when the 
              suspect was spotted by officers along Tras Street at about 11pm. He was 
              arrested.</p>
              <p>Investigations revealed that the threat was not substantiated and the
               call was a hoax.</p>
              <p>The suspect will be charged in court 26 on Friday. If convicted, he 
              faces a fine of up to $100,000 or a jail term of up to five years, or 
              both. A court order will also be sought for the suspect to be remanded 
              at the Institute of Mental Health for psychiatric assessment.</p>

              <p><strong>Bomb hoax suspect charged</strong></p>
              <p>AN ODD-JOB worker was charged on Friday with making an anonymous hoax
               bomb threat.</p>
              <p>Lee Hoong Kong, 39, is alleged to have called the police at 3pm on 
              Wednesday to tell them that the whole of Sentosa would be blown up in 
              less than three hours.</p>
              <p>According to the charge, Lee spoke English when he claimed 
              to be a Muslim fundamentalist extremist and his target was Sentosa.</p>
              <p>In the call, he is also believed to have said: 'The first 
              scenario will be at the Taiwanese Hot Pot restaurant near Imbiah 
              monorail station. It will happen at 5.45pm. The whole of Sentosa 
              including Resorts World Sentosa Casino will go up in flames as well. 
              Anyway, I have 100 C4 bombs.'</p>
              <p>Lee was also charged with allegedly committing mischief at 
              the Sijori Wondergolf Sentosa facility on June 20.</p>
              <p>At 1pm, he is said to have damaged a cash register, a 
              credit card reader, a standing fan, the doors to the cashier counter and
               several other items. Total damage came up to $3150.</p>
              <p>The judge ordered him to be remanded at the Institute of 
              Mental Health for psychiatric evaluation. His case will be mentioned in 
              court again on July 23.</p>
