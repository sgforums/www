              <p><strong>Retrenchments down sharply, unemployment stabilises in Q2</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: The number of jobs lost in Singapore doubled to 12,400
              in the second quarter of this year, according to the Manpower
              Ministry's (MOM) preliminary estimates on Friday. </span></p>
              <p><span> This is the first time that employment has contracted for two
              consecutive quarters since the 2003 economic downturn. Manufacturing,
              again, bore the brunt of job losses, shedding 17 600 jobs. </span></p>
              <p><span>Construction and services sectors increased their workforce with
              3,400 and 2,100 workers respectively, but the gains were lower than in
              previous quarters. <br> <br> On the other hand, retrenchments appeared to have eased. MOM said 4,800
              workers were laid off and 700 contracts were terminated prematurely in
              the second quarter. <br> <br> This means 5,500 workers were made redundant during that period – half the number compared to the previous quarter. 
              <br> <br> Overall unemployment rate also stabilised at 3.3 per cent in June, unchanged from a quarter ago. 
              <br> <br> Among the resident labour force, the unemployment rate declined from 4.8 per cent in March to 4.6 per cent in June. 
              <br> <br> The reason why job losses did not cause the unemployment rate to go up
              is because the losses were a result of the completion of contracts, and
              many foreign workers left Singapore as their contracts were not
              renewed, hence they did not add to the unemployment statistic.
              <br> <br> However, both the manpower minister and labour chief said that it is too soon to celebrate, and warned of a W-shaped recovery.
              <br> <br>Manpower Minister Gan Kim Yong said: “Whether the third wave of
              retrenchments will happen or when it will happen, we do not know. This
              quarter, as well as next quarter, remain rather uncertain. I've been
              speaking to some of the employers. They were able to see the next two
              months, but they are not sure beyond that.”
              <br> <br>NTUC Secretary-General Lim Swee Say said: “In the labour movement,
              it is important that we continue to work together to guard against a
              possible W-shaped recovery. Why? Because despite recent rallies in the
              financial market and property markets, I think there are still mixed
              reactions about what is happening in our real economy. <br> <br> “The optimists will tell us that the worst is over, the pessimists tell
              us that this rally is not sustainable. In fact, they will tell us their
              assessment is that another bubble is forming. The pragmatists say
              during an upturn, the global economy has a tendency to overshoot the
              upturn. <br> <br> “When you see the economy coming up, don't be too happy, there is no
              way to tell exactly what is going to happen in the next six months or
              so.”
              <br> <br>MOM said in the difficult job market, more people are deferring job
              searches to pursue training courses, including those supported under
              the Skills Programme for Upgrading and Resilience (SPUR). <br> <br> An estimated 91,800 residents were unemployed in June.
