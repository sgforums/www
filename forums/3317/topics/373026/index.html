              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Some 3,600 people became citizens of Singapore on Saturday at citizenship ceremonies held islandwide. </span></p>
              <p><span> The ceremonies took place at Group Representative Constituencies
              (GRCs), while the National Citizenship Ceremony was held in the Supreme
              Court Auditorium. </span></p>
              <p><span>Ministers and Members of Parliament officiating at the ceremonies
              have called on both new and existing citizens to get to know one
              another better.
              <br> <br> Minister in the Prime Minister's Office, Mr Lim Swee Say, also urged them to learn more than one language.
              <br> <br>Many of the new citizens, who are of different ages and come from
              various countries, said they want to become Singapore citizens because
              the country is safe and secure, and they will not face discrimination. <br> <br> Arevalo Sheila Marie Paloma, one the new citizens, said: "I feel very
              welcomed. My children have Chinese, Indian, Filipino friends and they
              get along well with them."
              <br> <br> The status of being a citizen also comes with responsibilities to the country, like National Service.
              <br> <br>Muthappan Krishnan, another new citizen, said: "I did chat (about
              National Service) with quite a few friends and what they said, I
              recall, is that it is a transition phase from boyhood to manhood, so I
              thought it's a good method to go through the process and I am happy
              about it."
              <br> <br>Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean emphasised that building a
              strong and closely knit community is a greater challenge during these
              difficult economic times.
              <br> <br>"A number of us would have come from countries which are much more
              mono-ethnic and mono-religious, where most of the people are of one
              race or one religion. In some cases, you have come from countries where
              there may be tensions or conflicts amongst people of different races
              and religions.
              <br> <br>"But when we come here to Singapore, we must commit ourselves to
              putting those things aside and commit ourselves to learning to live in
              peace and harmony, and understanding with our neighbours and fellow
              Singaporeans," he said. <br> <br> A key theme during this year's National Day celebrations is the
              importance of integration between old and new citizens. New citizens
              are encouraged to be active citizens by joining various community
              activities in their constituencies.
              <br> <br> The National Citizenship Ceremony is held in August to coincide with the National Day celebrations.
