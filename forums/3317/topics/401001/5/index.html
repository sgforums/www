              <p><strong>Pastor breaks silence</strong></p>
              <p>AFTER weeks of silence and dodging the media, City Harvest Church 
              founder Kong Hee on Thursday broke his silence about the ongoing probe 
              involving his church.</p>
              <p>In his first public comments carried in his blog entry, titled 
              'Reflections', Mr Kong, 46, said he and the church management board were
               helping police with investigations, and that he and his family were 
              'doing well'. He also thanked church members for their support.</p>
              <p>The one-page statement, however, shed no further details on 
              the case, which broke last month when Commercial Affairs Department 
              officers raided the church's offices in Suntec.</p>
              <p>'Because we're in the midst of the investigation, I am 
              unable to provide any details about the progress besides what already 
              has been released by the Singapore Police in their statement to the 
              press,' Mr Kong wrote in his message.</p>
              <p>Mr Kong, who is also the church's senior pastor, described 
              the investigation as a turning point for the church, which, since its 
              founding in 1989, has grown to become Singapore's largest independent 
              Christian church with a congregation of more than 33,000 followers.</p>
              <p>On the police raid which took place only a day after the 
              church had concluded an international conference of more than 25,000 
              participants, he wrote: 'What a difference a day makes... The page had 
              turned. The celebration had abruptly ended.'</p>

              <p><strong>Some City Harvest Church members unfazed by reports of Sun Ho's lavish 
              lifestyle</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : Ho Yeow Sun, the wife of City Harvest Church pastor 
              Kong Hee, has again been thrust into the spotlight, with recent reports 
              on her rented mansion in Hollywood. </span></p>
              <p><span>The 40-year-old singer, who is based in the US, was reported to 
              have rented a mansion in Hollywood Hills for S$28,000 a month.
              <br> <br> But members of the megachurch said they are not surprised with her 
              lavish lifestyle.
              <br> <br> Some churchgoers have defended her, saying she is a celebrity and that 
              her living arrangements are well known on the grapevine. And she had 
              probably paid with what she earns from her business and royalties.
              <br> <br> Ms Ho is currently in Singapore.
              <br> <br> Her husband, who appeared briefly at a service of City Harvest in Jurong
               West on Sunday morning, is among those questioned in a police probe. </span></p>

              <p><strong>Supporters defend Sun Ho</strong></p>
              <p>A DAY after singer Sun Ho's lavish lifestyle was splashed in the 
              local media, her supporters have come to her defence.</p>
              <p>Details of her lifestyle in the US, where she has been pursuing her 
              music career since 2003, include living in a plush $28,000-a-month 
              mansion in Los Angeles and two luxury cars.</p>
              <p>Her supporters have defended her way of life, with one 
              netizen saying that 'she is doing so well ... if Brad Pitt can stay (in 
              the same area) why can't she?'. He went on to say that people should 'be
               proud of her'.</p>
              <p>Another netizen asked others who were critcising her to 
              'keep their comments to themselves' and added that 'both of them have 
              worked so hard and put in so much effort in building up a church'.</p>
              <p>But many others also questioned where she got the money to 
              fund her lavish lifestyle and her billing as a top entertainer.</p>
              <p>Ho is currently back in Singapore assisting in the ongoing 
              probe into her husband's church over alleged misuse of funds.</p>

              <p><span>The 40-year-old singer, who is based in the US, was reported to have rented a mansion in Hollywood Hills for S$28,000 a month.<br><br>But members of the megachurch said they are not surprised with her lavish lifestyle.<br><br>Some churchgoers have defended her, saying she is a celebrity and that her living arrangements are well known on the grapevine. And she had probably paid with what she earns from her business and royalties.<br><br>Ms Ho is currently in Singapore.<br><br>Her husband, who appeared briefly at a service of City Harvest in Jurong West on Sunday morning, is among those questioned in a police probe.</span></p>

              <div><span style="color: #000080;">Saw this posting at yahoo singapore, sad for the naive youngsters: </span><br><br>1. Blue Haze on June 22, 2010 at 11:25 am<br>Reposted – losingfaith on June 21, 2010 at 6:08 am<br>It is reports like this that has made me lose faith in Christianity. After observing the vast number of comments made here, I feel a certain sense of obligation to voice my opinions as well.</div>
              <div><br>I had been a CHC member for almost 8 years, it’s has been nearly a year since I left city harvest. I joined when I was only 16. The highest ‘position’ I attained while I was there was as a junior ministry leader and as an assistant cell group leader, I was one of my zone’s guitarist as well.</div>
              <div>Due to the responsibilities of the ministry I was serving in, I brushed shoulders with Kong and Sun numerous times. I shall not say more as I will be easily to be identified if I give more info.</div>
              <div><br>So let me share with you guys a few of my experiences during my 8 years there. Barely half a year after joining the church and becoming part of a cell group, I was strongly pressured into buying an Sun Ho album by my then cell group leader, I remembered standing in line with my CG members in the hot afternoon sun outside orchard to buy her latest CD. At that point of time Sun hadn’t went to Hollywood yet. It was a Taiwan released album with mostly mandarin songs.</div>
              <div>I remembered saving up a weeks pocket money just so I can buy that album, which in the end, listened to it just once before never touching it again, it just wasn’t my cup of tea. I personally believe CHC members are instrumental in her success early in her career as devoted Sun fans would often buy her albums by the truckloads to give to their friends and relatives, I have witnessed this myself. The strange thing is that when I asked my non-church friends whether they listen to her music, their reply is often, ‘Who is she?’, ‘I only know her through newspaper reports.’, ‘Huh, she’s a singer meh? I thought pastor?’…etc etc…</div>
              <div><br>When Sun first forayed into the US music industry, the reason Pastor Kong gave the congregation for her effort was that he wants to reach out and bring the gospel to China and Sun was the conduit, and this was the vision that God had gave him. He explained that spreading the gospel in china was a uphill task and that if Sun was to be successful in the US, the Chinese will be more responsive to a successful singer than to just a lay pastor and that this will open doors for the gospel to be preached there. As evidenced by Sun’s numerous charitable works in China.</div>
              <div>However, that was in 2004. City Harvest now conducts regular mission trips to China, so I assume that it’s safe to say that the doors have indeed been opened. But, Sun is still in the US working on a debut album. When she first started out there were religious reasons given to us on her actions. Now it just seems that she is doing purely for monetary and personal gains, e.g, to become more famous.</div>
              <div><br>As a rather devoted church member at that period of time, I too gave to the building fund and donated my tithes and offerings to the church. Let me tell you guys something, it was really hard NOT to give. Due to the system of the cell groups there, the peer pressure to give is enormous. Miss a month of your tithing? Expect to get a call from your cell group leader asking for a reason why you did not tithe. Did not pledge for the building fund? The same, once a cell group leader in my zone commented that if her members have difficulty giving, she would work up a plan for them to give, for example cutting back on certain luxuries, getting a part time job…etc. Even after you pledged to give, the cell group leader will ‘interview’ you privately, asking, ‘So you have pledged to give this-this amount, is THIS the best you can give to God?’</div>
              <div><br>If you haven’t already noticed, the majority of the congregation in CHC is below 25. One would expect a church that has been around for 21 years to have older members but, somehow, when members reach the end of their teenage lives and enter the workforce their thinking changes and when they realise that the principles of CHC don’t apply to them anymore, most of them leave. Less than 10% of the people I have gotten to know during my first year in CHC are still in CHC. However, the outreach system in CHC more often than not targets the youth.</div>
              <div>So with older members leaving and young new members joining, the median age of the church is always kept young.<br>Why young people? Young people are easily impressed. They are more likely to succumb to peer pressure. The prospect of losing friends means more to them than money, so to order to continue to be part of a cell group, they willingly pay their tithes and give to the building fund. If a charismatic person becomes their Cell group leader, they will follow he/she to the ends of the earth. In case you didn’t know, cell group leaders are executive members of the church and they have the right to vote in CHC’s annual general meetings, and these meeting are chaired by Pst Kong.</div>

              <p>Over 18 people from City Harvest Church called up in probe so far</p>
              <p><br>By Neo Chai Chin | <br><br>City Harvest Church <br><br>SINGAPORE : More than 18 people from City Harvest Church, including pop singer Ho Yeow Sun, have been called up so far to help police investigations into the alleged misuse of funds at the church. <br><br>Founder Kong Hee and 16 others were questioned on May 31. <br><br>MediaCorp understands that others have also been called in since then. <br><br>Reverend Kong and his wife, Ms Ho, have now also "obtained legal representation", a church spokesperson told MediaCorp on Wednesday. <br><br>Ms Ho returned to Singapore on Monday from the United States, where she is now based. <br><br>She spent over eight hours on Tuesday at the Commercial Affairs Department. <br><br>The police probe into the church concerns specific incidents that could involve <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">the possible falsification of accounts and criminal breach of trust, involving millions of dollars and transactions that date back years. </span></span><br><br>They involve individuals and companies linked to the church. <br><br>Meanwhile, Reverend Kong has posted new messages on his Facebook page after a two-week hiatus. <br><br>- CNA/al</p>

              <p><strong>New leaders at City Harvest</strong></p>
              <p>THERE has been a leadership change at City Harvest Church, which is 
              being probed by police for alleged misuse of funds, reported The 
              Business Times on Friday.</p>
              <p>Pastors Derek Dunn and Aries Zulkarnain have been put in charge of 
              the church's ministerial duties while a 10- member board will continue 
              its role until the probe is over.</p>
              <p>Founder Pastor Kong Hee has relinquished his duties but will
               remain as the president and chairman of the church board, said the BT 
              report.</p>
              <p>City Harvest has also appointed auditors RSM Chio Lim to 
              conduct an independent review of the church's corporate governance 
              structure and internal control processes.</p>
              <p>On May 31, police rounded up 17 individuals associated with 
              the church,including Pastor Kong, to assist in investigations.</p>
              <p>Pastor Kong's wife, pop singer Sun Ho who has been based in 
              the US since 2003, flew back recently from Las Vegas to assist police in
               the probe. She was questioned for more than six hours on June 15.</p>
