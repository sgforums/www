              <p>as i read on her loopholes blog on she making millions of CD, then very simple, all of these transactions will sure have a record, as to who is the REAL MUSIC PRODUCER who made the CD for her, and I am sure if this SUN HO has evidents that she made all these $$$$$$$$ and use her own $$$$$$$$ at a later stage to upkeep her lifestyle in LA, she would have brought it out to the public.</p>

              <p>From what i read, she comes from a rich family,moreover she and husband in the fashion business so may be use money from these 2 sources to produce CD or may be she really use church fund to produce CD.  Don't know, only they and God know.</p>
              <p>Whatever, she is portraying very bad christian image to the world.    </p>

              <p>hmm, ya i heard she came from rich family, but ur family has got to be super rich to fund your lifestyle from wat i gathered, her family may not be as rich as we think. so i guess it only voice down to the $$$$$$ is coming from poor chc church goers who thought their $$$$$ was given to farther God's Kingdom and God's work but it has gone to Kong Hee, SUN HO and the other 16 or 17 people personal gain.</p>
              <p>anyway I have check with some of the people who works for the authority, CAD or our Govt would not make the investigating public if CAD has no hard and solid evidents.</p>
              <p>to end it all, if I am wrong in accusing them they have cheated, then i will apologise and ask God to forgive my statement i have made on them, but if they are guilty, they should be put behind bars and repent from their mistakes and move on with their lives.</p>
              <p>if a person who wants to start a church by making their own selfish gain, dun start 1. dun spoiled the good name of the Lord Jesus Christ. i have spoken to some frens, they are losing more faith in christianilty after the news of chc broke up and most of them firmly believes that they are guilty cos their sentiment is the same as my on CAD only has concrete evidents b4 they make it public.</p>
              <p>but will still give kong hee &amp; sun a benefit of doubts, pray that i , no it is we(christian) are wrong in accusing them.</p>

              <p><strong>City Harvest replaces Kong Hee</strong></p>
              <p>IT MAY be a while before City Harvest Church founder Kong Hee takes 
              to the pulpit again.</p>
              <p>On Friday, the megachurch said it had replaced Mr Kong, 46, as the 
              head of the church ministry. Mr Kong is expected to stay out of the 
              spotlight until the current investigations into the misuse of church 
              funds are complete.</p>
              <p>The seat is now shared by two senior pastors, Mr Derek Dunn 
              and Mr Aries Zulkarnain. Both men are well-known personalities at City 
              Harvest. Mr Dunn is its executive pastor and Mr Zulkarnain is one of the
               church's founding members.</p>
              <p>The move, however, does not put Mr Kong completely out of 
              the picture. He remains the president and chairman fo the church's 
              10-member management board. Meanwhile, the church has also hired a team 
              of experts to help its case in the ongoing investigations.</p>
              <p>They include Senior Counsel Michael Hwang, considered one of
               the best in commercial arbitration in the legal world, together with Mr
               Desmond Ong, manager director of law firm Eversheds LLP. An independent
               auditor has also been asked to look into the church's corporate 
              governance structure and internal processes.</p>
              <p>Mr Kong is represented by Allen &amp; Gledhill. Lawyers 
              representing Mr Kong and the church declined to comment on the 
              leadership change and ongoing police inquiry.</p>

              <p><strong>City Harvest Pastor Kong Hee gives sermons for 2nd day running</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: For the second day running, Pastor Kong Hee spoke at 
              his City Harvest Church services. </span></p>
              <p><span> The pastor had been out of the spotlight since investigations into 
              alleged misuse of church funds started a month back, and he was replaced
               as head of the church a few days ago. </span></p>
              <p><span>Although replaced by two senior pastors as head of the church 
              ministry, Pastor Kong Hee still heads the church's management board as 
              its president and chairman.
              <br> <br> On Saturday, Pastor Kong Hee spoke at the church service at Jurong West 
              and then at an evening service at the Singapore Expo.
              <br> <br> On Sunday, he was again present at both services. Members gave him a 
              thunderous applause when he appeared on stage to speak. 
              <br> <br> Paster Kong Hee spoke for some 45 minutes at both locations.
              <br> <br> And despite the official probe, church members said they are with the 
              pastor.
              <br> <br> "So far I have not doubted him, even though there's been lot of bad 
              news," said a church member.
              <br> <br> "We really rose up to the occasion, understanding things around us, and 
              that it's not easy for him to go through such things," said another.
              <br> <br> "The whole church actually trusts him a lot. We all have faith in him, 
              no matter what," said a third.
