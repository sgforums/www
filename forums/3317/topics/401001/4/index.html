              <p><strong>New Creation Church lists links</strong></p>
              <p>NEW Creation Church has for the first time provided a detailed list 
              of its business entities on its website, in an unusual move to reassure 
              members that its practices are 'transparent and above board'.</p>
              <p>The church said it did so in the light of media reports on police 
              investigations into individuals and companies related to another 
              megachurch, the City Harvest Church.</p>
              <p>Investigations are ongoing in the alleged misuse of church 
              funds.</p>

              <p><strong>Kong Hee 'plagiarised' book</strong></p>
              <p>TWO American authors of a Christian study book have accused City 
              Harvest Church founder Kong Hee of plagiarising their work in his books 
              and website.</p>
              <p>Mr Kong, 46, had been updating his website daily with an 
              inspirational passage which he called the 'Daily Devotion', before being
               called up by the police last Monday to help with investigations into 
              alleged misuse of funds within the church.</p>
              <p>A Singaporean blogger spotted that some of the passages in 
              the website were similar to the work of the Americans.</p>

              <p><strong>City Harvest pastor spotted</strong></p>
              <p>HE CAME quietly and left swiftly.</p>
              <p>City Harvest Church founder Kong Hee was spotted at the 3.30pm 
              service yesterday at its Jurong West premises.</p>
              <p>It was the 46-year-old's first known public appearance since
               he was thrust into the spotlight two weeks ago. He was called up to 
              help with police investigations into the alleged misuse of church funds.</p>
              <p>Another 16 people linked to the church were also called up.</p>
              <p>Yesterday, Mr Kong again made the news, this time for 
              plagiarism. A Straits Times report said a blogger here had spotted 
              passages in a Christian book written by Mr Kong that were similar to 
              those in Leadership Bible, penned by three Americans. Mr Kong also 
              updated his website with material from the book.</p>
              <p>In a note on his website last Monday, he said: 'We could

              <p><strong>City Harvest's Rev Kong Hee not seen at Sunday's service</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: He made a fleeting appearance at City Harvest Church's 
              Saturday service at its Jurong West premises, leaving some attendees 
              hopeful of catching a similar glimpse of their leader on Sunday.</span></p>
              <p><span>But City Harvest founder Reverend Kong Hee was not spotted at the 
              Sunday's service at the Singapore Expo.
              <br> <br> And going by the itinerary posted on his personal website, Rev Kong's 
              speaking schedule in June and July appears to have been removed. 
              <br> <br> For instance, he was originally scheduled to speak at City Harvest 
              Church Kuala Lumpur on June 5-6, but a June 1 posting on the latter's 
              Facebook page said: "Pls (sic) take note that our weekend services with 
              Rev Dr Kong Hee on June 5-6 have been cancelled."
              <br> <br> Last week, the congregation was told that Rev Kong was taking a "needed 
              rest".
              <br> <br> Despite Rev Kong's absence on Sunday, it was business as usual at the 
              Singapore Expo.
              <br> <br> Both special speaker Phil Pringle from C3 Church in Sydney and CHC 
              executive pastor Derek Dunn touched on the theme of coping and growing 
              through trials.
              <br> <br> While neither mentioned ongoing Commercial Affairs Department 
              investigations into City Harvest-linked individuals and companies, Dr 
              Pringle said his family and church were standing by City Harvest. 
              <br> <br> He also told churchgoers they would emerge stronger from their 
              experiences, saying "trials are meant to strengthen us, not weaken us".
              <br> <br> Mr Dunn said trials help to build faith, and teach one to focus on the 
              "right things". 
              <br> <br> Churchgoers said they were not disappointed that Rev Kong was not at the
               service. 
              <br> <br> Student Evangeline Pay, 18, said she had hoped to see him there, but 
              understood "he would have other things he's busy with".
              <br> <br> Another church member, Chew Sue Binn, 30, said if Rev Kong was in 
              Singapore, he would usually be around to host guest speakers. 
              <br> <br> "But if he's not around, it will be because he has other commitments, 
              and I guess we are used to it," she said, referring to his overseas 
              speaking engagements.
              <br> <br> A CHC spokesperson, when asked about allegations of plagiarism by Rev 
              Kong who has been said to have used portions of other Christian authors'
               works in his daily devotion postings, told MediaCorp the church "is not
               in a position to comment ... at this point in time".

              <p><strong>City Harvest's founder Kong says "good to be back"</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : City Harvest Church founder Kong Hee has been in the 
              news lately amid a probe into individuals and companies linked to the 
              megachurch. </span></p>
              <p><span>But his public appearance, even on the Internet, has been 
              fleeting. He has not updated his blog for more than two months.
              <br> <br> Mr Kong made a brief appearance at the church's service at its Jurong 
              West premises last Saturday.
              <br> <br> He did not turn up on Sunday, but posted a message on his Facebook page 
              at 11.28pm that night, saying: "It is good to be back in Church this 
              week. I love the house of God."
              <br> <br> This drew about 250 comments. Many expressed support for him and 
              welcomed him back to the church.
              <br> <br> Early this month, news broke that individuals and companies linked to 
              City Harvest Church are being investigated by the Commercial Affairs 
              Department.
              <br> <br> Recent reports also alleged that Mr Kong had plagiarised other Christian
               authors' works in his daily devotion postings, after a blogger 
              highlighted the similarities.

              <p><strong>City Harvest probe widens</strong></p>
              <p>THE probe into an alleged misuse of funds from City Harvest Church 
              has widened to at least 20 people, including pop singer Ho Yeow Sun, the
               wife of church founder, Pastor Kong Hee.</p>
              <p>Police from the Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) had, on May 31, 
              summoned 17 church members for questioning at the Police Cantonment 
              Complex, but The Straits Times understands that more individuals have 
              since been called up for questioning.</p>
              <p>Ms Ho, who was not among the initial 17, as she was 
              understood to be in the United States at the time, is now helping with 
              investigations, said the police.</p>
              <p>The police added that no arrests have been made.</p>
              <p>When The Straits Times tried to contact Ms Ho, a City 
              Harvest representative said she and Pastor Kong had 'obtained legal 
              representation' and that queries should be directed to them.</p>
              <p>When she was spotted leaving the police complex in New 
              Bridge Road on Tuesday evening, she told reporters that she had flown in
               from the US on Monday and that she was tired.</p>
