              <p><strong>Commercial activities may expose charities to governance risks</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : The commercial activities of City Harvest have 
              generated interest recently. And experts said religious charities that 
              go into business expose themselves to governance risks, including the 
              lack of proper checks and balances. </span></p>
              <p><span>For mega churches like City Harvest, a huge membership base means 
              more funds - but also higher expenses. And they are not the only ones 
              which have gone into business to raise revenue.
              <br> <br> For example, at Mount Sophia, there are several plots of land belonging 
              to Singapore's Presbyterian and Methodist churches. In 2002, the 
              Methodist Church reportedly leased out land to a commercial developer 
              for S$50 million.
              <br> <br> Experts said that in the past, to be good stewards of their assets, some
               religious organisations may choose to invest their excess resources in 
              fixed-deposit accounts. 
              <br> <br> But over time, due to low returns, these are not seen to be making the 
              best out of their assets. But once these organisations move into bigger 
              investments and commercial ventures, that is when more complicated 
              governance issues may arise.
              <br> <br> One pitfall is the lack of clear protocols for charities, as the law 
              does not currently provide for this. Instead, the law only delineates 
              what is taxable or not.
              <br> <br> Charities in Singapore have to abide by a code of governance, but any 
              company that is formed as an offshoot has to follow the Companies Act.
              <br> <br> Associate Professor Ho Yew Kee, Vice-Dean, NUS Business School, National
               University of Singapore, said: "Unfortunately, charities and religious 
              charities sometimes are not endowed with the procedures, the mechanisms,
               the safeguards, because a lot of religious charities, the basic working
               relationship is that of trust, that of believing in a common faith." 
              <br> <br> He added: "Within a religious authority, you may have a very senior 
              person that is a spiritual authority or spiritual figure, where the rest
               of the board basically give their consent to whatever he or she says. 
              And this immediately can create check and balance problems."
              <br> <br> Prof Ho said there are pragmatic reasons for setting up a separate legal
               entity to handle the business.
              <br> <br> He said: "Let's assume if I conduct a catering business within the 
              church - if there's a mass poisoning, I can be sued and I can bankrupt 
              the whole church.
              <br> <br> "If I set up a company to do catering, if there is a financial disaster,
               only the company will go bankrupt. I ring-fence, I at least protect the
               church from the financial liabilities." 
              <br> <br> 17 individuals and companies connected to City Harvest Church are being 
              investigated over possible misuse of funds.
              <br> <br> The church, in its latest notice to members posted on its website, said 
              that its corporate office will be closed "in line with our plan to give 
              the management and staff rest after the hectic Asia Conference week".
              <br> <br> The 5-day conference at the Singapore Expo ended over the weekend. The 
              church added that it "has cooperated and will continue to cooperate 
              fully with the authorities". Meanwhile, church activities will go on.

              <p>u are quoting from a news report i watched last nite as well, at 1st to a certain degree i would agree to church operating from a private/commercial point of view to be a good steward of $$$$ but after i have digested it, i think it is not about a church getting sued and make a bankrupt, if all churches are at least most churches practices the way of the Lord Jesus Christ , how would one church get into the situation of being sued.</p>
              <p>To Kong Hee and the rest of the Senior Pastor or deacon/Senior Pastor from New Creation : Dun just peached the teachings, ways and truth of Jesus Christ, you must do the walk and walk , talk the talk, and preach and live to wat u preached for. then the world (non-christian) would have more faith that christianity and it is indeed a true and right religion for them wanting to believe.</p>
              <p>yes indeed, we need to pray for the lost one, even pastors, senior pastors, deacon, for these are sinners as well just like any one of us. why dun condemn them , for they make mistakes too. so pray for them to repent and walk the ways of the Lord Jesus.</p>
              <p>John 3 : 16 -  For God so loved the world that He gave his Only Begotten Son, that who ever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life in Christ Jesus.\</p>
              <p>Roman : 3 : 23 - for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.</p>
              <p>yes like i said all are sinners, when one confessed that Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior, doesnt make me non-sinners. we are still sinners, we dun become SINLESS, we are suppose to SIN - LESS that is all.</p>
              <p>so people who are reading this thread, whether christian or non-christian, forgive Kong Hee or other Senior Pastor, or deacon, pray for them if u are a christian, and if you are non-christian, dun lose faith in christianity. go to a church nearby your place and start to find the truth about this person called Jesus Christ.</p>

              <p><strong>Religious bodies 'have duty'</strong></p>
              <p>RELIGIOUS organisations are no different from any other non-profit 
              group in that they answer to their stakeholders.</p>
              <p>They have a duty to make their governance blameless and be 
              transparent about what they do, said leaders in the community and 
              charity sector.</p>
              <p>MP Seah Kian Peng, chair of the Community Development, Youth
               and Sports Government Parliamentary Committee (GPC), said religious 
              organisations were, first and foremost, accountable to their members.</p>
              <p>'Good governance principles must be in place to ensure all 
              the stakeholders' interests are taken care of,' he said.</p>
              <p>At the sidelines of an event on Tuesday, MP Denise Phua, who
               is on the same GPC, noted that the charity sector had an even higher 
              duty than a commercial concern. She said: 'All of us who are serving in 
              the non-profit charity sector are working in a fishbowl. We are even 
              more accountable to the public.'</p>
              <p>Extensive guidelines for the sector have been written in 
              recent years and social service veteran Gerard Ee said there is no need 
              for more rules.</p>

              <p>so NCC reserves good seats for big timers ! and the small-timers still think the people running the church are ''good honest'' people ???!!!</p>
              <p>anyway, i finally saw Kong Hee for the1st time in the papers and i know why he's successfully running a scam ! he looks like a film actor and throw in some ''proper packaging'' , the gullible christians can be easily conned !</p>
              <p>xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</p>
              <p>((( christians are gullible since they actually devote their faith and belief to a storybook called the ''bible'' and they were simply told by pastors to not question the many ''questionable'' stories in the fairytales and to blindly believe them ! )))</p>
              <p>xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</p>
              <p>the Kong Hee and Sun Ho should be in deep shit since the PAP wouldn't want to be appearing like the ''bad guys'' and anger so many christians in an election year, eh ?</p>
              <p>in fact, after these 2 scamsters are put away, the PAP would appear to be the heroes in the whole thing !</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>too bad Durai, Ming Yi and Kong Hee won't meet in prison and be cellmates !</p>
