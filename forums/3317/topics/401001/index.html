              <p><span>Singapore: The Office of the Commissioner of Charitiies (COC) has 
              received complaints of misuse of church funds against City Harvest 
              Church. </span></p>
              <p><span>The COC has informed the Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) and 
              they are investigating some financial transactions involving several 
              individuals and companies related or connected to the City Harvest 
              Church.
              <br> <br> The COC which had received the complaints informed the CAD when it found
               that some of the financial transactions may need to be investigated. </span></p>
              <p><span> A joint statement issued Monday by the COC and Police said CAD officers 
              visited the offices of the individuals and the companies under 
              investigation in the morning. </span></p>
              <p><span> The officers secured records and accounts for the purpose of the 
              investigations. </span></p>
              <p><span> There have been assurances by the CAD and COC that despite the ongoing 
              investigations, services and religious activities of City Harvest Church
               need not be disrupted and can continue for its congregation. </span></p>

              <p><strong>City Harvest followers rally</strong></p>
              <p>CITY Harvest churchgoers rallied around their leaders a day after 
              news that Pastor Kong Hee and 16 other church members were being 
              investigated for allegedly misusing church funds.</p>
              <p>Followers said they were praying and confident that the church of 
              33,000 worshippers would ride out the storm. A group pledging support 
              has been set up on Facebook.</p>
              <p>But the probe has begun to take a toll.</p>
              <p>City Harvest's church in Kuala Lumpur announced on its Twitter site 
              yesterday that its service with Pastor Kong this weekend has been 
              cancelled. No reason was given.</p>
              <p>On Monday, police from the Commercial Affairs Department 
              (CAD) called in 17 church members for questioning at the Cantonment 
              Complex, and also took away files and documents from their homes for 
              investigations.</p>
              <p>Churchgoers meeting for bible study at the church's Boon Lay
               grounds yesterday said they were not worried.</p>

              <p><br>your explanation is not accepted.   please go buck up your bible knowledge don't malu yourself</p>
              <p>Greed itself is a sin.  Don't misquote the bible by saying bible does not say totally be ungreedy when it comes to money.   Greed is greed, no excuse.   A sin is a sin to God, no less sin .</p>

              <p>i personally believe goin 2 a church who practices the teachin of Jesus Christ is a creditable church, but some churches in SG has been in a limelight again for the wrong reasons.</p>
              <p>whether this kong kee pastor has gone astray from the teaching, 1st u got to know about this family, his teaching, his appearance, i mean everything.</p>
              <p>1st : i believe till date his wife is still a worldly singer, who try to make it to the hollywood, sigh, why dun be a gospel singer, why does she needs the fame. i think be a worship leader would be better for her.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2nd : the house this kong kee is staying and also the car he is driving</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3rd : question is, why does this kong kee has to dress up in the manner of the world??? did Jesus came to this world dress like a rock star to attract geniune people who dying to know the word of God????</p>
