              <p><strong>City Harvest Church's weekend service sees large turnout despite probe</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : It is the first weekend since news broke that 
              individuals and companies linked to City Harvest Church are being 
              investigated by the Commercial Affairs Department. </span></p>
              <p><span> Thousands of churchgoers attended the service on Saturday. </span></p>
              <p><span>Charismatic church leader Kong Hee may have been nowhere in sight,
               but it is service as usual, as thousands packed the Singapore Expo Hall
               One.
              <br> <br> Before the sermon began, Pastor Derek Dunn thanked the congregation for 
              their well-wishes and support. He stressed that church operations will 
              not be affected by the ongoing investigations. 
              <br> <br> Pastor Derek also mentioned Mr Kong and said the man is doing well. He 
              added that Mr Kong is taking a rest this weekend, so that he can 
              continue to assist with investigations.
              <br> <br> Churchgoers have thrown their support behind their pastor and board 
              members.
              <br> <br> One churchgoer said: "I have full faith in my pastor, and also the 
              church board because most of the time, when we do things, it is quite 
              transparent already.
              <br> <br> "When we are doing missions in other countries, he will tell us how much
               we have spent, what are the items that they sent over."
              <br> <br> Another added: "We have been praying for the leadership, and we hope 
              everything will be ok. The church is very united, I think everything 
              will be good."
              <br> <br> When asked for an update on the probe, the police maintained that it is 
              not appropriate to comment further at this juncture, as investigations 
              are still on-going. </span></p>

              <p><strong>New Creation explains</strong></p>
              <p>THE New Creation Church assured churchgoers yesterday that its 
              business ventures were formed not to spin money for the megachurch, but 
              were essentially driven by the need to house a growing congregation of 
              20,000.</p>
              <p>It also disclosed that Senior Pastor Joseph Prince stopped taking a 
              salary from the church late last year, but relies on book royalties and 
              other income.</p>
              <p>Deacon Jack Ho said he sought to ease the hearts of 
              churchgoers in revealing this, in the light of extensive media reports 
              and rampant online discussions of investigations into alleged misuse of 
              church funds at City Harvest Church.</p>
              <p>Speaking before Mr Prince took the pulpit at four Sunday 
              services at Suntec City Mall, he said more details would be posted on 
              the church website today.</p>
              <p>In his address, the deacon dwelt on the rationale for the 
              church's ventures.</p>
              <p>Its first entity was actually a childcare centre set up as a
               voluntary welfare organisation, he noted. Daystar Child Development 
              Centre opened at Holland Avenue 15 years ago, and was followed by a 
              second centre in Jurong West five years ago.</p>

              <p><strong>Deputy assisting in probe</strong></p>
              <p>PASTOR Tan Ye Peng, a founding member of City Harvest Church (CHC) 
              and Senior Pastor Kong Hee's deputy, is among those assisting the 
              authorities in an investigation arising from complaints about the 
              alleged misuse of church funds.</p>
              <p>The church in Jurong was told this during the Chinese language 
              service yesterday. Mr Tan, who heads the Chinese section, was not 
              present.</p>
              <p>Pastor Joseph Ang, who led the service, told the 
              congregation that both Mr Tan and Mr Kong were resting so they could 
              continue to assist in the police investigation.</p>
              <p>Assuring the congregation that both men were well, Mr Ang 
              thanked church members for the encouraging messages sent to their 
              leaders over the week.</p>
              <p>'Whatever happens, let us stay united,' he said.</p>
              <p>Seventeen individuals are involved in the investigation by 
              the police and the Commissioner of Charities.</p>

              <p><br>if every christian spend their sunday a few hrs only helping the poor or doing some charity work, don't need to donate money just help clean another poor people's house or keep them company, wouldn't christ be more happy about it? Or must they join convert then they will get your attention? must they also donate a certain percentage of the money to the church? so that a pastor can invest a nd grow money and organise orgy 1/2 fick heavy metal concerts?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i can pratise art or worship a religion even in my stinking toilet while i sheet, so what's wrong with a run down church as long as bbasic facilities like toilets and gathering hall well maintained on saftey features anything worng with that? so what suitable place you all need, one with 100" LCD HD TV for a pastor to speak behind the pulpit?</p>
