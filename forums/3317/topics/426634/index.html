              <p>SENIOR Minister Goh Chok Tong has an affinity with one of Singapore's
               iconic landmarks, the Fullerton Hotel. This is because he had started 
              his civil service career there in the 1960s.</p>
              <p>He shared this at a book launch on Wednesday at the Fullerton Hotel, 
              where he said, 'One memory was the occasional lunch I had at the simple 
              canteen at the roof-top.' Coming back to the hotel, SM Goh said he 'felt
               nostalgic about the building'.</p>
              <p>The coffee table book, titled 'The Fullerton Heritage', chronicles 
              the transformation of the building which was first built in 1928. It 
              served as the Government Post Office and was home to a number of 
              government agencies until it was bought over by property developer Sino 
              Land to be redeveloped into a hotel in 2001.</p>
              <p>Although $400 million was spent on restoring the 
              architecture of the building, the exquisite beauty that the building now
               exudes has not made former employees forget its sorry state in the 
              1960s and 1970s.</p>
              <p>'It was filthy, with rats running around and with cobwebs,' 
              says former civil servant Ngiam Tong Dow, 73, who worked there from 1959
               to 1974.</p>
              <p>The Fullerton Hotel has earned itself a prominent place 
              along the Singapore skyline and is managed by The Fullerton Heritage. 
              The Fullerton Heritage counts the Fullerton Hotel, Fullerton Bay Hotel, 
              the Fullerton Waterboat House, Customs House, One Fullerton and Clifford
               Pier as part of its 1.4 million sq feet property ring.</p>
