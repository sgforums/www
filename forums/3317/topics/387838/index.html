              <p><span>SINGAPORE : The Singapore government is allowing a child of mixed
              heritage to take on a "double-barrelled" race in official papers.
              <br> <br>This comes on top of changes that kicked in on January 2, where
              Singaporeans can take on either parent's race in the identity card.
              Before that, a child followed the father's race by default.
              <br> <br> This means that now, for example, a child can be recorded as "Chinese-Indian" or "Malay-Chinese". 
              <br> <br>But the government said that the first race is still considered the
              main one, for purposes such as administering policies in education or
              housing.
              <br> <br>In Parliament on Tuesday, Hri Kumar, MP, Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC,
              asked: "In light of the many different permutations, and now the
              greater flexibility of choices given to parents, is the selection of
              race on the identity card going to become an artificial exercise - you
              pick a race of convenience?"
              <br> <br>Associate Professor Ho Peng Kee, Senior Minister of State for Home
              Affairs, said: "In multi-racial Singapore, we still need the race
              classification. We celebrate our diversity and this is our strength. So
              unlike other societies, for example in France, to be
              politically-correct, they do away with recording and reflecting race.
              But that does not mean that the problems will go away." - CNA/ms</span></p>

              <p>For instance, Dick Lee (an internationally acclaimed Singaporean pop star),<br>in a newspaper interview in 1993, said <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>he had suffered an identity crisis<br>for all of his life. </strong></span>"My [Nyonya] grandmother was very British. She drank<br>tea at four and read Jane Austen. I thought I was a character in an Enid<br>Blyton novel." <br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br>He only realised he was not English when he visited England at age 14. </strong></span><br><br>In my description of the social and cultural history of the Babas, I have<br>refused to apply a modern, culturally-based definition of the Babas. <br><br>While the public focus until the electoral victory of the PAP was clearly<br>on Baba politics, there began -- after a decade of silence and the<br>Peranakan Association's intermittent attempts to restore some political<br>weight -- a public emphasis on Baba culture. <br><br>Ironically, this switch of emphasis occurred at a time when aspects of Baba<br>cultures not only began to disappear or be diluted, but they were also<br>commercialised and used to promote tourism. <br><br>The new cultural definition, which necessitated a deviation from the<br>equation of "Baba" with "Straits Chinese", is thus, in historical terms,<br>rather recent. <br><br>This assessment is not contradicted by the justifiable assumption that the<br>synonymous usage of the terms Straits Chinese, Peranakan and Baba in<br>written records was trailing behind the rapidly changing social reality of<br>Singapore and was becoming increasingly ambiguous. <br><br>In my interpretation, the Babas' newly-published distinctions between<br>"Straits Chinese" and "Babas" along cultural lines have to be taken<br>seriously when accounting for the time of their appearance and the more<br>recent past, but not further back (namely, the period preceding the<br>Japanese Occupation).</p>
              <p>According to the new cultural definition, a Baba should also be a Hokkien.<br>According to some purist Hokkien Babas, who regard themselves as true-blue<br>Baba jati, non-Hokkien Babas are only Baba chelup. <br><br>The expression suggests that the Baba chelup are only superficially dipped<br>in the paint of Babaness and are at best "nominal" Babas. Apart from the<br>conceptual history until the late '50s which contradicts such a narrow<br>conception of a Baba, we have a few examples of prominent non-Hokkien<br>Babas. <br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>First and foremost, there is Hakka Baba Lee Kuan Yew (who regards himself<br>as a Baba only technically)</strong></span>. Others are the Melaka dondang sayang singer<br>and serunee player Yeo Kim Swee, who is a Hainanese Baba, and Ambassador to<br>Germany Walter Woon, who is a Cantonese Baba...</p>

              <p>In the end there can be only <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>ONE</strong></span> identity. My view is that when it comes to mix marriages, the culture that you are brought up in, the one you are closer to should be the one for you. That means that you identify yourself with that cultural group.</p>
              <p>One problem with mix marriages is that it causes identity crisis.</p>
              <p>Since children are usually raised by the mother, the children is more exposed to the mother side's cultural influence. But on the IC, the kid follows the father's side. So there is confusion.</p>
