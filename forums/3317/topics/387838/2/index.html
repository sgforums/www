              <p><strong>Double-barrelled listing won't have big impact on ethnic policies:PM Lee</strong><br> <span class="update">By Asha Popatlal, Channel NewsAsia | </span> <span class="update">Posted: 15 January 2010 1634 hrs </span></p>
              <p><span>HANOI: Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said he does not
              think the recent announcement on double-barrelled race listing will
              have a big impact on ethnic integration policies, but instead, it is
              more a liberalisation of the system.
              <br> <br> Mr Lee was asked to comment on the issue at the wrap-up of his official visit to Vietnam.
              <br> <br>There have been an increasing number of mixed race marriages in
              Singapore. This has led the government to allow double-barrelled race
              listing, but questions have been asked about the impact on ethnic
              integration, housing and Group Representation Constituencies (GRCs)
              policies, for instance.
              <br> <br>Mr Lee said: "I don't think it will have a big impact on our GRCs
              or ethnic integration policies because the majority of the population
              will still be the major racial groups - the Chinese, the Malays, the
              Indians. <br> <br> "And these are the other racial or ethnic groups who, in total numbers,
              will remain small for some time to come, and maybe for a very long time
              to come."
              <br> <br>It is best though, said Mr Lee, for parents to say how they want to
              describe their children's ethnicity. He said: "We allow
              double-barrelled names - well triple and quadruple that becomes not
              very practical.
              <br> <br>"It is put down really for administrative purposes at birth, but
              the real determination takes place when he is 15 years old, or she, and
              you have your identity card and then what is put down in your identity
              card is what stays with you for life." <br> <br> Commenting on the public debate this has sparked, Mr Lee noted that
              race and religion are very sensitive areas, which will never become
              non-issues, here or globally.
              <br> <br>"I think it is a liberalisation, I don't think it is a revolution.
              And there is a lot of coverage, commentary, excitement even some angst
              in the newspapers - perhaps take a few days and things will cool off,"
              Mr Lee said.
              <br> <br>Referring to the French model which does away with such race
              classification, the prime minister said this had led to concentrations
              of ethnic groups in certain areas and an insoluble social problem.
              <br> <br>In the end, Mr Lee said it is best to have practical policies which
              gradually bring people together, but acknowledge that they are not
              identical.
