              <p>The ethos of self reliance as put forth by Singapore's government leaders seems to have filtered down to the ground.</p>
              <p>In a survey conducted on some 800 respondents, the Institute of
              Policy Studies or IPS found that some 80 percent of them think that
              people should rely more on personal initiative and sacrifice rather
              than the government to cope with the current economic crisis.</p>
              <p>The highest level of agreement came from those in the 30 to 39 age
              group and perhaps not surprisingly, those in the highest household
              income band.</p>
              <p>The lowest level of agreement came from respondents in the low household income bracket, but still the figure was at 77 percent.</p>
              <p>But if government assistance were needed, respondents across all age
              groups said rebates on taxes and government charges and direct
              financial assistance were considered of most benefit.</p>
              <p>Rebates were deemed most important for those with a household income of more than 2,500 dollars.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, financial assistance was most important to those with a household income of less than 2,500 dollars.</p>
              <p>In other findings, respondents also indicated they could cope for an
              average of eight and a half months if they were to lose their main
              source of income.</p>
              <p>The shortest length was found in the low household income group who
              said they could cope for about 6.3 months. (eds: less than 2.5k)</p>
              <p>A majority said they would rely heavily on their savings to tide
              them over, while about one in three respondents said they would be
              willing to take on any job regardless of the pay.</p>
              <p>However, if the downturn were to persist, social stresses could emerge.</p>
              <p>About a third of those in the 21 to 29 age group and those in the
              low household income group felt that they were worse off with having
              foreigners in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Still, when viewing this from a national perspective, respondents
              were more likely to say that Singapore is better off having foreigners
              here.</p>
              <p>Everything considered, respondents felt that Singapore had
              benefitted more from government measures than they had at the personal
              level.</p>
              <p>The survey was conducted in February, shortly after the Budget was announced and debated in Parliament.</p>
