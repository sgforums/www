              <p>Two junior college boys shared a quick peck on the lips in the school 
              canteen as a dare after being egged on by a schoolmate. Pictures and 
              even a video was taken, and on the same day, the students involved were 
              hauled off to the principal's office on Feb 8.<br><br>According to a 
              report in The New Paper today, the student who had promised to shave his
               head bald if his schoolmates did it was handed a letter for his parents
               to sign, acknowledging his withdrawal from the school. The boys who had
               shared the kiss were handed suspensions.<br><br>STOMPer Gary, who read about the incident was surprised but not shocked. He said:<br><br>"I
               think the school was too harsh on its students. It's just a prank, for 
              goodness sake. They weren't committing murder or theft.<br><br>"It was just a simple peck on the lips that only lasted for a few seconds -- but a fleeting moment.<br><br>"Actually a similar incident happened last time in my junior college. So I'm not surprised by this news."<br><br>STOMPer Sally also shared her views:<br><br>"I'm glad they were punished. We cannot encourage this kind of behaviour in a place for learning. It's a school, not your home!<br><br>"If
               students are so daring and they take this kind of thing so lightly, 
              they should be educated -- hence punished -- so that they will realise.<br><br>"What they did was just stupid. It's not funny at all. Who knows what they will be capable of later in life?<br><br>"And
               why do kids nowadays love to record everything, be it on video or 
              pictures? They are just incriminating themselves, even if they don't 
              post it online.<br><br>"I'm glad to read in the news report that the student who egged the boys on is repentant for what he did."</p>

              <p>It turns out that the student in question had a long list of disciplinary infractions. This incident was simply the last straw.</p>

              <p>I was just about to make a topic about this case. What a coincidence.</p>
              <p>I have read about it in the newspaper. I was shocked and flabbergasted.</p>
              <p>In the first place, why are they being punished ?</p>
              <p>I can understand it if they were stealing, fighting, or vandalising and destroying school property.......but they were not doing anything wrong, they were not harming anybody, including themselves.</p>
              <p>It is part of life experience and part of growing up process.</p>
              <p>I dont understand why the school principal need to expel 1 boy, the student who asked them to kiss, and suspend the 2 boys who kissed.</p>
              <p>It was merely joking and horseplaying.</p>
              <p>It is completely excessive and heavy-handed.</p>
              <p>I really wonder, if adults and authority figures do this, is it really helping the children or harming the children actually ?</p>
              <p>They need to be allowed to live their lifes as teenagers and as youths.</p>
              <p>Dont keep placing breaks on them.</p>
              <p>They will become normal and they will develop as well-rounded and well-balanced individuals. If adults and authority figures do this, it is actually harming them, it will make them become emotionally stunted.</p>
              <p>Please note it is not even a sexual act, because neither of those 2 boys are gays. They are not homosexuals. They are straight guys. They were merely joking amongst friends.</p>
              <p>So the school punish them for a joking act among friends.</p>
              <p>They are being told they cannot joke.</p>
              <p>Is this really necessary ?</p>
              <p>I really wonder why some adults and authority figures like to sabotage and straightjacket their youths so much.</p>
              <p>I can understand it if it was a sexual act and conservative adults want to instill conservative sexual mores and punish them, but actually this is not even a sexual act, it is merely joking amongst guys.</p>
              <p>Sometimes I think maybe they need to have a youth on their panel, because I think these adults have forgotten their time when they were young.</p>

              <p>It is the same logic on why people are losing their job because of "jokes" post in their facebook account. It is very obivous that the culprit or the real sabotage who took the video on these 2 nartuards are those who didn't like them and want to find dirt on them. I even remembered that during my primary school days during lesson, I was just tried and just look at the window for a few min for some rest. Later the teacher asked question and "arrow" me to answer and when I give incorrect answers, some busybody told the teacher "Madem, I saw him looking at the window" In the end , the busybody was praised as a "good boy" and I was told to stay and write the correct answer "N" times.This is what I call sabotage, not horseplay or joking around. JC people already and one step to adulthood, how much "risk" can they afford to play play if they went to workforce, just tell your superior that playing around is just part of grow up and you see whether they will promote you in the appraisal in the end</p>
              <p>And some prank are not funny as well depend on whether individual view it as fooling around or an act of bully. Remember the good "old" times where a group of students slapped on their friend 's back, or someone twisted the small staples refill to place under the school 's chairs ? In NS you still play this kind of childish game, the whole of the platoon got uniform changing parade and in the end of the day you tell me if it shiok or not.</p>

              <p>What I can say is this: SAF 8th core value applies. Do what you like, but don't get caught.</p>
              <p>If you want to play a prank, make sure you don't get caught. If you do get caught, then you have no one to blame but yourself. If you're scared of getting caught, then don't do it.</p>
              <p>This is especially the case if you already happen to have a long list of disciplinary offences, which was the case with the boy who was expelled. Sooner or later the school administration is gonna crack if you keep on antagonizing them.</p>
              <p>Yeah sure, we all have our youthful indiscretions, but at least we know that we only have ourselves to blame should we get caught.</p>

              <p>If the rest of the student did not take a photo of it and no idiots go and post the photo, no one will be affected.</p>
              <p>But, too bad for the students, it was being publicised.</p>
              <p>The principal have to do something or else he will kana a lot of friendly feedback from the parents.</p>
              <p>It is just a childish prank that served no harm for any one.</p>
              <p>The punishment is too severe and it will impact the students for life.</p>
              <p>Most of the adults are judging the issue from their point of view and not forgetting they are still kids and just do it for fun.</p>
