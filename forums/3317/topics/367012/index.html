              <p>A 15-YEAR-OLD boy's 'extra curricular activities' as a toyboy to a
              lonely maid in Singapore was reported in Malaysia's Sin Chew Daily.</p>
              <p>The Chinese daily reported that the parents had been forced to
              employ a bodyguard for the boy since his activities came to light.</p>
              <p>According to an investigator hired by the parents to keep an eye on
              their son, they became suspicious of the boy's movements and
              whereabouts after he started coming home late from school.</p>
              <p>The investigator - known as Jacob - said the boy would normally
              return home by 3pm everyday but since February, he only returned at 8pm.</p>
              <p>Initially, the parents thought the boy was revising his studies at a friend's house.</p>
              <p>But as the late hours continued, they became more concerned and decided to check his handphone.</p>
              <p>'When they found inappropriate messages in his handphone, they employed me to follow the boy,' said Jacob.</p>
              <p>He said he later found out that the boy had been meeting a maid,
              who is in her 30s, at a fast food outlet near his school and following
              her back to the apartment where she was working.</p>
              <p>Jacob added that upon investigations, he discovered that the maid
              had been bringing the boy home whenever her employers were not around.</p>
              <p>It is also learnt that the parents were already planning to send the boy overseas.</p>
