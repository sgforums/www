              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: He was 14 when he masterminded a plan with three friends to trick two girls into performing sexual acts.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The boys, who were 
              then between 12 and 15 years old, pretended to be possessed by "Chinese 
              gods", forcing the girls to do their bidding.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The mastermind pleaded guilty in July to two counts of rape and another two for sexual assault by penetration.<br><br>Eight other charges for offences including rape and molest will be taken into consideration during sentencing.<br><br>The youngsters will not be named due to a gag order.<br><br>The boys used to be friends with their victims, who were then 14 and 15 years old.<br><br>The
               court heard that the mastermind, now a 17-year-old old dropout, was 
              inspired by what he saw at a Chinese temple he used to frequent as a 
              child and decided to pretend to be possessed by "the Chinese god of 
              hell" to trick the girls.<br><br>He shared the plan with his friends who agreed to carry it out.<br><br>The mastermind then invited all five youngsters to his flat sometime in February or March 2008 where the plan swung into action.<br><br>He brought them into his bedroom and pretended to be possessed by jumping around and rocking the chair he was in.<br><br>His accomplices did likewise to scare the two girls who were ordered to strip.<br><br>The
               mastermind then grabbed one of the girls and warned her the "Chinese 
              god" would harm her and her loved ones if she disobeyed.<br><br>And after she removed her clothes out of fear, he forced her to perform a sexual act on him before raping her.<br><br>Deputy
               Public Prosecutor Kavita Uthrapathy said the girl was silent throughout
               her ordeal as she truly believed the boy was possessed.<br><br>From 
              then until April 2008, the boy used the same tactic to deceive both 
              girls into performing sexual acts on him and his friends.<br><br>Only the mastermind and his youngest accomplice have been convicted of their offences.<br><br>The youngest boy, who is now 16 years old, was given 24 months probation in the Juvenile Court this June.<br><br>The cases involving the two other youngsters are now at the pre-trial conference stage.<br><br>DPP Kavita has pressed for the mastermind to be jailed and caned despite his age and clean record prior to the case.<br><br>She
               recognised that as far as possible, first-time young offenders under 21
               years old should be kept out of prison, with the idea of rehabilitation
               as an important sentencing consideration.<br><br>But the prosecution felt the boy's offences were so serious that "the principle of deterrence should take centre-stage".<br><br>The mastermind is represented by lawyer Josephus Tan and the case will be mentioned again on September 9.<br><br>The boy could be jailed up to 20 years and fined or caned for each rape charge.<br><br>- CNA/fa</span></span></p>

              <p>Nonsense. These helpless little boys should be forgiven and their actions forgotten. If a little boy is doing these things, than he himself is a victim of sex abuse.</p>
              <p>For all of you boy-abusing pedophiles who believe these children deserve condemnation, your karmas are very bad. In your next incarnations you will live the lives of those defenseless boys.</p>

              <p>rape is rape which is wrong doesn't matter to males or females, they should get punished either way. As I said they have the intention to rape and did it on more than one ocassion and u think that they should be let off just becoz they are young? If ur sister was the victim would u still say they dun deserve any punishment?</p>

              <p>Does it ever occur to anyone that the actions of these boys are the fault of society? Because it is. Once society stops favoring girls over boys, such cases will become obsolete.</p>
              <p>This is exactly what I was talking about in my other thread. Here more about the effects of pro-girl sexism on the behavior of boys: http://sgforums.com/forums/96/topics/435901</p>
              <p>This explains why the boys did what they did. I don't blame them at all.</p>

              <p>Does it ever occur to anyone that the actions of these boys are
              the fault of society? Because it is. Once society stops favoring
              girls over boys, such cases will become obsolete.</p>
              <p>This is exactly what I was talking about in my other thread.
              Here more about the effects of pro-girl sexism on the behavior of
              boys: http://sgforums.com/forums/96/topics/435901</p>
              <p>This explains why the boys did what they did. I don't blame them
              at all.</p>

              <p>1. I'd say the same if the girls were related to me</p>
              <p>2. The boys are traumatized more than the girls.</p>
              <p>3. The boys were probably rape victims themselves. The were probably raped by men or bigger boys.</p>
              <p>4. Read the messages in the link I posted</p>
              <p>5. Forget about the girls. Girls are stronger than boys. They'll get over it.</p>
              <p>6. If society didn't discriminate against boys, then these boys wouldn't have done what they did. The boys were acting out of revenge and anger. It's society that's at fault.</p>
              <p>7. Using your logic if a bigger girl rapes a smaller boy [yes, this does happen], she should slowly roast alive over a charcoal flame.</p>

              <p>Really? Would you say the same if these boys raped other boys, instead of girls. You probably wouldn't because you have a macho man mentality. Due to this irrational thinking, you buy into the myth that rape is only male-to-female. Because of scum like you, little boys who are raped by pedophiles never get the justice they deserve.</p>
