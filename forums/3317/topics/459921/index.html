            <div class='col-md body'><p>Is a good news that they are not killed during their wrong understanding of Allah, the great teaching. This JI members should be awared that they are not in line with Allah teaching on love all people is loving Allah. And to smoothly completing their human dignified live of love and gratitude for heaven bliss of today, tomorrow and thereafter eternally, the only way is to embark on the right path on love, peace, courtesy and joys together. This required the assistance of Muslim community to develop the right way of life amongst one another, and expand / enlarging this love and grace outward towards the community within a nation and internationally. Allah is with them always, even serving prison term, just have faith in Allah loving you always. Detention is sort of a mere "cell" that cannot cell your loving heart. Be confident in living a bliss, joys and lovely live beyond the naked eyes of all, as they share the same loving heart as everyone else does.

              Hi bycai
              
              The Buddhists are definitely proud of you for what you have written.
              
              However, I'm not sure if the muslims will be happy with your linking of Allah and Buddha Amitabha.
              
              In Buddhism, everyone can be a Buddha by realizing our buddha-nature. In Islam, however, Allah is not the same as human, even though one could feel the love of Allah. It is a BLASPHEMY to equate Allah with human and any creatures.
              
              While your comment has a well intention, one need to be cautious about racial and religious hyper-sensitivities in view of the recent slew of events.
