              <p>MOSCOW – Two <span id="lw_1269845972_0" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc; cursor: pointer; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% transparent;">female suicide 
              bombers</span> blew themselves up on Moscow's subway system as it was 
              jam-packed with rush-hour passengers Monday, killing at least 35 people 
              and wounding more than 30, the city's mayor and other officials said.</p>
              <p>Emergency Ministry spokeswoman Svetlana Chumikova 
              said 23 people were killed at the Lubyanka station in central Moscow. 
              The station is underneath the building that houses the main offices of 
              the Federal Security Service, or FSB, the KGB's main successor agency.</p>
              <p>A second explosion hit the Park Kultury station about
               45 minutes later. Chumikova said at least 12 were dead there.</p>
              <p>Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov said both explosions were 
              believed to have been set off by female suicide bombers as the trains 
              entered the stations. In the first case, officials said the explosion 
              was on the train; there was no immediate information on the location of 
              the second blast.</p>
              <p>"The first data that the FSB has given us is that 
              there were two female suicide bombers," Luzhkov told reporters at the 
              Park Kultury site.</p>
              <p><span id="lw_1269845972_1" class="yshortcuts">Russia</span>'s
               top investigative body also said terrorism was suspected.</p>
              <p>The last confirmed terrorist attack in <span id="lw_1269845972_2" class="yshortcuts">Moscow</span> was in August 
              2004, when a suicide bomber blew herself up outside a city subway 
              station, killing 10 people.</p>
              <p>Responsibility for that blast was claimed by <span id="lw_1269845972_3" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc; cursor: pointer;">Chechen rebels</span> and 
              suspicion in Monday's explosions is likely to focus on them and other 
              separatist groups in the restive <span id="lw_1269845972_4" class="yshortcuts">North Caucasus region</span>.</p>
              <p>The Moscow subway system is one of the world's 
              busiest, carrying around 7 million passengers on an average workday, and
               is a key element in running the sprawling and traffic-choked city.</p>
              <p>The blasts practically paralyzed movement in the city
               center as <span id="lw_1269845972_5" class="yshortcuts" style="cursor: pointer; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% transparent;">emergency 
              vehicles</span> sped to the stations. Helicopters hovered over the Park 
              Kultury station area, which is near the renowned <span id="lw_1269845972_6" class="yshortcuts">Gorky Park</span>.</p>
              <p>Passengers, many of them in tears, streamed out of 
              the station, one man exclaiming over and over "This is how we live!"</p>
              <p>At least a dozen ambulances were on the scene.</p>

              <p><strong>Moscow vows avenge</strong></p>
              <p>MOSCOW - MOSCOW held a day of mourning on Tuesday for the 38 victims 
              of twin rush-hour suicide bombings on packed metro trains, as Russian 
              leaders pledged to hunt down and wipe out those behind the attacks.</p>
              <p>Prime Minister Vladimir Putin vowed those responsible for Monday's 
              bombings would be 'destroyed' as authorities pointed the finger at 
              militants from the Northern Caucasus for the deadliest attack in the 
              Russian capital for half a decade.</p>
              <p>President Dmitry Medvedev, while visiting the site of one of
               the bombings to lay a wreath of red roses, pledged 'we will find and 
              wipe out' those behind the blasts, calling them 'wild beasts.'</p>
              <p>The first explosion shortly before 8.00am (0400 GMT, 12.00pm
               Singapore time) ripped through a train that had stopped in the Lubyanka
               station just below the headquarters of Russia's FSB security service, 
              the successor to the Soviet KGB.</p>
              <p>About 40 minutes later, a second explosion went off in a 
              carriage of a train on the platform at the Park Kultury metro station, 
              named after Moscow's iconic Gorky Park.</p>
              <p>Officials said the attacks were carried out by women wearing
               belts packed with explosives, marking a return of the so-called 'Black 
              Widows' who terrorised Moscow a decade ago with a string of attacks. --
