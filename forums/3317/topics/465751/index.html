              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: The Restaurant Association of Singapore (RAS) has 
              urged the government to re-assess curbs on the inflow of foreign workers
               or businesses will face dire consequences.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>It added if nothing is done, Singapore may also lose its reputation as a global city with a vibrant F&amp;B sector.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The association was 
              responding to the Population White Paper, which was recently endorsed in
               Parliament. The paper charts the roadmap for Singapore's future 
              policies on population and immigration.<br><br>In a statement, the 
              association which has more than 300 members accounting for over 1,300 
              restaurant outlets, also called for a review of the Foreign Worker 
              Levies (FWL), in view of what has been described as "the severe labour 
              shortage faced by the F&amp;B sector".<br><br>The association said the 
              sector is facing a dire situation. That is because many Singaporeans 
              tend to shun F&amp;B jobs, leaving the industry with little choice but 
              to rely on foreign workers.<br><br>It added the White Paper should be viewed objectively by all parties and policies need to be realistic.<br><br>The
               association then listed various scenarios that may happen, under the 
              current labour shortage. They include -- businesses shutting down or 
              moving out of Singapore, as well as consumers facing higher food prices.<br><br>"Businesses
               may be forced to shut down or move their operations to other countries,
               a situation which will deprive the Singapore government of tax income; 
              consumers can expect food prices to increase, due to high operating 
              costs caused by artificial wage inflation, high-cost productivity drive 
              and high rentals.<br><br>"Consumers can expect higher food prices 
              without a concomitant increase in quality and service standards due to 
              lack of manpower. In fact, quality and service may decline," it said.<br><br>"The
               government cannot benefit if businesses are unable to sustain 
              themselves, as this will have a chain reaction," the association added.<br><br>The
               association has also suggested several measures for the government to 
              consider. Among them -- adjusting either the Foreign Worker quota or the
               levy quantum, not both so as to avoid causing further detriment to 
              F&amp;B/restaurant businesses; channelling the levy collected to further
               help businesses enhance their productivity; and considering alternative
               sources of labour.<br><br>One example of alternative sources is allowing foreign students studying in Singapore to work part-time. <br><br>The
               association said: "In reviewing the White Paper, the RAS is of the view
               that, in general, a larger population can have a positive impact on the
               economy and the government which derives its revenue primarily from 
              various forms of taxation, such as Consumption Tax, Income Tax, and 
              Property Tax.<br><br>"But for business to be able to pay tax, they must 
              be profitable. It is, therefore, imperative to have sustainable business
               activities, and for our population and workforce to be able to support 
              our economy.<br><br>"This justifies the need for more manpower. If the 
              dire situation persists, not only will revenue be channelled abroad, the
               reputation of Singapore as a global city and its F&amp;B/restaurant 
              sector as one of the most vibrant, could be severely affected."<br><br>-CNA/ac</span></span></p>

              <p>aiyah dont anyhow tok cock.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>say we have 1 company in singapore. it has 100 foreign workers. when 10 times up and have to leave, they go apply for 10 more to replace them. so what's so complicated?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>as if this latest adjustments gahmen tighten a lot meh? all the same except maine industries a 0.5 percent reduction.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>if you have an army of 100 heacount, only 0.5 heacount is affected.</p>
              <p>if you have 1,000 workers,  only 5 is affected.</p>
              <p>if you have 10,000 workers, only 50 is affected.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>its continuous improvedment.  productivity has to increase. so as businessmen you  should know how to tune your businesses to suite the economic situation. and please review on the ground, there are lots of redundant foreign workers and posts. dont turn a blind eye to that. make things easy fot you, youmake things very difficult for the social cohesion and overconjestion for singapore.</p>
