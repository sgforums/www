              <p>YANGON, MYANMAR - Myanmar state media on Friday hailed the discovery of a
               fifth white elephant, considered a symbol of good fortune, ahead of 
              elections dismissed by critics as a charade to legitimise military rule.<br> <br> The female pachyderm named Nandawady was sprinkled with holy water in a 
              ceremony that coincided with Thursday's unveiling of the country's new 
              flag.<br> <br> Watched by senior officials from the ruling junta, the 18-year-old 
              elephant was led around Naypyidaw's Uppatasanti pagoda, before retiring 
              to her new home with another white elephant, the New Light of Myanmar 
              said.<br> <br> The elephant, which was captured on September 23 in the western coastal 
              region of Rakhine State, is one of several now being kept by the regime,
               with two held in the capital Naypyidaw and a three in the main city of 
              Yangon.<br> <br> Despite their name, the revered creatures are not actually white but 
              have certain distinctive features including a pinkish complexion.<br> <br> State media have said the capture of a white elephant is a sign there 
              will be a successful "democratic transition" in the November 7 
              elections, the first in 20 years for the military-run country.<br> <br> The vote, which will not include Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu
               Kyi's opposition party, has been dismissed by critics as a sham aimed 
              at putting a civilian cloak over military rule.<br> <br> The appearance of another white elephant just as the country made the surprise launch of its new flag was noted by residents.<br> <br> "We cannot know whether the two events were coincidence or not," a 45-year-old Yangon man told AFP.<br> <br> Kings and leaders in the predominantly Buddhist nation have 
              traditionally treasured white elephants, whose rare appearances in the 
              country are believed to herald good fortune, including power and 
              political change.<br> <br> Two private planes for Myanmar's Senior General Than Shwe and four other
               top leaders were named "White Elephant" this year on the advice of 
              astrologers, according to the Irrawaddy, a Thailand-based magazine on 
              Myanmar. --AFP<br><br>Source:<a href="http://news.asiaone.com/News/Latest%2BNews/Asia/Story/A1Story20101022-243743.html"><br>http://news.asiaone.com/News/Latest%2BNews/Asia/Story/A1Story20101022-243743.html</a></p>
              <h1 id="yn-title">Myanmar: White elephant auspicious for elections<br> –
                  <abbr class="timedate" title="2010-09-25T00:57:58-0700">Sat Sep 25, 3:57 am ET</abbr></h1>
              <p><br>YANGON, Myanmar – Myanmar's state-controlled media hailed Saturday 
              the capture of a rare white elephant as a positive omen for upcoming 
              elections, the first balloting in two decades in the military-ruled 
              country.</p>
              <p>The 7-foot, 1-inch (216-centimeter) tall beast was 
              captured Thursday in Rakhine state in the northwest, and is the fifth 
              white elephant caught in a decade, the New Light of Myanmar newspaper 
              reported on its front page. The pachyderm is estimated to be 18 years 
              old.</p>
              <p>The newspaper, a mouthpiece for the ruling junta, 
              hailed the elephant's capture as a sign the country will be peaceful and
               free from all dangers, and its people will enjoy greater prosperity and
               progress.</p>
              <p>"It is auspicious that a rare white elephant emerged 
              at a time when Myanmar was going through a democratic transition and the
               elections will be held peacefully and successfully," it said.</p>
              <p>White elephants, actually albinos, have for centuries
               been revered in Myanmar, Thailand, Laos and other Asian nations. They 
              were normally kept and pampered by monarchs and considered a symbol of 
              royal power and prosperity. Myanmar's military rulers, like many of the 
              country's citizens, are said to be particularly superstitious.</p>
              <p>The Nov. 7 general elections will be the first in 20 
              years. The National League for Democracy party of Nobel Peace laureate 
              Aung San Suu Kyi won the last polls but was not allowed to take power by
               the military. It is boycotting this year's vote, charging that the 
              election rules are unfair and undemocratic.</p>
              <p>The New Light of Myanmar said the elephant's capture 
              will ensure that peace, stability and prosperity will continue under the
               new elected government, explaining that white elephants only emerge in 
              places where the practice of Buddhism flourishes and rulers govern 
              justly.</p>
              <p>It said that according to ancient treatises, it is 
              hard to find even a single white elephant among a thousand, but five of 
              the rare beasts have emerged from 2001 to 2010, and the latest discovery
               is a matter of "national pride."</p>
              <p>The country's fourth white elephant, a 38-year-old 
              female captured in the jungles of Rakhine state in June, was given a 
              lavish welcome ceremony when it was taken to the administrative capital 
              of Naypyitaw. It was housed in an enclosure near the Upptasanti pagoda, a
               replica of the famed Shwedagon pagoda in Yangon, the former capital and
               biggest city in Myanmar.</p>
              <p>Three other white elephants caught earlier are kept 
              in a special park in Yangon, where they live in an enclosure with 
              spiraled pavilions, a manmade waterfall, ponds and trees.<br><br>Source:<a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20100925/ap_on_re_as/as_myanmar_white_elephant"><br>http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20100925/ap_on_re_as/as_myanmar_white_elephant</a></p>
