              <p><strong>A year ago this week Iceland's economy collapsed along with three
              of its biggest banks. Since then the country has been struggling to
              recover and there is still a long way to go.</strong></p>
              <p>The setting is a
              restaurant with a stunning view over Reykjavik's harbour. But even in
              this idyllic location the effect of the recession - or "kreppan" as the
              Icelanders call it - is all too visible.</p>
              <p>Blocking some of the
              view is the massive concert hall which was supposed to be a symbol of
              prosperity overlooking the Faxafloi bay. Its first concert was to take
              place in December this year but since Iceland's economy collapsed,
              construction on the building has come to a halt.</p>
              <p>It is now a forlorn sight as it lies unfinished in one of the capital's beauty spots.</p>
              <p>Back in the restaurant the discussion keeps drifting towards the recession - in fact, in Iceland the talk is of little else.</p>
              <p>Perhaps
              that is not surprising since there is hardly anyone in this society of
              just over 300,000 people that has not been affected.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>'Viking' blame</strong></p>
              <p>Prices have soared since the value of the krona halved. At the same time wages have gone down and many have lost their jobs.</p>
              <p>Loan repayments have doubled for most people - especially those who borrowed in a foreign currency.</p>
              <p>And
              foreign currency is a big issue. Icelanders have gone from having
              almost unlimited access to it to severe rationing - something, one man
              pointed out, that they share with Cuba.</p>
              <p>Now if you want to buy foreign currency you have to show a valid
              airline ticket to the country you are travelling to - and even then the
              amount is limited.</p>
              <p>So Icelanders are still very angry about the situation.</p>
              <p>They
              blame everyone from Britain and its Prime Minister Gordon Brown, to the
              EU to the big Icelandic investors - sarcastically referred to as the
              "Vikings" - whose antics abroad are considered to be a big catalyst in
              Iceland's downfall.</p>
              <p>And many of these so-called Vikings have
              felt the full force of that wrath. Their cars and houses have been
              vandalised - a level of violence unheard of in Iceland for many
              decades.</p>
              <p>So far no-one has been arrested but most Icelanders do
              not condone such extreme behaviour, inflicted by what is thought to be
              just a handful of people. They prefer to voice their frustration in a
              more constructive manner.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Crippling debts</strong></p>
              <p>The biggest issue of all is Icesave.
              When Landsbanki's saving accounts in the UK and Holland collapsed last
              October it left Iceland with a bill of around £4bn ($6.3bn:4.3bn Euro).</p>
              <p>On a global scale, that is barely worth a mention but for this tiny nation the repayments of the UK loan will be crippling.</p>
              <p>Although there are people who believe Icelandic taxpayers should not
              be footing the bill for the collapse of a private bank, more are saying
              that Iceland needs to meet its obligations.</p>
              <p>But just what these
              obligations are has sparked a big row. A few weeks ago the new leftist
              government was shaken when one of its ministers walked out in protest
              at the government's handling of the case.</p>
              <p>Ogmundur Jonasson,
              the former health minister, believes Iceland should take its case to
              the courts to find out just what the repayment obligations are for a
              country whose whole banking system has collapsed - a move he says has
              been blocked by the British and Dutch.</p>
              <p>"We are experiencing the
              worst of British behaviour - that of the colonial power - instead of
              the best that Britain has to offer, which is fairness and democratic
              traditions," he says.</p>
              <p>"We are devastated by the collapse of the
              banks and their irresponsible behaviour makes people here angry and
              bitter. We want to pay our debts - but we want to pay what we are
              responsible for and no more."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Return to welfare</strong></p>
              <p>Financial support from other
              countries and organisations such as the IMF - and membership talks with
              the EU - are conditional on Iceland solving the Icesave dispute, which
              is why it has taken up most of the government's time.</p>
              <p>Some say too much time has been spent on it and too little focus has
              been on the other big problems Iceland faces, such as increasing
              household debt.</p>
              <p>Prof Stefan Olafsson from the University of
              Iceland says the government needs to finish the Icesave deal so it can
              start helping the people of the country.</p>
              <p>The crisis has also caused a radical U-turn in people's views of society.</p>
              <p>"There
              is clear evidence that the nation believes free capitalism has
              completely failed and now wants to focus on the Scandinavian welfare
              model," says Prof Olafsson.</p>
              <p>But it is not just capitalism that Iceland has turned its back on.</p>
              <p>Icelanders' attitude to the European Union has similarly changed.</p>
              <p>In
              the weeks after the crash there was huge support for EU membership but
              as the Icesave row has dragged on many have started blaming the EU.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Opportunity</strong></p>
              <p>It
              is not all doom and gloom in Iceland - Prof Olafsson points out that
              the vast majority of households are likely to get through the crisis
              without needing government help.</p>
              <p>Many of the traditional industries such as fishing, energy and wool knitting are also coping well.</p>
              <p>But it is tourism that has seen the biggest rise, with many foreigners taking advantage of the weak currency.</p>
              <p>A
              spokesman for Iceland's biggest national park, Vatnajokull Park, said
              it had had around 350,000 visitors so far this year, an increase of
              around 30% on last year.</p>
              <p>Many also see the recession as an opportunity.</p>
              <p>In
              a picturesque valley in the middle of Reykjavik a group of
              entrepreneurs has taken over a huge old power station and transformed
              it into what they are calling a "greenhouse for good ideas and design".</p>
              <p>"We want to look ahead and utilise the wealth that lies in
              Icelandic entrepreneurship and creativity in the coming years," said
              Gudrun Ingvarsdottir, an architect and one of the creators of
              Toppstodin.</p>
              <p>So in many ways Iceland is starting to feel like
              the Iceland of old - where the emphasis is on hard work, creativity and
              good values and less on making quick money.</p>
              <p>But it is clear that this small country will be paying for its flirtation with free capitalism for many years to come.</p>
