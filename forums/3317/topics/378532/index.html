              <p>MOSCOW (AFP) - – Russia's gross domestic
                      product (GDP) will shrink 7.5 percent in 2009, President Dmitry
                      Medvedev said in an interview released Sunday, after earlier government
                      predictions of an eight percent drop.</p>
              <p>"This year, we expect to
                      see the GDP decline by about 7.5 percent," Medvedev said in an
                      interview with Russia's Channel One state television, according to a
                      transcript released by the Kremlin.</p>
              <p>Last month, Russian Prime
                      Minister Vladimir Putin put the expected decline in GDP at eight
                      percent or slightly less, following earlier official forecasts that it
                      would shrink 8.5 percent.</p>
              <p>The Russian economy, which is largely
                      based on the export of oil, gas and other commodities, was badly hit by
                      the global financial crisis after years of enjoying strong growth.</p>
              <p>Medvedev
                      said the anticipated 7.5 percent decline was "very serious" and
                      admitted that the government had been surprised at how severely Russia
                      had been hit by the crisis.</p>
              <p>"The real damage to our economy was
                      far greater than anything predicted by ourselves, the World Bank and
                      other expert organisations," Medvedev told Channel One.</p>
              <p>But the
                      government pulled together and avoided the economic disaster that some
                      had feared by implementing an anti-crisis programme that saved jobs and
                      stabilised Russia's banking sector, he said.</p>
              <p>"We were
                      ultimately able to make fairly good use of anti-crisis measures to
                      avoid the worst possible scenarios in terms of unemployment and direct
                      financial consequences from the crisis, as well as effects on the work
                      of the banking system," Medvedev said.</p>
              <p>"Our banking system withstood the stress, and now it is doing just fine," he added.</p>
              <p>Medvedev
                      also assured television viewers that Russia's currency, the ruble, was
                      "entirely calm and stable" after it initially declined against the
                      dollar in the first months of the crisis amid plunging oil prices.</p>
              <p>"It
                      seems to me that overall, our reasonably optimistic expectations are
                      now justified. At the same time, there are grounds to believe that next
                      year we will have a whole new set of problems to address," the
                      president said.</p>
              <p>During the first eight months of the year,
                      Russian GDP declined 10.2 percent compared to the same period of 2008,
                      according to the country's economy ministry.</p>
              <p>Officials have
                      said however that Russia came out of recession during the third quarter
                      of 2008 and that the economy is gradually recovering.</p>
