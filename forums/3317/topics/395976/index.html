              <p><strong>No charges for Qatari diplomat after US flight scare</strong></p>
              <p>WASHINGTON (AFP) - – A Qatari diplomat who sparked a national 
              security scare by joking about setting fire to his shoe on an airplane 
              will be released without charge, a US law enforcement official told AFP 
              on Thursday.</p>
              <p>"It's expected that he's going to be turned over today to Qatari 
              officials. I don't know if he's still with the FBI or if he's been 
              turned over to the Qatari officials yet," the official said.</p>
              <p>Mohammed al-Modadi, 27, the third secretary and vice consul of the 
              Qatari embassy in Washington was confronted by air marshals late 
              Wednesday after smoking a cigarette in an airplane bathroom and joked he
               was trying to ignite his shoe.</p>
              <p>The source, who asked not to be named, said that even though smoking
               in airplane restrooms is a federal crime under US law, the diplomat is 
              not likely to be prosecuted.</p>
              <p>"He has diplomatic immunity. If he was a US citizen, that's a 
              violation, but he does have diplomatic immunity," the official said. 
              "Only a foreign government can lift the immunity."</p>
              <p>US air marshals wrestled Modadi to the floor of the plane during a 
              flight from the US capital to Denver, after he joked about setting fire 
              to his shoes.</p>
              <p>His comments raised fears of a repeat of the 2001 "shoe bomber" 
              incident in which British national Richard Reid tried to blow up an 
              airliner using explosives hidden in his shoe.</p>
              <p>Reid pleaded guilty in 2003 to trying to blow up an American 
              Airlines Paris-Miami flight on December 22, 2001 and murder the 197 
              people aboard.</p>
              <p>Wednesday's security scare prompted fighter jets to be scrambled and
               top White House aides to brief President Barack Obama.</p>
              <p>The plane landed safely at Denver International Airport following 
              the disturbance, and US officials later said it appeared the passenger 
              was not trying to blow up the plane.</p>
              <p>The State Department said Thursday it expected a quick diplomatic 
              solution to the affair, adding US authorities had been in close contact 
              with the ambassador of Qatar.</p>
              <p>"We are satisfied with the seriousness by which they take what has 
              occurred. That's why we have confidence that this will be resolved very 
              quickly," spokesman Philip Crowley told reporters.</p>
              <p>A US official, speaking on condition of anonymity, hinted Modad 
              would soon be sent home. "His ability to function effectively has been 
              significantly compromised," the official said.</p>
              <p>Qatar's ambassador to Washington Ali Bin Fajad al-Hajari said in a 
              statement the diplomat had been traveling to Denver on official embassy 
              business.</p>
              <p>"He was certainly not engaged in any threatening activity," the 
              ambassador said. "The facts will reveal that this was a mistake, and we 
              urge all concerned parties to avoid reckless judgments or speculation."</p>
              <p>The panic reaction also appeared to have been prompted by fears of a
               possible repeat of the foiled Christmas Day bombing, when a Nigerian 
              passenger tried to blow up a plane by igniting an explosive secreted in 
              his underwear.</p>
              <p>Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano praised the swift 
              actions of the federal air marshals.</p>
              <p>"We always treat security-related incidents seriously until verified
               otherwise, and thankfully this incident posed no actual security 
              threat," she added.</p>
