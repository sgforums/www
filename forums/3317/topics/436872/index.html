              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: An Army captain with a gambling addiction, on Friday 
              was jailed 16 weeks and fined S$40,400 for receiving loans in exchange 
              for providing confidential information about military projects.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Phua Poh Sim, 31, 
              who has been suspended on no-pay leave by the Singapore Armed Forces 
              (SAF), pleaded guilty to two charges of corruptly obtaining 
              gratification in the form of loans, which amounted to more than 
              S$53,000.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Three other similar charges were taken into consideration.<br><br>Phua received the money in mid-2008 from Richard Yow Wah, who was the managing director of Certified Aerospace Singapore.<br><br>Investigations revealed that Phua had chalked up debts of about S$100,000 after gambling at casinos onboard cruise ships.<br><br>Phua borrowed from various sources, including from his colleague, Major John Cheong Chee Wai, who later introduced Phua to Yow.<br><br>Phua
               told Yow that he was involved in project work with the SAF and he could
               help Yow's business by sharing information with him.<br><br>On May 3, 
              2008, Phua went to Yow's home and passed him a set of documents 
              containing confidential information relating to military projects, which
               the SAF was keen to purchase.<br><br>These included information on the new army combat uniform.<br><br>Phua continued to provide confidential information to Yow in return for loans on various occasions.<br><br>In
               mitigation, Phua's lawyer Mr Quek Mong Hua said that Phua had a 
              distinguished record where he was awarded several scholarships and 
              medals for his good service.<br><br>This included the prestigious SAF overseas merit scholarship.<br><br>He
               also came from a family with a military background as his father is a 
              warrant officer and his brother is also a captain in the SAF.<br><br>In 
              addition, Mr Quek urged the court to consider the nature of the 
              information revealed and said that Phua was mindful to not reveal 
              information that was highly damaging.<br><br>Mr Quek also noted that 
              Phua was due for a promotion to the rank of Major during the time of the
               offences and had confessed to his misdeeds voluntarily during his 
              interviews.<br><br>However, deputy public prosecutor Adrian Ooi said 
              that Phua's offences were a "disgrace to the SAF" and had compromised 
              the public image of Singapore as a corruption-free country.<br><br>Mr Ooi added that as an officer, Phua was not allowed to take loans in any case.<br><br>The tall and bespectacled man remained emotionless during sentencing.<br><br>Phua could have been jailed up to five years and jailed S$100,000 for each charge.<br><br>- CNA/ck</span></span></p>
