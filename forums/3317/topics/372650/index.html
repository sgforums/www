              <p>FORMER full-time national serviceman Ee Jin Liang was convicted on
              Wednesday of two graft charges and one charge under the Customs Act for
              accepting contraband cigarettes as bribes from members of the
              Indonesian navy last year.</p>
              <p>The court heard that in return for the bribes, Ee, now 23, who was
              a driver, transported illegal cigarettes from Changi Naval Base to the
              carpark outside the base where a Singapore syndicate waited to pick up
              the goods.</p>
              <p>The total amount of excise duty and GST unpaid for these cigarettes
              totalled over $3 million, while Ee received at least $1,974 worth of
              cigarettes for doing the job.</p>
              <p>A district court heard that Ee was assigned to Indonesian navy personnel to handle their transportation needs.</p>
              <p>Last August, Ee and his colleague Ang Zi Heng, who both held the
              rank of a lance-corporal, were assigned to the Indonesian navy which
              were here for a meeting at Changi Naval Base.</p>
              <p>On the second night of their duty, Indonesian navy personnel
              started loading cartons of contraband cigarettes onto the minibus that
              Ee and Ang were driving. Both were then directed to drive the minibus
              to a carpark outside the base.</p>
              <p>There, the cartons were unloaded from the minibus onto waiting
              lorries. In all, six trips were made. After the transfer, an Indonesian
              navy officer gave a black trash back containing about 20 cartons of the
              cigarettes to Ee and Ang in return for their help. Ang took about 13
              cartons while Ee took the rest.</p>
              <p>Ang, who faced only one charge, was sentenced to 16 months' jail in
              March for his role in the incident. Ee, however, continued to help
              transport the contraband cigarettes.</p>
              <p>In October, Ee and a navy recruit were the assigned drivers to the
              Indonesian navy again. Except this time, the Indonesians asked them for
              a larger vehicle as they had more boxes to transport.</p>
              <p>For doing this job, Ee received 20 cartons of contraband cigarettes and a chest of tea.</p>
              <p>Two months later, Ee's luck ran out when he was again asked to
              transport boxes containing cigarettes out of Changi Naval Base by the
              Indonesians.</p>
              <p>He was arrested, along with five syndicate members, when he was about to make his third trip out of the camp.</p>
              <p>He will be sentenced next Wednesday. For the Customs charge, he
              faces a fine of up to 20 times the duty and taxes evaded or jail of up
              to three years or both. For the corruption charges, he faces a maximum
              of five years' jail and a fine of $100,000.</p>

              <div class="top_headline"><strong> Ex-NSman jailed over smuggling</strong></div>
              <div class="top_headline"><br></div>
              <div class="top_headline">
              <p>A FORMER NSman, who helped some members of the Indonesian navy
              smuggle a large cache of contraband cigarettes, was jailed for four
              years and five months by a district court on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>Ee Jin Liang, 23, then a lance corporal (LCP) at the Tuas Naval Base, appeared stunned when sentence was passed.</p>
              <p>Senior District Judge Tan Siong Thye said while the jail term may
              seem harsh for a first offender like Eem, it serves as a deterrent to
              others.</p>
              <p>'If not deterred, some other national serviceman could be bribed to look the other way,' he said.</p>
              <p>'We can ill afford such security compromise in today's context as
              terrorism is very real and terrorists will exploit security lapses and
              cause massive public mayhem and destruction of human lives and
              property.'</p>
              <p>The judge also pointed out that the amount of contraband involved was one of the highest to have come before the courts.</p>
              <p>Excise duty and goods and services tax (GST) unpaid on these cigarettes came up to more than $3 million.</p>
              <p>Ee had pleaded guilty last Thursday.</p>
              <p>He was assigned to ferry the Indonesian personnel who were here for
              meetings with the Singapore Navy at the Changi Naval Base.</p>
              <p>It was during these meetings that Ee helped the Indonesians move the contraband out of the base.</p>
              <p>Investigations revealed that the Indonesians were in cahoots with a
              syndicate here that sold the smuggled cigarettes locally.</p>
