              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said 
              youths in the country will have a bright future - where they will be 
              given ample opportunity to do well in their studies and jobs, as well as
               contribute to society.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The message came on 
              the back of his speech in Parliament on Thursday, which promised a 
              better life for all and an inclusive society.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>At the launch of the
               inaugural Youths Care movement on Saturday, Mr Lee said in other parts 
              of the world, youths are frustrated at the system, and cited the "Occupy
               Wall Street" demonstrations as an example.<br><br>PM Lee said: "They 
              are unhappy because unemployment is high, because they see the problems 
              in their country, because they don't see any hope for themselves or any 
              optimism for the future, and they are just feeling angst - don't know 
              what to do about it - but anyway, [they are] not happy."<br><br>Mr Lee urged young Singaporeans to pay it forward and do their part for the community.<br><br>The initiative will see youths fan out across the island to do community service over two weekends.<br><br>The
               community service activities include sprucing up an old neighbourhood 
              with a colourful mural, and playing sports to raise funds for charity. <br><br>For instance, the Youths Care initiative in Bedok raised more than S$2,000 for the ComCare assistance fund.<br><br>"I
               hope you will gain something back by contributing. By painting the 
              wall, by doing the murals, you will make friends. You'll appreciate 
              what's happening in real life, and you'll build empathy, connect with 
              people, [gain] some humility to know that others are working with you. 
              And these are, I think values, and lessons which should be very valuable
               to you in life," said Mr Lee. <br><br>The People's Association (PA) said the Youths Care movement is also in line with the call for a more inclusive society.<br><br>"We
               also want to encourage and inspire our youth to do things, not just for
               themselves but to do things for others in the community, for other 
              youth, as well as seniors in the community," said Mr Yam Ah Mee, Chief 
              Executive of PA. <br><br>Mr Khoo Han Zhi, Arts &amp; Culture Secretary 
              of the Teck Ghee Youth Executive Committee, said: "I think it's a good 
              event to bridge different groups of people from different parts of the 
              community - the less privileged and our residents."<br><br>As it 
              celebrates its 40th anniversary, Mr Lee called on the People's 
              Association Youth Movement to adapt to new environments and reach out to
               more young people.<br><br>And to stay relevant, Mr Lee said the 
              movement must continue to engage youths through social media platforms 
              such as Facebook and Twitter.<br><br>- CNA /ls</span></span></p>
