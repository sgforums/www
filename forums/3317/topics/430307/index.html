              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: With an eye on the next General Election (GE), the 
              Workers' Party's (WP) top leadership made a strategic decision late 
              Thursday night to select a younger member for its second 
              Non-Constituency Member of Parliament (NCMP) seat.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Unfortunately, the move prompted veteran central executive committee member and party treasurer Eric Tan to quit.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>In an exclusive interview with Today late Thursday night, as he drafted a statement for the media, he said: "I feel betrayed."<br><br>The WP is expected to officially announce on Friday which of its candidates will be accepting the NCMP seats.<br><br>The
               WP is entitled to two NCMP seats - one for 46-year-old Yee Jenn Jong, 
              who lost narrowly in the single-seat of Joo Chiat and the other for one 
              of the five members of its East Coast Group Representation Constituency 
              (GRC) team.<br><br>The Thursday night meeting at Hougang Town Council 
              saw the WP's central executive committee vote to hand the second NCMP 
              seat to the party's assistant webmaster, 34-year-old Gerald Giam.<br><br>This was the first election the IT consultant, who joined WP in 2009, has contested. <br><br>He was part of the team in East Coast GRC which was led by 55-year-old Mr Tan.<br><br>Mr
               Tan, a former banker who is now a private equity fund manager, said: "I
               am disappointed that Low (Thia Khiang) and part of the CEC have decided
               to go against the people's wishes, citing party renewal as their 
              reason. <br><br>"I too, also believe in the renewal of the party but in an orderly manner, with succession plans. <br><br>"But not like this, dropped like a bomb." <br><br>Mr
               Tan added: "I have helped build the East Coast team since 2005 and was 
              the only one remaining after the 2006 election. I fought on and rebuilt 
              the team, helping to gain a solid result for the party," he said.<br><br>"I
               wanted the NCMP post so that I would be able to be the voice of the 
              people." said Mr Tan, who is also the chairman of the party's Eastern 
              Area Committee. <br><br>The 45.17 per cent polled by the WP in East 
              Coast GRC has led many to speculate that the WP has set its sight on 
              making the constituency its next major battleground in five years' time.<br><br>Mr
               Tan is also understood to have played a role in attracting corporate 
              lawyer Chen Show Mao and Mr Yee to join the party. It is not known if 
              the opposition party might reconsider its decision on Friday. <br><br>- </span><span class="path">TODAY</span><span>/wk</span></span></p>

              <p>WP has been following the ruling party's strategy of youth politics very closely ...</p>
              <p>We can say that the trend is moving towards the uprising youths and fading seniors...its a political life cycle as well as in the corporate world....</p>
              <p>if the WP does not engage in wooing the youths of today....in 5 years time..they may lose significant votes in this connection....</p>
              <p>it was exactly following the ruling party's strategy of candidates selection with strong credentials that led to the growth of WP into today's most powerful opposition...</p>
              <p>that decision is understandable....however, it should be done discreetly with more important advisory/ participative roles for the senior members so that they would not feel "betrayed" </p>

              look at the power of $16,000/mth NCMP seats...
              
              before election started, many parties didn't give way because each wanted their best chances at fillinf up the NCMP seats. eventually they did get realistic, and the joker who didn't, lost his deposit.
              
              after the election, the same $16,000 seat can create infighting within a party.
              
              it's really peanuts to keep the opposition disunited.

              ideas be taken seriously. If Eunic Olsen made so much from being an
              NCMP, she no need to endorse jewelry loh.</p>

              back to eric tan, when i was watching the news on tuesday (http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1127962/1/.html) and saw him saying it's likely to be him, i felt a bit strange because neither lina chiam or yee jenn jong had said something like that. sekali not him his face put where.
              
              as it turns out it really isn 't him.
