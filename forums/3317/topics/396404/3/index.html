              <p>A Straits Times report states that the fight started after “a player

               as a loser and made uncomplimentary remarks about his mother.”<br> <br> How can an incident like this happen between two of the best schools in

               youth athletes? Should the school, coaches or parents be responsible?

              <p><strong>Teen held over bus-stop assault</strong></p>
              <p>POLICE have arrested a 17-year-old boy suspected of assaulting an 
              Anglo-Chinese School (Independent) student at a bus stop after the 
              Schools National B Division rugby final last week.</p>
              <p>It is believed he is a Secondary 4 student from St Andrew's School 
              (SAS). The police succeeded in identifying and tracking him down with 
              the help of a photograph an ACS(I) teacher took of him following the 
              altercation.</p>
              <p>It is understood the boy surrendered himself on Tuesday at 
              the Tanglin Police Station after receiving a call from the police.</p>
              <p>Both schools declined to comment as the police are 
              investigating.</p>
              <p>The attack on the ACS(I) student and his friend took place 
              at a bus stop near the Old Police Academy, the venue of the April 12 
              final. They got away from the aggressor by boarding a bus. One of the 
              victims suffered a broken nose and was taken to hospital.</p>
              <p>The match, which ACS(I) won 8-7, was marred by an 
              ill-tempered end. SAS player Daniel Tan hit ACS(I) opponent Leonard Wee,
               sparking an on-pitch invasion by students, parents and old boys from 
              both camps.</p>

              <p><strong>Assault: Teen pleads guilty</strong></p>
              <p>A FORMER student of St Andrew's Secondary School (SAS) yesterday 
              admitted in court to assaulting two students of Anglo-Chinese School 
              (Independent) following a keenly contested rugby match that boiled over 
              into a fracas.</p>
              <p>Chan Yu Tat, 16, pleaded guilty to one charge of causing hurt to a 
              15-year-old ACS(I) student on the evening of April 12 at a bus stop 
              along Thomson Road, just outside the old Police Academy, where the match
               took place.</p>
              <p>A second charge, of causing hurt to another ACS (I) student,
               also 15, will be taken into consideration for sentencing.</p>
              <p>All three boys were not rugby players, but supporters of 
              their respective school teams.</p>
              <p>The match, which ACS (I) won 8-7, was marred by an 
              ill-tempered end, with an SAS player hitting his opponent. This sparked 
              an on-pitch invasion by students, parents and old boys from both camps.</p>
              <p>The Singapore School Sports Council is still investigating 
              the fracas on the field.</p>

              <p><strong>No probation for teen involved in rugby fight</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: The Court heard that the teenager who assaulted a 
              student from Anglo Chinese School, Independent after a rugby match in 
              April this year, won't be recommended for probation. </span></p>
              <p><span> As a result, 16-year-old Chan Yu Tat will be remanded to assess if he is
               suitable for rehabilitation at a Reformative Training Centre. </span></p>
              <p><span> Chan, a former student of St Andrew's Secondary School, will appear 
              again in court on July 30. </span></p>
              <p><span> District Judge Ng Peng Hong told the court that he was "alarmed" by the 
              probation report and that the teenager should be in a "structured 
              environment" to address what the judge referred to as his "delinquent 
              lifestyle". </span></p>
              <p><span> Chan pleaded guilty last month to punching the 15-year-old ACS(I) 
              student at a bus stop along Thomson Road, outside the old Police Academy
               where the match took place. </span></p>
              <p><span> The 15-year-old broke his nose and was sent to Tan Tock Seng Hospital. </span></p>
              <p><span> Chan was also accused of punching another 15-year old ACS(I)  boy in the
               face at the same place that day. </span></p>
              <p><span> However, this charge was taken into consideration. </span></p>
              <p><span> The three teenagers were not rugby players who took part in the match. </span></p>
              <p><span> They had turned up at the old Police Academy to support their school 
              teams. </span></p>
              <p><span> The outcome of the match made the headlines earlier this year when a 
              scuffle broke out on the rugby pitch shortly after the game ended. </span></p>
              <p><span> For punching the 15-year-old boy, Chan could have been sentenced to up

              <p><strong>Rugby teen fined $3,000</strong></p>
              <p>THE tension in a keenly contested rugby match between two schools 
              spilled over to its supporters and resulted in Chan Yu Tat punching a 
              pupil from the rival Anglo-Chinese School (Independent) on April 12.</p>
              <p>Chan, a former student of St Andrew's Secondary School (SAS) and now 
              working as a part-time packer, was on Friday fined $3,000. He had been 
              found unsuitable for probation as he had a previous conviction for theft
               for which he served 15-months probation in 2008.</p>
              <p>He could have been subjected to the tougher reformative training 
              regime but his lawyer Harold Seet Pek Hian convinced the court that Chan
               should be fined instead.</p>
              <p>The lawyer said that Chan had been provoked by insults from 
              rival supporters at the bus stop along Thomson Road outside the old 
              Police Academy.</p>
              <p>The teen had also acted out of character by punching Keith 
              Chia Ker Ren, 15, in the face and breaking his nose, the lawyer added.</p>
              <p>In reply, the police prosecutor said that the court should 
              note that the attack occurred after the game and away from the field. A 
              second similar charge against Chan for punching another ACS (I) boy also
               at the bus stop was taken into consideration by Community Court Judge 
              Ng Peng Hong when passing sentence.</p>
