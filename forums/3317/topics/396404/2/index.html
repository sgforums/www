              <p>Hey Sgdevilzz, thanks for the source.</p>
              <p>I wasn't aware of the exact details of the bus-stop incident prior to reading your post other than reading what the paper wrote. In that light, yes, I would fully agree that those ACS boys who kept provoking the SA student was asking for it.</p>

              <p>On the surface level, the Google letters depict the various panoramic places of interests in Singapore. Several of the iconic tourist attractions featured by my illustration encompasses the Merlion, the Singapore Flyer, the Jurong Bird Park, the Esplanade and the Changi Airport. In a more abstract manner, several distinctive values of Singaporeans such as education, punctuality, racial harmony and total defence are also shown respectively by the depiction of the graduation cap, the MRT, the people holding hands together and the 5 jets parading in the air. Thus, I feel that my doodle has expressed the theme of “Our Singapore” effectively.</p>

              <p><strong>Saint punished</strong></p>
              <p>ST ANDREW'S School (SAS) has taken swift action in disciplining a 
              player who floored Anglo-Chinese School (Independent) flanker Leonard 
              Wee with a punch during Monday's Schools National B Division rugby 
              final.</p>
              <p>The incident, which happened right after the final whistle, sparked a
               pitch invasion from players and supporters of both camps.</p>
              <p>SAS yesterday temporarily suspended the boy from lessons.</p>
              <p>He was also banned from all school rugby activities for six 
              months, disqualified from receiving the school colours, and will not be 
              allowed to represent the school again.</p>
              <p>The player also made a public apology in front of the entire
               school during assembly yesterday morning and will be taken to meet 
              Leonard to reconcile their differences.</p>
              <p>In a statement yesterday, the Ministry of Education said 
              that the Schools National rugby convener - St Andrew's - has appointed a
               disciplinary panel to investigate the incident. Appropriate action will
               be taken on the recommendations of the committee.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>I may be wrong, but when it comes to sports, you need a good brain. Opponents will try all ways to get you worked up and sent off. To say you cannot tolerate insults means that you have a huge vulnerability in competitive sports, or should i say, opponents will take advantage of it. But obviously insults are a low handed way to win a game. I despise it but then in games, you have all sorts of people, what can you do?</div>
