              <p>FAMED Spanish chef Santi Santamaria died last night after collapsing 
              in the kitchen of his restaurant at Marina Bay Sands. He was 53 and it 
              is believed he had a heart attack.</p>
              <p>The Michelin-starred chef is believed to have fainted around 8pm at 
              Santi, his restaurant, and was taken immediately to the Singapore 
              General Hospital.</p>
              <p>The chef is believed to have died an hour or two later.</p>
              <p>Just hours earlier, he had appeared well and spoke 
              animatedly at a press conference held by the integrated resort to 
              introduce its seven celebrity chefs.</p>
              <p>He bantered with the other chefs: Tetsuya Wakuda, Guy Savoy, Mario Batali, Daniel Boulud, Wolfgang Puck and Justin Quek.</p>
              <p>Chef Santamaria spoke of how going forward, it was important
               for the restaurant here to continue to promote good relations between 
              Barcelona, near where his restaurant is, and Singapore.</p>

              <p><strong>World's top chefs pay tribute to Spain's Santamaria</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: A gathering of the world's top chefs paid tribute to 
              one of their own on Thursday as they mourned Spain's Michelin-starred 
              Santi Santamaria who died in Singapore.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Santamaria, who was 
              53, collapsed on Tuesday while serving guests gathered to inaugurate the
               opening of Singapore's Marina Bay Sands resort and died following a 
              reported heart attack while being taken to hospital.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Michelin-starred 
              Daniel Boulud, Guy Savoy and Wolfgang Puck - along with acclaimed Asian 
              chefs Justin Quek and Tetsuya Wakuda - gathered on stage to pay their 
              respects to Santamaria, who like those five had in the past year opened a
               restaurant at the US$5.7 billion resort.<br><br>"Santi was crazy about 
              cooking, his cooking, and he was crazy about the one thing we all love -
               great cuisine," said the Austrian-born Puck, famous for his 
              two-Michelin-starred Spago Beverly Hills.<br><br>"I really think that 
              Santi is looking down us and saying, you know, you guys should live your
               life the way I lived it - with passion for food, with passion for 
              friends, passion for family, and with passion to live life they way you 
              see is fit for yourself. <br><br>"With Santi you felt like he was your brother and your best friend."<br><br>Santamaria
               was generally acknowledged as the man who took Catalan cooking to the 
              world and his Can Fabes restaurant in the Spanish city of Sant Celoni 
              has been rated with three Michelin stars since 1994.<br><br>The chef was
               given two further Michelin stars for his restaurant in Madrid, Sant 
              Celoni, one more star for his Barcelona establishment Evo, and another 
              for Tierra, in Valdepalacios, just outside of Madrid.<br><br>A visibly 
              shaken Boulud - who runs the three-Michelin-starred Daniel in New York -
               said too that the world of cooking had lost a "great friend, an 
              inspiration." <br><br>"He taught the world about the importance of 
              Spanish cuisine, Catalan cuisine, and his passion and love for Spanish 
              cuisine was quite unique," said the Frenchman. <br><br>"He will be 
              greatly missed. But I don't think he'd want to be remembered for 
              anything less than what he did for Spanish cuisine and his country as 
              well.<br><br>"Santi has left a huge legacy and we are all proud to have known him."<br><br>Santamaria
               was a fierce advocate of using only the freshest produce in his cooking
               and had been a sometime vocal critic of the advent of "molecular 
              gastronomy."<br><br>"Santi loved to eat," said France's Savoy, a pioneer
               of the "Nouvelle Cuisine" movement at his three-Michelin-starred Guy 
              Savoy in Paris. <br><br>"He has left us way too early. In its way, for him to leave us in his kitchen was a beautiful way for him to leave us."<br><br>- AFP/fa</span></span></p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Medical test showed Spanish chef Santamaria was healthy</h1>
              <p>SPANISH chef Santi Santamaria was holding court in the kitchen of his
               Marina Bay Sands (MBS) restaurant and speaking passionately about food 
              to some 20 members of the media when he suddenly fainted.</p>
              <p>Just before he had a heart attack and collapsed around 7.30pm on 
              Wednesday, he turned to those standing near him and said he felt faint.</p>
              <p>Mr Mikel Zeberio, 59, an established food writer in Spain who was 
              present when the chef collapsed, told The Straits Times: 'It was very 
              sudden. I gave him a kiss (of greeting) and three minutes later, he had 
              collapsed and I was holding him in my arms.'</p>
              <p>Mr George Tanasijevich, interim chief executive of MBS and 
              managing director of global development with Las Vegas Sands Corp, the 
              parent company of MBS, said in a press statement on Thursday that staff 
              from the restaurant 'rendered assistance' while an ambulance was called.</p>
              <p>The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) arrived nine 
              minutes later at 7.44pm. An SCDF spokesman said that when its paramedics
               arrived, the chef was not breathing and had no pulse.</p>
              <p>Paramedics began cardiopulmonary resuscitation at the 
              restaurant and continued en route to the Singapore General Hospital. The
               53-year-old chef was pronounced dead at the hospital at around 9pm. He 
              is survived by his wife Angels, 53, son Paul, 27, daughter Regina, 25, 
              and a week-old grandson born to Paul.</p>
