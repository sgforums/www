              <p>STOMPer anson highlights a 2009 survey on marital 
              success in which 17,000 adults were interviewed. One of the findings of 
              the London Institute of Education survey was that men who went to 
              single-sex schools were more likely to be divorced -- and depressed -- 
              by their early 40s.</p>
              <p>There was no significant link for women, but the survey suggested that there was a <span class="Apple-style-span">"statistically significant positive association between single-sex schooling and wages for women".</span> Another possible conclusion was that, <span class="Apple-style-span">"boys learn better when they are with girls and they actually learn to get on better."</span> <br><br>The
               findings of the research were presented by Professor Diana Leonard, 
              from the university, at a conference at the Perse School for Girls in 
              Cambridge.<br><br>Wrote the STOMPer:<br><br>"This study shows that boys 
              taught in single-sex schools are more likely to be divorced or separated
               from their partner than those who attended a mixed school by their 
              early 40s.<br><br>"However, those who stayed together were just as 
              likely to be happy in their relationship as men educated in mixed 
              schools -– when asked to rate the quality of their marriage on a scale 
              of one to seven.<br><br>"The research covered 17,000 adults who had been
               taught in a range of institutions from private boarding schools to 
              state comprehensives.<br><br>"The majority had been brought up in day schools."</p>
