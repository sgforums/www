              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Some 200 Chinese nationals working for three
              construction companies gathered at the Ministry of Manpower (MOM)
              building at Havelock Road on Monday morning over employment matters,
              such as unpaid wages.
              <br> <br> Police were called in after about 130 of them refused to move on to the ministry's Kim Seng Road office as advised.
              <br> <br>The ministry said the workers were part of the same group
              interviewed at its Kim Seng Road office on Friday. They had their work
              permits revoked two weeks ago after their employers breached labour
              laws.
              <br> <br>The companies had apparently failed to pay the foreign worker levy.
              They had also failed to produce documents and their foreign workers for
              verification. In such a situation, employers are required by law to
              repatriate them within a week. <br> <br> At least one worker told Channel NewsAsia he had paid over S$5,000 to
              work in Singapore for one year. But he had only been here for four
              months and now has to return to China, barely getting back what he
              paid.
              <br> <br>The ministry added that the actions of these foreign workers were
              unproductive, and only served to delay the resolution of their claims.
              It urged them to cooperate and work with MOM officers, rather than
              break the law.
              <br> <br>It warned that if these workers gather at MOM again without prior
              appointments and without valid reasons, MOM will immediately refer them
              to the police.
              <br> <br>MOM said workers can be assured that early intervention measures by
              MOM to investigate errant employers is to help workers sooner rather
              than later and that MOM is committed to seek a fair resolution to their
              disputes.
              <br> <br>Upon receiving reports of salary arrears, MOM will first need to
              establish the facts of the case before exploring whether workers and
              their employers can reach a mutually acceptable settlement. <br> <br> Such investigations cannot be completed overnight and will take some
              time. Workers whose work permits have been terminated and are still
              needed here in Singapore to assist in investigations will be issued
              special passes to do so. <br> <br> As long as workers are working and living here in Singapore, MOM said
              they must abide by and respect Singapore's laws or risk being dealt
              with accordingly, if they break them.
