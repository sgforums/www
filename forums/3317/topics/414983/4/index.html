              <p><strong>6 more suspects nabbed</strong></p>
              <p>POLICE have arrested six more suspects in connection with the two 
              cases of armed rioting at Bukit Panjang housing estate on Nov 8.</p>
              <p>The suspects, aged 19 to 25 years, were rounded up by CID officers in
               successive raids at Balestier and Bukit Batok early on Thursday.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The latest arrests bring to 12 the number of suspects</span> who have been 
              detained for suspected involvement in gang-related activities. Police 
              investigations are on-going.</p>
              <p>Director of the Criminal Investigation Department, Senior 
              Assistant Commissioner of Police Ng Boon Gay said: 'We understand 
              residents' concern arising from the attacks. We are working closely with
               the local MPs and grassroots leaders to address residents' concerns and
               will provide progressive updates on our investigations. '</p>
              <p>On Wednesday, Mr Ng warned that all gang behaviour would be 
              dealt with firmly and decisively. Offenders will face the full brunt of 
              the law, including the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act, which 
              allows for detention without trial, Mr Ng said.</p>
              <p>'Youth offenders involved in violent crimes must be warned 
              that they will not be treated lightly simply because of their age,' he 
              said in a statement on Wednesday. 'There is no excuse for violence and 
              no leniency for those who disregard the law.'</p>
              <p>Action will also be taken against those who turn up at the 
              courts in force as a show of support for their fellow gangsters, police 
              further warned. The warnings came after six youths were arrested over 
              two cases of armed rioting in Bukit Panjang in a 24-hour swoop by CID 
              officers.</p>

              			<br></h1>
              <p>YOUTH crime in Singapore has seen a general decrease over the years through various police enforcement and preventive actions.</p>
              <p>In response to rising concern over the recent spate of youth
               gang attacks and rioting, police on Friday said they will step up 
              operations against gang-related activity.</p>
              <p>In a statement giving an update on the gang situation in 
              Singapore today, police said the number of youths arrested for overall 
              crime has gone down by 9 per cent to 2,086 in the first six months of 
              this year, from the same period last year.</p>
              <p>This group accounted for 24 per cent of all offenders arrested for overall crime between January and June.</p>
              <p>But the number of youths arrested for rioting in the first half year has gone up from 263 a year ago to 278.</p>
              <p>Police said youth crime is a multi-faceted problem that 
              requires a multi-pronged approach and urged schools, law enforcement 
              agencies, social services sector, parents and youths themselves all to 
              pay a role.</p>

              <p>at least they dressed up nicely, look civilised.</p>
              <p>And if u think japan have much higher crime rate, u are awfully wrong.</p>
              <p>Japan has maintained a developed and safe country with humane judicial system.</p>
              <p>we have alot to learn from them, both the black and white society.</p>
