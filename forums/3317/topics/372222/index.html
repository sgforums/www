              <p>SAN FRANCISCO - A French teenager's claim that an Apple iPhone
              shattered in his face is the first involving the device but similar
              incidents have occurred with the iPod according to a US television
              station.<br><br>Ms Marie-Dominique Kolega, whose 18-year-old son was
              struck in the eye by a piece of glass when the screen shattered on his
              girlfriend's iPhone, has threatened to file a complaint against Apple.
              The phone began making a hissing noise and the screen suddenly broke,
              sending pieces flying in the air. <br><br>"My son was frightened but he did not lose an eye," said Ms Kolega. <br><br>The report is the first such incident involving an iPhone.<br><br>But
              US television news station Kiro reported in July that an "alarming
              number" of iPods "have suddenly burst into flames and smoke". There
              were no serious injuries, and the cause appeared to be overheated
              lithium ion batteries.<br><br>The number of incidents is low
              considering the tens of millions of iPods sold and that such reports
              diminished after Apple evidently changed the battery technology.</p>

              <p><strong>Apple looking into reports of exploding iPhones</strong></p>
              <p>BRUSSELS - Apple is investigating media reports that one or more of
              the company's iPhones have exploded in Europe, a European Commission
              spokeswoman said Tuesday.</p>
              <p>The spokeswoman for the EU executive, which oversees the safety of
              consumer products sold in the 27-country bloc, said Apple had described
              the reported incidents as isolated.</p>
              <p>Apple said it was aware of
              the media reports, which include a case in which a teenager in France
              said he was slightly injured when his iPhone made a hissing noise and
              shattered, but did not comment on any contacts with the commission.</p>
              <p>"Apple
              have come back to us ... and what they've said to us is that they
              consider these are isolated incidents. They don't consider that there's
              a general problem," commission spokeswoman Helen Kearns told a news
              briefing.</p>
              <p>"They're trying to get more information on the specific
              details of those incidents and they will do tests as necessary to
              investigate the possible cause," she said.</p>
              <p>Apple did not comment on the commission spokeswoman's remarks.</p>
              <p>But
              a spokesman for Apple Europe Ltd. said: "We are aware of these reports
              and we are waiting to receive the iPhones from the customers. Until we
              have the full details, we don't have anything further to add."</p>

              <p><strong>Frenchman hurt by 'exploding iPhone'</strong></p>
              <p class="first">MARSEILLE, France (AFP) - - A French security guard
              said Tuesday he had received a faceful of glass when the screen of his
              iPhone exploded, the second such reported incident in France.</p>
              <p>Yassine Bouhadi, a 26-year-old supermarket watchman from the
              southeastern town of Villevieille, said he was typing a text message on
              Monday afternoon when the screen exploded.</p>
              <p>Bouhadi, who says he
              was hit in the eye with a glass shard, said he was "very angry" and
              planned to consult a doctor and file suit for damages.</p>
              <p>"I want an
              explanation about this damned telephone," said Bouhadi, who bought the
              hugely-popular smartphone device for 600 euros (850 dollars) three
              months ago and now wants his money back.</p>
              <p>France's official
              competition, consumer affairs and fraud watchdog, the DGCCRF, said
              Tuesday it had opened an investigation after a French teenager suffered
              an eye injury in a similar iPhone incident earlier this month.</p>
              <p>"An
              investigation is under way. We have been alerted to the problem and we
              are looking into it closely," said a spokesman from the agency.</p>
              <p>The
              US technology giant Apple, which makes the iPhone and the iPod music
              player, assured the European Union on August 14 that the exploding
              screen cases reported so far were "isolated incidents."</p>
              <p>The French cases come a few weeks after an uproar in Britain over an exploding iPod owned by an 11-year-old girl.</p>
              <p>And
              a US television station reported last month that an "alarming number"
              of iPods had burst into flames, though without causing serious injury,
              a problem apparently caused by overheated lithium ion batteries.</p>
              <p>A
              spokesman for France's consumer rights group, UFC-Que Choisir, called
              on Apple to "communicate a bit more with its customers" about reported
              glitches with its iPod and iPhone devices.</p>
              <p>"We want to know if
              this is an isolated incident as they claim, or a real problem involving
              the iPhone -- in which case, what are they planning by way of
              compensation and to prevent it happening again?"</p>
