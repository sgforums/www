              <p>In just a month, there have been three reported cases of teens who took 
              their own lives. They should have cherished their lives and looked 
              towards the future, says a concerned STOMPer G. School and relationship problems are not the end of the world, he adds.</p>
              <p>According to a report in The New Paper (June 13), 16-year-old Darryle 
              Tan Wei Guan, Lim En Han and Krystal Aki Mizoguchi, both 18, fell to 
              their deaths.</p>
              <p>Secondary 4 Express student Darryle had been suspended from school on 
              March 25 for slapping a male teacher. He then took up a part-time job, 
              studied hard on his own and seemed to be becoming more positive. 
              However, barely two months after his suspension, on May 29, he took his 
              own life after apologising to his family on the phone.<br><br>Lim En Han
               was a bright student at Hwa Chong Institution, but had been seeing a 
              psychiatrist and her family had withdrawn her from school in March. 
              According to a report in Lianhe Wanbao, it is believed that she might 
              have been facing relationship problems as well as difficulties with her 
              studies, which could have spurred her to take her own life on June 5.<br><br>Krystal
               Aki Mizoguchi was a half-Japanese, half-Chinese Singaporean student at 
              Yishun Junior College. However, things took a turn for the worst when 
              the youth received her A-level results which were only good enough for 
              her to apply to private universities. That option "had never crossed 
              (her) mind", she wrote in her blog. On May 14, she fell to her death.<br><br>STOMPer G shares his views:<br><br>"After
               reading the report of the three youth suicides, I felt very sad. They 
              had so much ahead of them -- they just needed to clear the stumbling 
              blocks that were in their path instead of stopping their journey through
               life.<br><br>"The Samaritans of Singapore (SOS) has asked that a 
              suicide prevention programme be put in place in schools here. I agree. 
              We focus too much on grades until we forget to cater to the human 
              element.<br><br>"Besides, grades are not everything. Look at Facebook 
              co-founder Mark Zuckerberg. He's a Havard dropout, but look what he is 
              now? He's wealthy and successful at the age of 27.<br><br>"How about 
              Bill Gates? He's the world's most famous school dropout, and one of the 
              world's most wealthiest people. He, too, left Havard to work on his 
              start-up company, which is now Microsoft.<br><br>"Then you have Steve 
              Jobs who dropped out of Reed College just after six months because it 
              was a big financial burden on his working-class parents. If not for him,
               we wouldn't have iPhones and iPads and other Apple products!<br><br>"So
               people, don't think taking your own life is the solution to all of your
               problems. Work around your problems, and you will become stronger. Seek
               help if you need, there's nothing embarrassing about needing a helping 
              hand. We are but human.<br><br>"And most importantly, cherish your lives. You're young! You have much to live for! You have so many things to do and to see!"</p>
