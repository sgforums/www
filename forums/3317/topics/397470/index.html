              <p>Reports of priests raping or abusing minors have now emerged in
                                      Brazil, Bolivia, Uruguay, Mexico and Chile causing growing anger in
                                      the continent.</p>
              <p>In Brazil an 83-year-old priest was arrested after he was
                                      secretly filmed in bed with a 19-year-old altar boy. The footage
                                      was broadcast on national television which led to the arrest of
                                      Monsignor Luiz Marques Barbosa and two other priests in the state
                                      of Alagoas who are accused of abusing boys as young as 12
                                      yrs-old.</p>
              <p>The Catholic Church in Chile confirmed this week that there have
                                      been 20 alleged or confirmed cases of child abuse by
                                      priests. </p>
              <p>In Uruguay, a priest charged with raping three children in
                                      Bolivia had returned to his homeland and was living openly with
                                      full knowledge of local church officials.</p>
              <p>Juan Jose Santana has been on the run from Bolivian
                                      authorities since May 2008. Asked if allegations that he had abused
                                      children were true, Santana said, "It's true. That's all I can
                                      say... You know something? I'm dead."</p>
              <p>In Mexico, The Legionnaires of Christ, a shadowy but
                                      powerful Catholic sect founded by Maciel Degollado. It emerged that
                                      the staunchly conservative theologian had a series of sexual
                                      affairs with MEN, women and BOYS in many different parts of the
                                      world.</p>
              <p>The Mexican church has also been drawn into a legal
                                      battle in the United States. A Mexican citizen is suing Catholic
                                      cardinals in Mexico City and Los Angeles, accusing them of
                                      purposely hiding the background of a Mexican priest accused of
                                      sexually abusing dozens of children.</p>

              <p><strong>'Why I kept silent'</strong></p>
              <p>DUBLIN - ONE of the first whistleblowers in the clerical abuse 
              scandal which has shaken the Catholic Church in Ireland to its 
              foundations can still recall the fear that stalked his wretched 
              childhood.</p>
              <p>Sent to a Church-run school at the age of four, Paddy Doyle was 
              severely abused. It was not until he was 38 that he was able to open up 
              about the horrors he had suffered.</p>
              <p>'For saying anything at all, you would be seriously 
              punished,' he recalls in an AFP interview, when asked why the systematic
               abuse meted out across the predominantly Catholic country was allowed 
              to continue unchecked for so long.</p>
              <p>When his mother died of cancer and his father hanged himself
               in front of him and his two-year-old sister, the Irish justice system 
              in 1955 labelled him as 'not being in possession of a proper guardian'.</p>
              <p>He was sent to the now notorious St Michael's Industrial 
              School, at Cappoquin, County Waterford, south-east Ireland, where he was
               viciously assaulted and sexually abused.</p>
              <p>'They were very serious abusers. We couldn't even dream of 
              speaking out. You could be deprived of food, of any kind of social 
              interaction with other children.</p>
              <p>'So you just went with the way things were. All the children
               were under the age of 10, so it was very difficult.' - AFP</p>
