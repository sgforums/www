              <p>The largest study to date on the potential health effects of mobile 
              phone use concludes that the devices do not increase the risk of brain 
              cancer among average cell phone users.  But it finds a slightly greater 
              risk of cancer among heavy users.  <br><br>The massive international 
              research project, conducted by the World Health Organization's 
              Interphone Study Group, surveyed more than 13,000 mobile phone users in 
              13 countries over the past decade.  Overall, members of the panel 
              concluded that radio-frequency energy emitted by mobile phones does not 
              increase the risk of the two main types of brain tumors, glioma and 
              meningioma. <br> <br>However, when researchers looked at the 10 percent 
              of subjects who identified themselves as heavy users, they found a 40 
              percent increased risk of glioma.  Heavy users included those who talked
               on a mobile phone for at least a-half hour a day, seven days a week, 
              for ten years.<br><br>But panel member Daniel Kewski, of the Center for 
              Population Health Risk Assessment at the University of Ottawa in Canada,
               says the group was unable to prove that heavy mobile phone use 
              increased the risk of cancer because the findings were based on the 
              sketchy memories of some participants.<br><br>"If we asked you to be a 
              participant, we would sit down with you and ask you to try and remember 
              every cell phone that you had used in your entire life," said Daniel 
              Kewski. "And then we would ask you how many times a day you made phone 
              calls, and how long you were on the phone for each of those calls on 
              average.  So your recall of your cell phone utilization patterns may not
               be perfect."<br><br>Kewski says the remaining 90 percent of mobile 
              phone users were on the device an average of two to two-and-a-half hours
               per month.<br><br>Otis Brawley, chief medical and scientific officer of
               the American Cancer Society, says there is little evidence that even 
              heavy cell phone use causes a significant increase in brain cancer.  And
               if it did, says Brawley, the problem would be dwarfed by other more 
              serious public health concerns:<br><br>"If you use the worst case 
              studies that we have to date, it's about 300 additional brain tumors per
               year in the United States," said Otis Brawley. "Compare that with the 
              fact that we have definite data to show that 3,000 deaths are caused by 
              auto accidents due to cell phones in the United States every year."<br><br>Panel
               member Jack Siemiatycki, a professor of environmental epidemiology at 
              the University of Montreal agrees, saying there is no reason for 
              unnecessary panic or concern among average cell phone users.<br><br>"For
               people who are heavy duty users, who really do use 1,000 minutes a 
              month or 2,000 minutes a month, or something like that, then you are 
              getting into a zone where we may have seen a risk," said Jack 
              Siemiatycki.<br><br>In that case, Siemiatycki says, users should 
              consider operating their mobile phones without holding them to their 
              ears by using wired earplugs or by using a wireless Bluetooth device, 
              which emits less radio frequency energy than the mobile phone's 
              electronics.<br><br>Christopher Wild is director for the International 
              Agency for Research on Cancer based in Geneva:<br> <br>Wild says the 
              Interphone Study Group will convene a meeting next year to review data 
              from all studies that have been conducted looking at cell phone use to 
              see whether the devices increase the risk of brain cancer among heavy 
              users.<br><br>"We need to look in more depth at that finding in the 
              context of all the other information that's available to us before we 
              are confident to conclude that there's no associated risk," said 
              Christopher Wild.<br><br>The paper by the Interphone Study Group on 
              mobile phone use and the risk of brain cancer was published in the <em>International
               Journal of Epidemiology. </em></p>
