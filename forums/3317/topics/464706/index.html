              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Since the government launched the Baby Bonus scheme 
              in 2001, it has disbursed more than S$2.3 billion in benefits. This 
              includes a cash gift and the Child Development Account -- a scheme where
               the government matches savings for children, dollar-for-dollar.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The Chinese consider
               the year of the Dragon, an auspicious year to have children. 
              Noticeably, there were more births in Singapore between January and 
              November 2012, compared to the same period in 2011. 38,914 babies were 
              born in the first 11 months of 2012, and it looks like the numbers will 
              exceed the preceding year.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Still, Singapore's total fertility rate (TFR) remains at a low 1.2, well below the replacement rate of 2.1.<br><br>Various
               measures have been introduced in an attempt to raise the TFR -- like 
              cash gifts under the Baby Bonus scheme, which have been given to over 
              310,000 children since it was introduced in 2001.<br><br>More than 
              240,000 children have also opened the Child Development Account -- a 
              savings account for children up to 12 years of age, which enjoys 
              dollar-for-dollar matching from the government. The money can be used to
               pay for childcare centre fees, early intervention programmes or 
              medical-related expenses, among other things.<br><br>The government is expected to announce enhancements to the Baby Bonus under its marriage and parenthood package.<br><br>However, family experts Channel NewsAsia spoke with said money is not everything.<br><br>Associate
               Professor Paulin Straughan, a sociologist with the National University 
              of Singapore, said: "From the population demographic statistics, we can 
              see where the adjustments have come -- delayed marriage, smaller family 
              sizes.<br><br>"Moving forward, the question is then are we happy with 
              this -- to allow individuals to continue to make adjustments to the 
              constraints in our living environment? Can the nation sustain with these
               kind of population trajectories or is it time for us then to re-look 
              the environmental constraints? To see if we can adjust those so that 
              individuals don't have to tilt their balance too much."<br><br>Environmental
               constraints include long working hours, a competitive education system,
               the availability of accessible childcare and Singaporeans' expectations
               in general.<br><br>The government is already addressing some of these 
              issues -- for example, putting less stress on the education system. 
              There are also plans to make it easier for young families to set up 
              their first home.<br><br>James Chan, a father of one, said: "I believe 
              because of lifestyle, because of the rising cost -- cost is rising in 
              Singapore, so everybody thinks it's not easy to set up a family. Time, 
              childcare centres not being easily available at certain places.<br><br>Iqbal
               Zainal, a 25-year-old operations executive, said: "For us, we are in 
              the mid-20s, we still want to do what we want after education, like 
              travel and stuff. Even if couples get married, they want to stay 
              together and travel and do what they want to do together without a 
              child. Just make having kids cool or something. For now, having it in 
              the early 20s is not cool."<br><br>It is the mindset change that experts said is hard to overcome.<br><br>Professor
               Gavin Jones, director at the JY Pillay Comparative Asia Research 
              Centre, said: "This is a country that succeeded by its own hard work -- 
              no natural resources, it has developed its own human resources. We've 
              got to be able to compete in the world and all these feeds in towards 
              the attitude to education of children, the children has to succeed.<br><br>"Maybe
               the whole mystique has to be slightly changed, to give a little bit 
              less precedence to economic growth. There are trade-offs and slower 
              economic growth is dangerous for a country like Singapore in some ways, 
              but rapid economic growth is going to lead to significant population 
              decline and that is also not something that's desirable."<br><br>The 
              government has set a target of raising the total fertility rate from 1.2
               to 1.4 or 1.5 -- a target which experts said is quite possible with the
               right mix of policies. But that is still way below the replacement rate
               of 2.1. Given that reality, experts said the only way to make up for 
              the shortfall is through immigration.<br><br>-CNA/ac</span></span></p>
