              <p id="articlecontent"><span>SINGAPORE: Singapore has won its first gold medal at the inaugural Asian Youth Games (AYG), and achieving that feat was bowler New Hui Fen in the girls' singles event. <br><br>The 16-year-old Sports School student recently won the Malaysian Open Girls' Masters Championship, and she continued her winning ways at the AYG, scoring 1,359 pinfalls in total for the gold. <br><br>Japan's Misaki Mukotani won silver with 1314 pinfalls and Korea's Oh Nu Ri took the bronze with a score of 1308 pinfalls. <br><br>New's win was all the more sweet as the president of Singapore Bowling had pledged S$2,000 and an equal amount was contributed by Orchid Bowl. The competition was held at the Orchid Country Club. <br><br>New said: "I just focused on my pre-shot routine and… just concentrated on each frame, and not the whole game itself." <br><br>Community Development, Youth and Sports Minister Vivian Balakrishnan said: "This is great news, we are all very happy with that but I also want to add that the entire Singapore team is doing well. Our sailors are nicely positioned, and the table tennis team… I'm sure (they) will make good progress. I just want all Singaporeans to really come out and support Team Singapore." <br><br>And Team Singapore's bowlers are expected to add to the medal tally over the next few days of competition. <br><br>Hong Kong also won its first gold, when Michael Mak topped the boys' singles with a total of 1,396 pinfalls. South Korea's Park Ji-Soo was second with 1381, while his compatriot Hwang Dong-jun took the bronze. <br><br>- CNA</span></p>

              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Singapore has won its first medals in the Asian Youth Games, athletics arena, at the Bishan Stadium.
              <br> <br> Pole vaulter Shawn Lim Ziqing and long jumper Melissa Wu both grabbed bronze medals in their events on Tuesday.
              <br> <br> Lim was third behind Taiwan's Chi Chien Hao and Japan's gold medallist
              Sho Hibasa. He cleared a height of 4.3 metres and lost the silver on a
              count back.
              <br> <br>Wu claimed bronze after jumping a distance of 4.94 metres. Qatar's
              Peyma Alen Thomas won silver with 5.06 metres, while Thai athlete
              Pennatta Tantragool clinched the gold medal with a distance of 5.58
              metres.

              <p><strong>Asian Youth Games: Beached by inexperience</strong></p>
              <p class="first">SINGAPORE: It was hardly perfect weather for a day at the beach on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>The sun stayed hidden for the most part over Sentosa, on the first
              day of the Asian Youth Games beach volleyball competition, and the
              heavens opened for a brief while in the late morning, just enough to
              harden the usually soft white sands of Siloso Beach.</p>
              <p>But that did
              little to help Mongolian duo Nomio Ragchaabazar and Namuun Altansukh,
              who played their first match just before noon and went down 21—13, 21—7
              to Singapore’s Tan Yi Ting and Dorita Peng.</p>
              <p>Despite the defeat,
              the Mongolian girls were all smiles as they posed for pictures with
              17—year—old Dorita and 16—year—old Yi Ting and soaked up the atmosphere.</p>
              <p>"This is our first competitive beach volleyball game," said Nomio.</p>
              <p>"Playing volleyball on sand is different and we were a bit nervous.</p>
              <p>"The Singapore team was too strong, but we hope to do better in our next match."</p>
              <p>There
              are no beaches in landlocked Mongolia, and the inexperience of
              17—year—olds Nomio and Namuun showed against the more seasoned Yi Ting
              and Dorita.</p>
              <p>Last year, the Singaporean pair won the inter—school beach volleyball competition for Presbyterian High School.</p>
              <p>The Mongolians did give the local favourites an early scare when they took a 3—1 lead.</p>
              <p>But after drawing level at 7—7, Yi Ting and Dorita never looked back.</p>
              <p>"We
              were nervous initially, but we managed to calm down when we took the
              lead," said Singapore’s No 1 Yi Ting, who credited the victory to good
              communication.</p>
              <p>Indeed, the duo’s voices reverberated around centre court at Siloso as they shouted instructions to each other.</p>
              <p>They face Kazakhstan at 10am on Thursday in a battle for top spot in Group G.</p>
              <p>But
              the competition is over for Nomio and Namuun, who were beaten 21—10,
              21—7 by Kazakhstan in their second game on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile,
              the Republic’s boys’ team of Qing Shan and Melvin Goh bounced back from
              an opening 21—17, 21—14 loss to Sri Lanka to beat Japan 21—14, 21—18
              later in the day in Group B action.</p>
              <p>They face Saudi Arabia on Thursday at 11am needing a win to qualify for the knock—out stages.</p>

              <p><strong>Chairman of 2012 London Olympics in Singapore for AYG</strong></p>
              <p class="first">SINGAPORE: The chairman of the 2012 London Olympics said the global financial crisis has had no impact on its preparations.</p>
              <p>Sebastian Coe, who is in Singapore for the inaugural Asian Youth
              Games, told Channel NewsAsia on Thursday that plans for the London
              Games are on track.</p>
              <p>Almost four years ago in Singapore, London
              won the right to host the 2012 Olympics and Coe, a double Olympic
              champion, was instrumental in helping the city clinch victory.</p>
              <p>The
              London Games’ chief said: "We’ve raised more money than any other host
              city at this point. The economic downturn, which is always going to be
              a challenge for everybody, has so far not really affected us.</p>
              <p>"That’s
              in large part due firstly to early planning, secondly to the quality
              and strength of the Olympic brand because people are investing in the
              Olympic Games as sponsors. They understand the vision behind the Games
              and that’s very powerful for us.</p>
              <p>"We’ve set ourselves a target of about 680 million pounds. We are in and around the 500—million mark, with three years to go."</p>
              <p>Coe also said Asia’s emergence as a world superpower is important in promoting sports.</p>
              <p>"I
              suppose the process really began in 1988, in Seoul, with the Olympic
              and Paralympic Games, and Asia has built on that. The Beijing Games was
              a seismic jump forward and the Games itself was the largest, most
              impactful Games of all time — in television numbers, in terms of
              medals, the number of women competing, the number of national Olympic
              committees," he said.</p>
              <p>While in Singapore, Coe and his team will
              update the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA), which is a sporting body that
              controls all sports in Asia, on the progress of preparations for the
              2012 Olympics.</p>
              <p>On a separate note, Coe said he is impressed by
              Singapore’s staging of the Asian Youth Games and believes the Republic
              is already a destination for major sporting events.</p>
              <p>"If a city, a
              country, is prepared to invest in events, it also means they understand
              there is a commitment beyond those events to other things that happen
              in sports," he said.</p>
              <p>"I went to the track and field championships
              yesterday and thought they were remarkably organised. All the events
              went off on time, there were good facilities, good warm—up areas.
              Clearly, a lot of thought had gone into recognising that the athletes
              are the most important part of this whole process."</p>

              <p><strong>Asian Youth Games: China dominate track and field</strong></p>
              <p class="first">SINGAPORE: They are the biggest rivals on the Asian
              stage. Over recent years though, China have clearly become the leading
              nation in sport, with Japan battling it out with South Korea behind it.</p>
              <p>The inaugural Asian Youth Games here is no different, with the
              Chinese leading the overall tally with 13 gold medals, nine more than
              Japan and 10 more than South Korea.</p>
              <p>The track and field
              competition began on Tuesday, with 18 gold medals up for grabs in the
              first three days of competition. To date, China have plundered seven
              gold medals at Bishan Stadium.</p>
              <p>In the nine events on Thursday,
              Chinese featured in five of them, and they won all five gold medals.
              Their boys won the 110m hurdles, 400m hurdles and long jump, while the
              girls bagged gold in the discus and 400m hurdles.</p>
              <p>Not one of the Chinese winners on Thursday took their success for granted.</p>
              <p>"A
              lot of the athletes here have shown that they have good potential. I
              can’t say for sure that China will dominate the athletics programme
              tomorrow, but all of us will definitely try our best," said Cheng
              Yafan, winner of the 400m hurdles for girls in a time of 1 minute 2.15
              seconds.</p>
              <p>Huang Haibing, who took the long jump (boys) gold with a
              leap of 7.28 metres, added: "It looks like Japan will be our closest
              challengers."</p>
              <p>Japanese athletes won the boys’ 400m and girls’
              100m hurdles. So far, they have won three golds in athletics entering
              the final day of track and field today.</p>
              <p>Singapore’s Inez Leong
              came in third in the girls’ 100m hurdles, making it three bronze medals
              for the hosts on the penultimate day of athletics.</p>

              <p><strong>Asian Youth Games: Swimmer Quah Ting Wen clinches 4th gold for Singapore</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Singapore won its fourth gold at the Asian Youth Games
              on Friday. Swimmer Quah Ting Wen, 16, clinched the gold for Singapore
              when she came out tops in the Girls' 200-metre freestyle.
              <br> <br> Quah trailed her Korean opponent for 150 metres before pulling ahead towards the end to finish with a timing of 1:59.21 minutes.
              <br> <br>Following closely behind her was Korea's Kim Junghye who clinched
              the silver medal with a timing of 1:59.93 minutes. Kim's fellow
              countrywoman, Kim Seoyeong, took the bronze medal with a timing of
              2:01.92 minutes.
              <br> <br> Singapore also bagged five bronze medals on Friday - three from swimming, one from athletics and another from table tennis.
              <br> <br>Two of the bronzes came from the 50-metre breaststroke in both the
              Boys' and Girls' events. They were won by Lionel Khoo and Roanne Ho
              respectively.
              <br> <br> The third bronze came from Rainer Ng Kai Wee in the Boys' 100-metre backstroke.
              <br> <br>Singapore's fourth bronze of the day was won by the boys in the
              4x100-metre freestyle relay when they came in fourth in the event.
              <br> <br> Singapore also bagged a bronze from the mixed table-tennis team, after losing to China in the semifinals.
              <br> <br> China was just too strong for Team Singapore in the match played at the Toa Payoh Sports Hall.
              <br> <br>China's Chen Meng whipped Isabelle Li in straight sets, winning
              3-0. However Clarence Chew salvaged some pride for Singapore by winning
              one set although he eventually lost 1-3 to Cheng Jing Qi.
              <br> <br> Despite the defeat, the Singapore players were happy with their performance. 
              <br> <br> Clarence said: "Playing against China, there's no pressure for me. So I gave it all out."
              <br> <br> Isabelle said: "Overall I think I played quite well. But I think I attacked too much at the end."
              <br> <br> The other bronze in the event went to Chinese Taipei players who lost to North Korea.

              <p><strong>Asian Youth Games: Fina presidential hopeful Maglione impressed</strong></p>
              <p id="articlecontent"><span>SINGAPORE: It was a brief three-day stop, but the man who could be the next chief of swimming left the Republic impressed.
              <br> <br> Fina honorary treasurer Julio Cesar Maglione (picture), who is running
              for the presidency at the federation's general congress in Rome on July
              24, was struck by the way the inaugural Asian Youth Games had been
              organised, particularly the swimming competition.
              <br> <br>"All the necessary facilities needed for an excellent championship
              are here," Dr Maglione, 73, told Today during Friday's swimming
              competition at the Singapore Sports School. "And it helps that the
              standard of competition has been very good. I enjoyed every single race
              I saw (over the past two days)."
              <br> <br>Dr Maglione, who is also Uruguay's International Olympic Committee
              member, is set to replace outgoing Fina chief Mustapha Larfaoui as he
              is the sole candidate so far. "If I become Fina president, my goal is
              to help promote all five disciplines of aquatics" he said.
              <br> <br> "Fina has 204 affiliates, and it is important to support youth development across the five disciplines." </span></p>

              <p><strong>Asian Youth Games: Table tennis team through to semi-finals in mixed team event</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : Buoyed by the cheers of a 500-strong crowd -
              including 200 schoolmates from the Singapore Sports School - the
              Republic's table tennis team of Clarence Chew, Tay Jit Kiat, Isabelle
              Li and Chau Haiqing went through to the semi-finals in the mixed team
              event at the inaugural Asian Youth Games on Friday. <br> <br> Clarence and Isabelle combined to dispatch fifth seeded India 3-0 in
              the morning, but unfortunately, the hosts met the world's leading table
              tennis nation China in the last four. <br> <br> The top seeds posted a clinical 2-0 win over Singapore who, along with
              Taiwan, collected bronze as the rules stipulated no play-off for third
              place. <br> <br> While China battle North Korea in Sunday's final, the big task for the
              Singapore team will be preparing for next year's Youth Olympic Games,
              which will be held here from Aug 14-26. <br> <br> Coach Xu Xiangdong believes the team is in good shape.  
              <br> <br> "Over the past two days, I've been happy with their mental development
              and they're doing very well," he said. "Especially with them playing
              such a big competition on home soil, there's definitely pressure, but
              they've dealt with it well. <br> <br> "This will help the team in the Youth Olympics, as it gives them
              big-match experience. It's good training for them, and will help in
              their development as players." </span></p>

              <p><strong>Asian Youth Games: Crowd helps Singapore swimmer post thrilling win</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : If Singapore swim star Quah Ting Wen goes on to
              dominate the Asian Youth Games swimming competition, she will have to
              thank the crowd at the Singapore Sports School for playing their part. <br> <br> On Friday, the 17-year-old grabbed her first gold medal in a thrilling win.   
              <br> <br> She came from behind to clinch the girls' 200m freestyle gold with a
              new national record of 1:59.21s, breaking her previous national mark of
              2:00.14 set three weeks ago at the Singapore National Swimming
              Championship. <br> <br> South Korea's Kim Jung Hye (1:59.93) and Kim Seo Yeong (2:01.92) had to settle for silver and bronze, respectively.  
              <br> <br> Ting Wen's gold capped a fruitful outing for the hosts in the pool,
              after three bronze medals from Lionel Khoo (boys' 50m breaststroke),
              Roanne Ho (girls' 50m breaststroke) and Rainer Ng (boys' 100m
              backstroke). <br> <br> Feeding off the crowd  Ting Wen, the holder of four individual national records, trailed Jung Hye for two-thirds of the race.  
              <br> <br> But by the 150m mark, she had caught up to within 0.01s of the Korean,
              hitting the final turn at 1:28.88 to set up a thrilling finale in front
              of nearly 1,000 spectators. <br> <br> "A lot was going through my mind (in the final 50m)," said Ting Wen.   
              <br> <br> "To my left, I could see my team-mates, to my right, I could see the
              spectators. All that pushed me to go as fast as I could. It's a load
              off my shoulders now as it was a big event for me." <br> <br> Former Singapore backstroke star David Lim, her coach at Swimfast Aquatic Club, was never in any doubt.  
              <br> <br> "At the Singapore National Championships recently, she went out too
              fast and didn't have enough gas on the return," said Lim, who expects
              this result to improve Ting Wen's current world No 56 ranking. <br> <br> "So my instructions was for her to save herself in the first 100m, and
              kick-in the last 50. And it was made easier as she is the type who
              follows instructions." <br> <br> Ting Wen leaves for Rome on July 20 for the Fina World Championship,
              where she will compete in the 50m, 100m, 200m and 400m freestyle
              events. <br> <br> But before that, she has some work to do here, with more events for her.  
              <br> <br> Ting Wen, who will race in the girls' 50m freestyle heats on Saturday,
              said: "Winning my first gold medal at the Asian Youth Games means a lot
              to me. It's just amazing." </span></p>

              <p><strong>Asian Youth Games: Japan's Masaki gets his gold, and toy</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : Shahrir Mohd Anuar shot off the starting block less
              than two-hundredths of a second after the starter's pistol went,
              fractionally faster than Japan's Masaki Nashimoto. <br> <br> But that was the only time the 16-year-old was in front of the Japanese in the Asian Youth Games boys' 100m Final on Friday.   
              <br> <br> Just as he promised, Masaki burned rubber as he roared down the Bishan
              Stadium straight, hitting the tape ahead of the rest of the field to
              bag the gold medal in 10.82sec. <br> <br> Thailand's Kittisak Phiraksa clocked 11.11s to pip Shahrir for the
              silver, with the Singaporean posting a time of 11.13s. The Hunabashi
              City High School student drowned out the "Shahrir, Shahrir" chant from
              the 2,000-strong partisan crowd, going faster than his qualifying time
              of 10.89s to take home the Games' most coveted individual medal and the
              Frasia soft toy (the Games mascot) he had promised his girlfriend. <br> <br> While 15-year-old Masaki's race went according plan, the same could not
              be said of Shahrir. The Singapore Sports School student looked sluggish
              in the first 20 metres, then picked up the pace but just when it seemed
              he would finish behind the Japanese, he let silver slip. <br> <br> "If there's one thing I regret, it's not seeing the Thai boy catching
              up at the end of the race," he said. "I prefer to be at the back in the
              first 20m, then to catch up at the 60m mark, but I probably should have
              driven harder at the start. That's probably why I couldn't catch up
              with Masaki." <br> <br> Failed tactics aside, he admitted that he was struck by a bout of nerves.  
              <br> <br> "For the first time, I felt tense and a bit stressed before a race.
              Maybe it's because I was running on home soil, where there's a natural
              pressure to do well," he said. "At the start, the crowd was a bit
              distracting, but I have to say they were fantastic and I felt sorry
              that I had to block them out." <br> <br> Whatever the reason, Shahrir's time in the final fell way short of his
              personal best of 10.90s. Asked if his runner had the mental toughness
              to become a top sprinter, coach Remy Gan only had one word:
              "Definitely." <br> <br> Masaki has already promised his girlfriend a soft toy from next year's
              Youth Olympics, which Singapore will host from Aug 14-26. He wants gold
              again. <br> <br> Singapore's hope Shahrir will meet him again, along with sprinters from
              the rest of the world. He has about a year to get his gameplan right. </span></p>

              <p><strong>Asian Youth Games: Singapore secures gold, silver in sailing</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Singapore added a fifth gold medal to its tally at the Asian Youth Games on Sunday.
              <br> <br> The latest gold came from sailing, courtesy of 15-year-old Sports School student, Darren Choy.
              <br> <br> Getting off to a good start from race one, Choy maintained his lead for 9 races in the Boys' Byte CII Class event.
              <br> <br> And he topped race 10 on Sunday, giving him the title, with a race to spare.
              <br> <br> Choy has collected 10 points after 10 races, making him beyond the reach of his 
              <br> second-placed opponent from Thailand.
              <br> <br> Meanwhile, Singapore's Najwa Jumali, competing in the Girls' Byte CII
              Class, secured a silver, with race 11 to compete on Monday.
              <br> <br> Home ground advantage was a factor in the Singapore sailors' good performances.
              <br> <br>Choy said: "Basically, it's just consistency and knowing the course
              well, which I have known for five years. The main thing for me is boat
              technique. All you need for this regatta is boat speed. (You) don't
              really need to think so much, the race is very straight forward."

              <p><strong>Asian Youth Games: Singapore misses bronze medal in table tennis</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Singapore came close to winning a bronze in table tennis on Sunday.
              <br> <br> But Isabelle Li lost in the quarter-finals of the girls' singles event.
              <br> <br> Li, who had helped Singapore win a bronze in the mixed table tennis
              team event, was hoping for a second bronze when she took on North
              Korea's Kim Song I.
              <br> <br> The match was tied 3-3 before the Korean went on to win the final set 11-7.
              <br> <br>If Li had gone on to the semi-finals, she would have been assured
              of a bronze as there is no play-off for third spot in table tennis.

              <p><strong>AYG: Thais storm Siloso for golden double</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Before the heavens opened to unleash a torrent on
              Sunday afternoon, Thailand let loose a red and blue storm of their own
              on Kazakhstan at the Asian Youth Games beach volleyball competition.
              <br> <br>Both the boys' and girls' finals at Sentosa's Siloso Beach pitted
              Thais against Kazakhs, and the Southeast Asian nation took gold in both
              categories with dominating performances that won the crowd over.
              <br> <br>Kitted out in red tops, the Thai girls' Aunchalee Yunsuwan and
              Prateep Kambut triumphed 21-14, 21-12 over Bakhtygul Samalikova and
              Lyubov Bogatu, who seemed cowered by their opponents' war-cries, which
              came after each point won.
              <br> <br>Thosapol Puangprasert and Warut Prasanok, who wore blue, also won
              the boys final in two sets, 21-19, 21-10 over Vladislav Pustynnikov and
              Sergey Bogatu.
              <br> <br> The Thai proved too tricky at the net, alternating between intelligent dinks and lobs, and powerful spikes.
              <br> <br>Said Thai girls' gold medallist Prateep: "Our target was to make
              the final, that's why we were very tense in the semi-finals, but just
              now in the final, we were very relaxed and enjoyed it."
              <br> <br>Chinese duo Chen Chunxia and Lu Yuanyuan took the girls' bronze,
              while Indonesia's Gede Eka Augustiawan and Ade Chandra Rachmawan bagged
              the bronze in the boys' division. </span></p>
