              <br> <br> She topped the girls' 100m freestyle finals in 55.57 seconds to clinch
              her third gold in the Games, after the two golds won in the 200-metre

              <p><strong>AYG: Singapore's sailing gets thumbs-up</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: SingaporeSailing president Low Teo Ping said on Monday
              the performance of the local sailors and the progress of the
              competition off East Coast Park at the Asian Youth Games was good
              enough to obtain a grade "close to an 'A'".
              <br> <br>So pleased was he with the event he claimed the sailing team and
              overall facilities would be ready for the Youth Olympic Games, if it
              were held today.
              <br> <br>The Republic's sailors bagged one gold, one silver and one bronze
              in four events and Low attributed the success to the association's
              youth development programme.
              <br> <br>"This is a space we're comfortable with because of the way we have
              structured the whole broadbase development pipeline leading into the
              Olympic classes.
              <br> <br> "We believe we can host the Youth Olympics tomorrow and participate in it, if we have to," he said.
              <br> <br>Darren Choy and Najwa Jumali took home the boys' and girls' Byte
              CII gold and silver medals respectively at the Asian Youth Games, while
              Audrey Yong won a bronze in the girls' Bic Techno 293.
              <br> <br>It is understood that as one of the 26 sports in the Youth
              Olympics, sailing will receive an initial grant of about $100,000 from
              the Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports to help prepare
              their athletes for next year's Games, which Singapore will host from
              August 14-26.
              <br> <br>But there will be no tailor-made programme for the likes of Darren,
              who will have to battle 14 other sailors for a spot in next year's
              team. <br> <br> Said Andrew Sanders, SingaporeSailing's chief executive officer: "Our
              principle is we coach the many, and not the few. We never put all our
              eggs in one basket." </span></p>

              <p><strong>Asian Youth Games: Team Singapore medallists to receive monetary bonus</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Team Singapore's medallists at the Asian Youth Games
              will receive a monetary bonus for their successful performances at the
              event.
              <br> <br>Just before the closing ceremony at the Games Village yesterday,
              the Singapore National Olympic Council (SNOC) announced that the
              athletes are likely to be rewarded via an incentive scheme. <br> <br> "We are talking to potential sponsors and are thinking about putting
              the money into an endowment fund for the athletes," said SNOC
              secretary-general Chris Chan. "We hope to announce it over the next few
              days."
              <br> <br>The money will not come from the current Multi-Million Dollar
              Awards Programme, which is sponsored by the Tote Board and Singapore
              Pools and gives cash payouts to athletes who win medals at the
              Olympics, Asian Games, Commonwealth Games and SEA Games.
              <br> <br>The Republic's 90 athletes competed in aquatics (swimming and
              diving), athletics, football, 3-on-3 basketball, beach volleyball,
              bowling, shooting, sailing and table tennis at the Games, winning nine
              gold, six silver and 15 bronze medals in six sports.
              <br> <br>The swimmers were the top performers at the nine-day event with
              five golds, two silvers and five bronzes. Six national and nine
              under-17 records were set, and 36 personal bests were posted.
              <br> <br>Singapore's bowlers won three gold, two silver and two bronze
              medals, followed by sailing (1-1-1), athletics (4 bronze), shooting (1
              bronze) and table tennis (1 bronze). <br> <br> The Republic finished fourth on the medal table, behind China (25
              gold), South Korea (20) and Thailand (11), but Team Singapore
              chef-de-mission Lee Wung Yew warned against complacency.
              <br> <br>"Singapore's medal standing is not a true reflection (of our
              standing in Asia) as Malaysia did not send a full squad and they are a
              force in bowling," he said. <br> <br> "The Japanese also did not send quite a few of their top athletes in
              swimming. That gave us the opportunity to shine. But looking at the
              performance of the athletes, it shows our potential to reach higher
              standards."
              <br> <br> The Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) gave the organising committee a glowing report card.
              <br> <br>"It was a fantastic Games, not only for the athletes, but the
              atmosphere was great," said Timothy Fok, OCA's vice-president for East
              Asia. <br> <br> "They had only one year to prepare, so it wasn't a walk, but a sprint.
              Health issues (H1N1) factored very much in the preparations and created
              tremendous stress for the organising committee, but they did well."
              <br> <br>Touted as a test event ahead of next year's Youth Olympics - which
              Singapore will host from Aug 14-26 - these Games was hosted at a cost
              of $15 million, with S$8.4 million raised through sponsorship. Over
              1,400 athletes from 43 National Olympic Committees took part.
              <br> <br>Issues such as poor ticket sales, website updates, event
              information and volunteers' training will be ironed out in time for the
              Youth Olympics, organisers promised.

              <p><strong>Asian Youth Games: Ting Wen shines bright</strong></p>
              <p class="first">SINGAPORE: With the nineâday Asian Youth Games done
              and dusted, Singaporeâs final medal haul from its 90âstrong athlete
              contingent is nine gold, six silver and 15 bronze medals.</p>
              <p>The hostsâ brightest star was Quah Ting Wen, who accounted for five medals â four gold and a bronze.</p>
              <p>On
              Tuesday night, the 16âyearâold was recognised for the big splash she
              created at the Singapore Sports School pool when she was presented with
              the Most Valuable Player (Girls) award at the closing ceremony, held at
              the Games Village at Swissotel the Stamford.</p>
              <p>South Korean swimmer Chang Gyu Cheol, 17, bagged the male prize after also winning four golds.</p>
              <p>"Iâm
              really surprised," said the 1.74mâtall Ting Wen, who turns 17 on Aug
              18. "I really exceeded my expectations. Iâve done my best times, which
              was what I set out to do. Iâm really so happy and this is an added
              bonus."</p>
              <p>Ting Wen broke her own national records in the 100m and
              200m freestyle and was part of the 4x100m free relay team that smashed
              the previous mark by almost eight seconds. She also won gold in the 50m
              free.</p>
              <p>Singaporeâs young athletes are set to benefit as sports chiefs explore ways to ensure they do not slip through the net.</p>
              <p>"We
              have to figure out a way to retain and train them, first for the Youth
              Olympics," said Senior Parliamentary Secretary (Community Development,
              Youth and Sports) Teo Ser Luck.</p>
              <p>Each of the National Sports
              Associations (NSA) representing the 26 sports that will feature at next
              yearâs Youth Olympic Games here will receive about $100,000 in funding
              to help prepare their respective athletes and sports, with medal
              potential likely to be given additional funding.</p>
              <p>The Youth Sports Development committee, launched last year with a war chest of $15 million, will play a central role.</p>
              <p>Said
              Teo: "This jointâcommittee will work on the effort of tying up between
              the SSC, NSAs and schools to come together and develop a programme
              around the athletes to enable them to train with a more flexible
              academic curriculum."</p>
              <p>Addressing the issue of National Service
              for the male athletes, Teo said: "Beyond the Youth Olympics, we hope to
              have Mindefâs support as well. If any of the athletes have been
              identified for the Olympic Pathway Programme, then weâll have to see if
              they can go into Mindefâs sportsman scheme."</p>
              <p>While the Singapore
              National Olympic Council announced plans to reward the Gamesâ
              successful athletes monetarily, Ting Wen feels support in areas like
              sports medicine and science is also crucial. She said: "Going overseas
              for meets and seeing the sports science, especially in the US and
              Australia, I feel that can be improved to better help younger swimmers."</p>
              <p>Ting
              Wenâs longâterm goal is the 2012 Olympics, where she will probably meet
              Suwonâborn Gyu Cheol, who is aiming to compete at the London Games.</p>
              <p>Speaking
              via a translator, he said: "I couldnât imagine my good results before
              coming here. Before coming here, I trained a lot. It is the best way to
              get good results. I ate right and was disciplined and it also helped. I
              want to be a great world champion in swimming in the future."</p>

              <p><strong>Over 6,000 gather to celebrate Singapore's success in hosting AYG</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: More than 5,000 volunteers and 1,200 sports officials
              gathered to celebrate Singapore's successful hosting of the inaugural
              Asian Youth Games (AYG), which ended on Tuesday.
              <br> <br>The event at the Singapore Indoor Stadium on Friday evening was
              graced by Mr Teo Chee Hean, Deputy Prime Minister and President of the
              Singapore National Olympic Council.
              <br> <br>Mr Teo said the Games were not perfect but Singapore did well. He
              said 1,400 athletes were here for the AYG, and 3,600 are expected for
              the first Youth Olympic Games next year.
              <br> <br> Hence, a lot more work needs to be done, especially the training of more volunteers.
              <br> <br>Mr Teo said the AYG brought a wonderful challenge to Singapore, and
              the experience showed that when there is a challenge, the country can
              rise to it.
              <br> <br>Oon Jin Teik, chief executive officer of the Singapore Sports
              Council, said: "The workforce volunteers form a critical backbone to
              whatever we do and many of them would ideally have had years of
              training before the events. <br> <br> "But I think with their own personal background, their passion and
              their inherent knowledge of what to do right, we pulled off an event
              within a very short time, with a very small budget."

              <p><strong>Teo Ser Luck says AYG a success despite problems faced</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Community
              Development, Youth and Sports, Teo Ser Luck, has given the Asian Youth
              Games' organising committee an "A" grade. <br> <br> Speaking at the sidelines of a youth award event on Monday, he told
              reporters that the event was a success despite the problems faced. <br> <br> The Asian Youth Games may have opened with a bang, but it was plagued with several problems from the start.
              <br> <br> Criticism erupted over poor ticketing promotion and last minute
              scheduling changes, amid complaints about events held in half-empty
              venues.
              <br> <br>There were also initial doubts whether the Games would go on as
              scheduled, as the H1N1 virus hit the Philippine and Hong Kong football
              teams and Malaysia pulled out as a precaution.
              <br> <br> Despite those problems, Mr Teo said the organising committee did their best, given the time and budget constraints.
              <br> <br>While he admitted the committee was not fully prepared, he added
              the Games had always been meant as a testing platform for the Youth
              Olympic Games (YOG) in 2010.
              <br> <br>He said: "Honestly, we did not realise that it can come up to be so
              big, and we also did not realise that it would capture so much
              attention. But nevertheless, putting the hiccups aside, and some of the
              gaps we need to close aside, I think they have done a great job. I
              would give a good 'A' grade."
              <br> <br>On Team Singapore's performance, Mr Teo said the crop of 30 medals
              - comprising nine golds, six silvers and 15 bronzes - confirms the
              Republic can produce local sporting talent.
              <br> <br>Mr Teo said: "Based on the results of our youth athletes, I
              realised that they do have a chance for medals, and five medals were
              originally what I'd forecasted, but they exceeded my expectations."
              <br> <br>Mr Teo added that with growing interest in Singapore's sports
              culture and the work done by the YOG organising committee so far, he is
              confident Singapore will be able to pull off similar events in the
              future. </span></p>
