              <p><strong>CASE, NTUC Income sued by 2 private schools for some S$10m</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: The consumers association CASE and insurance company
              NTUC Income are battling it out with two private schools at the High
              Court. </span></p>
              <p><span>Stansfield College and the Singapore Institute of Commerce, both
              owned by Mr Kannappan Chettiar are claiming CASE wrongfully suspended
              the schools from an accreditation scheme.
              <br> <br> This meant the schools could no longer take in foreign students.
              <br> <br> CASE had said they did this because the schools did not have any insurance for more than 400 foreign students.
              <br> <br>Chairman of the schools, Mr Kannappan Chettiar, said it was
              unreasonable for CASE to suspend the accreditation without an "on-site"
              investigation.
              <br> <br> Mr Kannappan is seeking some S$10 million in damages.
              <br> <br> He will take the stand again on Monday in what is being viewed as a "David versus two Goliaths" case. </span></p>

              <p><strong>Schools’ owner breaks down in court</strong></p>
              <p>SINGAPORE: Students at Stansfield College and the Singapore
              Institute of Commerce had remained uninsured "for months" even though
              staff members knew of this.</p>
              <p>So, the Consumers Association of
              Singapore (CASE) had not wrongfully suspended the two private schools,
              senior counsel Cavinder Bull argued in court on Monday.</p>
              <p>By
              having 479 uninsured students, the schools were in breach of the
              CaseTrust for Education scheme, and as the scheme’s administrator, CASE
              was obliged to inform the public about it, said Mr Bull, who was
              defending CASE against a $10—million suit.</p>
              <p>The schools’
              suspension between Nov 20 and Dec 13 in 2006 was not brought about by
              false rumours that they were facing financial troubles — as contended
              by the schools’ owner Kannappan Chettiar — said the lawyer.</p>
              <p>He
              added that when CASE wrote to the schools, it asked only about the
              discrepancy between the number of student passes issued by the
              immigration authorities and the number of insured students.</p>
              <p>The suspension came a week after, when the schools had not been able to "remedy the situation" despite promising to do so.</p>
              <p>Under
              the lawyer’s cross—examination, on Day Two of the suit against CASE and
              insurer NTUC Income, Mr Chettiar broke down on the stand.</p>
              <p>Mr
              Bull grilled him on his intentions for taking legal action and referred
              to a letter Mr Chettiar had sent out to students, government agencies
              and the press following news about his schools’ suspension — in which
              the businessman said the two organisations were "fully responsible" for
              the errors.</p>
              <p>The lawyer asked if he was "trying to profit" from the mistakes or was bringing about a "frivolous lawsuit".</p>
              <p>When Mr Chettiar disagreed, Mr Bull asked if he was trying to force CASE to apologise through the lawsuit.</p>
              <p>"I have ... I think my ... yes, I want an apology," Mr Chettiar said, before taking out his handkerchief and wiping his tears.</p>
