              <p>One word sums it all for Sun Ho: vanity.</p>
              <p>Does her faith approve it? </p>
              <p>In Christian teachings <em>vanity</em> is considered an example of <a title="Pride" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pride">pride</a>, one of the <a title="Seven deadly sins" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_deadly_sins">seven deadly sins</a>. This list evolved from an earlier list of eight sins, which included <em>vainglory</em> as a sin independent of <em>pride</em>.
               In Orthodox church, vanity is one of eight sinful and diabolical 
              passions, the fight against which is a major task of every Orthodox 
              Christian.</p>
              <p>To have so many millions to spend to fulfill her vanity.  This is desperate.</p>

              <p>How did $23 million help advance singer Ho Yeow Sun's music career in the US?<br> <br> Ho Yeow Sun, 42, popularly known as Sun Ho, is married to Pastor Kong 
              Hee, 45, founder of City Harvest Church. The couple have a 7-year-old 
              son, Dayan.<br> <br> Kong is currently facing charges of alleged misuse 
              of at least $23 million of church funds to finance his wife's singing 
              career in the US.<br> <br> A "Crossover Project", started in 2002 by the
               couple, was set up to use Ho's secular music to connect with people and
               reach out to non-Christians, local media agencies reported.<br> <br> Since news of the charges against Kong and four others broke, two of 
              Ho's music videos for dance tracks "China Wine" and "Mr Bill", have been
               widely circulated on social media.<br> <br> In comments posted on the 
              videos hosted on YouTube, netizens slammed the videos for its content 
              and Ho's provocative dance moves.<br> <br> Many questioned how the controversial videos could be "reaching out to non-Christians".<br> <br> In "China Wine", Ho can be seen gyrating to the music with back-up 
              dancers, dressed in a low-cut, midriff-baring top and micro-shorts.<br> <br> Ho collaborated with noted rapper-producer Wyclef Jean on both singles.<br> <br> The singer was based in the US between 2003 and 2010, reported The New 
              Paper, where five of her English singles released made it into the top 
              10 of Billboard's Hot Dance Club Songs.<br> <br> But according to a Straits Times on Wednesday, doubts were cast that Ho made it just on talent alone.<br> <br> One senior music executive interviewed by the paper said the Billboard dance chart is based on airplay and not sales.<br> <br> "You can just pay to promote yourself to get radio stations to play your songs," said the executive, who remained anonymous.<br> <br> A director of a record label here estimates that it costs between 
              US$300,000 (S$386,000) and US$1 million to produce an album in the US.<br> <br> A collaboration with famed producer Wyclef Jean could cost between US$50,000 and US$300,000.<br> <br> The $23 million that was purportedly used to finance Sun's music career
               not only gave her four No.1 hits on the Billboard dance charts, an 
              English-language album and slick music videos but also a US$20,000 
              (S$25,600) a month Hollywood home.<br> <br> The mansion, nestled in the 
              plush Hollywood Hills district, is where celebrities like Nicky Hilton 
              and singer Leona Lewis have set up home, The New Paper reported. Brad 
              Pitt and Angelina Jolie are also said to own property there.<br> <br> The New Paper visited the house in June 2010 and reported seeing a black
               SUV and a black Mercedes Benz CLK550 driving in and out of the estate, 
              which has four buildings in all.<br> <br> Ho is also known to have uploaded videos of her personal life in the US on her official website.<br> <br> The videos posted included those of her spending time with her 
              five-year-old son Dayan at Manhattan Beach, her relief work in Haiti 
              after the earthquake and picking up US$217 worth of groceries from Whole
               Foods Market, a natural and organic food store.<br> <br> Besides drawing flak for her music videos and lifestyle, Ho was also criticised on many occasions for her fasion sense.<br> <br> In 2010, she was criticised for showing too much skin in a black cut-out Rodarte dress at the Grammy awards.<br> <br> Comments on her dress from online communities ran the spectrum from “bad taste”, “too SM (sadomasochistic)” to “skanky”.<br> <br> In November 2003, she set tongues wagging when she wore a daring red 
              Armani gown – with a plunging neckline – to the Hollywood Film Festival 
              in Los Angeles.<br> <br> At the 2006 Global Music Awards held in 
              Singapore, she was criticised again for turning up in a short grey-black
               dress that barely covered her buttocks.<br>  <br> Ho first entered the music scene in 2002 as a Mandarin artiste, when she released her debut album, Sun With Love.<br> <br> She also won the Singapore Hit Awards in 2003 and 2004 for two of her Mandarin albums, Sun*Day and Lonely Travel.</p>

              <h1>He dared to ask about use of church funds 10 years ago</h1>
              <p>Almost 10 years ago, Mr Roland Poon dared to ask whether City Harvest
               Church was using church funds to fund Ho Yeow Sun's music career.</p>
              <p>The question resulted in him having to make a
               public apology to the church in January 2003. The then-businessman left
               City Harvest soon after.</p>
              <p>Now, the charges filed against five City Harvest church members seem to have vindicated Mr Poon's actions.</p>
              <p>When The Straits Times visited Mr Poon's house on Wednesday evening, 
              his daughter said the 62-year-old was out of town on a mission trip.</p>

                  The more eloquent  some one is  the more we gort to be careful about the person.  He was vile enough to recruit people of low intelligence and discernment to be his kakis...give them a bit of recognition and semblance of power and you've got their undying loyalty....what a vile fella. The very moment they  said his wife made it as a singer  etc I knew something was really wrong...When some one uses God to be his shield to deceive....well there are a lot of gullible people out there  who continuously need affirmation  and assurance from some  kind of leader or so...I always believe if you believe in GOD- speak to him directly- if he answers you -good for you!  But you don't need some two bit  intermediary- if there is a God.

               This is the problem with the Courts..where is the redress? Even in Durai's case  two or more people had been sued by  him earlier and had to apologise  etc...what happened- no redress! If there is no redress and people have to suffer  for being upright and daring to question wrong doing, it iis just bloody unfair!  As i said, why should good people suffer at the hands of vile people without redress???
               With the power of a coporation and the goondu system sometimes even "big guns" supporting them behind them = they persecute  the individuals who saw thro their scam! This is the realism of life - can you blame people sometimes for  simply bochap and walk away ? There must be some justice for people wrongly persecuted!

               The thing about this is that the authorities  tend to look upon this as a "religious " issue/matter and thus a sensitive issue. It ISN"T ! Any logical right thinking individual whether Christian or not will understand this fell a is a scumbag!. It's a   a cult idolisation of a scumbag.
