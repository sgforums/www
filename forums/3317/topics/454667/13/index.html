              <p><br> Yeah, but most people hate christians. Why? Because they claim to
              be the true and happy people. But I hear so many stories of
              politics at church, christians trampling over other downtrodden
              christians. That is why so many people are disillusioned.</p>
              <p>I have counsel so many youths who blindly join their youth
              ministry, then those who are no handsome looking guys, nerdy
              looking girls or guys who have disabilities, are mistreated -
              marginalised during their activities. Its a disgraceful treatment.
              Only those who are children of pastors, handsome guys, pretty
              girls, influential children or children with rich parents are
              treated better.</p>
              <p>At our buddhist counselling center, we try to bring back these
              disenchanted christians and show the path to nirvana is the right
              way.</p>

              <p>In Singapore, proselytizing to people of other religions and openly encouraging conversions to your religion is a sensitive thing.</p>
              <p>I think it MIGHT be acceptable to do it on an individual basis and not target any specific religous group. I don't know what you are doing out there, but when you describe it like in your last paragraph, it sounds out of bounds.</p>

              Clearly his henchmen  were making a din and causing obtruction to the reporters and cameramen disallowing them to carry out their duties. I suggest the police sent in some red squad cars ready to transport  these " misguided henchmen" to Changi or Whitley detention should they  again try their antics.

              <p>How to find goodness? I counsel so many ex-christians and all of them tell me that they initially taught christianity was something enlightening for them, would bring them out of their lull but eventually they were disapponted by they way they were treated by the politics of the church.</p>
              <p>Yes there are a lot of politics in the church. But I do not find anything like this at all in buddhism because we all work for the good of all.</p>
              <p>Aum Shinrikyo has little to do with buddhism, in fact its founder Shoko Asahara, took the roots of christianity, yoga, hinduism to build on his cult.</p>
              <p>You see, all wars are started by the muslims and christians. George Bush who claims to be a devout christian and supports Billy Graham, went on to wage a fake and bloody war on Iraq on the lies that Iraq was developing WMD.</p>

              <p>Hi speakoutfor, sorry but I need to say something here.</p>
              <p>I am a Buddhist. And I feel that what you have written, even though we feel this way, should not be written.</p>
              <p>Buddha says, "Ehi Pasiko". It means, "Come see for yourself. If its good, embrace it, if not, discard it".</p>
              <p>Do not force others to join your belief, but you can tell them the good about it. And do not say bad about others.</p>
              <p>Apologies for this side-tracking.</p>

              20 years ? I doubt the Courts will do that. These days they ar e too lenient to the wrong parties! remember S$1000 dollars for two offences for getting someone to take over the offence as scapegoat?
