                                    <p>City Harvest Church (CHC) started off as a modest Bible study
                                    group of 20 more than two decades ago.</p>
                                    <p>Organised by a fresh-faced National University of Singapore
                                    graduate named Kong Hee in 1989, the church grew rapidly,
                                    converting many young and passionate individuals to the Christian
                                    faith.</p>
                                    <p>At its peak in 2009, the religious group, which by then had been
                                    registered as a charity, could count 33,000 followers.</p>
                                    <p>Many of them would rock the halls of the Singapore Expo where
                                    services were held, repeating the shouts of â€œHallelujah!â€� by Kong,
                                    a proponent of the charismatic movement in Singapore.</p>
                                    <p>In interviews with Yahoo! Singapore, current and former church
                                    members recounted their experiences with <span class="">CHC</span>,
                                    which has now come under the spotlight after Kong and four other
                                    key members of the ministry were charged Wednesday over the alleged
                                    misuse of church funds to finance Kongâ€™s pop-star wifeâ€™s
                                    career.</p>
                                    <p>â€œI think one of the factors that draw people to our church is
                                    how the services are conducted,â€� shared 22-year-old <span class="">CHC</span> member Michelle Weers. â€œThe praise and worship is
                                    vibrant, the gospel is preached creatively.â€�</p>
                                    <p>Besides holding weekly services in English, Mandarin and
                                    dialects, the <span class="">CHC</span> also caters to Indonesians,
                                    Filipinos, children and the intellectually-disabled.</p>
                                    <p>About 46 per cent of the congregation was below the age of 25
                                    years, based on statistics provided by the church in 2010. With an
                                    average age of 24, majority of the churchgoers are believed to be
                                    young professionals aged 25 to 35.</p>
                                    <p>Most, if not all, of <span class="">CHC</span>â€™s followers are
                                    also very much attracted to the churchâ€™s charismatic founder, a man
                                    they said is â€œtalentedâ€� and â€œinspiringâ€� and who always â€œlives out
                                    what he preachesâ€�.</p>
                                    <p>â€œHeâ€™s like our spiritual father,â€� said James Yeo, an active
                                    <span class="">CHC</span> member for the past eight years. â€œAnd as
                                    our senior pastor, he really practises what he preaches, and acted
                                    like a role model to all of us.â€�</p>
                                    <p>Echoed a 28-year-old executive whoâ€™d be known only as Ms Ong, â€œI
                                    believe it is the doctrines and preaching from Pastor KH that
                                    continues to draw the crowd and retain its members despite the
                                    upheavals it has been through over the years.â€�</p>
                                    <p>The â€˜prosperity Gospelâ€™ of <span class="">CHC</span></p>
                                    <p>Church funds grew with the rise in membership. Net assets in
                                    2009 amounted to an estimated S$103 million.</p>
                                    <p>Members who listened to Kong, 47, would open their pockets wide
                                    to contribute to the church.</p>
                                    <p>The pastor would often preach what became known as the
                                    â€œprosperity Gospelâ€� â€“ one reaps what one sows, and up to a
                                    hundred-fold returns could be harvested.</p>
                                    <p>In a video of one of his sermons uploaded onto YouTube in 2008,
                                    Kong stressed that oneâ€™s faith proclamation â€œmust be backed up by
                                    our givingâ€� and, if not, was essentially empty.</p>
                                    <p>â€œWhat we give every week is the measure of the value that you
                                    place on your Lord and your saviour Jesus Christ,â€� he told the
                                    crowd. â€œWe can lift up our hands to worship god, but if the tithes
                                    are still in our pockets, then due tribute has not been given. Then
                                    our praises are empty. Our words are empty. There is no value to
                                    back it up.â€�</p>
                                    <p><span class="">CHC</span>â€™s online donation page, which allows
                                    churchgoers and the public alike to give their offerings via eNets
                                    and credit cards, also states that the church believes oneâ€™s giving
                                    is â€œa form of worship unto the Lordâ€�.</p>
                                    <p>Not everyone, however, bought into this belief, which gradually
                                    turned into a focus of many critics. Some <span class="">CHC</span>
                                    members left as a result.</p>
                                    <p>â€œI joined the church initially because he (Kong) preached very
                                    well and knows how to create a program that appealed to youths,â€�
                                    said 26-year-old Terence Lee, who was a member of the church for
                                    seven years until 2010.</p>
                                    <p>Citing â€œa lack of transparencyâ€� in the running of the church as
                                    his reason for leaving, the assistant editor shared that he no
                                    longer agreed with the doctrine, which he now feels is based on a
                                    â€œshaky Bible interpretation concocted by self-styled Bible
                                    gurusâ€�.</p>
                                    <p>A former cell group leader, who declined to be named, also let
                                    on that â€œthere was definitely pressure to donateâ€�, especially among
                                    younger church members.</p>
                                    <p>â€œThose who consistently gave more would be applauded; those who
                                    didnâ€™t give so much would be â€˜strongly encouragedâ€™ every week to
                                    â€˜give as much as you canâ€™,â€� he told Yahoo! Singapore. â€œWe were
                                    always told that God would make rich those who donated more.â€�</p>
                                    <p>Marketing executive Mary Lim too, felt the pressure. The
                                    29-year-old eventually chose to leave the religious organisation
                                    three years ago when she became depressed that she couldnâ€™t give
                                    enough.</p>
                                    <p>â€œWhen we signed up, they would give us forms, <span class="">GIRO</span> forms, encouraging us to donate to <span class="">CHC</span> via <span class="">GIRO</span> to make sure our
                                    tithes were regular,â€� she recalled.</p>
                                    <p>Her friends who continue to attend <span class="">CHC</span>
                                    still donate via <span class="">GIRO</span>, she added. Three other
                                    <span class="">CHC</span> members confirmed this.</p>
                                    <p>Continued support</p>
                                    <p>Over the years, <span class="">CHC</span> has been hounded by
                                    controversy over how it may be using membersâ€™ funds.</p>
                                    <p>Nine years after its main church building â€“ a 2,300 seater â€“ was
                                    built in Jurong West, <span class="">CHC</span> announced in early
                                    2010 its big plans to build a double-floor 12,000-seat auditorium
                                    in Suntec Singapore for worship services at a whopping S$310
                                    million.</p>
                                    <p>Questions over the churchâ€™s ambitious plans began to surface
                                    among the public and the press. For one, should religious
                                    organisations, registered as charities, be allowed to make
                                    investments using what are essentially donor funds?</p>
                                    <p>In March 2010, the Commissioner of Charities (COC) and
                                    Commercial Affairs Department came knocking on <span class="">CHC</span>â€™s door after receiving complaints alleging the misuse
                                    of the churchâ€™s funds.</p>
                                    <p>Even then, the megachurch managed to secure S$22.9 million last
                                    November in pledges towards a building fund that will pay for the
                                    churchâ€™s S$310 million investment in Suntec Singapore, said a 2011
                                    Straits Times report.</p>
                                    <p>This, despite a falling membership amid police investigation for
                                    possible abuse of funds.</p>
                                    <p>Numbers dwindled to an estimated 23,000 in 2010, down from
                                    33,000 a year before.</p>
                                    <p>A two-year investigation ended last Wednesday with Kong and four
                                    other senior <span class="">CHC</span> members charged for
                                    allegedly misappropriating about S$24 million from <span class="">CHC</span>â€™s building funds for unauthorised use, among other
                                    charges.</p>
                                    <p>Despite the put-downs, many <span class="">CHC</span> members
                                    whom Yahoo! Singapore spoke to continued to show unwavering support
                                    for the church and their pastor.</p>
                                    <p>â€œThe church does preach about prosperity, but that is only one
                                    aspect of the gospel,â€� shared Weers, whoâ€™s been a member for six
                                    years. â€œTeachings are done on the full gospel.â€�</p>
                                    <p>The 22-year-old <span class="">SIM</span> undergraduate also
                                    added that â€œtestimonies shared are not always on financial
                                    blessingsâ€�, contrary to what many have alleged.</p>
                                    <p>Mdm Lim, a 50-year-old homemaker, was another who shared the
                                    same sentiment and believed wholeheartedly in â€œGodâ€™s principle of
                                    Sowing and Reapingâ€�.</p>
                                    <p>â€œWhatever seed we sow, we will reap the harvest of its kind â€“
                                    when we sow love, we reap love; when we sow money, we will be
                                    blessed financially,â€� she said.</p>
                                    <p>â€œBut itâ€™s more than that,â€� Lim was quick to add. â€œPastor Kong
                                    has preached on love, sacrifice and many areas, itâ€™s not just about
                                    money.â€�</p>
                                    <p>But the churchgoer of two years, who contributes about S$500 to
                                    the <span class="">CHC</span> every month, shared that she
                                    understood where detractors were coming from, especially since
                                    â€œmoneyâ€™s a sensitive issueâ€�.</p>
                                    <p>â€œBut my stand is that people give because they want to give to
                                    the Lord. And we know that the church will do good works from
                                    whatever weâ€™ve contributed.â€�</p>
                                    <p>While some churchgoers such as Lim acknowledged â€œthe wrong
                                    Pastor Kong has doneâ€�, many maintained that their leaders are
                                    innocent and voiced confidence in their integrity.</p>
                                    <p>Said one from the latter group, James Yeo, â€œI believe that no
                                    individual personally benefited from this, no one pocketed any
                                    money, and there was no embezzlement whatsoever.â€�</p>
                                    <p>Referring to the controversial project at the heart of the
                                    probe, the 21-year-old added, â€œCrossover is not a project of five
                                    individuals, it is a project of the whole church. Members gave
                                    willingly and with great support as to what Sun (Kongâ€™s wife) is
                                    doing.â€�</p>

              The chappie is not stupid . He saw what he could do to harness the young and impressionables . He had a platform to start with - he was a graduate  from our UNI to start with. And he must have seen those American styled evangelical stir your spirits type  cult leaders, who could move  people.. in the direction he wants them to move... Like a MRT  people mover - you can swing a mass of loyalists to donate to your course once they  get mesmerized by your prosperity gospels and fast beating rock hymns....and of course you got to do some visibily good stuff( charities etc)  and promote  and publicize what good you do...... then when your insidious  intentions to line your pockets and lifestyle  seeps in- the congregation actually accepts it as  part and parcel of God's blessings for you-their spiritual leader! Amazing grace!

              There is a diffeence in daylight robing you force th ewoman to give up her handbag...in crossover evangelism you preach  to get  the people to give 'voluntarily" so the penalty in my opinion will not be more than 10years.
