              <p>They never read carefully the newspapers.. The just see money,
              Christians, millions, and jump to all sorts of conclusions and
              allegations.</p>
              <p>The COC and CAD investigated for two years come up with the
              charge of CBT and unauthorised use of charity money. They did not
              come up with misappropriation of church funds. That means they did
              not steal any money.</p>
              <p>One church official has already issued a statement that no money
              was lost, and all the millions came back with interest. This
              information seems to be ignored by all.</p>
              <p>Thats why the government ministers advice not to speculate and
              wait for the court case.</p>

              <h1 class="headline">I maintain my integrity: Kong Hee</h1>
              <p class="first">Beleaguered City Harvest Church pastor Kong Hee insisted he had integrity as he spoke to a full house at Singapore Expo Hall 1 early Saturday evening. <br><br>In
               the first English-language service of the church since he and four key 
              ministry members were charged with criminal breach of trust allegedly to
               support the music career of his wife Sun Ho, Kong said, "I maintain my 
              integrity."</p>
              <p>With his wife up on stage with him, he added, "There were times when 
              Sun and I just didn't know what to do." He and his wife also hugged on 
              stage.</p>
              <p>The expo hall was packed with members of the congregation and two 
              rooms overflowed with supporters for about a total of 5,000 people. 
              There were many banners saying "I love Pastor Kong".</p>
              <p>Some of the faithful also gave testimonies on the church's "Crossover
               Project" started in 2002 supposedly as a way to use Ho's secular music 
              to connect with people and reach out to non-Christians.<br><br>One of 
              Ho's backup dancers talked about how the pastor's wife, who tried to 
              become a pop star in the U.S., brought Christ to her and the world 
              through Ho's song "China Wine".<br><br>CHC has thrown its weight behind its founder Kong Hee and the four other key members who were charged Wednesday over alleged misuse of the charity’s funds.<br><br>In a statement
               released by executive pastor Aries Zulkarnain on Thursday evening, the 
              church stated that it is standing by the five individuals.</p>
              <p>"The people currently in the news are our pastors and trusted staff and 
              leaders who have always put God and CHC first," he said. "As a church we
               stand with them and I believe fully in their integrity."<br><br>The 
              statement also said that Kong, 47, and his deputy pastor Tan Ye Peng, 
              39, who both face charges of criminal breach of trust, will continue 
              preaching at the megachurch.<br><br>Addressing the current charges that stand against the five accused 
              leaders, Zulkarnain maintained that the church did not lose any money in
               the transactions detailed in the charges, which list two separate 
              amounts of S$24 million and a further S$26.6 million.<br><br> "The S$24 million, which went into investment bonds, was returned to the
               church in full, with interest... The church did not lose any funds in 
              the relevant transactions, and no personal profit was gained by the 
              individuals concerned," he said.
              <strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;"></span></strong>In
               response to the church’s statement, the Attorney-General’s Chambers 
              (AGC) said, “We wish to reiterate that as criminal charges are now 
              before the court and will be subject to adjudication by the court; and 
              that as such, neither the prosecution nor any other party should comment
               on issues which will be subject to adjudication and on which evidence 
              will be led in court.”</p>
