              <h1 class="news_title">Judge explains why City Harvest member denied foreign senior counsel</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE: The admission of foreign 
              senior counsel, such as a Queen’s Counsel, could be granted in cases 
              where the interests of an individual or issues pertaining solely to that
               individual “are so out of the ordinary that they require special 
              consideration”, Judge of Appeal V K Rajah said Wednesday.</p>
              <p>For 
              example, an individual may be able to establish that his case is 
              exceptional if he can prove that, despite all reasonable efforts 
              conscientiously made, he cannot find any competent local counsel to 
              represent him.</p>
              <p>This “exceptional case” would then constitute as a 
              “special reason” under the Legal Profession Act, said Justice Rajah in a
               50-page judgment released on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>In it, he laid out the 
              legal principles governing applications for the ad hoc admission of 
              foreign senior counsel in criminal cases and further explained why City 
              Harvest Church member Chew Eng Han’s application for an elite British 
              lawyer was dismissed last month.</p>
              <p>Chew is among six church leaders 
              charged last June with conspiring to cheat the church of millions of 
              dollars by funnelling S$24 million into sham investments to further the 
              career of Senior Pastor Kong Hee’s pop-singer wife, and then 
              misappropriating another S$26.6 million to cover up the misuse of the 
              first sum.</p>
              <p>Under the Legal Profession Act, there are three areas —
               criminal law, family law, and constitutional and administrative law — 
              where the courts will weigh the need for foreign lawyers.</p>
              <p>Justice 
              Rajah said it would be mandatory for the “special reason” criterion to 
              be made out for applications for foreign senior counsel involving the 
              three restricted areas of law.</p>
              <p>In addition, four requirements, 
              such as the nature of the factual and legal issues involved, as well as 
              the necessity for the services of a foreign senior counsel, must be 
              satisfied before one is admitted, he added.</p>
              <p>At the hearing, Deputy
               Chief Counsel Aurill Kam, who represented the Attorney-General, felt 
              that a case must raise significant matters of “a macro nature” before it
               can be considered an exception.</p>
              <p>Justice Rajah, however, felt that
               there “is no sound policy reason to limit the court’s discretion to 
              only cases of a macro nature”. “It would be preferable for the court to 
              simply decide, based on the facts and circumstances of each case, 
              whether the case before it is exceptional,” he added.</p>
              <p>For Chew’s 
              application, Justice Rajah found that the factual and legal issues 
              involved in his case were not complex enough to justify the ad hoc 
              admission of a foreign senior counsel.</p>
              <p>The High Court Judge was 
              also satisfied that there was an untapped “substantial number of more 
              than competent local counsel and senior counsel to represent the accused
               in the criminal proceedings”.</p>
              <p>Last month, Chew appointed Senior 
              Counsel Michael Khoo to represent him, three days after his application 
              was dismissed by Justice Rajah.</p>

              <h1 class="news_title">City Harvest executive pastor to continue helming church affairs</h1>
              <div class="news_detail">
              <div>
              <p>SINGAPORE: City Harvest Church said Wednesday that its
               executive pastor Aries Zulkarnain will continue to helm church affairs,
               after consultation with the organisation's management board.</p>
              <p>Mr 
              Zulkarnain, who is also the church’s management board's chairman, began 
              leading the organisation some 10 months ago when Pastor Kong and other 
              leaders were suspended from their duties.</p>
              <p>The Commissioner of 
              Charities (COC) on Tuesday said that it was considering removing eight 
              church leaders from their posts as not all had agreed to voluntarily 
              extend their suspension until six months after the criminal trial, which
               starts on 15 May.</p>
              <p>The COC previously found in an inquiry that 
              there were financial irregularities of at least S$23 million in the 
              management of church funds.</p>
              <p>Channel NewsAsia understands that the 
              church leaders’ lawyers are studying the Commissioner's report and will 
              decide whether to make representations on why they should not be 
              removed.</p>
              <p>All representations to the COC have to be made by 13 May.</p>
              <p>The
               COC emphasised on Tuesday that its actions are independent and separate
               from the criminal proceedings against six of the suspended individuals.</p>

              <h1 class="news_title">City Harvest Church's founder, wife did not confirm consent to voluntarily extend suspension orders: COC</h1>
              <div class="news_detail">
              <div>
              <p>SINGAPORE: City Harvest Church's founder Kong Hee and 
              his wife Sun Ho were not among the five church leaders who reaffirmed 
              their consent to voluntarily extend their suspension orders.</p>
              <p>The
               Commissioner of Charities (COC) had asked for eight church leaders - 
              including Senior Pastor Kong, who had initially given their consent on 7
               February, to confirm by 25 March this year.</p>
              <p>This was revealed
               by the Commissioner in a statement to clarify why he had "no choice but
               to proceed with regulatory action", and propose to remove the eight 
              from their management positions.</p>
              <p>The Commissioner of 
              Charities' inquiry into City Harvest Church, instituted in May 2010, has
               revealed misconduct and mismanagement in the administration of the 
              charity particularly to money in the Building Fund, earmarked for 
              specific purposes.</p>
              <p>Financial irregularities of at least $23 
              million were discovered. The funds were used with the intention to 
              finance Sun Ho's secular music career, and the inquiry had found that 
              there was a concerted effort to conceal it from stakeholders.</p>
              <p>On
               28 December 2012, the Commissioner proposed to nine church leaders that
               it would defer the next stage of regulatory action if all nine agreed 
              to voluntarily extend their suspension orders.</p>
              <p>By 7 February 2013, eight out of nine, including Pastor Kong Hee and Sun Ho, had initially consented to this proposal.</p>
              <p>Although
               there was no collective agreement, as one person did not consent, the 
              Commissioner said it was still prepared to defer regulatory action.</p>
              <p>On
               14 March 2013, it asked the eight persons to confirm in writing that 
              they are still agreeable to voluntarily extend their suspension.</p>
              <p>A final deadline of 25 March 2013 was given.</p>
              <p>But by then, the Commissioner only received consents from five of them.</p>
              <p>This
               time, pastor Kong Hee and Sun Ho were not among the five who reaffirmed
               their consent even though they had agreed to do so earlier.</p>
              <p>The
               Commissioner said because the individual cases are linked, he could not
               extend the suspension only for those who gave their confirmations.</p>
              <p>Separately,
               in his latest statement on 11 April, Pastor Kong maintained that the 
              premise for the Commissioner's offer had changed.</p>
              <p>He said as 
              he and his wife had already agreed to the original terms in February 
              2013, they did not see any reason to consent again to the revised offer.</p>
              <p>There was no mention of the 25 March deadline in his latest statement.</p>
              <p>The Commissioner has allowed all eight persons to make representations before deciding on removing them.</p>
              <p>For four individuals, the Commissioner is also inviting representations from the public. They are:</p>
              <p>- Pastor Kong Hee;</p>
              <p>- Chairman of City Harvest Church's Board Lam Leng Hung who served as its Treasurer from 7 March 2010 to 10 April 2011;</p>
              <p>- Vice-Chairman of City Harvest Church's Board Tan Ye Peng; and</p>
              <p>-
               Key officer of City Harvest Church Kelvin Teo Meng How who exercises 
              general control and management of the Charity's administration.</p>
              <p>All representations to the Commissioner of Charities have to be made by 13 May 2013.</p>
              <p>It
               is understood that some church-goers have already submitted 
              representations to the Commissioner of Charities not to remove their 
              leaders.</p>

              <div class="bd" style=" font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 1.6em;"><strong>[Update 11:04pm: Include Lai Bao Ting's court appearance] </strong><br><br>Former City Harvest Church (CHC) accountant Lai Bao Ting was the first witness to take the stand in court on Wednesday for the trial against the mega-church's founder Kong Hee and five of the church's leaders for alleged misappropriation of funds.<br> <br>In one set of charges, Kong Hee, Tan Ye Peng, Chew Eng Han, Serina Wee Gek Yin, Tan Shao Yuen Sharon and Lam Leng Hung (known as John Lam) are accused of criminal breach of trust for dishonestly misusing $24 million in church building funds to finance the music career of Kong's wife, Sun Ho.<br><br>In another set, Chew, Tan Ye Peng, Sharon Tan and Wee are said to have diverted about $26 million in church funds by channelling the sum into Xtron Productions and PT The First National Glassware (Firna) as bond investments. This was allegedly to cover up the "sham transactions" in the first batch of charges.<br>
              <p class="first" style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px;">Lai, a former assistant accountant who had joined CHC in February 2006, was questioned by deputy public prosecutor Tan Kiat Pheng during the afternoon court session.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px;">The court heard that Lai, who reported to finance managers Wee and Sharon Tan, was involved in recording transactions between CHC and Xtron Productions Pte Ltd. In emails, she also would sign off as a representative of Xtron Productions though she was not a staff of the company. She explained this was because she was asked to help handle Xtron's accounts.</p>
              During questioning, DPP Tan had asked her whether she understood the concerns that was raised by external auditor Sim Guan Seng - the latter had queried the church’s close relationship with third party Xtron Productions, an artiste management business that used to handle Sun Ho's career, as well as the church’s investments in AMAC Capital Partners, a company owned by former church member Chew Eng Han. <br><br>The soft spoken Lai, who wore a maroon top and black pants, answered "no". In her conditioned statement, she said there were instances that she followed her manager's (Sharon Tan) instructions to record entries involving millions of dollars to companies like Xtron.<br>Lai continues to take the stand on Thursday morning.<br><br>Earlier in the day, crowds of supporters had queued outside the Subordinate Courts at the crack of dawn, with some reportedly lining up as early as late Tuesday evening, to get entry passes to the trial.<br><br>In the opening statement, lead prosecutor Mavis Chionh pointed out that the church's building funds came from donations by members to a campaign specifically targeted to support the construction of a new church.<br><br>Also, based on admitted statements of fact, the CHC management board publicly said none of the church's funds were being used to promote the career of Ho.<br><br>However, the prosecutor asserted that evidence would show that the six accused conspired to devise "purported" bond investments through which $13 million in building funds was misappropriated for Ho's career and $11 million was used for the same purpose as well as to for the personal use of one Wahju Hanafi.<br><br>The prosecution stressed that it was immaterial whether the accused believed that the promotion of Ho's music career would further the broader objectives of CHC.<br><br>"The question is whether the diversion of the Building Fund monies towards financing her music career, under the guise of purported bond investments, was an authorised use of the Building Fund," the prosecutor said.<br><br>The prosecution also pointed out that the "theological legitimacy" of using Ho's music career as a means of evangelism was not at issue in the trial and was not relevant to the charges against the accused.<br><br>Regarding the second set of charges, the prosecution alleged that the four accused over this aspect of the case conspired to effect the supposed redemption of the bonds "by misappropriating further sums totalling about $26.6 million of CHC's monies".<br><br>The prosecution said the accused intended to defraud the auditors of CHC and false entries into CHC's accounts had been made. This was said to have happened in 2009.<br><br>In conclusion, the prosecution said the evidence would show that "the offences were part of a deliberately planned, meticulously coordinated, and carefully executed scheme which stretched over a prolonged period of time and involved the movement of millions of dollars".</div>
