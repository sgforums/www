              <h2>CHC member challenges detractors to join City Harvest Church for a year</h2>
              <p class="date">Posted by <a href="http://temasektimes.wordpress.com">temasektimes</a> on July 8, 2012</p>
              <p>This is my take on the post found <a href="http://temasektimes.wordpress.com/2012/06/27/an-analysis-into-the-wealth-of-city-harvest-church/">here</a></p>
              <p>Thank you for writing such an amazing post on your take on the whole 
              City Harvest Church saga. I respect your views but I would not take 
              yours as a business case as its biased and you merely conveniently 
              connecting the dots backwards.</p>
              <p>So I would like to correct certain misconceptions and assumptions you
               made. I may not not address everything but I will try the best I can 
              with what I what I know.</p>
              <p>To begin let me first say that I am a member of City Harvest Church. 
              If you feel I’m biased just take it as a view from the other side of the
               coin. As a believer my views will be based on my total reliance on my 
              faith, hope you understand.</p>
              <p><a href="http://temasektimes.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/chcraise.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7025" title="chcraise" src="http://temasektimes.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/chcraise.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="301"></a></p>
              <p><strong>1. Clever packaging of Sunday services.</strong></p>
              <p>I totally agree with you! I love the CHC does it services. Being from
               a Christian family and coming from an Orthodox Church background I 
              always felt Sunday services boring and unrelatable. Everyday weekend 
              certain sounded like story telling than learning anything from it. When I
               first joined CHC I was shocked! I couldn’t believe that being a 
              Christian was an in-thing and you could learn life lessons that could be
               applied in our daily lives! I was drawn by Pastor Kong’s sermon on 
              being a problem solver and making an impact in this world.</p>
              <p>As Christians you believe in a God who is omniscient, all knowing and
               all powerful, the church always encouraged the congregation to think 
              and do big think as far as your imagination can take. This indeed will 
              increase followers as no one has ever taught these things in a church 
              before. This may increase retention but if it was just a fad how long 
              can the church keep bluffing people with these? It has brought a 
              positive impact in their lives hence they continue to join services and 
              continue giving because to run a church with all the stuffs that you’ve 
              mentioned is not free. People continued supporting it because they love 
              it and want the church to continue.</p>
              <p>You make it sound easy retaining and having a huge following but then
               why is there still only a few who can do this and why do many of them 
              fail?</p>
              <p><strong>2. Extra revenue in the form of advertisements, sales of CDs</strong></p>
              <p>Church does maximize it revenue with advertising and selling related 
              contents. If the church has a bookstore built with it definitely I would
               go and buy as I was to read more or wish to share it with family and 
              friends.</p>
              <p>If Universal Studios has a souvenir shop after every ride, why can’t 
              the church do the same? If the secular can do it why can’t religion?</p>
              <p><strong>3. Efficient collection of tithes</strong></p>
              <p>We do give our tithe out our free will, its not paying. No one is 
              forced to pay. So since i said free will it is indeed a monthly giving 
              that is given by each member of the church. It is given in cash and via 
              electronic payment. Online payments encourage our overseas members to 
              continue giving as they believe in our church and its activities.</p>
              <p>But…not GIRO! Church doesn’t have a GIRO system and I do not know 
              where you get your facts from. Instead of watching services online you 
              my wanna come down and see it yourself.</p>
              <p><strong>4. 30-fold, 60-fold, 100-fold returns on your church donations</strong></p>
              <p>Pastor indeed preaches on the 100-fold blessings. Its biblical and 
              thats what church does, teach the Bible. Of course there are other 
              churches who slam it as each and every church has it own focus.</p>
              <p>I have been with the church for over a number of years and I have 
              seen the blessing and that’s why I continue to give. If the scripture 
              did not hold any water and people didn’t feel any of this were true then
               shouldn’t the people already stop giving? I mean it common sense right?</p>
              <p>Like any religion “The 10 Laws Of The Harvest” promises each and 
              every believer a blessing in return which is biblical. Isn’t every 
              Christian promised heaven in his/her after life? Is that being greedy 
              and self centered?</p>
              <p><strong>5. Quality of customers</strong></p>
              <p>How many organizations claim because they were asked to give 10% of their earnings they had a huge membership?</p>
              <p>If the church has attracted an ambitious bunch then why is there so 
              much focus on fasting and prayer? I don’t see you even mention about 
              that in here. Its convenient to take a slice of a weekend service out of
               context instead of seeing what were the focus of each and every week.</p>
              <p>You won’t get 33,000 blind people to follow that unless these people 
              had an encounter. Like any organization if the claim didn’t hold water 
              would you continue giving?</p>
              <p>Yes CHC members are ambitious and always looking to be somebody in the marketplace. There is nothing wrong with that.</p>
              <p><strong>6. Kill off competition</strong></p>
              <p>How would one know what is a good or a bad ground? Its in its fruits.</p>
              <p>Similarly the sermon tells each and every believer that since you all
               have experienced the goodness of God in this church this is indeed the 
              good ground to give. The church does give to the poor and needy around 
              the world. It does practice what it preaches. You can check on CHC 
              website to see the reports.</p>
              <p>Is it killing off competition? I don’t know. If the church impresses a believer he/she will sure follow. It pure free will.</p>
              <p><strong>7. Providing a place where the rich can network</strong></p>
              <p>Church is indeed about fellowship and networking. But is every weekend about networking and name card exchanges? No.</p>
              <p>I do have friends in the business and insurance. If i find my friend 
              reliable with whatever they do, definitely I would recommend and use 
              their services.</p>
              <p>As a member I am flattered when you say its a network of the rich and powerful.</p>
              <p><strong>8. Preach what people like to hear.</strong></p>
              <p>Clearly Matthew 19:23-24 speaks of putting your money above God. We 
              preach on that and that’s exactly the reason why we have no qualms over 
              giving money to the church. As members its no big deal, we put God’s 
              work above wealth.</p>
              <p>But from your post you claim that we are blinded and brainwashed to give away money.</p>
              <p>You wrote;</p>
              <p>In the video “Rich God? Poor God?”, the Pastor preaches that it is 
              absolutely ok to be rich. Some prophets of God were very rich. (Abraham,
               David, Solomon)</p>
              <p>There is nothing more musical to a money-minded person than to hear 
              that God is on your side in your pursuit of money. The church-members 
              who are more money-minded will love this and donate even more.</p>
              <p>Pastor stated that the men of God were wealthy people and that is 
              what the Bible says. He’s not making stuff up and as Christians we ought
               to be self sufficient and wealthy so that you can continue to give for 
              good causes. Good causes according to the believers will.</p>
              <p><strong>9. God pays for the returns, not the church.</strong></p>
              <p>Here we go again. Blabbering the same ol’ thing.</p>
              <p>The church doesn’t owe anyone any money. If you want returns from the same organization you give money to, engage a broker.</p>
              <p>Donations are all out of free will, simple as that. The principle 
              applies to any charity, people work and donate, the charity takes and 
              continues working.</p>
              <p><strong>10. Social pressure to conform in church settings and ease of influence</strong></p>
              <p>Free will again, whether you are turned off by people or no people 
              its up to you. We still receive donation via our online portal and those
               people are disconnected as they can be. But we still continue giving as
               we believe in what the church is doing.</p>
              <p><strong>11. Tremendous future earning power</strong></p>
              <p>I was in debt when I first came to church but few years later I am 
              now living a debt free life. The church actively teaches the 
              congregation on “How to get out of debt”, “Building Financial 
              Excellence” and so on. I was always blessed by that and applied Biblical
               Principles which you call “Prosperity Gospel” and it worked!</p>
              <p>I love this!</p>
              <p>In the Pastor’s words, “You may be poor today, but you will not be poor all your life”.</p>
              <p>I totally abide by what he says ‘coz its true! Poverty is a mindset if you can overcome this, you can overcome your debt.</p>
              <p><strong>12. Stable earnings in times of depression</strong></p>
              <p>Besides being a growth stock, CHC can also be viewed as a defensive 
              and safe stock. People pray hardest when they fall in hard times. 
              Strangely, some people have an urge to tithe when they are in financial 
              troubles.</p>
              <p>We should continue tithing no matter what financial condition you are
               in because the Bible says so. Its a curse to hold on it. I have 
              personally held on to it to pay our my loans and it has never done any 
              good.</p>
              <p>People who have tasted the blessings on giving will never go back 
              again. May be you should give it shot! Give 10% of what you earn to any 
              charity you like, I can guarantee you will feel the difference.</p>
              <p>Psalms 34:8 Taste and see that the LORD is good; blessed is the man who takes refuge in him.</p>
              <p><strong>13. Using Prosperity as a theme to appeal to customers</strong></p>
              <p>Here we go again! Prosperity gospel is only preached during offering.
               This year our theme is “Relationship and Discipleship” and last year 
              our theme was “Love”. I don’t see you speak about those programs we did.
               All you claim you see is Money, Money and Money.</p>
              <p>Money is integral for all charities. If you cant bring in the money, 
              your work to spread the Gospel in an effective manner will stop. You 
              cant help the poor and the needy. You cant bring in Guest Speakers, you 
              cant run simulcast to people all over the world!</p>
              <p>We don’t love money, we love God. Money is the enabler unless we are 
              all living in Willy Wonka’s world. Reality is you still need to pay the 
              bills.</p>
              <p><strong>14. Tax benefits as church is registered as a charity</strong></p>
              <p>Tax breaks helps uses that extra to do more. This is same for all charities, its not a CHC exception.</p>
              <p>Pastor indeed is runs a business, you should may be consider 
              investing since you already has confessed you love for his business 
              acumen.</p>
              <p>Here my challenge for you.</p>
              <p><strong>Join City Harvest Church for a year and in the end if it has 
              not changed your life for the good. Please come back and write again.</strong></p>

              <h2>CHC member challenges detractors to join City Harvest Church
              for a year</h2>
              <p>Posted by <a rel="nofollow" href="http://temasektimes.wordpress.com">temasektimes</a> on July 8, 2012</p>
              <p>This is my take on the post found <a rel="nofollow" href="http://temasektimes.wordpress.com/2012/06/27/an-analysis-into-the-wealth-of-city-harvest-church/">here</a></p>
              <p>Thank you for writing such an amazing post on your take on the
              whole City Harvest Church saga. I respect your views but I would
              not take yours as a business case as its biased and you merely
              conveniently connecting the dots backwards.</p>
              <p>So I would like to correct certain misconceptions and
              assumptions you made. I may not not address everything but I will
              try the best I can with what I what I know.</p>
              <p>To begin let me first say that I am a member of City Harvest
              Church. If you feel I’m biased just take it as a view from the
              other side of the coin. As a believer my views will be based on my
              total reliance on my faith, hope you understand.</p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://temasektimes.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/chcraise.jpg"><img title="chcraise" src="http://temasektimes.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/chcraise.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="301"></a></p>
              <p><strong>1. Clever packaging of Sunday services.</strong></p>
              <p>I totally agree with you! I love the CHC does it services. Being
              from a Christian family and coming from an Orthodox Church
              background I always felt Sunday services boring and unrelatable.
              Everyday weekend certain sounded like story telling than learning
              anything from it. When I first joined CHC I was shocked! I couldn’t
              believe that being a Christian was an in-thing and you could learn
              life lessons that could be applied in our daily lives! I was drawn
              by Pastor Kong’s sermon on being a problem solver and making an
              impact in this world.</p>
              <p>As Christians you believe in a God who is omniscient, all
              knowing and all powerful, the church always encouraged the
              congregation to think and do big think as far as your imagination
              can take. This indeed will increase followers as no one has ever
              taught these things in a church before. This may increase retention
              but if it was just a fad how long can the church keep bluffing
              people with these? It has brought a positive impact in their lives
              hence they continue to join services and continue giving because to
              run a church with all the stuffs that you’ve mentioned is not free.
              People continued supporting it because they love it and want the
              church to continue.</p>
              <p>You make it sound easy retaining and having a huge following but
              then why is there still only a few who can do this and why do many
              of them fail?</p>
              <p><strong>2. Extra revenue in the form of advertisements, sales of
              CDs</strong></p>
              <p>Church does maximize it revenue with advertising and selling
              related contents. If the church has a bookstore built with it
              definitely I would go and buy as I was to read more or wish to
              share it with family and friends.</p>
              <p>If Universal Studios has a souvenir shop after every ride, why
              can’t the church do the same? If the secular can do it why can’t
              religion?</p>
              <p><strong>3. Efficient collection of tithes</strong></p>
              <p>We do give our tithe out our free will, its not paying. No one
              is forced to pay. So since i said free will it is indeed a monthly
              giving that is given by each member of the church. It is given in
              cash and via electronic payment. Online payments encourage our
              overseas members to continue giving as they believe in our church
              and its activities.</p>
              <p>But…not GIRO! Church doesn’t have a GIRO system and I do not
              know where you get your facts from. Instead of watching services
              online you my wanna come down and see it yourself.</p>
              <p><strong>4. 30-fold, 60-fold, 100-fold returns on your church
              donations</strong></p>
              <p>Pastor indeed preaches on the 100-fold blessings. Its biblical
              and thats what church does, teach the Bible. Of course there are
              other churches who slam it as each and every church has it own
              focus.</p>
              <p>I have been with the church for over a number of years and I
              have seen the blessing and that’s why I continue to give. If the
              scripture did not hold any water and people didn’t feel any of this
              were true then shouldn’t the people already stop giving? I mean it
              common sense right?</p>
              <p>Like any religion “The 10 Laws Of The Harvest” promises each and
              every believer a blessing in return which is biblical. Isn’t every
              Christian promised heaven in his/her after life? Is that being
              greedy and self centered?</p>
              <p><strong>5. Quality of customers</strong></p>
              <p>How many organizations claim because they were asked to give 10%
              of their earnings they had a huge membership?</p>
              <p>If the church has attracted an ambitious bunch then why is there
              so much focus on fasting and prayer? I don’t see you even mention
              about that in here. Its convenient to take a slice of a weekend
              service out of context instead of seeing what were the focus of
              each and every week.</p>
              <p>You won’t get 33,000 blind people to follow that unless these
              people had an encounter. Like any organization if the claim didn’t
              hold water would you continue giving?</p>
              <p>Yes CHC members are ambitious and always looking to be somebody
              in the marketplace. There is nothing wrong with that.</p>
              <p><strong>6. Kill off competition</strong></p>
              <p>How would one know what is a good or a bad ground? Its in its
              fruits.</p>
              <p>Similarly the sermon tells each and every believer that since
              you all have experienced the goodness of God in this church this is
              indeed the good ground to give. The church does give to the poor
              and needy around the world. It does practice what it preaches. You
              can check on CHC website to see the reports.</p>
              <p>Is it killing off competition? I don’t know. If the church
              impresses a believer he/she will sure follow. It pure free
              will.</p>
              <p><strong>7. Providing a place where the rich can
              network</strong></p>
              <p>Church is indeed about fellowship and networking. But is every
              weekend about networking and name card exchanges? No.</p>
              <p>I do have friends in the business and insurance. If i find my
              friend reliable with whatever they do, definitely I would recommend
              and use their services.</p>
              <p>As a member I am flattered when you say its a network of the
              rich and powerful.</p>
              <p><strong>8. Preach what people like to hear.</strong></p>
              <p>Clearly Matthew 19:23-24 speaks of putting your money above God.
              We preach on that and that’s exactly the reason why we have no
              qualms over giving money to the church. As members its no big deal,
              we put God’s work above wealth.</p>
              <p>But from your post you claim that we are blinded and brainwashed
              to give away money.</p>
              <p>You wrote;</p>
              <p>In the video “Rich God? Poor God?”, the Pastor preaches that it
              is absolutely ok to be rich. Some prophets of God were very rich.
              (Abraham, David, Solomon)</p>
              <p>There is nothing more musical to a money-minded person than to
              hear that God is on your side in your pursuit of money. The
              church-members who are more money-minded will love this and donate
              even more.</p>
              <p>Pastor stated that the men of God were wealthy people and that
              is what the Bible says. He’s not making stuff up and as Christians
              we ought to be self sufficient and wealthy so that you can continue
              to give for good causes. Good causes according to the believers
              will.</p>
              <p><strong>9. God pays for the returns, not the
              church.</strong></p>
              <p>Here we go again. Blabbering the same ol’ thing.</p>
              <p>The church doesn’t owe anyone any money. If you want returns
              from the same organization you give money to, engage a broker.</p>
              <p>Donations are all out of free will, simple as that. The
              principle applies to any charity, people work and donate, the
              charity takes and continues working.</p>
              <p><strong>10. Social pressure to conform in church settings and
              ease of influence</strong></p>
              <p>Free will again, whether you are turned off by people or no
              people its up to you. We still receive donation via our online
              portal and those people are disconnected as they can be. But we
              still continue giving as we believe in what the church is
              doing.</p>
              <p><strong>11. Tremendous future earning power</strong></p>
              <p>I was in debt when I first came to church but few years later I
              am now living a debt free life. The church actively teaches the
              congregation on “How to get out of debt”, “Building Financial
              Excellence” and so on. I was always blessed by that and applied
              Biblical Principles which you call “Prosperity Gospel” and it
              worked!</p>
              <p>I love this!</p>
              <p>In the Pastor’s words, “You may be poor today, but you will not
              be poor all your life”.</p>
              <p>I totally abide by what he says ‘coz its true! Poverty is a
              mindset if you can overcome this, you can overcome your debt.</p>
              <p><strong>12. Stable earnings in times of depression</strong></p>
              <p>Besides being a growth stock, CHC can also be viewed as a
              defensive and safe stock. People pray hardest when they fall in
              hard times. Strangely, some people have an urge to tithe when they
              are in financial troubles.</p>
              <p>We should continue tithing no matter what financial condition
              you are in because the Bible says so. Its a curse to hold on it. I
              have personally held on to it to pay our my loans and it has never
              done any good.</p>
              <p>People who have tasted the blessings on giving will never go
              back again. May be you should give it shot! Give 10% of what you
              earn to any charity you like, I can guarantee you will feel the
              difference.</p>
              <p>Psalms 34:8 Taste and see that the LORD is good; blessed is the
              man who takes refuge in him.</p>
              <p><strong>13. Using Prosperity as a theme to appeal to
              customers</strong></p>
              <p>Here we go again! Prosperity gospel is only preached during
              offering. This year our theme is “Relationship and Discipleship”
              and last year our theme was “Love”. I don’t see you speak about
              those programs we did. All you claim you see is Money, Money and
              Money.</p>
              <p>Money is integral for all charities. If you cant bring in the
              money, your work to spread the Gospel in an effective manner will
              stop. You cant help the poor and the needy. You cant bring in Guest
              Speakers, you cant run simulcast to people all over the world!</p>
              <p>We don’t love money, we love God. Money is the enabler unless we
              are all living in Willy Wonka’s world. Reality is you still need to
              pay the bills.</p>
              <p><strong>14. Tax benefits as church is registered as a
              charity</strong></p>
              <p>Tax breaks helps uses that extra to do more. This is same for
              all charities, its not a CHC exception.</p>
              <p>Pastor indeed is runs a business, you should may be consider
              investing since you already has confessed you love for his business
              acumen.</p>
              <p>Here my challenge for you.</p>
              <p><strong>Join City Harvest Church for a year and in the end if it
              has not changed your life for the good. Please come back and write
              again.</strong></p>

              That's precisely the trademark of the prosperity Gospel, an overemphasis on wealth. The NT has nothing against riches per se, but the emphasis is on being rich spiritually, storing up treasures in heaven. The NT also has many warnings about the deceitfulness of richess, and I would also say it warns against the conceitedness of riches too. Riches have a way of turning one's eyes away from God.
