              <p>City Harvest church founder Kong Hee and four others from his 
              ministry were arrested by the police on Tuesday morning, two years after
               investigations first began into the homegrown church.</p>
              <p>Mr Kong, deputy pastor Tan Ye Peng and three
               other church leaders were picked up by the police at their homes early 
              on Tuesday morning and taken in for questioning over the alleged misuse 
              of church funds as well as alleged breaches under charity laws.</p>
              <p>All five are expected to be produced in court on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>This latest development comes two years 
              after the Commercial Affairs Department started a probe into the alleged
               misuse of church funds in May 2010.</p>

              <div class="articleHeadline">COC 'concerned about the misconduct and mismanagement' following alleged misuse of building funds</div>
              <div class="articleHeadline"><br></div>
              <div class="articleHeadline">SINGAPORE - The Commissioner of Charities (COC), following an Inquiry 
              into the City Harvest Church (CHC), has suspended eight members of the 
              church governing board with immediate effect under the Charities Act, 
              following financial irregularities in the use of its building fund.<br><br> In May 2010, the COC and the Commercial Affairs Department 
              commenced investigations into financial transactions involving several 
              individuals and companies connected to City Harvest.<br><br> In a 
              statement today, the COC said its inquiry revealed "misconduct and 
              mismanagement in the administration of the Charity, particularly in 
              relation to the funds that were in the Building Fund which had been 
              raised and earmarked for specific purposes". <br><br> Financial irregularities of at least S$23 million from the funds were discovered, the COC said. <br><br> "These funds were used with the purported intention to finance Ho 
              Yeow Sun's secular music career to connect with people. There was a 
              concerted effort to conceal this movement of funds from its 
              stakeholders." the statement read. Ms Ho Yeow Sun, also known as Sun Ho,
               is the wife of City Harvest founder Kong Hee, and has been pursuing a 
              pop career which has included stints in the United States.<br><br> The COC said the following eight people "have been suspended from the 
              exercise of their office or employment as governing board members, 
              officers, agents or employees of the Charity with immediate effect":<br><br> - Kong Hee, member of the board and executive member;<br><br> - Lam Leng Hung, chairman of the board, trustee, agent and executive member;<br><br> - Tan Ye Peng, vice-chairman of the board, trustee, employee, agent and executive member;<br><br> - Tan Shao Yuen Sharon, employee and executive member;<br><br> - Chew Eng Han, agent and executive member;<br><br> - Ho Yeow Sun, agent and executive member;<br><br> - Kelvin Teo Meng How, agent, employee and executive member; and<br><br> - Tan Su Pheng Jacqueline, employee and executive member. <br><br> The eight have also been suspended from their executive memberships in CHC with immediate effect.<br><br> The COC added in its statement that it "will also consider taking 
              further courses of action under the Charities Act against these 
              individuals in order to protect the charitable property of the Charity".
               This could include their removal from their office as trustee, 
              governing board members, officers, agents or employees of the CHC.  <br><br> While suspended, they will be prohibited from involvement in 
              managing or representing City Harvest, or attending any of its annual 
              general meetings, extraordinary general meetings and board meetings, the
               COC said.<br><br> City Harvest Church's normal services can continue as usual, it added.</div>

              the City Harvest Church on Tuesday morning, following a Commercial 
              Affairs Department investigation into financial irregularities at the 
              church.</p>

              <p>I think you have a serious low self esteem problem. You been rejected by christian guys and unable to make friends at church, so you feel much hatred for christians.</p>
              <p>The christians believe those who heard the gospel but rejected it, would be the worst kind of christians because tehy rejected and trampled on christs. There's a special place in hell for people like you.</p>
