              <p>What everyone overlooks is the fact that Kong Hee is a protege of Phil Pringle from C3 Sydney. Pringle pulpit pimps continuously and has numerous unethical techniques to rip off the flock. C3 encourages the sheeple to mortgage or sell their houses and give the money to C3. Kong Hee has learnt a lot of fund raising techniques from Pringle.</p>
              <p>Kong Hee is arguably Asia's most dangerous man because he has led so many people astray and he gives Christianity a bad name, as does Pringle.</p>
              <p>As far as Kong Hee's wife goes she is not even a pastor's toenail. Neither is Kong Hee. Kong hee is a businessman who has seen an oppurtunity to fleece people of their assets and savings.</p>
              <p>A guy like him deserves 100% to be in prison.</p>

              <p><strong>City Harvest's founder Kong Hee, four others charged</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Five senior members of City Harvest Church (CHC), 
              including its founder Kong Hee, was charged in court on Wednesday with 
              misappropriating church funds. </span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The prosecution is levelling three charges against the five -- involving over S$50 million in total.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>This is more than the S$23 million earlier announced by the Commissioner of Charities. <br><br>The
               first charge centres on purported bond investments made by the church 
              in two companies, Xtron Productions and PT The First National Glassware.<br><br>These
               bond investments, which the prosecution said are "sham transactions", 
              were allegedly devised to conceal the diversion of some S$24 million 
              from the church's Building Fund to fund Ho Yeow Sun's music career. Ho 
              is Kong Hee's wife.<br><br>Four people are liable for the first set of charges - Kong Hee, Tan Ye Peng, Lam Leng Hung and Chew Eng Han.<br><br>The
               second charge relates to a series of transactions that some of the 
              accused had created to clear the purported bond investments off the 
              church's accounts.<br><br>They allegedly misappropriated a further S$26.6 million from the church's funds.<br><br>It's
               alleged that the money was circulated through a complicated series of 
              transactions to create the false appearance that the purported sham bond
               investments had been redeemed.<br><br>For these charges, which have 
              been termed as "round-tripping", three people are liable  - Tan Ye Peng,
               Chew Eng Han and Tan Shao Yuen Sharon.<br><br>The third charge relates to the falsification of church's accounts to cover their tracks.<br><br>It's
               alleged that Tan Ye Peng, Chew Eng Han and Tan Shao Yuen Sharon 
              doctored the church's books to give the false appearance that the bond 
              investments had been redeemed.<br><br>In all, pastor and church founder 
              Kong Hee faces three charges; senior pastor Tan Ye Peng faces 10 
              charges; finance manager Tan Shao Yuen Sharon faces seven charges; 
              senior member Chew Eng Han faces 10 charges; and former secretary of the
               church's management board Lam Leng Hung faces three charges.<br><br>All five church members stood solemnly together in the dock when the charges were read to them.<br><br>The five have each posted bail of S$500,000 and have had their passports impounded.<br><br>Earlier
               in the morning, a media scrum broke out when Kong Hee and his wife, 
              local songstress Sun Ho, arrived outside the Subordinate Courts.<br><br>Supporters belonging to City Harvest Church were also gathered outside the court.<br><br>Some were there as early as 7.30am. Their numbers swelled to over a hundred within an hour.  <br><br>- CNA/ck</span></span></p>

              <p>IRONIC Lyrics to 'Fancy Free' song by Sun Ho</p>
              <p>Woke up feeling like a <strong>millionaire</strong>,<br>Walking down the street with the wind in my hair,<br>All the boys stare, say I look so good,<br>No, I'm not cocky but I knew that they would,</p>
              <p>Cause everywhere I go my life is a party,<br>I don't have a worry, the sun keeps on shining on me,<br>Look how it's shining on me, (Oh),<br>You can't tell me nothing, look out cause I'm coming,<br>The street is my runway and everyone's looking at me,<br>All of their eyes are on me, (All of their eyes are on me)<br>And I....</p>

              Who is Ho Yeow Sun?
              
              Who is the woman behind beleaguered City Harvest Church founder Kong Hee, now at the centre of the most shocking probe into a religious organization in Singapore?
              
              Ho Yeow Sun, who now styles herself Sun Ho, is no stranger to controversy or the spotlight.
              
              She is expected to come even under more scrutiny after her husband and four other key ministry members were reportedly arrested Tuesday morning for allegedly using church funds to funnel S$23 million into promoting her music and albums.
              
              Since first bursting onto the scene in 2003 as Kong Heeâ€™s Mando-pop singing wife, Ho has been praised and slammed in equal parts by a public shocked by her skimpy dressing and blatant use of her husbandâ€™s church as a platform to promote her music albums.
              
              The Anglican High and Victoria Junior College alumnus had previously stayed under the radar as part of CHCâ€™s creative team until she resigned in 2003 to pursue her dreams of pop-stardom. Soon she started performing in flamboyant and expensive costumes on stage, sparking an uproar in the city-state.
              
              When news leaked in 2005 that she had once been a victim of sexual abuse, the public wasted no time in slamming the information as part of her strategy to promote her new album â€œEmbraceâ€� at that time.
              
              Coverage of her albumâ€™s successes was limited and muted, compared to the likes of other home-grown talent like Stefanie Sun.
              
              She tried to defend herself and told Channel NewsAsia around then that she hoped that Singaporeans could â€œgive me a chanceâ€�.
              
              CHC had also began to prosper on donations from members who were encouraged to set aside a tenth of of their income to CHC every month.
              
              Last year, CHC moved to its new home in Suntec though the church did shelve more ambitious plans to build a 12,000 seater auditorium at the site after the Urban Redevelopment Authority released guidelines restricting the use of commercial buildings for religious purposes.
              
              Initial plans for the Church to pay S$310 million to become a co-owner of Suntec sparked widespread debate when it was announced in March last year.
              
              Hoâ€™s husband, Kong, started to refer to himself as a â€œbusinessmanâ€� and together with his wife, set up Skin Couture, a luxury fashion apparel business in 2005.
              
              When the five successive albums she released between 2002-2007 hit double or triple platinum status, rumours of her â€œstagedâ€� popularity started to fly.
              
              One church member reportedly accused Kong of using CHC funds to fuel Hoâ€™s music career, but the allegation was later retracted.
              
              In the wake of the accusations, Ho abruptly announced that she would be â€œlooking overseasâ€� to further her career, moving to Los Angeles, Hollywood with her young son, Dayan Kong.
              
              The allegations were investigated by the Commercial Affairs Department in 2010, leading to the reported arrests Tuesday of her husband and four other key ministry members for alleged criminal breach of trust and falsifying church accounts.
              
              But what was Ho up to in those three years she upped and moved to LA?
              
              According to media reports, she was living the lavish lifestyle of a bona fide Hollywood celebrity.
              
              It was reported by The New Paper in 2010 that Ho was renting a S$7.7 million estate in Hollywood Hills with her son, an assistant, a nanny, and her relatives.
              
              The 29,000 sq ft Mediterranean style building boasted four structures, including accommodation for a butler, nanny, and maid. It also had a swimming pool and space for 11 cars, the tabloid said.
              
              Famous neighbours in the area were the likes of Nicky Hilton, Amercia Ferrera, and singer Leona Lewis.
              
              When Ho wasnâ€™t relaxing in her multi-million dollar home, she hobnobbed with music A-listers like Wyclef Jean, who produced her 2007 album, â€œChina Wineâ€� and whom, according to Ho, she is so close to that her son calls him â€œUncle Clefâ€�.
              
              According to her website, in 2008, Ho donated 500 tents to victims of the Sichuan earthquake and released a single, â€œEternal Blossomâ€�, which was broadcast over radio stations there.
              
              A single â€œKill Billâ€�, which she released the same year with rapper Lady Saw, saw Ho calling herself a â€œGeishaâ€� and gyrating around household appliances wearing only revealing kimono-styled lingerie and singing about killing her fictional husband. 
              
              Ho also became the first Asian pop singer to be invited to the MTV Europe Awards when she attended it in 2007, and subsequently also turned up for the Grammys in 2010.
              
              Things were not looking so good for Kong back in Singapore, who was in the news again, this time because he and other members of CHC were part of a CAD probe into allegations of the misuse of funds and cooking the churchâ€™s account books.
              
              Ho herself was placed under scrutiny when she was asked to return to assist in investigations in 2010 and reportedly grilled for eight hours by the police.
              
              Now, even more questions on Kong and Ho will likely be raised.

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0pt;"><strong>BY ESTHER TEO, DARYL CHIN, <br>NG KAI LING AND <br>TOH YONG CHUAN</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>SOME were surprised, others saw it coming. Mostly, they said they would stand by their pastor and church - at least for now - even if they were disappointed by the turn of events.</p>
              <p>  The Straits Times approached 25 parishioners of City Harvest Church yesterday and about half did not want to be interviewed, saying they wanted more information before making a judgment.</p>
              <p>  Of those who did speak, the overwhelming sentiment was that they still had faith in Pastor Kong Hee and the church.</p>
              <p>  Pharmacist Liu Yuan Tai, 28, said the congregation had been "expecting something" about the probe and so were not totally surprised. "But most of us are supportive of Pastor Kong, especially from what we know of him. We trust his integrity. Until more details of the case come out, we don't want to rush into any judgment yet. He might be vindicated," he said.</p>
              <p>  Mother of two Carol Soh, 41, said 'I believe in my leaders... even though there might be some things happening to our leaders, we learn from it, and we want to move forward in the same direction'.</p>
              <p>  Many said they supported the church's vision of reaching out to the secular world through the music of Mr Kong's wife, Ms Ho Yeow Sun, popularly known as Sun Ho.</p>
              <p>  A businessman who wanted to be known only as Mr Oh, 37, said The Crossover Project "started with good intentions to reach out."</p>
              <p>  He added: "I am still supportive as we've seen the fruits of the project, with thousands benefiting both here and overseas. As a church, I would like us to move forward and go on."</p>
              <p>  The parishioners said they were aware that their tithe money - typically 10 per cent of their income - was helping Ms Ho propel her music career, but added they had not been told how much was being used for this.</p>
              <p>  That some $23 million was used to fund her career did not rattle their faith, they said. While the amount was big, Ms Ho did relatively well in the American music scene, they pointed out.</p>
              <p>  Members said there had not been any sign that anything was amiss in recent weeks. Pastor Kong had led the service on Sunday with Ms Ho in attendance.</p>
              <p>  Support for the pastor poured in online after the news broke, with many taking to Twitter and Facebook to express this. Many of those interviewed saw the episode as an opportunity for the church to learn and grow as a family.</p>
              <p>  Entrepreneur Elim Chew, 45, said: "City Harvest has been my family for 21 years and a family comes together in challenging times... The church has a capable team that will be able to lead the church through this time."</p>
              <p>  The church's executive pastor Aries Zulkarnian, 39, is understood to be at the helm. A founding member, he was left to lead the church after the departure of executive pastor Derek Dunn last December.</p>
              <p>  In a statement posted on the church's website at about 8pm, Mr Zulkarnian did not refer to the arrests of the five members. He just said they had been "informed to attend court tomorrow", and that "there is no case that is being brought against the Church".</p>
              <p>  He said the church's advisory committee, comprising Dr Phil Pringle, founder of Christian City Church in Sydney, and Dr A.R. Bernard, founder of Christian Cultural Centre in New York, will continue to provide "spiritual leadership". "Church operations and cell group meetings will continue as usual, including all weekend services at Singapore Expo and Jurong West," he said.</p>
              <p>  A spokesman said Mr Zulkarnain and the management board will take over the management and daily running of the church.</p>
              <p>  It is understood that the church's original 10-member management board is now down to seven, following the suspensions of Pastor Kong Hee, Mr Tan Ye Peng and Mr John Lam Leng Hung, who were arrested yesterday.</p>
              <p>  The Straits Times understands that Dr Pringle will arrive today and will preach this weekend.</p>
