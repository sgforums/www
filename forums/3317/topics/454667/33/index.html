              I think you are conflating two issues here. That donors entrust the monies to management to use it for right purposes is separate from the issue of management keeping proper records for accounting or audit purposes.

              <p>But one issue I don't understand is why some christians
              donate a good part of their wealth to the church. Its not small
              sum, it is like, some of them save $10,000 and then thinking of
              using for other means like deposit for house or that new car, then
              one day the pastor preaching, say there is a need for new building
              fund or some ministry in some desolate area - they decide to
              channel the money to the church. They tell me its for the extension
              of their kingdom in heaven.</p>
              <p>When this money go into the pockets of the pastors, there is
              great great temptation for abuse of power. There is ABSOLUTELY no
              accountability. They don't audit their accounts at all. I got a
              friend (an ex gf) who works as an accountant at a big church, she
              tells me that there is no control on where the expenses go to. No
              signatory, no authorisation letter. The pastor just tell her to
              deposit this money or that money into this anonymous bank account
              or pass large swarths of cash to this certain leader of the
              ministry. All this goes on without the knowledge of the
              congregation.</p>
              <p>Unlike the big listed corporations, they have internal audit and
              proper controls in place to ensure no abuse of power and money.
              Churches have none of this.</p>
              <p>This Kong Hee case is a good development. At least the
              singaporean government have laws to protect the congregation.</p>
              <p>In malaysia, the govt don't bother as long as its not a
              government bribery case. So the churches here can go anything they
              want with the money. Last year christmas, I was forced to attend
              the church by my christian boss (but I still remain truthful to
              buddhism), just out of respect for other religions. So during the
              service, I watch them pass the offering bag around. But I refuse to
              give a cent. Even when they say its for a good cause, money goes
              out to help the orphanages, the poor and the homeless. But how much
              of this money really goes to the underprivaledge? before it
              channels and end up into pockets of pastors and senior church
              leaders? City Harvest is a good example of abuse of money.</p>

              <p>Many churches collect tithes and offerings that go towards the

              <p>I think the problem with CHC is that monies earmarked for
              specific purposes were used for other purposes and there was no
              transparency. Perhaps had they initially asked for monies to be
              donated specifically FOR Sun Ho's music career they could used it

              ongoing court troubles of five City Harvest Church (CHC) leaders. <br><br>The
               FOP, which attracts members from more than 30 churches in Singapore, 
              brings together performers from overseas in a glitzy presentation. <br><br>Its well-attended shows are also said to be one of the most important events in the local Christian community. <br><br>But in a letter addressed to followers
               on its Facebook page last Friday, the event's founder and president, 
              Canon James Wong announced the cancellation of what would have been the 
              26th edition of the concert.  <br><br>"It is with the heaviest of hearts that the Committee announces that Festival of Praise 2012 has been cancelled," he wrote.<br><br>Wong also pointed to the implication of CHC founder Kong Hee in a court case as the reason for the festival's cancellation.<br><br>"As
               you might know, Rev. Kong and City Harvest Church are currently 
              undergoing a challenging period. In view of this situation, the 
              Committee has decided not to go ahead with this year's Festival," Wong 
              said.<br><br>The Festival of Praise concert this year was supposed to be
               held at the CHC auditorium at Suntec City as its usual venue, the 
              Singapore Indoor Stadium, is not available for rental this year. <br><br>Kong
               is the executive director of the FOP, as he has been for the past few 
              years. According to Wong, besides offering its venue, CHC had also 
              offered manpower for hospitality, ushering and security duties for the 
              festival. <br><br>Last month, Kong and four senior CHC leaders were charged in court
               for allegedly misappropriating church funds amounting to $50 million. 
              They are out on bail of $500,000 each and their passports have been 
              impounded. They will next appear in court on 25 July. <br><br>With that 
              in mind, Wong urged, "We ask you to keep Rev. Kong Hee and City Harvest 
              Church in prayer — they have faithfully served and supported the 
              Festival of Praise for many years, so let us unite and support our 
              brothers and sisters in Christ in this time of need."<br><br>News of the
               festival's cancellation came as a surprise to regular attendees, with 
              many leaving comments of "sadness" and "disappointment" on the Facebook 
              page. <br><br>But in response to some of these comments, organisers 
              said: "It is not just about Rev Kong. His staff and members are heavily 
              involved in this year's FOP. For the best interest of the church 
              members, the Committee has decided to cancel for this year."<br><br>Still,
               some Christians that Yahoo! Singapore spoke they were looking forward 
              to this year's show and are shocked by the latest development. <br><br>One
               of them, assistant creative director Sonny Lim, 37, attended last 
              year's show at the Indoor Stadium with his wife and was eager to go 
              again this year. <br><br>"It was entertaining, enlightening and a great 
              opportunity for us to get together to praise our faith, so not having 
              the chance to go again this year is disappointing," Lim said. <br><br>Attempts by Yahoo! Singapore to reach CHC for comments were unsuccessful.</p>

              <p>I am a Christian and am praying for Kong Hee...that he goes to jail for a long time!</p>
              <p>He is a dangerous con man fleecing the flock by twisting scriptures and using a centuries old deception based on Catholic indulgences, aka "tithing". He misinterprets the word of God. He's too dangerous to not be locked up!<br>Friends, God does NOT want your money-He wants your heart and love. That's all!</p>
              <p>Tithing is Old Testament Law that passed away when Jesus nailed the law to the cross. He fulfilled the law and His new commandment is to Love God and love your neighbour as yourself.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, KOng Hee just loves himself and Sun Ho's music career.</p>

              <p>I have an impt meeting to attend.  When the agenda came out, I saw the date, I knew the date looked familiar.  sekali it's the date that the five CHC members return to court.  sigh.  I wonder if there will be a big crowd though.  It's not very big in the courtroom.  only a few rows of benches nia.  many will have to stand outside and wait.  I bet many seats will be choop by reporters at an early hour, followed by the followers.</p>
