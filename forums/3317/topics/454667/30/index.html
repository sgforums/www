              <p>Which is why until 25 July comes I think people are just recycling old news.</p>
              <p>About how successful a church is, I think as a Christian I do not look at numbers and growth alone. But unfortunately the "Big is Better" mentality has taken a hold on many churches who strive to be bigger and mega in their setup. Such was NOT the mentality of the early church. There went about preaching the Gospel not to draw members into their church buildings on Sundays, for they had no church buildings. But yet they effectively turned the world upside down with their Gospel. And being persecuted at times it was anything but health and wealth.</p>

              <p>All we have to go on today is the CHCSA website.</p>
              <p>CHCSA is presented on the CHC website as the official community services organisation of CHC.</p>
              <p>CHCSA has published the financial statements on <a href="http://www.chcsa.org.sg/2012/financial_statements.htm">http://www.chcsa.org.sg/2012/financial_statements.htm</a></p>
              <p>From this we learn that (ignoring the cross-over of financial years) that following was spent on <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Local Charity</span>:</strong><br>2008-2009: 327,000 SGD <br>2009-2010: 72,000 SGD</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Based on the 70+ million received, I would not say this is charity???<br>Definitely nothing to brag about...</p>
              <p> </p>

                  most successful , so to speak , pastor.</p>
              <p>Unless if the pastor is so anointed and his success comes as a
                  result of his anointment, and growth comes as a result, then it is
                  only natural that as long as the message is effective to this
                  society of the lost, the pastor deserve every single bit of the
                  success.     However, this is not easy, as I
                  see many pastors falling into the same trap all over
                  again.   Perhaps this is the only way for us to see the
                  counterfeit and being able to differentiate it from the
                  original.</p>

              <p>And I won't agree that CHC has simplistically "benefitted countless people" because it has also taken untold sums from its members, a majority of whom are minors.</p>

              <p>Yes, "big is better " mentality has taken a hold on the church leaders ...agreed ..in fact for Singapore, there is no need to build big buildings.. look at so many buildings that are under utilized during the weekends and what the church needed is some kind of creativity... and you know whether they need to build even bigger buildings....</p>
              <p>Yes, proof is needed for the "good that CHC has done". looking at those numbers presented, it seems that  there is poor stewardship of the money being allocated to the respective causes.   The issue is poor allocation.   Unless poor allocation leads to mistakes and mistakes leads to mischief which eventually leads to misappropriation.   What I was pointing out that in the initally years of CHC, they are well known to every youth (which has Christian background) in town.  The youth found a new meaning and relevance in going to church to worship.   That is already a big achievement and cannot be measured in terms of funds allocation.   Many churches have failed in reaching to the next generation and CHC has in a way succeeded.   Hence, I measure this by the fruits.   In other aspect, I measure it according to motivation.   If the motivation behind the "give more" sermons is to accumulate more funds for the church so that they can squander and allocate wrongly to the inappropriate causes, then the motivation is wrong.   If the motive is for the benefits of the individual , then it is a different story.    The result of big funds coming in is as a result of the right sermon.  </p>
              <p>I have helped youth in the past and have big problems dealing with committees in churches who are too conservative and irrelevant in reaching to today's youth.   What CHC has achieved , just by looking at their sheer youth population mix already put many churches to shame.   However, the issue here about CHC is mis-management and probably poor stewardship since the wrong doing is not yet proven in court.</p>
              <p>So, we should instead help them back to the right motivation back in their early days. Where things are much simpler and motives are pure.</p>

              <p>That the majority of the church goers are youths or young adults certainly adds to the vibrancy of their weekly services which is also a main selling...err...attraction point of churches like CHC. But I think it is also this youth aspect that worries some people, who are of the view that young people are impressionable, naive, gullible even, and prone to "idol" worship, if you get my drift.</p>
              <p>Going back to the early days is good. But what I think is better (and Biblical), not just for CHC but for believers in general, is going way back to when the church was young. <a href="http://www.alanknox.net/2010/12/when-the-church-was-young/">http://www.alanknox.net/2010/12/when-the-church-was-young/</a></p>

              <p>Some are christians  and some worship other gods.     Pernarakan christians can be superstitious to the point that they believe the good fengshuiof ancestors leads to allowing the next generation onwards to continue to flourish.</p>
