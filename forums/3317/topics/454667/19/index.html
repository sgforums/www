                  It is not a matter of supppression of Chinese education. The
                  problem with the education system was they neglected ethics and
                  civics as a subject . The focus was so much on the sciences that
                  they forgot to teach the young to live as decent human beings with
                  a conscience to know right from wrong and good from bad. It now so
                  bad- that even if they commit a wrong they also feel justified in
                  doing the wrong they do! So you see the consequences of what is
                  happening- Singapura - the new Corrupted Hub-(look at the number of
                  cases involving all these high profile people) Now for every case
                  apprehended there is very possibly another 10 to 20 undetected
                  cases, some maybe more or less in terms of the amounts involved-
                  but still wrongs of society!
                  When conscience and common decency fails to exists and not nurtured in people, then Greed is all encompassing and self  justifiable-why do you think the necessity to" pay people not to be corrupt?" Isn't that concept  itself so corrupt a concept? The altruistic notions  of honour , integrity,  sacrifice, give way to self- justification for greed and selfcentredness!

              <p>this has nothing to do with relirion or what.</p>
              <p>when people have access to lots of money they ever have not in life - its a test of their mind and willpower to resist the temtation. as usual their church people will al;ways show support of thos shit, even if they do worng lah, what forgive and forget. i think in the manner our buddhisma nd taoism religion has a better way tp tackle.</p>

              <p>ask his devotees to donate their hard earned money, as if the 10% month tithes is not already enough, to enrich themselves so that they can stay in Sentosa Cove, travel in first class overseas etc. dun they have shame on themselves, enriching their lifestye at the expense of their devotees money. how much money do Kong Hee and Sun draw monthly salary from the church?</p>
              <p>its no longer a religion already, its a business. the church should not be exempted from corporate taxes no more.</p>

I think he is earning much more than as compared when he is working in the private sector. this is even better than starting his own business, ripping off tens of millions of their devotees monthly 10% tithes.

                  You will be surprise such people sleep very well.  You can only sleep badly if you have a conscience to feel guilty. The rot that is pervading our society is really  frighteningly bad. There is nothing wrong with  such leaders living  in  decent accomodation  and accorded a decent standard of living, but living in abject luxury  and yet have the gall to preach about  God' s mission and telling the  multitude  that follows your sermon to tighten their belts and sell their homes....for the cause quite another thing! frightful ! frightful!

              No not necessarily so.  Even if consicence exist , there will stil be temptations and crimes. The only difference is: the ones commiting such crimes  know themselves- they  have committed a wrong because they have conscience., and thus perhaps repentance takes place. However these days  people who commit wrongs actually still believe for some self justifying reasons they are right and are unrepentant. Or they blame society for their  circumstances.
              Someone comented about  skin being thick. Indeed this is so , becuase people with no conscience also have no sense of shame Which is why, in teaching values  in schools we cannot molly coddle kids too much . Some modern western educational psychologists tells you  "oh we mustn't make the kid lose self worth so  we mustn't shame them publicly - so no caning publicly etc." This to me , is crap shit. If the child  has done a grave error ( e.g stealing or forging parents signature) at say  age 10 years and above( by then you assume he knows what is wrong and right having been taught ethics and civic and has a conscience) caning in front of the school is ok! " Hopefully the shame will deter him ever doing something like that which he already knows is wrong anyway. If we don't instil the sens of shame in doing wrong, he graduates to being bolder and then one day he may have to meet up with Daljit Singh -for his 3 or 6 strokes of the rotan in Changi!

              <h1 class="headline">Concerned parents of City Harvest youths turn up for service</h1>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span>Even as thousands continued to show up at City Harvest Church at
              their second English service this weekend, caution has started to seep into
              parts of its congregation about church donations. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span>Several adults were seen accompanying their teenaged children
              during the service but remaining seated and silent throughout the service. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span>When Yahoo! spoke to some outside the conference hall, they said
              they were not churchgoers but parents of youths who attended service regularly. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span>“I’m still okay with my son going for service at CHC – he’s grown
              up and it’s his choice, but I was worried when I found out you could make
              donations through credit card – he uses our supplementary card and I’m not
              comfortable with him donating to a church that I personally wish was more
              accountable.” said a bank executive, 56, who wanted to be known as Mr Lim. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span>Another parent, Mdm Sally Low, 48, said she had attended to “hear
              Pastor Kong’s side of the story”. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span>“The newspapers are saying one thing, but my daughter says it’s
              not true. So I’m here to make sure my daughter doesn’t anyhow (sic) believe
              everything she hears.” said the mother of a 16-year-old churchgoer.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span>The service at Singapore Expo was predictably
               packed, with every
              seat in the 8000 capacity hall filled and “overflowing rooms” nearby 
              occupied by hundreds of other supporters and curious onlookers. <span> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span>In a repeat of yesterday’s two-hour service, the same two
              testimonies were delivered by a member with the Crossover Project and a back up
              dancer who attributed her conversion to Christianity to Sun and the opportunity
              to perform on her controversial music video, China Wine. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span>Kong and Sun were seen to tear several times while speaking to the
              crowd and singing worship songs, but looked considerably more comfortable than
              their first, tense appearance yesterday evening when Kong spoke up publicly for
              the first time to declare that he maintained his integrity. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span>Most CHC members declined to comment when approached after the
              service, only saying that they were “standing by Pastor Kong” and “didn’t want
              to feed the media frenzy”. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span>During Saturday’s service, Kong had told the congregation that he
              would be putting off hospital visits and meeting sessions for “a few weeks”,
              explaining that he wanted to avoid a situation where reporters might tail him
              in hospitals and inconvenience those he was there to help. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span>“We know that whatever we say, people will judge us. So we just
              pray that his innocence will come to light – as long as we believe, it doesn’t
              matter what people outside the church think.” said 16-year-old Annie Tsang, who
              was seen crying emotionally when Kong took to the stage to thank his flock for
              their prayers and support on Sunday morning. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span>CHC has thrown its weight behind its founder Kong Hee and the four
              other key members who were charged Wednesday over alleged misuse of the charity’s
              funds.<br><br>In a statement released by executive pastor Aries
              Zulkarnain on Thursday evening, the church stated that it is standing by the
              five individuals. </span></p>
              <p class="first"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">"The
              people currently in the news are our pastors and trusted staff and leaders who
              have always put God and CHC first," he said. "As a church we stand
              with them and I believe fully in their integrity."<br><br> The statement also said that Kong, 47, and his deputy pastor Tan Ye Peng, 39,
              who both face charges of criminal breach of trust, will continue preaching at
              the megachurch.<br><br> Addressing the current charges that stand against the five accused
              leaders, Zulkarnain maintained that the church did not lose any money in the transactions
              detailed in the charges, which list two separate amounts of S$24 million and a
              further S$26.6 million.<br><br> "The S$24 million, which went into investment bonds, was returned to the
              church in full, with interest... The church did not lose any funds in the
              relevant transactions, and no personal profit was gained by the individuals
              concerned," he said. <br><br> In response to the church’s statement, the Attorney-General’s Chambers (AGC)
              said, “We wish to reiterate that as criminal charges are now before the court
              and will be subject to adjudication by the court; and that as such, neither the
              prosecution nor any other party should comment on issues which will be subject
              to adjudication and on which evidence will be led in court.”</span></p>
