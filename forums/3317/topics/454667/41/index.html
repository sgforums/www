              <p>City Harvest Church has been warned by the Commissioner of 
              Charities (COC) about its employees' efforts to raise funds to pay the 
              legal fees of its leaders facing criminal charges in court.</p>
              <p>At issue is a donation form which surfaced this month seeking funds as a "personal gift" to the six people charged so far.</p>
              <p>Dated Aug 6, the form states that the donations would be deposited into the bank accounts of two City Harvest Church pastors.</p>
              <p>In response to The Straits Times' queries, COC said that it had 
              informed the church that neither it nor its employees may be involved in
               raising funds for the legal expenses for the accused.</p>
              <p>The commissioner also said that it had earlier issued a restriction 
              order to the church's board to stop them from using church funds for the
               same reason.</p>
              <p>City Harvest Church, however, said that the donation form - which had
               been circulated as recently as last week - was no longer being used.</p>
              <p>It said the pastors involved have relinquished their roles in the 
              effort, and added that the church was unaware of any new fund-raising 
              efforts that are currently taking place.</p>
              <p>Employees from the church have mounted fund-raising efforts ever since their church leaders were charged in June this year.</p>

              <p><strong>Commissioner of Charities' response</strong></p>
              <p>"The Commissioner of Charities' (COC) office had earlier issued a 
              Restriction Order to the Board of City Harvest Church (CHC) to restrict 
              CHC from paying the legal fees of the six accused persons and entering 
              into transactions relating to payment of services to the suspended 
              individuals and their related entities, without the approval of the COC.</p>
              <p>The COC has informed CHC that the church and/or its employees should

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;">Do not miss the odds at the end…</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">--------------------------------</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">I know a little bit about the Law here, so here's my 2 cents
              worth.  All this of course is very
              subjective and should in no way be construed as acts of guilt of the part of
              the accused. The prosecution is duty bound to proof its case beyond a
              reasonable doubt, not just raise some doubt.<br> <br> However I think you mixing UK justice system with ours. Here plea bargaining
              rarely occurs at the arrest stage by police (CAD in this case). Here once a
              report is made against you (which had to be the case, CAD dont just go
              investigating people for fun). The police will look at the merits of the
              report, interview the complainant and record his statement. If any allegation
              of a crime is made out, they will then take the next steps, either call up the
              parties named or it's serious enough, launch a raid to prevent further offences
              and to seize case property. This is not done haphazardly. The CAD Director
              would almost certainly be informed and a task force or team formed to look at
              the issue. Normally the AG's Chambers (prosecution) is not consulted at this
              stage, police investigations are solely the purview of the police. Plus unlike
              the UK, the Laws here provide sufficient powers to the police as far as
              warrants are concerned. (No need for a judge to issue a search or arrest
              warrant).</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">So the CAD could do a few things, either call the parties
              named for the interview or arrest them. I think they did the former, called up
              KH, and of course for something like this, can't be a 1 man job, so others who
              knew or had access to the funds would also be called up. Even those not named
              initially. <br> <br> Their statements recorded and their versions listed down. Of course at some
              stage an arrest would have to be made (technically on paper, doesn't mean they
              have to be the lock-up), that would explain the long hours they spent at
              Cantonment. No lawyer would be present at police investigation stage. Over the
              next days, weeks or months, items such documentation etc would be seized or
              asked to be turned over. <br> After all these, the persons would be told they can either go back and wait to
              be called again if a decision is made or to clarify certain issues, or released
              on bail pending the decision. In any case the bail would allowed to lapse (if
              it takes more than a month or more as happened here). Their passports could be
              impounded if necessary (not done here).<br> <br> After all this, the CAD would review the evidence, statements of accused,
              victims and complainants. If it is clear cut, a decision would be made to
              charge or drop the case. But since this was more complex, they would study it
              further and at this stage, the case would referred to the Public Prosecutor
              (the AG) and a DPP(s) assigned to review it. <br> Now this is totally at the hands of the DPP at this stage, no plea bargaining
              yet. The DPP will decide if their is sufficient evidence to charge them ( 1, 2
              or all) in court. <br> of course other persons would also be called up. <br> <br> Now here is where your next part comes in. If all of them are in denial, then
              would out rightly deny the charges. But if 1 or 2 are not, they may have
              co-operated with the investigations. 5 were charged here, maybe more than 5
              were called up or accused at that stage. Depending on their degree of
              wrong-doing, the DPP, might not want charge the others, if they were helpful in
              investigations and agreed to testify for the prosecution. But these 5 probably
              did not help or were in the DPP's view, the main players and had to be charged
              no matter what.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Once the DPP has decided to charged them (from whatever
              total of persons under investigation) in court, they would have be arrested
              officially again and kept in the lock-up. Finger-printed and all that. A
              cautioned statement must be recorded, where the charges are officially read to
              the accused and they are asked if they want to say anything, which must be
              recorded down and will be tendered in court. Of course KH and gang are no mugs,
              they would have had legal advise, and told to deny the charges and say nothing
              else.<br> <br> Thereafter they would be released on court bail to attend court soonest
              (usually the next day). They would then be charged in court and a new bail
              would be fixed by the Court (500k here) and their passports impounded. This is
              called the 1st mention, and the charges would be read in open court and their
              pleas noted, guilty or claim trial. They would be allowed to engaged a lawyer
              and another mention date would be fixed usually 2-4 weeks later (25th June). <br> <br> On the 25th, they would have time to consult their lawyers and the lawyers
              would take it from there, normally they would ask for more time to review the
              charges and to make representations to the AG's Chambers (the DPP in charge of
              the case). The case would then be fixed for pre-trial conference (PTC). There
              would a few procedural appearances at this PTC stage, where the DPP has to
              present the evidence the want to use in the case to the defense and the list of
              witnesses. This whole thing could take 3-6 months. In the interim, here is
              where the plea bargaining can take place.<br> <br> The respective lawyers would make representations based on the evidence
              reviewed to drop certain charges or offer to plead guilty to a lighter one.
              Since all 5 have different counsel (I think), this becomes interesting. What if
              1 or more of them, decide that ok, yes, we did something wrong and will plead
              guilty? Or are advised to do so by their lawyers after an offer from the DPP?<br> <br> Or if 1 or more decide to shoulder all the blame and exonerate the others? So
              many factors can come into play. For that matter KH, could be totally innocent
              of the charge in that he didn't know or approve of the transfers etc, and this
              was done by his subordinates trying to do 'good' in their own view. Maybe even
              the subordinates did what they did without any criminal intent to deceive. Or
              that they only committed procedural violations of false declaration (still an
              offence but not cheating).<br> <br> But after all this, say all of them stick to their guns and claim innocence,
              then a date would be set for a trial. I think will only take place in late
              December or early 2013. But if some of them plead guilty, then they would be
              sentenced first and they could then be called up to testify in the trial of the
              others, and their admission of guilt will be placed on record and used as
              evidence against the others.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">There's so many other things to write about, but I think, I
              shall stop here for the moment. On a lighter side, I've decided to 'act like a
              bookmaker ala William Hill et al' as they do in the UK, who would offer odds
              for something like this. <br> Of course this is purely for fun, and in no way am I gonna gamble or accept
              bets on this.<br> <br> Verdict only<br> -----------------------------------------</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>My opening odds</strong> would be (only for Kong Hee)<br> <br> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Innocent (Acquitted of all the charges) 15-1<br> Convicted of 1 or 2 charges but not all. 5-2<br> Convicted on all charges. 3-1</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><br> A plea of guilt would naturally count as a conviction.<br> Total Sentences to serve(if found guilty):<br> <br> 0 - 5 years. 33-1 <br> &gt; 5 years - 7 years. 15-1<br> &gt; 7 years to 10 years. 7-6<br> &gt; 10 years - 13 years. 11-8<br> &gt; 13 - 15 years. 7-1<br> &gt; 15 years - 20 years. 33-1<br> *20 years and above. 100-1<br> #Life 500-1.<br> <br> Total sentence only refers to consecutive sentences. If for example he gets 5
              years for each charge (total 15), but only 2 are consecutive (the other
              concurrent), that means his total sentence is only 10 years. Likewise if he get
              7 years for 1 charge and the other 2 are taken into consideration (TIC) or 7
              years concurrent, his sentence is only 7 years in total.<br> <br> *The maximum for his charge is up to 20 years (and life). So he can only be
              sentenced to 20 years on each charge, but if 2 are consecutive, he can go above
              the 20 years mark, eg, he gets 11 years + 11 years = 22 years.<br> <br> # If the sentence for 1 charge is life, the others, x numbers years, the total
              sentence to serve is only the life sentence. <br> (Life sentence in Singapore means life in the ordinary term, but after 20 year
              mark there might be a periodical review after a certain numbers years to grant
              a release)<br> <br> Just to add, neither he nor any of the others are likely to get life in my
              view. (the case is at the Sub Courts, only the High Court can impose the life
              term, of course it can be transferred to High Court for hearing)<br> <br> Even at a High Court hearing it's unlikely he'll get life as a 1st offender, or
              any combination of sentences above 20 years for that matter. Though of course I
              can be wrong. <br> <br> My take is 3 possible scenarios:<br> <br> 1. He is acquitted entirely. Somebody else gets the can<br> <br> 2. He's convicted on 1 or 2 charges only and gets 7 - 10 years in total.<br> <br> 3. He's convicted on all 3 and gets &gt;10 - 13 years</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">No, I am not a lawyer. Did work in the Police for a short
              time (7 years), in lieu of NS. Once you join uniformed group and serve for 5
              straight years, you've considered to have served your NS liabilities. I would
              have rather served NS but the pay was way too low then (about $200 + or -), and
              I had to support myself and contribute to the family, so becoming a regular was
              the best option. Plus we were in a recession then (just after the 1987 stock
              market crash). Not many jobs around, so the Civil Service offered some job
              security.<br> <br> But this knowledge about the Law was gained both by my time in the Police and
              by keeping abreast of the Law thereafter. <br> On a brighter note, I am pleased to inform you (if you haven't heard already),
              our 'beloved Govt' (I'm sure you can take a hint), has finally decided to
              review the mandatory death penalty here.<br> <br> So hopefully we will see lesser cases of stupid young drug mules, sentenced to
              death, like the unfortunate cases of the young Viet Australian boy, another
              Tamil Malaysian and now another Malaysian Chinese (I think), whose lawyer is
              trying his level best to get him off the ropes (sorry for the gallows humour).<br> <br> There are now 35 persons on death row in Singapore, let's hope and pray that
              many, if not all, are able to get their sentences commuted to life.<br> I am not totally against the death penalty, I do believe that some offenders
              are too hardcore, callous, depraved and evil to be allowed to live and worse
              still, maybe 1 day be released to society.<br> <br> For aggravated murder (especially after rape and torture, brutality against
              children) and other serious cases like kidnapping for ransom, which involves a
              degree of planning, wanton terrorism against innocent civilians, I think the
              death penalty is the best available punishment and deterrence. Even for the
              unlawful discharge of a firearm (or explosive) in order to commit crime. This
              gun law has made Singapore really safe from gun crime, I don't think we've had
              a case since the '1 eyed dragon case' 5 years or so ago, whereas we this
              occurring quite regularly across the border.<br> <br> Sorry for being too long winded, once I start, it's so hard to stop!</p>

              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: The Commissioner of Charities (COC) said it has 
              informed City Harvest Church that the church or its employees should not
               be involved in raising funds for the legal expenses of their founder 
              and five others embroiled in the court case.</span></span></p>

              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The COC had earlier

              <p style="line-height: normal;">Do not miss the odds at
              the end…</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>--------------------------------</p>
              <p>I know a little bit about the Law here, so here's my 2
              cents worth.  All this of course is very subjective and should
              in no way be construed as acts of guilt of the part of the accused.
              The prosecution is duty bound to proof its case beyond a reasonable
              doubt, not just raise some doubt.<br> <br> However I think you mixing UK justice system with ours. Here plea
              bargaining rarely occurs at the arrest stage by police (CAD in this
              case). Here once a report is made against you (which had to be the
              case, CAD dont just go investigating people for fun). The police
              will look at the merits of the report, interview the complainant
              and record his statement. If any allegation of a crime is made out,
              they will then take the next steps, either call up the parties
              named or it's serious enough, launch a raid to prevent further
              offences and to seize case property. This is not done haphazardly.
              The CAD Director would almost certainly be informed and a task
              force or team formed to look at the issue. Normally the AG's
              Chambers (prosecution) is not consulted at this stage, police
              investigations are solely the purview of the police. Plus unlike
              the UK, the Laws here provide sufficient powers to the police as
              far as warrants are concerned. (No need for a judge to issue a
              search or arrest warrant).</p>
              <p>So the CAD could do a few things, either call the
              parties named for the interview or arrest them. I think they did
              the former, called up KH, and of course for something like this,
              can't be a 1 man job, so others who knew or had access to the funds
              would also be called up. Even those not named
              initially. <br> <br> Their statements recorded and their versions listed down. Of course
              at some stage an arrest would have to be made (technically on
              paper, doesn't mean they have to be the lock-up), that would
              explain the long hours they spent at Cantonment. No lawyer would be
              present at police investigation stage. Over the next days, weeks or
              months, items such documentation etc would be seized or asked to be
              turned over. <br> After all these, the persons would be told they can either go back
              and wait to be called again if a decision is made or to clarify
              certain issues, or released on bail pending the decision. In any
              case the bail would allowed to lapse (if it takes more than a month
              or more as happened here). Their passports could be impounded if
              necessary (not done here).<br> <br> After all this, the CAD would review the evidence, statements of
              accused, victims and complainants. If it is clear cut, a decision
              would be made to charge or drop the case. But since this was more
              complex, they would study it further and at this stage, the case
              would referred to the Public Prosecutor (the AG) and a DPP(s)
              assigned to review it. <br> Now this is totally at the hands of the DPP at this stage, no plea
              bargaining yet. The DPP will decide if their is sufficient evidence
              to charge them ( 1, 2 or all) in court. <br> of course other persons would also be called up. <br> <br> Now here is where your next part comes in. If all of them are in
              denial, then would out rightly deny the charges. But if 1 or 2 are
              not, they may have co-operated with the investigations. 5 were
              charged here, maybe more than 5 were called up or accused at that
              stage. Depending on their degree of wrong-doing, the DPP, might not
              want charge the others, if they were helpful in investigations and
              agreed to testify for the prosecution. But these 5 probably did not
              help or were in the DPP's view, the main players and had to be
              charged no matter what.</p>
              <p>Once the DPP has decided to charged them (from whatever
              total of persons under investigation) in court, they would have be
              arrested officially again and kept in the lock-up. Finger-printed
              and all that. A cautioned statement must be recorded, where the
              charges are officially read to the accused and they are asked if
              they want to say anything, which must be recorded down and will be
              tendered in court. Of course KH and gang are no mugs, they would
              have had legal advise, and told to deny the charges and say nothing
              else.<br> <br> Thereafter they would be released on court bail to attend court
              soonest (usually the next day). They would then be charged in court
              and a new bail would be fixed by the Court (500k here) and their
              passports impounded. This is called the 1st mention, and the
              charges would be read in open court and their pleas noted, guilty
              or claim trial. They would be allowed to engaged a lawyer and
              another mention date would be fixed usually 2-4 weeks later (25th
              June). <br> <br> On the 25th, they would have time to consult their lawyers and the
              lawyers would take it from there, normally they would ask for more
              time to review the charges and to make representations to the AG's
              Chambers (the DPP in charge of the case). The case would then be
              fixed for pre-trial conference (PTC). There would a few procedural
              appearances at this PTC stage, where the DPP has to present the
              evidence the want to use in the case to the defense and the list of
              witnesses. This whole thing could take 3-6 months. In the interim,
              here is where the plea bargaining can take place.<br> <br> The respective lawyers would make representations based on the
              evidence reviewed to drop certain charges or offer to plead guilty
              to a lighter one. Since all 5 have different counsel (I think),
              this becomes interesting. What if 1 or more of them, decide that
              ok, yes, we did something wrong and will plead guilty? Or are
              advised to do so by their lawyers after an offer from the
              DPP?<br> <br> Or if 1 or more decide to shoulder all the blame and exonerate the
              others? So many factors can come into play. For that matter KH,
              could be totally innocent of the charge in that he didn't know or
              approve of the transfers etc, and this was done by his subordinates
              trying to do 'good' in their own view. Maybe even the subordinates
              did what they did without any criminal intent to deceive. Or that
              they only committed procedural violations of false declaration
              (still an offence but not cheating).<br> <br> But after all this, say all of them stick to their guns and claim
              innocence, then a date would be set for a trial. I think will only
              take place in late December or early 2013. But if some of them
              plead guilty, then they would be sentenced first and they could
              then be called up to testify in the trial of the others, and their
              admission of guilt will be placed on record and used as evidence
              against the others.</p>
              <p>There's so many other things to write about, but I
              think, I shall stop here for the moment. On a lighter side, I've
              decided to 'act like a bookmaker ala William Hill et al' as they do
              in the UK, who would offer odds for something like
              this. <br> Of course this is purely for fun, and in no way am I gonna gamble
              or accept bets on this.<br> <br> Verdict only<br> -----------------------------------------</p>
              <p><strong>My opening odds</strong> would be (only for
              Kong Hee)<br> &lt;!--[if !supportLineBreakNewLine]--&gt;<br> &lt;!--[endif]--&gt;</p>
              <p>Innocent (Acquitted of all the charges) 15-1<br> Convicted of 1 or 2 charges but not all. 5-2<br> Convicted on all charges. 3-1</p>
              <p><br> A plea of guilt would naturally count as a conviction.<br> Total Sentences to serve(if found guilty):<br> <br> 0 - 5 years. 33-1 <br> &gt; 5 years - 7 years. 15-1<br> &gt; 7 years to 10 years. 7-6<br> &gt; 10 years - 13 years. 11-8<br> &gt; 13 - 15 years. 7-1<br> &gt; 15 years - 20 years. 33-1<br> *20 years and above. 100-1<br> #Life 500-1.<br> <br> Total sentence only refers to consecutive sentences. If for example
              he gets 5 years for each charge (total 15), but only 2 are
              consecutive (the other concurrent), that means his total sentence
              is only 10 years. Likewise if he get 7 years for 1 charge and the
              other 2 are taken into consideration (TIC) or 7 years concurrent,
              his sentence is only 7 years in total.<br> <br> *The maximum for his charge is up to 20 years (and life). So he can
              only be sentenced to 20 years on each charge, but if 2 are
              consecutive, he can go above the 20 years mark, eg, he gets 11
              years + 11 years = 22 years.<br> <br> # If the sentence for 1 charge is life, the others, x numbers
              years, the total sentence to serve is only the life
              sentence. <br> (Life sentence in Singapore means life in the ordinary term, but
              after 20 year mark there might be a periodical review after a
              certain numbers years to grant a release)<br> <br> Just to add, neither he nor any of the others are likely to get
              life in my view. (the case is at the Sub Courts, only the High
              Court can impose the life term, of course it can be transferred to
              High Court for hearing)<br> <br> Even at a High Court hearing it's unlikely he'll get life as a 1st
              offender, or any combination of sentences above 20 years for that
              matter. Though of course I can be wrong. <br> <br> My take is 3 possible scenarios:<br> <br> 1. He is acquitted entirely. Somebody else gets the can<br> <br> 2. He's convicted on 1 or 2 charges only and gets 7 - 10 years in
              total.<br> <br> 3. He's convicted on all 3 and gets &gt;10 - 13 years</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>No, I am not a lawyer. Did work in the Police for a
              short time (7 years), in lieu of NS. Once you join uniformed group
              and serve for 5 straight years, you've considered to have served
              your NS liabilities. I would have rather served NS but the pay was
              way too low then (about $200 + or -), and I had to support myself
              and contribute to the family, so becoming a regular was the best
              option. Plus we were in a recession then (just after the 1987 stock
              market crash). Not many jobs around, so the Civil Service offered
              some job security.<br> <br> But this knowledge about the Law was gained both by my time in the
              Police and by keeping abreast of the Law thereafter. <br> On a brighter note, I am pleased to inform you (if you haven't
              heard already), our 'beloved Govt' (I'm sure you can take a hint),
              has finally decided to review the mandatory death penalty
              here.<br> <br> So hopefully we will see lesser cases of stupid young drug mules,
              sentenced to death, like the unfortunate cases of the young Viet
              Australian boy, another Tamil Malaysian and now another Malaysian
              Chinese (I think), whose lawyer is trying his level best to get him
              off the ropes (sorry for the gallows humour).<br> <br> There are now 35 persons on death row in Singapore, let's hope and
              pray that many, if not all, are able to get their sentences
              commuted to life.<br> I am not totally against the death penalty, I do believe that some
              offenders are too hardcore, callous, depraved and evil to be
              allowed to live and worse still, maybe 1 day be released to
              society.<br> <br> For aggravated murder (especially after rape and torture, brutality
              against children) and other serious cases like kidnapping for
              ransom, which involves a degree of planning, wanton terrorism
              against innocent civilians, I think the death penalty is the best
              available punishment and deterrence. Even for the unlawful
              discharge of a firearm (or explosive) in order to commit crime.
              This gun law has made Singapore really safe from gun crime, I don't
              think we've had a case since the '1 eyed dragon case' 5 years or so
              ago, whereas we this occurring quite regularly across the
              border.<br> <br> Sorry for being too long winded, once I start, it's so hard to
              stop!</p>

              <p>Normally for consecutive and concurrent sentences there are guidelines, but Judges can depart from them, if they have good reasons for doing so (the case is unique, circumstances in them demand it).</p>
              <p>But usually for 3 charges, it's very unlikely for all 3 sentences to be consecutive, unless each are distinct offences, and have different scales of punishment, eg:  1 charge is theft, 2nd is rioting and the 3rd failing to report change of address. Even then having 3 consecutive is unlikely.</p>
              <p>KH will probably only get 2 consecutive or 1 sentence with the other 2 TIC or concurrent.</p>
              <p>Now if he gets only 1 sentence (the other 2 concurrent), the answer to your question is yes, if he appeals and succeeds, the appeal will only be for the 1 taken in sentencing (since the other 2 considered part of the original sentence), and no further sentence will be passed on the other 2.</p>
              <p>If he faced 2 consecutive sentences (the 3rd TIC) and appeals, the High Court can either </p>
              <p>A) Acquit him on both</p>
              <p>B) Acquit on 1 and let the second stand </p>
              <p>The 3rd sentence will not be brought up (he doesn't have to serve it) since it was concurrent. (Usually)</p>
              <p>But this is not firm, as we assume he is making the appeal, the prosecution can also appeal if they are unsatisfied with the sentence.</p>
              <p>Obviously in an appeal, the High Court can increase both, even all 3 sentences, just 1 or make any variation to any sentence it sees fit.</p>
              <p>The High Court can easily vary the sentence to 1 'global sentence' (that encompasses) all 3 charges, so he gets a heavy sentence on 1 with the other 2 TIC. Or it can decrease all sentences, or as you pointed, the High Court can reverse the concurrent charges and make them consecutive, but usually only 2 will be consecutive.</p>
              <p>But they rarely do so (reverse a concurent charge (s)) in a successful appeal by the accused.</p>

              <p>Corruption can happen in institutes of any religion, not just in christian churches and buddhist organisations. No religion is an exception.</p>
              <p>Mosques are also rife with corruption in Malaysia. I had wanted to share these pieces of news with others, BUT was BANNED by some religious BIGOTS.</p>
