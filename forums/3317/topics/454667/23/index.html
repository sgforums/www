              <div class="yom-mod yom-art-content ">
              <div class="bd"><span>Even as thousands continued to show up at City Harvest Church at
              their second English service this weekend, caution has started to seep into
              parts of its congregation about church donations.<br></span><br><span>Several adults were seen accompanying their teenage children
              during the service but remaining seated and silent throughout the service. </span>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span>When Yahoo! spoke to some outside the conference hall, they said
              they were not churchgoers but parents of youths who attended service regularly. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span>“I’m still okay with my son going for service at CHC – he’s grown
              up and it’s his choice, but I was worried when I found out you could <a href="https://secure.chc.org.sg/donation/creditcard/index.asp">make
              donations through credit card </a>– he uses our supplementary card and I’m not
              comfortable with him donating to a church that I personally wish was more
              accountable,” said a bank executive, 56, who wanted to be known as Mr Lim. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span>Another parent, Mdm Sally Low, 48, said she had attended to “hear
              Pastor Kong’s side of the story”. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span>“The newspapers are saying one thing, but my daughter says it’s
              not true. So I’m here to make sure my daughter doesn’t anyhow (sic) believe
              everything she hears,” said the mother of a 16-year-old churchgoer.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span>The service at Singapore Expo was predictably packed, with every
              seat in the 8,000-capacity hall filled and rooms nearby occupied by hundreds of other supporters and curious onlookers. <span> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span>In a repeat of <a href="http://sg.news.yahoo.com/i-maintain-my-integrity--kong-hee.html">Saturday’s two-hour service</a>, the same two
              testimonies were delivered by a member with the Crossover Project and a back-up
              dancer who attributed her conversion to Christianity to Sun and the opportunity
              to perform on her controversial music video, "China Wine". </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span>Kong and Sun were seen to tear several times while speaking to the
              crowd and singing worship songs, but looked considerably more comfortable than
              their first, tense appearance an evening earlier when Kong spoke up publicly for
              the first time to declare that he maintained his integrity. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span>Most CHC members declined to comment when approached after the
              service, only saying that they were “standing by Pastor Kong” and “didn’t want
              to feed the media frenzy”. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span>During Saturday’s service, Kong had told the congregation that he
              would be putting off hospital visits and meeting sessions for “a few weeks”,
              explaining that he wanted to avoid a situation where reporters might tail him
              in hospitals and inconvenience those he was there to help. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span>“We know that whatever we say, people will judge us. So we just
              pray that his innocence will come to light – as long as we believe, it doesn’t
              matter what people outside the church think,” said 16-year-old Annie Tsang, who
              was seen crying emotionally when Kong took to the stage to thank his flock for
              their prayers and support on Sunday morning. </span></p>
              <p class="first"><span>CHC has thrown its weight behind its founder Kong Hee and the four
              other key members who were <a href="http://sg.news.yahoo.com/city-harvest-founder-arrested-for-allegedly-misuing-church-funds.html">charged Wednesday</a> over alleged misuse of the charity’s
              funds.<br><br><a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10150906511472934&amp;set=a.106297597933.96699.93889432933&amp;type=1&amp;theater">In a statement</a> released by executive pastor Aries
              Zulkarnain on Thursday evening, the church stated that it is standing by the
              five individuals.</span><br><br><span style="font-size: 11pt;">"The
              people currently in the news are our pastors and trusted staff and leaders who
              have always put God and CHC first," he said. "As a church we stand
              with them and I believe fully in their integrity."<br><br> The statement also said that Kong, 47, and his deputy pastor Tan Ye Peng, 39,
              who both face charges of criminal breach of trust, will continue preaching at
              the megachurch.<br><br> Addressing <a href="http://sg.news.yahoo.com/city-harvest-founder-arrested-for-allegedly-misuing-church-funds.html">the current charges</a> that stand against the five accused
              leaders, Zulkarnain maintained that the church did not lose any money in the transactions
              detailed in the charges, which list two separate amounts of S$24 million and a
              further S$26.6 million.<br><br> "The S$24 million, which went into investment bonds, was returned to the
              church in full, with interest... The church did not lose any funds in the
              relevant transactions, and no personal profit was gained by the individuals
              concerned," he said. <br><br> In response to the church’s statement, the Attorney-General’s Chambers (AGC)
              said, “We wish to reiterate that as criminal charges are now before the court
              and will be subject to adjudication by the court; and that as such, neither the
              prosecution nor any other party should comment on issues which will be subject
              to adjudication and on which evidence will be led in court.”</span></p>

              <p>I think, generally speaking, if the organisation has "excess" monies not currently needed it can invest in ways that offer better returns than merely parking in banks. This would be good financial stewardship. The point is that such organisations cannot be set up for the sole purpose of making profits.</p>

              <p>While a church can be registered as a charity for tax purposes and other reasons, it is not a charity per se, if you get what I mean. While the church can be charitable, it is not a charity. Most churches today have building funds and seek to own buildings (something the NT church was not fixated over) but since it takes years for the buildings to materialise there will sometimes be "excess" monies from fund raising until the time come for progressive payments to be made to the contractors. </p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">We have audited the financial statements of <span style="color: #993300;"><em>Healthy Children Society
                  Singapore</em></span>, which comprise the balance sheet as at xx December 201x, and the
                  income and expenditure, statement of changes in funds and statement of cash
                  flows for the financial year ended on that date and a summary of significant
                  accounting policies and other explanatory notes, as set out on page x to xx.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>Board of Governors' Responsibility for
                  the Financial Statements</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The Board of Governors is responsible for the preparation of financial
                  statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with Singapore
                  Financial Reporting Standards, and for devising and maintaining a system of
                  internal accounting controls sufficient to provide a reasonable assurance that
                  assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorised use or disposition; and
                  transactions are properly authorised and that they are recorded as necessary to
                  permit the preparation of true and fair profit and loss accounts and balance
                  sheet and to maintain accountability of assets.<span>  </span></span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements
                  based on our audit.<span>  </span>We conducted our
                  audit in accordance with Singapore Standards on Auditing.<span>  </span>Those Standards require that we comply with
                  Ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
                  about whether the financial statements are free from material
                  misstatement.<span>  </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts
                  and disclosures in the financial statements.<span>  </span>The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgements, including
                  the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial
                  statements, whether due to fraud to error.<span>  </span>In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control
                  relevant to the entity’s preparation of financial statements that give a true
                  and fair view in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the
                  circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
                  effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes
                  evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the
                  reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the Board of Governors, as well
                  as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.<span>  </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and
