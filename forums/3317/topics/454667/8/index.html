Any  preacher  who lives a life of luxury and dare to tell me to tithe  and give up material things  for the Kingdom of God..I'll tell him to first surrender  all his own assets first before telling me how to live my life...Amazing grace!

              <p class="submitted"><span>Submitted by <span class="username">therealsingapore</span> on Tue, 06/26/2012 - 21:47</span></p>
              <p></p>
              <p>Dear Editors,</p>
              <p>I am deeply saddened by the reactions of netizens to the arrest of my
               dearest pastor Kong Hee. As a long time member of City Harvest Church, 
              the public clearly does not understand the sacrifices he had to make in 
              the name of God.</p>
              <p>When I first received Sun Ho’s Chinese pop CD in 2003, I thought to 
              myself: “what kind of devil’s music is this?” But as I listened more, it
               began to dawn on me that I was being overly prudish and she was 
              actually spreading the word of God in the form of Satan-worshipping 
              music to beat the devil at his own game.</p>
              <p>Indeed, the more involved I became at the Church, the more I began to
               understand that I could not even begin to comprehend God’s plan and the
               plans pastor Kong had for me, and the church. You see, I am but mortal.
               Pastor Kong was the chosen one.</p>
              <p>Without his light shining like a beacon of conscience, the gays, 
              prostitutes, and the opposition would start to take over Singapore. 
              Satan would then have a hub to take over the world.</p>
              <p>So it was with deep love that I decided to dedicate 30% of my 
              husband’s salary each month to help fund Sun Ho’s music career as part 
              of the Crossover project.</p>
              <p>As a good christian, I have an obligation to The Lord to spread his 
              message: from Singapore to Malaysia, to Taiwan, China and even the town 
              of sin, Hollywood.</p>
              <p>It must have been extremely difficult for pastor Kong to see his wife
               in such disgusting states of undress in public, and for her to live in 
              the heart of the most unholy places on earth, Beverly Hills. I’ve 
              watched the TV series 90210 when I was younger. These people have no 
              morals but like lepers, the Man and Woman of God must go to the sick to 
              heal the sick.</p>
              <p>People outside the church don’t understand us and are so quick to 
              condemn when they haven’t experienced God through His music, sung to 
              thumping beats and a negro man saying something intelligible at the 
              beginning.</p>
              <p>I do not understand how “China wine” or being a Geisha is related to 
              God’s work, but as I said, I’m only mortal. God has a plan, even when I 
              don’t understand. Even when it involves S$23 million. If pastor Kong was
               using that money, it must be God’s will.</p>
              <p>Jesus preaches forgiveness, and therefore we must forgive even if we don’t want to.</p>
              <p>So I forgive the government, and the public for misunderstanding and maligning the Church.</p>
              <p>There’s a special place in hell for people who say nasty things about
               Kong Hee and an even worse one for those that framed God’s chosen 
              workers.</p>
              <p>I pray that it will be like Sodom and Gonorrhea.</p>
              <p>Yours truly,</p>

              <p>There are supposedly 30,000 of them. If the church raised $500M, each gave $16,600 over 10 year or 1660 a year.</p>

              All the good deeds and work done in that church DOES NOT   excuse any abuse  or misappropriation of funds on the part of any single one of its members! For if it does,  then it is as good as  that ,  as long as  a leader and his team engages in many good works ...we should close our eyes to their  weaknesses and faults and even let them take personal advantage of  people's trust in them!  That 's ridiculous!
