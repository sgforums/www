              <h1>Concerned parents of City Harvest youths turn up for
              service</h1>
              <p><span>Even as thousands continued to show up at City
              Harvest Church at their second English service this weekend,
              caution has started to seep into parts of its congregation about
              church donations.</span></p>
              <p><span>Several adults were seen accompanying their
              teenaged children during the service but remaining seated and
              silent throughout the service.</span></p>
              <p><span>When Yahoo! spoke to some outside the conference
              hall, they said they were not churchgoers but parents of youths who
              attended service regularly.</span></p>
              <p><span>“I’m still okay with my son going for service at
              CHC – he’s grown up and it’s his choice, but I was worried when I
              found out you could make donations through credit card – he uses
              our supplementary card and I’m not comfortable with him donating to
              a church that I personally wish was more accountable.” said a bank
              executive, 56, who wanted to be known as Mr Lim.</span></p>
              <p><span>Another parent, Mdm Sally Low, 48, said she had
              attended to “hear Pastor Kong’s side of the story”.</span></p>
              <p><span>“The newspapers are saying one thing, but my
              daughter says it’s not true. So I’m here to make sure my daughter
              doesn’t anyhow (sic) believe everything she hears.” said the mother
              of a 16-year-old churchgoer.</span></p>
              <p><span>The service at Singapore Expo was predictably
              packed, with every seat in the 8000 capacity hall filled and
              “overflowing rooms” nearby occupied by hundreds of other supporters
              and curious onlookers. <span> </span></span></p>
              <p><span>In a repeat of yesterday’s two-hour service, the
              same two testimonies were delivered by a member with the Crossover
              Project and a back up dancer who attributed her conversion to
              Christianity to Sun and the opportunity to perform on her
              controversial music video, China Wine.</span></p>
              <p><span>Kong and Sun were seen to tear several times
              while speaking to the crowd and singing worship songs, but looked
              considerably more comfortable than their first, tense appearance
              yesterday evening when Kong spoke up publicly for the first time to
              declare that he maintained his integrity.</span></p>
              <p><span>Most CHC members declined to comment when
              approached after the service, only saying that they were “standing
              by Pastor Kong” and “didn’t want to feed the media
              frenzy”.</span></p>
              <p><span>During Saturday’s service, Kong had told the
              congregation that he would be putting off hospital visits and
              meeting sessions for “a few weeks”, explaining that he wanted to
              avoid a situation where reporters might tail him in hospitals and
              inconvenience those he was there to help.</span></p>
              <p><span>“We know that whatever we say, people will judge
              us. So we just pray that his innocence will come to light – as long
              as we believe, it doesn’t matter what people outside the church
              think.” said 16-year-old Annie Tsang, who was seen crying
              emotionally when Kong took to the stage to thank his flock for
              their prayers and support on Sunday morning.</span></p>
              <p><span>CHC has thrown its weight behind its founder Kong
              Hee and the four other key members who were charged Wednesday over
              alleged misuse of the charity’s funds.<br> <br> In a statement released by executive pastor Aries Zulkarnain on
              Thursday evening, the church stated that it is standing by the five
              individuals.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">"The people currently in
              the news are our pastors and trusted staff and leaders who have
              always put God and CHC first," he said. "As a church we stand with
              them and I believe fully in their integrity."<br> <br> The statement also said that Kong, 47, and his deputy pastor Tan Ye
              Peng, 39, who both face charges of criminal breach of trust, will
              continue preaching at the megachurch.<br> <br> Addressing the current charges that stand against the five accused
              leaders, Zulkarnain maintained that the church did not lose any
              money in the transactions detailed in the charges, which list two
              separate amounts of S$24 million and a further S$26.6
              million.<br> <br> "The S$24 million, which went into investment bonds, was returned
              to the church in full, with interest... The church did not lose any
              funds in the relevant transactions, and no personal profit was
              gained by the individuals concerned," he said.<br> <br> In response to the church’s statement, the Attorney-General’s
              Chambers (AGC) said, “We wish to reiterate that as criminal charges
              are now before the court and will be subject to adjudication by the
              court; and that as such, neither the prosecution nor any other
              party should comment on issues which will be subject to
              adjudication and on which evidence will be led in
              court.”</span></p>

              Oh and laurence82 deserves special mention as his knowledge of the Bible is below zero, in the negative. And that probably goes for his knowledge of Singapore Constitution too. Duh.
