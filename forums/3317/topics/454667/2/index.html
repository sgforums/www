              <p>you know the charities part?</p>
              <p>the people on top were so successful at fund raising, they forgot what they were about.. after a while, it became nothing more than just fund raising... that became their only goal.. to raise funds.. nothing else mattered for them..</p>
              <p>eventually they looked at the funds as the be-all and end-all of the organisation existence and helped themselves to the funds..</p>
              <p>quite sad...</p>
              <p>but from what i've known about CHC, they never hid the fact that they were just raising funds for themselves.. i wonder why their followers can't see that..</p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; line-height: 18px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: #000000; text-align: left;">Two years ago, on May 31 2010, the Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) started an investigation into certain financial transactions of CHC after receiving information of misuse of CHC funds.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; line-height: 18px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: #000000; text-align: left;">A police spokesman said that after a thorough investigation, the five would be charged with being in a conspiracy to commit criminal breach of trust as an agent. If convicted, each of them could be jailed for life and fined.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; line-height: 18px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: #000000; text-align: left;">Mr Tan, Mr Chew and Ms Sharon Tan, will also be charged with conspiracy to falsify accounts. If convicted, each could be jailed up to 10 years and fined. All five will be charged in court on Wednesday.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; line-height: 18px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: #000000; text-align: left;">In a separate statement, a spokesman for the CoC said it had launched an inquiry into the church on May 31, 2010 under the Charities Act.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; line-height: 18px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: #000000; text-align: left;">Its inquiry revealed misconduct and mismanagement in the administration of the church, particularly in relation to the funds that were in the Building Fund which had been raised and earmarked for specific purposes.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; line-height: 18px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: #000000; text-align: left;">The CoC spokesman said: 'The COC is concerned about the misconduct and mismanagement in the administration of the Charity.'</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; line-height: 18px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: #000000; text-align: left;">With immediate effect, it has suspended the five - along with three others, from holding any post on the church board of management. The three are: executive members Ho Yeow Sun, Kelvin Teo Meng How and Tan Su Pheng Jacqueline. They will be prohibited from taking part or being involved in managing the church, representing it in any matters, or attending any of its Annual General Meetings, Extraordinary General Meetings and Board meetings.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; line-height: 18px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: #000000; text-align: left;">The CoC spokesman added that it will also consider taking further courses of action under the Charities Act against these individuals in order to protect the charitable property of the Charity.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; line-height: 18px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: #000000; text-align: left;">'This may include the removal of these persons from their office as trustee, governing board members, officers, agents or employees of the Charity.'</p>

              along with four others from the mega-church for alleged criminal breach 
              of trust and falsifying church accounts, reported local media.<br><br>Pastor
               Kong, his deputy John Tan Yee Peng and three other key ministry members
               -- Lam Leng Ham, Chew Eng Ham, Sharon Tan -- were arrested at their 
              homes early Tuesday morning and questioned over the alleged misuse of at
               least S$23 million from church funds.<br><br>They have since been released on bail and will be charged in court on Wednesday.<br><br><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>Channel NewsAsia</em> </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">reported that the funds could have allegedly been used to finance the music career of <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=Ho+Yeow+Sun&amp;ei=UTF-8&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;vm=r&amp;cs=bz">Kong's pop-star wife, Ho Yeow Sun</a>.</span></strong><br><br>The
               Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) began its two-year investigation in
               May 2010 after receiving information of misuse of funds. <br><br>The 
              Commissioner of Charities (COC), which launched its own investigation at
               the same time, found there was a “concerted effort to conceal this 
              movement of funds from the charity’s stakeholders.”<br><br>The COC has 
              also suspended eight people, included the five that have been charged. 
              The other three are Ho herself, Kelvin Teo Meng How and Jacqueline Tan 
              Su Pheng.<br><br>Kong, a prolific Twitter user who goes by @konghee, <a href="https://twitter.com/#%21/konghee">last posted a tweet at 
              9am on Tuesday morning</a> with a Bible Psalm in Chinese, translated to "The
               sun will not smite you by day, nor the moon by night. Jesus will 
              protect you from all harm."<br><br>He had spent the previous weekend 
              before his arrest delivering his usual sermons, including one at the 
              Heart of God Church in Paya Lebar.<br><br>Members of City Harvest church reacted with a mix of shock and denial.<br><br>"I
               still believe he will come out spotless from all this -- he's a man of 
              God and we believe in him," said teacher Alicia Goh, 29, who attends the
               church regularly with her husband and two young children.<br><br>"I 
              hope that the rest of the church and their good work will not be brought
               down with him. He is the founder of the church, but he can also make 
              mistakes -- if he has indeed misused our funds, he needs to own up," 
              said retiree Steven Wong, 67, who added that he was "very disappointed" 
              by the news.<br><br>Many of Kong's supporters also took to Twitter to 
              ask for "prayers" for Kong and the senior church ministry members, with 
              one user "Erictan" saying that he was "praying and fasting" for Kong's 
              "protection".<br><br>Other tweets were more sarcastic, with one tweeter 
              saying that Kong had been having too great a "harvest" and that his 
              arrest was an indication that "there is a God".<br><br>City Harvest, which was founded by <a title="Kong Hee" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kong_Hee">Kong Hee</a><sup id="cite_ref-news.asiaone.com_1-1" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_Harvest_Church#cite_note-news.asiaone.com-1"></a></sup> and his wife <a title="Ho Yeow Sun" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ho_Yeow_Sun">Sun Ho</a><sup id="cite_ref-broadpastor_5-0" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_Harvest_Church#cite_note-broadpastor-5"></a></sup> in 1989, is among the largest church congregations in Asia.

              <h1>City Harvest's Crossover Project lies at heart of CoC inquiry</h1>
              <p>At the centre of the inquiry by the Commisioner of Charities (CoC) is
               the City Harvest Church's Crossover Project and the misrepresentation 
              on the use of the charity's fund.</p>
              <p>The project was set up in 2002 purportedly to use Sun Ho's secular music to connect with people and reach out to non-Christians.</p>
              <p>By 2003, it had drawn flak. According to the CoC, an 
              individual alleged in the media that the charity was funding Sun Ho's 
              music career.</p>
              <p>This attracted public attention. Although 
              the person eventually issued a public apology and retracted his 
              allegations, the church faced media scrutiny. In response, it issued 
              press statements and made several representations to its members to 
              state that they had not funded Sun Ho's music career.</p>
              <p>However, unknown to the executive members of the board, the church's funds were used to run the project, said the CoC.</p>
              <p>'Over a period of 3 years, at least $23 million was 
              used. However, during this period of time, the executive members were 
              not told of the actual purpose of the use of these funds,' the spokesman
               said.</p>
              <p>Giving an idea of how this was done, the CoC said the
               funds from the church were diverted to finance the project under the 
              guise of donations to its affliated church in Kuala Lumpur between 
              December 2007 and May 2010.</p>
              <p>The church - City Harvest Church Kuala Lumpur (KL) - 
              then transmitted the monies to support the project in the United States 
              (US). During this period, at least $2.1 million was transferred from the
               Singapore church to the one in KL to fund the project, the CoC said.</p>
              <p>It added that its inquiry revealed that pastor Kong 
              Hee and his deputy, Mr Tan Ye Peng, executive member Kelvin Teo Meng 
              How, church finance manager Tan Shao Yuen, Sharon and executive member 
              Serina Wee Gek Yin were aware of the true purpose of the donations to 
              the KL church.</p>
              <p>Donations and tithes to the church were also 
              transferred into a private fund known as the multi-purpose account, 
              administered by Ms Wee and pastor Kong's former personal assistant, Ms 
              Jacqueline Tan Su Pheng.</p>
              <p>Monies in this account were in turn used to fund the 
              project. The CoC said that between April 2007 and March 2010, the funds 
              used for purported expenditures of pastor Kong and his wife amounted to 
              approximately $600,000 and $3 million respectively. Selected donors were
               asked to transfer their contributions originally meant for the church's
               'Arise and Build' project to the multi-purpose account.</p>
              <p>It added that the existence of the account was not 
              known to the church's members. 'There was even an attempt to conceal the
               existence of this account by closing the joint bank account and dealing
               only in cash transactions, which was kept in a safe at the charity,' 
              the spokesman said.</p>
              <p>About three years ago, a plan was conceptualised by 
              Mr Tan, Mr Chew, Ms Wee and Ms Tan to divert a $600,000 donation to the 
              multi-purpose account. The donation which was meant to be for the 
              church's building fund, was diverted via a purported 'refund'.</p>
              <p>The amount apparently went some ways to meet the 
              financial needs of the project - which included US$100,000 (S$128,000) 
              to finance a media team from Singapore to publicise and write about Sun 
              Ho's music career in the US.</p>
              <p>The CoC said that between 2006 and 2008, pastor 
              Kong's company sold over $3 million worth of merchandise to the church, 
              but did not disclose his interests in these related transactions in the 
              church's financial statements.</p>
              <p>In 2008, he 'refunded' royalties to the church 
              amounting to approximately $770,000 from the sale of his merchandise. 
              The CoC said this was probably motivated by concerns that the church's 
              auditors would require them to be disclosed.</p>
              <p>The purported refunds were concealed as a 'sales 
              discount' given to the church, and later, reimbursed to pastor Kong from
               the multi-purpose account and the KL church.</p>
              <p>'(The) refund of royalties to the charity was therefore cosmetic and he was instead never 'out of pocket',' the CoC said.</p>
              <p>It also found evidence which suggested that certain 
              members of the church's board had been less than prudent in the 
              discharge of their duties toward the charity and its members.</p>
