              <p><br>As part of a wider effort to help charities improve their governance, the Office<br>of the Commissioner of Charities has issued guidance for charities which are<br>engaging or intend to engage in business activities.</p>
              <p><br>2     Some charities engage in business activities to generate additional income or<br>to provide goods or services for their members or clients. The guidance aims to<br>provide greater clarity to charities on when and how they may engage in business<br>activities.

              <p><br>4     As with other investment decisions, it is the responsibility of a charity’s board<br>members to be prudent in making the assessment. “Ultimately, charity boards are<br>responsible for the proper use of their charities’ assets and resources, and are<br>accountable for their investment decisions,” added Mr Low. However, if necessary,<br>the Commissioner of Charities can direct a charity to cease funding or to terminate<br>its business activities, in order to protect its charitable assets.<br>The guidance is posted on the Charity Portal</p>

              <p>Whether or not is theft depends on eg: authority(whether implied or expressed), consent or whether there was claim of right on it and also perhaps deception.</p>
              <p>I think they will mostly likely be in breach of board consent and approval. From link by HoneyBunz it is quite clear charitable organisations can participate in non-primary purpose activities as long as the primary charitable purpose is not tainted. Too many missing facts. So all just speculation.</p>

              <p><br>JUST who is Mr Wahju Hanafi?</p>
              <p>  He's an Indonesian business, a City Harvest Church (CHC) member and a long-time friend of church founder Kong Hee.</p>
              <p>  He is also the man who made a "love gift" to the church - a $600,000 donation to the church's building fund. The money was "intended for specific pastors and employees".</p>
              <p>  Mr Wahju's name cropped up in the Commissioner of Charities' statement on Tuesday, after an inquiry into financial irregularities at the church.</p>
              <p>  Where and how his donation was spent became part of the investigation.</p>
              <p>  Mr Wahju's name popped up again when The New Paper checked on Kong's last-known address.</p>
              <p>  Mr Wahju, 52, confirmed to TNP over the phone from Papua New Guinea (PNG) yesterday that he has a Sentosa property at Ocean Drive, but does not live there.</p>
              <p>  He said: "I've known Kong Hee for about 20 years. We're friends...</p>
              <p>  "I heard about what happened to him (on Tuesday) from reports."</p>
              <p>  But he did not answer when asked about how he felt upon learning of Kong's arrest.</p>
              <p>  By all accounts, Mr Wahju is a man of great wealth, with business interests spanning from California in the US TO Capetown in South Africa.</p>
              <p>  There's also the glass factory, PT The First National Glassware, in Jakarta, Indonesia, that he heads, and a 14-outlet supermarket chain, Super Value Stores, in PNG.</p>
              <p>  The supermarket managing director, who is based in PNG, flies to Singapore every month. He is married with four children.</p>
              <p>  Mr Wahju's childhood was reportedly tough.</p>
              <p>  Previous reports from CHC's newsletter Harvest Times said he had to borrow $500 from his father's business contact every month just to saty in school.</p>
              <p>  In 1978, when Mr Wahju was 18 years old, his girlfriend's brother (now his brother-in-law) offered him a job in PNG.</p>
              <p>  In 1986, at age 26, Mr Wahju opened the first Super Value Store retail outlet in Mount Hagen, PNG's third biggest city.</p>
              <p>  Today, the supermarket chain has more than 1,100 people on its payroll and is the main wholesaler for brands like Puma and Indofood.</p>
              <p>  Two of Mr Wahju's daughters help run the business.</p>
              <p>  "People find it hard to believe that we are one of the biggest companies in Papua New Guinea because half the time, I'm not even there," Mr Wahju had told Harvest Times in 2005.</p>
              <p>  "Yet everything still runs well. I credit this to God's grace and the excellent stewardship of my staff."</p>
              <p>  Mr Wahju's wife, whom he acknowledged for sharing his vision, is based in Melbourne, Australia.</p>
              <p>  "She handles all the properties," he said.</p>
              <p>  Kong had previously said of his friend, who joined the church in 1993: "Wahju started seeing himself not just an employer but a 'pastor' to his workers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 115%; color: red; font-size: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Shares Kong's sermons</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;">"He use my sermons and shares biblical principles four times a week in his company."</p>
              <p>  While Kong has a high profile both inside and outside church circles, Mr Wahju is less known.</p>
              <p>  Of the five City Harvest churchgoers TNP spoke with, only one had heard about him.</p>
              <p>  A delivery assistant who wanted to be known only as Vince, 33, said Mr Vince, 33 said Mr Wahju appeared to be Kong's close friend.</p>
              <p>  "He usually goes up on stage and pastor Kong will interview him," he said.</p>
              <p>  According to him, the interviews tend to involve a suited Mr Wahju talking about how his business had been blessed because of the church.</p>
              <p>  Vince added: "To me, he was quite ordinary, except for the fact that he did a lot of business.</p>
              <p>  "I don't know what kind of business or how big, but I'm guessing it's a lot."</p>
              <p>  According to Harvest Times in 2007, Mr Wahju had over the years donated almost $6 million to the church.</p>
              <p>  He had made close to $30 million by then.</p>
              <p>  When asked about his Indonesian glass factory being mentioned in Kong's case, Mr Wahju sounded angry.</p>
              <p>  "I don't have to answer your questions," he replied.</p>
