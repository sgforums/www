              <p>NCCS should stop ppl from anyhow start a church.  This is how cults are started.  Anyhow start a group, with the claimed objective of expanding the religion, reaching out to others.  later on, dunno how they teach or what they teach.  then they become cults lor. </p>
              <p>Look at how mormons and JW were formed. </p>
              <p>If anybody wants to do more outreach, or serve God, or preach, he can do it in the existing church.  Why need to form a new organisation, instead of serving existing established ones?  To make oneself the head of church and have followers?</p>

              <p><span>NCCS</span> hopes Singaporeans will not react
              against churches</p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE</span>: The Christian community is
              united in disapproving any misuse of public institutional funds,
              the National Council of Churches Singapore (NCCS) said, in response
              to the case involving five City Harvest Church members.</p>
              <p>This includes money raised by or given to churches, <span>NCCS</span> president Lutheran Bishop Terry Kee said.</p>
              <p>He added that dishonesty in financial matters is clearly
              contrary to the teaching of the church.</p>
              <p>However, he noted that as the matter is before the courts, it
              was important to avoid speculation or pre-judgement, and that the
              legal process should be allowed to take its course.</p>
              <p>The bishop said the council appreciates the clarification by
              Deputy Prime Minister and Home Affairs Minister Teo Chee Hean that
              the charges are filed against the five individuals and not City
              Harvest Church itself.</p>
              <p>Bishop Kee also hoped that Singaporeans would not react against
              the church or churches in Singapore.</p>

              <p>I am in the buddhism ministry to proseltyle to ex-christians
              (excluding Wimsomnea) to come back to buddhism.</p>
              <p>Here is another story.</p>
              <p>A broken down 22 year old woman walk in to our charity branch
              (in the nation that is north of singapore) to confess about
              her problems. She told us that she was a member of this sprawling
              big mega church in PJ. She had a boyfriend who work full time at
              the church. She told us she was very immature and she had many
              arguments and disagreements with her boyfriend. However one day she
              got pregnant by her boyfriend and her stomach was growing
              bigger.</p>
              <p>She joined the church when she was in her teens so her whole
              life was that church. She was an orphan but she managed to fend for
              herself working odd jobs like waitering, cashier and sales person
              at the shopping mall. She dropped out of school when she was 15.
              According to her, she was very popular at the church. Because of
              her jovial character and her broken background, the church members
              accept her and treat her well.</p>
              <p>However, moment they spot her growing bump, they began to keep a
              distance from her. They tried to do marriage counselling for her
              and her boyfriend but it didn't turn out well because they both
              argued a lot and didn't get along. At the same time they also gave
              counselling and displinary action against the boyfriend because he
              broke the christian rules, having sex before marriage (as the
              boyfriend was also a full time staff). The boyfriend was very
              angry. Then as this girl was approaching her 7 month pregnancy, the
              church decided for her !</p>
              <p>Decided for her ! That is so arrogant of them. How can
              they  do this? It is her decision not theirs.</p>
              <p>Because the marriage counselling failed, they decided to sack
              the boyfriend. They advice the girl to give her baby for adoption !
              All her friends at church avoided her and made her felt lonely. For
              a 22 year old pregnant girl to feel abandoned by the people who
              should love her, is very bad ordeal. So we at the buddhist charity
              org, decided to call her up and give her shelter because she could
              not afford a home. But she opted for a christian shelter for abused
              women instead.</p>
              <p>Then she gave birth for the baby, the church decided to pay for
              her hospitalization expenses. We came to the hospital too to give
              her support. We saw the beautiful baby and she was holding on the
              baby, crying, because she knew that she will never see her baby
              again. Then the nurse came and collected the baby to be given to
              the new adoptive parents.</p>
              <p>Three years later, we decided to follow up and call her up to
              see how she was. Alas, she was still a christians (why these
              christians so stubborn as hell? come back to buddhism lah). As we
              found out, she married a christian guy who was willing to accept
              her flaws. But she quit this mega church and went to a smaller more
              conservative church (of which her husband is attending). Another
              two years later, she gave birth to two wonderful boys.</p>
              <p>So see?  What right does a church got to force her to give
              her baby away? Had she kept the baby, she would have found a better
              husband who is willing to provide.</p>

              <p><span>CHC</span> member writes to <span>MCYS</span> alleging defamation</p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE</span>: A City Harvest Church member,
              Christopher Pang, has written to Acting Minister for Community
              Development, Youth &amp; Sports Chan Chun Sing alleging that the
              Commissioner of Charities’ statement on the misconduct and
              mismanagement in the administration of the charity is
              defamatory.</p>
              <p>The Commissioner of Charities issued a statement on Tuesday
              saying that its inquiry discovered financial irregularities of at
              least S$23 million from the Charity’s funds, and that these funds
              were used with the purported intention to finance Sun Ho’s secular
              music career to connect with people.</p>
              <p>Among other things, Mr Pang said he disagreed with the
              Commissioner of Charities’ statement being posted on <span>MCYS</span>’ website.</p>
              <p>Speaking up for the five leaders who were charged in court on
              Wednesday, Mr Pang claimed that the statement is defamatory, and
              asked for an apology from the Commissioner of Charities.</p>
              <p>He asserted that as a society, the church does not owe members
              of the public any account of how its funds are used, yet audited
              accounts are posted on the church’s website for transparency and
              accountability.</p>
              <p>He added that he was not supportive of the move by the
              Commissioner of Charities to suspend eight church leaders from
              their offices.</p>

              <p>Why didn't Kong Hee downgrade his sentosa cove home and his wife's hollywood home for the church building fund?  Why the members have to downgrade and live a poor life?  Selfish!  and the members see nothing wrong with that?  OMG!</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>Even though I attended City Harvest only once, it felt somehow wrong to me. I think the whole problem is the followers are not seeking God but Kong Hee. They are treating him like some saviour and that is very dangerous. It does not help that the church seems to target impressionable male teenagers by luring them in with xiao mei mei. Coupled with their jamming worship session it makes it not different from a pub where guys go to pick up girls or girls go to be picked up.</div>

              <p>in fact all charismatic churches felt wrong to me. Went once and they give u the look when i apprarently refused to "tithe" and i went to take a look as a non christians. The things there. just seems totally wrong.</p>
              <p>a city harvest friend once told me "it is superficial to look into the philosophies of life" i wonder, what has city harvest been teaching their ppl? maybe is to just give and give?</p>

              <p>How to find goodness? I counsel so many ex-christians and all of them tell me that they initially taught christianity was something enlightening for them, would bring them out of their lull but eventually they were disapponted by they way they were treated by the politics of the church.</p>
              <p>Yes there are a lot of politics in the church. But I do not find anything like this at all in buddhism because we all work for the good of all.</p>
              <p>Aum Shinrikyo has little to do with buddhism, in fact its founder Shoko Asahara, took the roots of christianity, yoga, hinduism to build on his cult.</p>
              <p>You see, all wars are started by the muslims and christians. George Bush who claims to be a devout christian and supports Billy Graham, went on to wage a fake and bloody war on Iraq on the lies that Iraq was developing WMD.</p>
              <p>I even counsel one friend, who used to have a christian girlfriend. They went out for 3 years until one day, she was attracted by teh idea of converting to christianity. She insisted her boyfriend to follow her to church, he relented. She began to quit drinking, to become so so holy, hate swearing, don't like to gossip, spend her money for church work, no time for boyfriend because go and do ministry, etc. But the boyfriend still go for clubbing. Though he attend church but he decided to be a lukewarm christian. Then they both join cell group. The leaders forced them both to go for water baptism and classes. But the boyfriend refused. She went. And then the day when he really felt left out was the on that very sunday service when she went out on stage to profess her commitment to christ to a congregation of 2000. Arguments started to ensue. The boyfriend spent so much money to buy a house and fund her part time studies because he was thinking of marrying her. But she wanted him to become christian and go thru marriage counselling together. The boyfriend read the rules from the marriage counselling course, he has to tithe 10%, only marry a christian. He was outraged. Their relationship got worst, started arguing, mainly over religion.</p>
              <p>Before she became christian, everything was ok, they even spoke of starting family. Moment she got converted, she completely changed, wanted the boyfriend to change as well. Wah, like Jonestown, completely brainwashed.</p>
              <p>Then she decided to break up with him. He was so heartbroken. On the day after they broke up, he wanted to go to the cell group to meet up with her and try to persuade her to come back. But the cell group leader refused to open the gate to let him in. He wanted to speak to her. But it was the cell group leader who came out to speak to him instead, advised him to let her go.</p>
              <p>he tried to contact her, but her handphone blocked his calls. Her parents refused to open the door for him. He was really heartbroken. We buddhist had to counsel him and now he became a devout buddhist, decided to be a vegetarian.</p>
              <p>Few years later, we found out the truth. the girl fell in love with one of the church leaders, a junior pastor and married him.</p>
              <p>Hah, see? Churches reserve all the girls for their leaders. And they kick out the poor guys like this guy, my charity branch had to counsel him.</p>
              <p>So cruel. Churches all like Kong Hee.</p>

              <p><br>Yeah, but most people hate christians. Why? Because they claim to be the true and happy people. But I hear so many stories of politics at church, christians trampling over other downtrodden christians. That is why so many people are disillusioned.</p>
              <p>I have counsel so many youths who blindly join their youth ministry, then those who are no handsome looking guys, nerdy looking girls or guys who have disabilities, are mistreated - marginalised during their activities. Its a disgraceful treatment. Only those who are children of pastors, handsome guys, pretty girls, influential children or children with rich parents are treated better.</p>
              <p>At our buddhist counselling center, we try to bring back these disenchanted christians and show the path to nirvana is the right way.</p>

              <p><br>This is why buddhism is far better. We focus on individual enlightenment and not take advantage of former drug addicts, bully victims, prostitutes, handicap people and lie to them that they found enlightenment.</p>
