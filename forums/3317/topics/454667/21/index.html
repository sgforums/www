              <p><br>Except of course that hardly anyone agreed with your views back then. Professor Dr. Thio Li-Ann, who is a Singapore constitutional scholar, said that "Evangelism is legal and in fact a constitutional right" and that "It would in fact be intolerant to ban this form of speech."</p>
              <p>Of course atheists like laurence82 are hardly the tolerant type of people.</p>

              <p>Guys , you all focus on con man Kong Hee and his partner in crime Phil Pringle of C3. Then you blame God and criticise the Bible.</p>
              <p>In the book of Hebrews cahpter11, the Bible says "Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith."</p>
              <p>We can only look to Jesus perfection and his Truth. Kong Hee &amp; Pringle do not preach Truth. They twist the word of God and use scriptures out of context to manipulate money out of their cult followers. They are not a true church but con artists. </p>
              <p>You can take verses and make them mean anything.eg Here are actual verses:-</p>
              <p>Judas hanged himself.</p>
              <p>(Verese out of context)...Go thou and od likewise.</p>
              <p>You could even prove that the early disciples played cricket! In Acts2:14</p>
              <p>"Jesus stood up with the eleven and was bold (bowled)."</p>
              <p>Kong Hee takes scriptures out of context to achive his monetary goals eg. The Sentosa apartment and Sun Ho's career.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>Young  people are easily impressionable . actually many of them go there to meet their peers and also to have a good time - like a rock party - so they get sucked in by the temp beat and music . The programme they have is catered to win over  young people who love music  but span of attention for factual or theoretical  substance in youngster generally are weak- so that give them the "love thing" everyone loves everyone  and give your love gifts of all you possess and you will be RICHLY rewarded....and what better example than the man himself ...sentosa cove!</div>

              <p><strong>BY GOH CHIN LIAN <br></strong>POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>IN THE light of the City Harvest case, corporate governance advocate Mak Yuen Teen talks about the governance of charities.</p>
              <p>  The National University of Singapore don is a member of the Charity Council, set up under the Charities Act to promote good governance standards in the charity sector.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>• Are you following the City Harvest case? Is it deja vu?</p>
              <p>Yes and no. There are obviously parallels with certain cases in terms of a charismatic leader, questions about board independence, and a whistleblower having to apologise.</p>
              <p>  No, in the sense that the allegations about how transactions were executed and attempts to hide them are somewhat different from those in other charity cases, and are more similar to some corporate cases.</p>
              <p><br>  Also, the alleged amounts involved are larger. But let's be clear that they are only allegations at this stage.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>• How do you feel about the way governance of charities and regulatory oversight have evolved since the National Kidney Foundation saga?</p>
              <p>Both have improved a lot. Charity rules, guidelines and codes have been enhanced. Regulatory oversight has been enhanced as well, for example, having regulators for different sectors, sector administrators and also governance reviews of charities.</p>
              <p>  Overall, awareness of governance and implementation of good governance practices have improved. But there will always be exceptions when we are talking about around 2,000 charities in total.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>• The 7th Charity Council Governance Seminar in March this year was titled Good Governance Keeps The Regulator Away. However, again, the regulator has to step in. Is the charity sector as a whole and on group level doing enough to ensure good governance?</p>
              <p>Well, when there are governance concerns, this will bring the regulators in. That is their role. If charities do the right thing, they should never worry about regulators looking over their shoulders.</p>
              <p>  I think awareness has improved a lot, and implementation is happening, perhaps more in some sectors than others. For example, the religious sector tends to have lower compliance with the code of governance on the degree of management involvement in the governing board, including in chairing the board, because some view these as secular guidelines which do not really apply to them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>• To what extent have charities and their members internalised the values of good governance? What are the challenges?</p>
              <p>One of the challenges in the sector is that people may volunteer to be on the board and, because it's voluntary and honorary, may not give the required commitment and be quite passive.</p>
              <p>  The selection process may also be ad hoc because it's honorary.</p>
              <p>  They may also not be willing to commit time to learn about their duties and responsibilities through attending professional development programmes.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>• What about concerns that yet another high-profile case will lead to tighter regulations that affect the operations of charities?</p>
              <p>This is a risk and I think it's best not to react to the moment and just introduce new rules.</p>
              <p>  If there is another scandal, as I am sure there will be just like in the corporate sector, there may be different issues involved.</p>
              <p>  You then end up with rules being put together like patchwork.</p>
              <p>  The Sarbanes-Oxley Act in the United States is a perfect example. The Act was written very clearly to address the problems in two major scandals - Enron and WorldCom. Guess what? Lots of other things were not addressed and we ended up with the global financial crisis starting from the US.</p>
              <p>  This is not to say that we should not consider rule changes, but we need to be considered in how we do this.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>• What more would you like to see done?</p>
              <p>Enforcement must be strong where there is proven wrongdoing.</p>
              <p>  I still believe we should consider legislation to protect whistleblowers who blow the whistle in good faith and with reasonable belief, as in some of the more developed markets.</p>
              <p>  We may wish to consider modifying our defamation laws. It's just too easy for someone who is rich or who has the backing of a wealthy organisation to sue someone, even if comments may have a reasonable basis.</p>
              <p>  There is a danger in suppressing fair comment and I think that is unhealthy for us in the long term.</p>
              <p>  And we should keep improving the quality of people who serve on boards in the sector, and continue to help charities build capacity to improve their governance.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>BY GOH CHIN LIAN </strong></p>
              <p><br><span style="font-size: 14pt; color: gray;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">What it's all about</span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>ONE of Singapore's largest churches made the news this week when its founder Kong Hee, 47, and four senior church members were arrested and charged with conspiring to cheat the church of millions of dollars.</p>
              <p>  Public prosecutors alleged that an initial $24 million was taken from the building fund of City Harvest Church and put into sham bond investments, and another $26.6 million went to covering up the money trail.</p>
              <p>  The investments were allegedly used to finance the career of Kong's wife, pop singer Ho Yeow Sun.</p>
              <p>  The severity of the case led the Commissioner to suspend eight members, including Kong and Ms Ho, as board members or agents of the church.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 14pt; color: gray;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">What's the buzz?</span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>ALLEGATIONS that church funds were used to finance Ms Ho's career have become a talking point, drawing strong responses from many.</p>
              <p>  Members of City Harvest Church have stood by their leaders, defended them online and turned up en masse in court to show support. At least one wrote to a Cabinet minister to say that the Commissioner's statement on the church's financial irregularities was defamatory.</p>
              <p>  Detractors, however, found this show of loyalty troubling. They wondered if church members have been unduly influenced by their pastor's magnetic personality. One online article counselled against a siege mentality.</p>
              <p>  Even after the case had gone to court, the church's leaders saw it fit to issue a public statement to maintain that it did not lose any funds and no personal profit was gained by those involved in the transactions.</p>
              <p>  They also defended the church's Crossover Project, which the Commissioner had said was underwritten by at least $23 million of church funds, unknown to the church's executive members.</p>
              <p>  They insisted it was not about one person's singing career, but a mission that was fundamental to the church - to use Ms Ho's music to connect with and reach non-Christians.</p>
              <p>  This was notwithstanding the edgy music videos of Ms Ho making the rounds online, which drew fresh criticisms from many over whether the stated purpose of Christian outreach was achieved.</p>
              <p>  The case has also sparked fresh debate over the wealth accumulated by megachurches and their leaders.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 14pt; color: gray;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Why it matters</span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>THE amounts involved make it the biggest financial case at a registered charity since the high-profile scandals at the National Kidney Foundation (NKF) in 2005 and Ren Ci Hospital in 2007.</p>
              <p>  It eclipses the $12 million for which the NKF sued former chief executive T.T. Durai and three others, and the $50,000 unauthorised loan for which Ren Ci Hospital's chief Ming Yi was jailed.</p>
              <p>  The scandals led to a big clean-up of governance practices in the charity sector.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 14pt; color: gray;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">What's next?</span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>  KONG and the four church members are due to return to court on July 25, for varying counts of committing criminal breach of trust as an agent.</p>
              <p>  The offence is punishable with a life sentence, or jail of up to 20 years and a fine.</p>

              <p>In the book of Hebrews cahpter11, the Bible says "Looking unto

              <p>We can only look to Jesus perfection and his Truth. Kong Hee
              &amp; Pringle do not preach Truth. They twist the word of God and
              use scriptures out of context to manipulate money out of their cult
              followers. They are not a true church but con artists. </p>
              <p>You can take verses and make them mean anything.eg Here are
              actual verses:-</p>
              <p>Judas hanged himself.</p>
              <p>(Verese out of context)...Go thou and od likewise.</p>
              <p>You could even prove that the early disciples played cricket! In
              Acts2:14</p>
              <p>"Jesus stood up with the eleven and was bold (bowled)."</p>
              <p>Kong Hee takes scriptures out of context to achive his monetary
              goals eg. The Sentosa apartment and Sun Ho's career.</p>

                  <p><strong>BY GOH CHIN LIAN<br></strong> POLITICAL
                  CORRESPONDENT</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>IN THE light of the City Harvest case, corporate governance
                  advocate Mak Yuen Teen talks about the governance of charities.</p>
                  <p>  The National University of Singapore don is a member of
                  the Charity Council, set up under the Charities Act to promote good
                  governance standards in the charity sector.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>â€¢ Are you following the City Harvest case? Is it deja vu?</p>
                  <p>Yes and no. There are obviously parallels with certain cases in
                  terms of a charismatic leader, questions about board independence,
                  and a whistleblower having to apologise.</p>
                  <p>  No, in the sense that the allegations about how
                  transactions were executed and attempts to hide them are somewhat
                  different from those in other charity cases, and are more similar
                  to some corporate cases.</p>
                  <p><br>
                    Also, the alleged amounts involved are larger. But let's be
                  clear that they are only allegations at this stage.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>â€¢ How do you feel about the way governance of charities and
                  regulatory oversight have evolved since the National Kidney
                  Foundation saga?</p>
                  <p>Both have improved a lot. Charity rules, guidelines and codes
                  have been enhanced. Regulatory oversight has been enhanced as well,
                  for example, having regulators for different sectors, sector
                  administrators and also governance reviews of charities.</p>
                  <p>  Overall, awareness of governance and implementation of
                  good governance practices have improved. But there will always be
                  exceptions when we are talking about around 2,000 charities in
                  total.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>â€¢ The 7th Charity Council Governance Seminar in March this year
                  was titled Good Governance Keeps The Regulator Away. However,
                  again, the regulator has to step in. Is the charity sector as a
                  whole and on group level doing enough to ensure good
                  governance?</p>
                  <p>Well, when there are governance concerns, this will bring the
                  regulators in. That is their role. If charities do the right thing,
                  they should never worry about regulators looking over their
                  shoulders.</p>
                  <p>  I think awareness has improved a lot, and implementation
                  is happening, perhaps more in some sectors than others. For
                  example, the religious sector tends to have lower compliance with
                  the code of governance on the degree of management involvement in
                  the governing board, including in chairing the board, because some
                  view these as secular guidelines which do not really apply to
                  them.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>â€¢ To what extent have charities and their members internalised
                  the values of good governance? What are the challenges?</p>
                  <p>One of the challenges in the sector is that people may volunteer
                  to be on the board and, because it's voluntary and honorary, may
                  not give the required commitment and be quite passive.</p>
                  <p>  The selection process may also be ad hoc because it's
                  honorary.</p>
                  <p>  They may also not be willing to commit time to learn
                  about their duties and responsibilities through attending
                  professional development programmes.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>â€¢ What about concerns that yet another high-profile case will
                  lead to tighter regulations that affect the operations of
                  charities?</p>
                  <p>This is a risk and I think it's best not to react to the moment
                  and just introduce new rules.</p>
                  <p>  If there is another scandal, as I am sure there will be
                  just like in the corporate sector, there may be different issues
                  involved.</p>
                  <p>  You then end up with rules being put together like
                  patchwork.</p>
                  <p>  The Sarbanes-Oxley Act in the United States is a perfect
                  example. The Act was written very clearly to address the problems
                  in two major scandals - Enron and WorldCom. Guess what? Lots of
                  other things were not addressed and we ended up with the global
                  financial crisis starting from the US.</p>
                  <p>  This is not to say that we should not consider rule
                  changes, but we need to be considered in how we do this.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>â€¢ What more would you like to see done?</p>
                  <p>Enforcement must be strong where there is proven wrongdoing.</p>
                  <p>  I still believe we should consider legislation to protect
                  whistleblowers who blow the whistle in good faith and with
                  reasonable belief, as in some of the more developed markets.</p>
                  <p>  We may wish to consider modifying our defamation laws.
                  It's just too easy for someone who is rich or who has the backing
                  of a wealthy organisation to sue someone, even if comments may have
                  a reasonable basis.</p>
                  <p>  There is a danger in suppressing fair comment and I think
                  that is unhealthy for us in the long term.</p>
                  <p>  And we should keep improving the quality of people who
                  serve on boards in the sector, and continue to help charities build
                  capacity to improve their governance.</p>
                  <p> </p>

                  <span style="font-size: 14pt; color: gray;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">What it's all
                  about</span></span></p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>ONE of Singapore's largest churches made the news this week when
                  its founder Kong Hee, 47, and four senior church members were
                  arrested and charged with conspiring to cheat the church of
                  millions of dollars.</p>
                  <p>  Public prosecutors alleged that an initial $24 million
                  was taken from the building fund of City Harvest Church and put
                  into sham bond investments, and another $26.6 million went to
                  covering up the money trail.</p>
                  <p>  The investments were allegedly used to finance the career
                  of Kong's wife, pop singer Ho Yeow Sun.</p>
                  <p>  The severity of the case led the Commissioner to suspend
                  eight members, including Kong and Ms Ho, as board members or agents
                  of the church.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt; color: gray;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">What's the buzz?</span></span></p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>ALLEGATIONS that church funds were used to finance MsHo's career
                  have become a talking point, drawing strong responses from
                  many.</p>
                  <p>  Members of City Harvest Church have stood by their
                  leaders, defended them online and turned up en masse in court to
                  show support. At least one wrote to a Cabinet minister to say that
                  the Commissioner's statement on the church's financial
                  irregularities was defamatory.</p>
                  <p>  Detractors, however, found this show of loyalty
                  troubling. They wondered if church members have been unduly
                  influenced by their pastor's magnetic personality. One online
                  article counselled against a siege mentality.</p>
                  <p>  Even after the case had gone to court, the church's
                  leaders saw it fit to issue a public statement to maintain that it
                  did not lose any funds and no personal profit was gained by those
                  involved in the transactions.</p>
                  <p>  They also defended the church's Crossover Project, which
                  the Commissioner had said was underwritten by at least $23 million
                  of church funds, unknown to the church's executive members.</p>
                  <p>  They insisted it was not about one person's singing
                  career, but a mission that was fundamental to the church - to use
                  Ms Ho's music to connect with and reach non-Christians.</p>
                  <p>  This was notwithstanding the edgy music videos of Ms Ho
                  making the rounds online, which drew fresh criticisms from many
                  over whether the stated purpose of Christian outreach was
                  achieved.</p>
                  <p>  The case has also sparked fresh debate over the wealth
                  accumulated by megachurches and their leaders.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt; color: gray;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Why it matters</span></span></p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>THE amounts involved make it the biggest financial case at a
                  registered charity since the high-profile scandals at the National
                  Kidney Foundation (NKF) in 2005 and Ren Ci Hospital in 2007.</p>
                  <p>  It eclipses the $12 million for which the NKF sued former
                  chief executive T.T. Durai and three others, and the $50,000
                  unauthorised loan for which Ren Ci Hospital's chief Ming Yi was
                  jailed.</p>
                  <p>  The scandals led to a big clean-up of governance
                  practices in the charity sector.</p>

                  <p> </p>
                  <p>  KONG and the four church members are due to return to
                  court on July 25, for varying counts of committing criminal breach
                  of trust as an agent.</p>
                  <p>  The offence is punishable with a life sentence, or jail
                  of up to 20 years and a fine.</p>

                  Mak Yuen whatever must be readng  all the calls  for redress n ths forum. Indeed there should be redress for people who get sued for defamation etc for so called (no evidence etc) when in time  they are proven right  by subsequent events that followed. e.g that Archie fella  and the lady also who were sued by Durai...First whatever cost they had incurred should be paid in full plus interest lost multiplied by  the number of years  that had  passed before  it was discovered that  what they said was actually true, as compensation . Then another amount for damage caused to their career and reputation to be decided by the courts!

              Ex-CHC members reveal pressure to donate 'as much as we can'
              
              City Harvest Church (CHC) started off as a modest Bible study group of 20 more than two decades ago.
              
              Organised by a fresh-faced National University of Singapore graduate named Kong Hee in 1989, the church grew rapidly, converting many young and passionate individuals to the Christian faith.
              
              At its peak in 2009, the religious group, which by then had been registered as a charity, could count 33,000 followers.
              
              Many of them would rock the halls of the Singapore Expo where services were held, repeating the shouts of â€œHallelujah!â€� by Kong, a proponent of the charismatic movement in Singapore.
              
              In interviews with Yahoo! Singapore, current and former church members recounted their experiences with CHC, which has now come under the spotlight after Kong and four other key members of the ministry were charged Wednesday over the alleged misuse of church funds to finance Kongâ€™s pop-star wifeâ€™s career.
              
              â€œI think one of the factors that draw people to our church is how the services are conducted,â€� shared 22-year-old CHC member Michelle Weers. â€œThe praise and worship is vibrant, the gospel is preached creatively.â€�
              
              Besides holding weekly services in English, Mandarin and dialects, the CHC also caters to Indonesians, Filipinos, children and the intellectually-disabled.
              
              About 46 per cent of the congregation was below the age of 25 years, based on statistics provided by the church in 2010. With an average age of 24, majority of the churchgoers are believed to be young professionals aged 25 to 35.
              
              Most, if not all, of CHCâ€™s followers are also very much attracted to the churchâ€™s charismatic founder, a man they said is â€œtalentedâ€� and â€œinspiringâ€� and who always â€œlives out what he preachesâ€�.
              
              â€œHe's like our spiritual father,â€� said James Yeo, an active CHC member for the past eight years. â€œAnd as our senior pastor, he really practises what he preaches, and acted like a role model to all of us.â€�
              
              Echoed a 28-year-old executive whoâ€™d be known only as Ms Ong, â€œI believe it is the doctrines and preaching from Pastor KH that continues to draw the crowd and retain its members despite the upheavals it has been through over the years.â€�
              
              The â€˜prosperity Gospelâ€™ of CHC
              
              Church funds grew with the rise in membership. Net assets in 2009 amounted to an estimated S$103 million.
              
              Members who listened to Kong, 47, would open their pockets wide to contribute to the church.
              
              The pastor would often preach what became known as the "prosperity Gospel" â€“ one reaps what one sows, and up to a hundred-fold returns could be harvested.
              
              In a video of one of his sermons uploaded onto YouTube in 2008, Kong stressed that oneâ€™s faith proclamation â€œmust be backed up by our givingâ€� and, if not, was essentially empty.
              
              "What we give every week is the measure of the value that you place on your Lord and your saviour Jesus Christ,â€� he told the crowd. â€œWe can lift up our hands to worship god, but if the tithes are still in our pockets, then due tribute has not been given. Then our praises are empty. Our words are empty. There is no value to back it up.â€�
              
              CHCâ€™s online donation page, which allows churchgoers and the public alike to give their offerings via eNets and credit cards, also states that the church believes oneâ€™s giving is â€œa form of worship unto the Lordâ€�.
              
              Not everyone, however, bought into this belief, which gradually turned into a focus of many critics. Some CHC members left as a result.
              
              â€œI joined the church initially because he (Kong) preached very well and knows how to create a program that appealed to youths,â€� said 26-year-old Terence Lee, who was a member of the church for seven years until 2010.
              
              Citing â€œa lack of transparencyâ€� in the running of the church as his reason for leaving, the assistant editor shared that he no longer agreed with the doctrine, which he now feels is based on a â€œshaky Bible interpretation concocted by self-styled Bible gurusâ€�.
              
              A former cell group leader, who declined to be named, also let on that â€œthere was definitely pressure to donateâ€�, especially among younger church members.
              
              "Those who consistently gave more would be applauded; those who didn't give so much would be 'strongly encouraged' every week to 'give as much as you can',â€� he told Yahoo! Singapore. â€œWe were always told that God would make rich those who donated more.â€�
              
              Marketing executive Mary Lim too, felt the pressure. The 29-year-old eventually chose to leave the religious organisation three years ago when she became depressed that she couldnâ€™t give enough.
              
              "When we signed up, they would give us forms, GIRO forms, encouraging us to donate to CHC via GIRO to make sure our tithes were regular," she recalled.
              
              Her friends who continue to attend CHC still donate via GIRO, she added. Three other CHC members confirmed this.
              
              Continued support
              
              Over the years, CHC has been hounded by controversy over how it may be using membersâ€™ funds.
              
              Nine years after its main church building â€“ a 2,300 seater â€“ was built in Jurong West, CHC announced in early 2010 its big plans to build a double-floor 12,000-seat auditorium in Suntec Singapore for worship services at a whopping S$310 million.
              
              Questions over the churchâ€™s ambitious plans began to surface among the public and the press. For one, should religious organisations, registered as charities, be allowed to make investments using what are essentially donor funds?
              
              In March 2010, the Commissioner of Charities (COC) and Commercial Affairs Department came knocking on CHCâ€™s door after receiving complaints alleging the misuse of the churchâ€™s funds.
              
              Even then, the megachurch managed to secure S$22.9 million last November in pledges towards a building fund that will pay for the churchâ€™s S$310 million investment in Suntec Singapore, said a 2011 Straits Times report.
              
              This, despite a falling membership amid police investigation for possible abuse of funds.
              
              Numbers dwindled to an estimated 23,000 in 2010, down from 33,000 a year before.
              
              A two-year investigation ended last Wednesday with Kong and four other senior CHC members charged for allegedly misappropriating about S$24 million from CHC's building funds for unauthorised use, among other charges.
              
              Despite the put-downs, many CHC members whom Yahoo! Singapore spoke to continued to show unwavering support for the church and their pastor.
              
              â€œThe church does preach about prosperity, but that is only one aspect of the gospel,â€� shared Weers, whoâ€™s been a member for six years. â€œTeachings are done on the full gospel.â€�
              
              The 22-year-old SIM undergraduate also added that â€œtestimonies shared are not always on financial blessingsâ€�, contrary to what many have alleged.
              
              Mdm Lim, a 50-year-old homemaker, was another who shared the same sentiment and believed wholeheartedly in â€œGodâ€™s principle of Sowing and Reapingâ€�.
              
              â€œWhatever seed we sow, we will reap the harvest of its kind â€“ when we sow love, we reap love; when we sow money, we will be blessed financially,â€� she said.
              
              â€œBut itâ€™s more than that,â€� Lim was quick to add. â€œPastor Kong has preached on love, sacrifice and many areas, itâ€™s not just about money.â€�
              
              But the churchgoer of two years, who contributes about S$500 to the CHC every month, shared that she understood where detractors were coming from, especially since â€œmoneyâ€™s a sensitive issueâ€�.
              
              â€œBut my stand is that people give because they want to give to the Lord. And we know that the church will do good works from whatever weâ€™ve contributed.â€�
              
              While some churchgoers such as Lim acknowledged â€œthe wrong Pastor Kong has doneâ€�, many maintained that their leaders are innocent and voiced confidence in their integrity.
              
              Said one from the latter group, James Yeo, â€œI believe that no individual personally benefited from this, no one pocketed any money, and there was no embezzlement whatsoever.â€�
              
              Referring to the controversial project at the heart of the probe, the 21-year-old added, â€œCrossover is not a project of five individuals, it is a project of the whole church. Members gave willingly and with great support as to what Sun (Kong's wife) is doing.â€�

              cannot believe a christian said this.
              
              so they gave generously hoping to be blessed even more financially?  is this really what christianity preaches?
              
              i believe the govt cant do anything about this but surely the bishop can and should right?

              <h1>I maintain my integrity: Kong Hee</h1>
              <p>Beleaguered City Harvest Church pastor Kong Hee
              insisted he had integrity as he spoke to a full house at Singapore
              Expo Hall 1 early Saturday evening.<br> <br> In the first English-language service of the church since he and
              four key ministry members were charged with criminal breach of
              trust allegedly to support the music career of his wife Sun Ho,
              Kong said, "I maintain my integrity."</p>
              <p>With his wife up on stage with him, he added, "There were times
              when Sun and I just didn't know what to do." He and his wife also
              hugged on stage.</p>
              <p>The expo hall was packed with members of the congregation and
              two rooms overflowed with supporters for about a total of 5,000
              people. There were many banners saying "I love Pastor Kong".</p>
              <p>Some of the faithful also gave testimonies on the church's
              "Crossover Project" started in 2002 supposedly as a way to use Ho's
              secular music to connect with people and reach out to
              non-Christians.<br> <br> One of Ho's backup dancers talked about how the pastor's wife, who
              tried to become a pop star in the U.S., brought Christ to her and
              the world through Ho's song "China Wine".<br> <br> CHC has thrown its weight behind its founder Kong Hee and the four
              other key members who were charged Wednesday over alleged misuse of
              the charity’s funds.<br> <br> In a statement released by executive pastor Aries Zulkarnain on
              Thursday evening, the church stated that it is standing by the five
              individuals.</p>
              <p>"The people currently in the news are our pastors and trusted
              staff and leaders who have always put God and CHC first," he said.
              "As a church we stand with them and I believe fully in their
              integrity."<br> <br> The statement also said that Kong, 47, and his deputy pastor Tan Ye
              Peng, 39, who both face charges of criminal breach of trust, will
              continue preaching at the megachurch.<br> <br> Addressing the current charges that stand against the five accused
              leaders, Zulkarnain maintained that the church did not lose any
              money in the transactions detailed in the charges, which list two
              separate amounts of S$24 million and a further S$26.6
              million.<br> <br> "The S$24 million, which went into investment bonds, was returned
              to the church in full, with interest... The church did not lose any
              funds in the relevant transactions, and no personal profit was
              gained by the individuals concerned," he said. In response to the
              church’s statement, the Attorney-General’s Chambers (AGC) said, “We
              wish to reiterate that as criminal charges are now before the court
              and will be subject to adjudication by the court; and that as such,
              neither the prosecution nor any other party should comment on
              issues which will be subject to adjudication and on which evidence
              will be led in court.”</p>
