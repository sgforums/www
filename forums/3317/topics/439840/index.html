              government will need to step up efforts to show that its growth policies
               are humane.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>This is amid criticism the country emphasises on economic growth while excluding everything else.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>To convince 
              detractors, Dr Khor said the social safety net -- comprising Workfare, 
              ComCare and Medifund -- could be strengthened.<br><br>She called for more frequent payouts for low-wage workers under the Workfare Income Supplement Scheme.<br><br>She
               suggested raising the household income ceiling criteria for ComCare 
              schemes, to help families cope with the rising cost of living.<br><br>"The
               key point here is that the qualifying criteria as well as the quantum 
              and types of assistance need to be reviewed periodically, and revised if
               necessary," Dr Khor said. <br><br>"The rules should also be applied flexibly to ensure that no one who genuinely needs help falls through the cracks."<br><br>Meanwhile,
               MP for Pioneer Cedric Foo called on the government to share more 
              information on its policy formulation process with Singaporeans.<br><br>Mr
               Foo said despite the best intentions of the government when making 
              decisions, the public at large does not have the benefit of this

              <p><strong>Lawrence Wong makes rebuttal arguments on growth policies</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Minister of State for Defence and Education Lawrence 
              Wong has rebutted arguments by some MPs in Parliament that the problems 
              being faced by Singapore are the result of the government's focus on 
              growth. </span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>He said the 
              government has never pursued GDP as an end in itself. Rather, growth has
               been pursued with a firm commitment to fairness, and as the foundation 
              for broader benefits for all.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>"The criticisms 
              against growth are not uniquely heard in this House. They are also heard
               in other developed countries, as growth becomes tainted by the excesses
               of capitalism. But they have arisen more fundamentally due to the 
              pressures in the workplace brought about by globalisation and the IT 
              revolution," said Mr Wong, who is also MP for West Coast GRC. <br><br>"In
               the past, the competition came from low-wage, low-skilled workers. Now,
               there is also competition from low-wage, high-skilled workers. Reading 
              X-rays or filing tax returns can be done by lower-paid radiologists or 
              accountants - they do the work in India, and send the results back the 
              next day via fibre-optic cable," he added.<br><br>Mr Wong explained that
               very few other countries have emerged from the last five years of the 
              global turmoil with such positive results.  <br><br>But Singapore made 
              it happen, because of policies to promote sustainable and inclusive 
              growth - growth that benefits every citizen, strengthens social 
              solidarity, and increases living standards not just for today, but for 
              future generations as well.  <br> <br>Turning to education, Mr Wong 
              said: "Next year, the new Singapore University of Technology and Design 
              (SUTD) will take in its first batch of students. The Singapore Institute
               of Technology (SIT) will also have new programmes with overseas 
              universities. <br><br>"So we can expect an increase of around 1,000 
              university places for Singaporeans in 2012. Thereafter, there will be an
               increase of another 1,000 more university places over the next few 
              years."<br><br>Concluding his speech, he said that while the government 
              will do its part to facilitate and lead in terms of the broad 
              directions, it will also need the support of Singaporeans. <br><br>Mr 
              Wong said: "To understand and tackle our challenges fully and 
              vigorously, we need to draw on the expertise and resources of all our 
              people. This means that the government should pull back from being all 
              things to all citizens, and give Singaporeans the opportunity and space 
              to organise themselves, and develop their own solutions."<br><br>- CNA /ls</span></span></p>
