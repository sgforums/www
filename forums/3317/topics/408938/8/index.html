              <p><strong>Chinese anger as Philippine flag draped over gunman's coffin</strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; font-size: 13px;">MANILA - The Chinese government expressed outrage on Friday after television footage showed a Philippine flag draped over the coffin of a gunman who hijacked a busload of Hong Kong tourists.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; font-size: 13px;"> </span></p>
              <p>"The person who deserves a national flag at (their) funeral should be someone of heroism, decency and integrity, not someone who inflicts atrocity on innocent lives," the Chinese embassy in Manila said in a statement.</p>
              <p>"This is nothing but a smear on the dignity of the Philippine national flag."</p>
              <p>Sacked policeman Rolando Mendoza hijacked a bus that was carrying a group of Hong Kong tourists in Manila on Monday in a bid to be cleared of extortion charges and get his job back.</p>
              <p>Eight of the tourists on board the bus were killed in the final stages of the 12-hour siege, which finally ended when police shot Mendoza dead.</p>
              <p>Police said they believed Mendoza killed all eight of the victims but are carrying out tests to ensure the rescuers did not shoot any of the captives.</p>
              <p>The Chinese government has expressed anger over the Philippine government's handling of the hostage crisis, and the flag issue is likely to stoke tensions.</p>
              <p>"The Chinese embassy in the Philippines condemns the brutality of the criminal and expresses its strong indignation over this irritating act," the statement said.</p>
              <p>The flag was draped over Mendoza's coffin on Friday during his wake at his family's home in Tuanauan town, about two hours' drive south of Manila.</p>
              <p>Following the Chinese embassy statement, the government moved quickly to have the flag removed and police said his family likely draped it over the coffin. Mendoza's funeral will be held on Saturday.</p>

              <p><strong>Scores at hijacker's funeral</strong></p>
              <p>TANAUAN (Philippines) - SCORES of friends and family turned out 
              Saturday to bury the slain ex-policeman who this week hijacked a bus in 
              Manila, leading to a crisis in which eight Hong Kong tourists died.</p>
              <p>Even as the government tried to distance itself from the incident, 
              over a hundred people gathered at Senior Inspector Rolando Mendoza's 
              home, to remember him for his police honours and not for Monday's tragic
               events.</p>
              <p>'There are so many mourners because he was a good man. You never 
              heard about him doing anything bad,' said warehouse worker Mark Torres, a
               family friend attending the wake in Tanauan, a small city south of 
              Manila.</p>
              <p>Francisco Misaba, a district watchman, said he had been assigned to 
              manage the traffic because many people were expected to attend Mendoza's
               funeral mass and burial later in the day. 'There will be plenty of 
              people attending because he had a lot of friends. Just about everyone in
               the district was his friend,' he said.</p>
              <p>Mendoza's family has refused to grant press interviews. But 
              at his wake, which is being held in Mendoza's home, they put his 
              numerous citations on display alongside many floral wreaths sent by 
              fellow policemen.</p>
              <p>Mendoza, a decorated police officer who had been sacked over
               extortion charges, took a bus-load of Hong Kong tourists hostage in 
              Manila on Monday, demanding to be reinstated. This led to a siege of the
               bus and muddled police negotiations that ended bloodily, with Mendoza 
              and eight of the tourists shot dead. -- AFP</p>

              <p>They were not really your normal commandos, they were our SOF, or SpecOps forces. Till that point of time they were a secret.</p>
              <p>We were rather fortunate in the SQ117 hijacking. The hijackers had no firearms and were mostly bluffing that they had a bomb to destroy the aircraft. Before that they also made several tactical errors by releasing pushing hostages out of the plane to seem badass, which gave the SOF intelligence on the details on the number of hijackers and what they had. Additionally, appropriate media control was established so the hijackers had no real-time information on what was going on outside the plane, and the fact that they shut all the windows rendered them pretty much dumb, deaf and blind.</p>
              <p>The one threat they could carry out however, was the burn the plane... had they carried it out that would have possibly caused quite a lot of casualties, but in terms of actually being able to resist the SOF, storming the plane full of amateur hijackers with no real weapons was about as dangerous as shooting fish in a barrel. </p>
              <p>All in all we were quite fortunate that the first hijacking we had to handle on our soil was done by a bunch of noobs. We might face a harder challenge next time.</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">MANILA - The Chinese government expressed outrage on Friday after television footage showed a Philippine flag draped over the coffin of a gunman who hijacked a busload of Hong Kong tourists.</span></p>
              <p>"The person who deserves a national flag at (their) funeral should be someone of heroism, decency and integrity, not someone who inflicts atrocity on innocent lives," the Chinese embassy in Manila said in a statement.</p>
              <p>"This is nothing but a smear on the dignity of the Philippine national flag."</p>
              <p>Sacked policeman Rolando Mendoza hijacked a bus that was carrying a group of Hong Kong tourists in Manila on Monday in a bid to be cleared of extortion charges and get his job back.</p>
              <p>Eight of the tourists on board the bus were killed in the final stages of the 12-hour siege, which finally ended when police shot Mendoza dead.</p>
              <p>Police said they believed Mendoza killed all eight of the victims but are carrying out tests to ensure the rescuers did not shoot any of the captives.</p>
              <p>The Chinese government has expressed anger over the Philippine government's handling of the hostage crisis, and the flag issue is likely to stoke tensions.</p>
              <p>"The Chinese embassy in the Philippines condemns the brutality of the criminal and expresses its strong indignation over this irritating act," the statement said.</p>
              <p>The flag was draped over Mendoza's coffin on Friday during his wake at his family's home in Tuanauan town, about two hours' drive south of Manila.</p>
              <p>Following the Chinese embassy statement, the government moved quickly to have the flag removed and police said his family likely draped it over the coffin. Mendoza's funeral will be held on Saturday.</p>

              <p><strong>Philippines allows Hong Kong police to probe hijack killings</strong></p>
              <p>The Philippines has allowed Hong Kong police to examine a bus where 
              eight Hong Kong tourists died in a hostage siege last Monday.</p>
              <p>The team was today allowed to go inside the vehicle and examine the 
              weapons used in the shoot-out that ended the day-long standoff. <br> <br> It was also allowed to interview witnesses. <br> <br> But the Philippine justice secretary said the Hong Kong team could not interfere in the investigation in general. <br> <br> She said there has been no direct pressure from the Hong Kong side to interfere in the probe. <br> <br> But legislators and the media in the Chinese city have been leading 
              calls for their government to step up pressure on the Philippine 
              authorities over the investigation and allow a joint inquiry. <br> <br> The Philippine justice secretary said final findings of the probe would be known within three weeks.</p>
