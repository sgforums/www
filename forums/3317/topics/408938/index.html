              <p class="hn-byline">By Mynardo Macaraig
              (AFP)
              –
              <span class="hn-date">11 hours ago</span></p>
              <p>MANILA — A dramatic hostage siege in the Philippine capital involving
               a busload of Hong Kong tourists ended after 12 hours on Monday with 
              several captives walking free but the fate of 11 others unknown.</p>
              <p>The
               gunman, a disgruntled ex-policeman, was killed in the final moments of 
              the crisis in the heart of Manila, which was played out live on 
              television screens around the globe.</p>
              <p>Four of the tourists emerged 
              from the bus alive, surrounded by police and emergency vehicles, but 
              there were fears for the lives of the 11 others who did not get off the 
              vehicle immediately afterwards.</p>
              <p>Some of the hostages were seen being pulled out of the bus motionless, but it was unclear whether they were unconscious or dead.</p>
              <p>The
               body of the gunman, a highly decorated former police inspector who 
              hijacked the bus in a desperate bid to get his job back, was seen 
              slumped out of the main door of the vehicle.</p>
              <p>Multiple gunshots 
              were heard moments before heavily-armed police moved in on the bus near a
               park in Manila's historic tourist district just after nightfall.</p>
              <p>The
               gunman, former senior police inspector Rolando Mendoza, said just ahead
               of the police assault that he had shot two of his captives and would 
              kill the others if police did not move back.</p>
              <p>"I shot two Chinese. I
               will finish them all if they do not stop," he told the Radio Mindanao 
              Network about 10 hours in to the hostage drama.</p>
              <p>"I can see a lot 
              of SWAT (special weapons and tactics police) coming in. I know they will
               kill me. They should all leave because anytime I will do the same 
              here."</p>
              <p>Police were unable to get inside the bus for more than an hour after negotiations broke down and they decided to storm it.</p>
              <p>They encircled the bus, smashed its windows and fired at it, but Mendoza held them off by shooting back.</p>
              <p>The crisis eventually ended when police threw tear gas inside the bus, and fired again.</p>
              <p>The
               hostage drama began when Mendoza boarded the bus in Manila's tourist 
              district on Monday morning. He wanted to clear his name after being 
              discharged for extortion in 2008, and called on authorities to review 
              his case.</p>
              <p>Philippine authorities said 22 tourists from Hong Kong 
              were originally on the bus, including children, as well as the local 
              driver and two other Filipinos.</p>
              <p>Seven of the tourists, including 
              three children and an elderly man, as well two Filipinos, were released 
              at various times throughout the day.</p>
              <p>The Filipino driver jumped out of a window and escaped just before police stormed the bus.</p>
              <p>Mendoza,
               55, was honoured by police chiefs in 1986 as one of the top 10 officers
               in the country. But he was discharged in 2008 for his alleged 
              involvement in drug-related crimes and extortion, according to police.</p>
              <p>"He wants to be reinstated in the service," Manila district police chief Superintendent Rodolfo Magtibay said early in the day.</p>
              <p>Mendoza
               had posted a series of written messages on the windows of the bus, one 
              of which read: "Big mistake for big wrong decision", apparently in 
              reference to his sacking.</p>
              <p>Joseph Tung, executive director of the 
              Travel Industry Council of Hong Kong, said the tourists on the bus were 
              aged between four and 72.</p>
              <p>They were on a three-day tour with Hong Thai Travel and were scheduled to return to Hong Kong late Monday.</p>
              <p>The
               bus was parked in front of a grandstand at Rizal Park, a popular 
              tourist destination just a few blocks from police headquarters.</p>
              <p>Before
               the crisis ended, China's foreign ministry urged Philippine authorities
               to ensure the Hong Kong tourists were rescued safely.</p>
              <p>Monday's 
              bus hijack recalled a similar hostage-taking in 2007, when a troubled 
              civil engineer armed with a grenade took over a bus and held 30 children
               but freed them after a 10-hour standoff with police.</p>
              <p>The 2007 drama took place near Manila city hall, just off Rizal Park.</p>
              <p>Monday's tragedy also added to a fast-growing number of attacks of foreigners in the Philippines.</p>
              <p>Gunmen
               shot dead a South Korean man in a separate attack on Monday morning in 
              another section of Manila. Police said the incidents were not related.</p>
              <p>Last
               month, an American, a South African, a Briton and their Filipina 
              partners were killed in spate of murder-robberies in Angeles City north 
              of Manila. The alleged killer was arrested.</p>

              <p>Bus hostage crisis ends with 7 dead<br> (The Philippine Star) Updated August 23, 2010 10:16 PM Comments (0) View comments<br> <br> MANILA, Philippines (AP) — A dramatic hostage-taking in the capital 
              ended with six bus passengers dead today after shots rang out and police
               stormed the vehicle.<br> <br> The hostage-taker also died, police said.<br> <br> Five hostages were brought to the Manila Hospital, two of them dead on arrival and three alive without injuries.<br> <br> The Manila Doctors Hospital reported it received four dead and one woman in critical condition.<br> <br> The incident started when a dismissed policeman armed with an M16 rifle 
              seized the busload of Hong Kong tourists to demand his reinstatement in 
              the force.<br> <br> Police officer Roderick Mariano cited the driver who escaped moments 
              before police surrounded the bus as saying the hostage-taker, identified
               as former Senior Inspector Rolando Mendoza, 55, opened fire at the 
              tourists.<br> <br> The gunman earlier released nine hostages — leaving 15 inside — and demanded his job back to free the rest.</p>

              <p>i was watching it live in hongKong from moring till the sniper is killed. From passenger looking out at the window in moring till they were killed. From kidnapper walking around the bus till he was head blash by sniper and brain matter coming out. It is really saddening. Like a action movie but super long 11 hours. The Police want to revenge for getting fired. Those tourist were having their last day returning to HongKong from that bus to airport.The thunder and lightning during the rescue mission seems to representing tears from the sky.</p>
              <p>Phillipine SWAT team is bad at handling these kind of suituation. Sniper missed  3 good chance at killing the kidnapper. Swat team is fat and scare to go inside.In the end.so many passenger is killed.</p>

              <p><strong>China strongly condemns Philippine bus hijack</strong></p>
              <p><span>MANILA: China on Tuesday strongly condemned a bus hijacking in 
              Manila that left eight Hong Kong tourists dead, while urging the 
              Philippine government to ensure Chinese travellers were safe.
              <br> <br> "The Chinese government strongly condemns the atrocity by the 
              hostage-taker, expresses grave condolences to the victimised Hong Kong 
              compatriots and conveys profound sympathy to the bereaved families," the
               Chinese embassy said.
              <br> <br> "The Chinese side has urged the Philippine side to take concrete 
              measures to ensure the safety and security of the Chinese citizens in 
              the Philippines," it said in a statement.
              <br> <br> China on Tuesday urged its citizens travelling to the Philippines to 
              exercise caution, after eight Hong Kong tourists were killed in a bus 
              hijacking in Manila.
              <br> <br> "The consular section of the foreign ministry and the embassy in the 
              Philippines warn Chinese citizens to be cautious when travelling to the 
              Philippines," the ministry said in a statement.
              <br> <br> "Chinese citizens in the Philippines must pay attention to security 
              risks, step up measures of self-protection and immediately inform the 
              Chinese embassy of any emergency situations."
              <br> <br> The mission also said the Chinese government was sending a government 
              team to Manila to help deal with the aftermath of Monday's hostage 
              crisis that unfolded live on global television.
              <br> <br> "The... authorities of China will keep close contact with the Philippine
               side and the government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region,
               exert the utmost to save the injured and properly deal with the 
              aftermath."
              <br> <br> Eight Hong Kong tourists were killed when police stormed a bus that had 
              been commandeered 12 hours earlier by a disgraced ex-police officer 
              demanding he get his job back.
              <br> <br> Seven other Hong Kong tourists were injured. 
              <br> <br> One of them is still in a critical condition more than 12 hours after 
              the bloody rescue attempt while the others sustained only slight 
              injuries, Chinese embassy spokesman Sun Yi told local radio.
              <br> <br> The ordeal began when the suspect, armed with an M-16 assault rifle and 
              dressed in combat pants, hijacked the bus with 25 people aboard in 
              Manila's tourist district.
              <br> <br> He later freed seven Hong Kong tourists and two Filipinos.
              <br> <br> But negotiations broke down after nightfall when the gunman, former 
              senior police inspector Rolando Mendoza, began shooting and commandos 
              were forced to storm the bus, firing dozens of bullets of their own into
               the vehicle.
              <br> <br> The Filipino driver escaped just before the shooting.
              <br> <br> Sun, the embassy spokesman, said a Hong Kong flight carrying the 
              victims' relatives arrived in Manila before dawn on Tuesday. - AFP/de/fa</span></p>

              <p><strong>Philippine police admit blunders in deadly hostage ordeal</strong></p>
              <p>MANILA — Philippine police conceded Tuesday they made blunders in 
              ending a bus hijacking as outrage grew over the bloody assault played 
              out on live television that left eight Hong Kong tourists dead.</p>
              <p>Commandos fired dozens of bullets into the bus and smashed its 
              windows with sledgehammers as they tried to storm it, but were then 
              forced to wait outside helplessly for over an hour as the hijacker used 
              his captives as human shields.</p>
              <p>The ordeal in Manila’s tourist district on Monday finally ended when 
              the police fired tear gas into the bus and a sniper shot the gunman in 
              the head, but by that time eight of the tourists on board had been 
              killed.</p>
              <p>Amid a building storm of criticism from Hong Kong’s government and 
              people around the world who watched the shoot-out live on television, 
              Manila police commander Leocadio Santiago admitted mistakes had been 
              made.</p>
              <p>“We saw some obvious shortcomings in terms of capability and tactics 
              used, or the procedure employed and we are now going to investigate 
              this,” Santiago said on local television.</p>
              <p>He and President Benigno Aquino promised to probe all aspects of the 
              12-hour ordeal, which began when a disgruntled sacked policeman armed 
              with an M-16 assault rifle hijacked a bus carrying 25 people, mostly 
              Hong Kong tourists.</p>
              <p>Aquino told a pre-dawn press conference that the tragedy highlighted 
              many flaws in the ability of Philippine security forces to handle 
              hostage situations.</p>
              <p>“There are a lot of things (that) resulted in a tragedy. Obviously we
               should be improving,” said Aquino, who took office less than two months
               ago.</p>
              <p>One of the problems he emphasised was the way the crisis played out 
              through the media, with the gunman being allowed to speak on radio and 
              watch events live on the bus’s television, giving him insights into 
              police actions.</p>
              <p>But Aquino nevertheless insisted waiting more than 10 hours before 
              storming the bus was the right course of action, because police believed
               until that point they could convince the gunman to stand down.</p>
              <p>However relatives of the victims as well as the Hong Kong government 
              and media expressed anger over the bloody end to the stand off.</p>
              <p>“The way it is handled — particularly the outcome — is very 
              disappointing,” Hong Kong Chief Executive Donald Tsang told reporters.</p>
              <p>The Chinese embassy in Manila on Tuesday urged the Philippines to 
              take concrete measures to protect Chinese citizens while Hong Kong 
              newspapers bemoaned missed opportunities to end the siege much earlier.</p>
              <p>“A large group of police failed to get into the bus after surrounding
               the vehicle for nearly half an hour,” the Hong Kong Economic Journal 
              said.</p>
              <p>“Their appalling professional standards, and the lack of strategic 
              planning, made observers both angry and sad. This tragedy could have 
              been avoided.”</p>
              <p>One of the survivors, who identified herself as Mrs Leung, said at 
              the scene after she scrambled out of the bus that police should not have
               waited so long before taking action.</p>
              <p>“There were so many people on the bus — no one came to our rescue. Why?” said Mrs Leung.</p>
              <p>Hong Kong media said Mrs Leung’s husband had died in a hail of 
              bullets as he tried to protect his wife. The couple’s three children 
              aged 14, 18 and 21 were also on the bus and remained unaccounted for, 
              according to the reports.</p>
              <p>The Hong Kong government organised two chartered flights to take 
              relatives of the hostages, as well as psychologists, doctors and social 
              workers, to Manila.</p>
              <p>Flags flew at half mast and the Hong Kong stock exchange held a minute’s silence as the shocked territory mourned the victims.</p>
              <p>The gunman, former senior inspector Rolando Mendoza, hijacked the bus
               in a crazed attempt to clear his name from charges of extortion that 
              led to him being discharged from the police force in 2008.</p>
              <p>Mendoza, 55, had demanded that the ombudsman re-open an investigation
               into his case, which centred on accusations he tried to extort money 
              from a man who was accused of drug trafficking.</p>
              <p>Before being discharged, Mendoza was regarded as a model officer, 
              once being named by his superiors as among the top 10 policemen in the 
              country.</p>

              <p>Snipers should have taken him on 2 occasions, 1) when he was releasing the old man from the bus door (more than 5 seconds) and 2) when he moved the curtains peering out of the bus window.</p>

              <p>I watched the video of the SWAT team rescue attempt.</p>
              <p>I'm not trying to be an armchair general, but I really had to cringe while watching it.</p>
              <p>WTF were they doing, smashing windows here and there? The element of surprise was totally lost when they did that.</p>
              <p>At one point in time, the fella smashing in the door actually somehow hurled the jackhammer right into the bus. Huh?</p>
              <p>And then they tried to throw lightsticks in there. No nightvision equipment ah?</p>
              <p>All that is a great way of telling the hijacker that '<em>We want to storm the bus, and we're trying to smash our way in. Because we can't see you properly, we're going to light our way with lightsticks</em>.'</p>
              <p>Kaoz.... just position snipers around the bus, and take down the fella once any one of them got a clear shot!</p>

              <p>I was very surprised that at one point, when the gun man release the elderly, he was in full front view at the door, even when the elderly had walk quite a distance, he was still standing there with the doors open! A very good opportunity to capture/ shoot him! </p>
              <p>Who is more important, the life of the gun man or the safety of the tourist! When the elderly was led out, the people on board the bus were still very much alive, if they had not missed that chance, this tragedy could have been avoided. What a tragic moment to see your love one being gunned down in front of you, and not being able to moan and cry openly and seek help for fear of that gun man too. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="icon_evil.gif"></p>
