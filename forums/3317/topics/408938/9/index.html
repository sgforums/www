              <p>It's true that it is a personal tragedy. However, I feel that the issue now is not about crying out loud because of the incident that took place, but because of the mishandling of the situation that led to the deaths of the tourists. The march is more about the pressure to ensure that the phil provide accurate information on their findings, and not let corruption stand in their way. </p>
              <p>As a Singaporean, I also feel sad, not because the hostage taking took place in a poverty ridden country, but because of the way it was handled that could have turned out for the better. </p>

              <p><strong>Philippines urges media restraint after hostage chaos</strong></p>
              <p>The Philippines has urged the media to show more restraint in covering crisis situations.</p>
              <p>It follows concerns that live broadcasts of last Monday's Manila 
              hijacking incident fuelled tensions that led to the death of eight Hong 
              Kong tourists.</p>
              <p>Police stormed the bus 10 hours into the ordeal after the hijacker started firing his weapons. <br> <br> It seems he had been outraged after watching on a television screen in 
              the bus, images of his brother being arrested just outside the vehicle. <br> <br> A presidential spokesman said he would hold talks this week with 
              executives of Manila television and radio networks about their coverage 
              of the siege. <br> <br> A sacked policeman last Monday took a busload of Hong Kong tourists hostage in a bid to get his job back. <br> <br> The government has admitted to making many errors in handling the crisis. <br> <br> The episode has since chilled diplomatic ties with Hong Kong.</p>

              <p>I understand your good intention for filming a movie. But rather than jumping on the bandwagon like previous blockbusters has done and make a pile out of it, and then in the name of kindness donate some proceeds to the victims, I feel that it reeks of hypocrisy. It's like exploiting the accident that has happen, to garner in viewers ratings and money due to the realistic events and something that has happened so close to home. </p>
              <p>There are many ways to honour the dead, without making money at the same time. When money comes into play, there are many grey areas that would have to be resolve. Lastly, why put through the agony that the survivors has gone through again? Especially when the pain involved their loss of their love ones. Not very humane. </p>
              <p>If we want to help these people, then maybe a fund should be set up, and governed by the government where it would given out periodically to the families who are in need of financial help. If the public sympathise with them, they can donate to follow these people through the difficult times of their life.  </p>

              <p><strong>Philippines needs more time</strong></p>
              <p>MANILA - THE Philippines on Sunday said it needed more time to 
              complete its official inquiry into a deadly hostage crisis that left 
              eight Hong Kong tourists dead.</p>
              <p>The investigation, which began last week, was to have been wrapped up
               on Monday before a formal report is submitted to President Benigno 
              Aquino and Hong Kong authorities. But members of the investigating 
              committee need additional days to question more witnesses as well as to 
              re-enact the hostage drama that ended in a bungled police rescue, 
              Justice Secretary Leila de Lima told AFP.</p>
              <p>'We will be extending up to Wednesday, it is not possible to wrap up 
              (the investigation) tomorrow,' Ms de Lima said. She said members of the 
              inquiry board would on Tuesday inspect the park where the hostage taking
               played out live on televisions around the world on August 23.</p>
              <p>A re-enactment of the day-long crisis was to be also carried
               out Wednesday at a police camp where the bullet-riddled bus is being 
              kept, she said.</p>
              <p>A sacked police inspector hijacked a tourist bus full of 
              Hong Kong tourists two weeks ago, in a crazed bid to regain his old job.
               The stand-off ended in a bloody mess, when unprepared police commandos 
              launched a rescue attempt riddled with errors that left eight of the 
              tourists dead.</p>
              <p>Hong Kong authorities have demanded a speedy and impartial 
              investigation amid a public outcry and a chilling of ties between the 
              neighbours. The inquiry has so far uncovered embarrassing lapses from 
              police and city officials who took part in the failed hostage 
              negotiations. On Saturday, Manila's deputy mayor Isko Moreno told the 
              inquiry that officials involved in the crisis had left their posts when 
              the gunman began shooting while the force's best-trained unit sat out 
              the assault. -- AFP</p>

              <p><strong>'Friendly fire' suspected</strong></p>
              <p>MANILA - PHILIPPINE investigators admitted for the first time on 
              Thursday that police may have shot some of the tourists in a bungled 
              operation that left eight Hong Kong residents dead on a bus in Manila.</p>
              <p>Armed with an assault rifle and a pistol, sacked policeman Rolando 
              Mendoza took a busload of tourists hostage on August 23 in a desperate 
              bid to clear himself of extortion charges and get his old job back.</p>
              <p>Eight of the tourists were killed and seven others were injured in 
              the central Manila standoff. Police initially insisted the bullets that 
              killed the tourists were all fired from Mendoza's guns.</p>
              <p>Other bullets were fired into the bus by police snipers and 
              an assault unit but they did not result in fatalities, police had said. 
              But Justice Secretary Leila de Lima said on Thursday: 'There is a big 
              possibility that there (was) friendly fire,' adding experts are 
              convinced some bullets could not have been fired by the hostage-taker.</p>
              <p>Ms De Lima, head of an official inquiry, also said the 
              forensic reports on some of the slain victims did not match the account 
              of the driver of the tourist bus, who had told investigators the gunman 
              shot the tourists at close range. 'What is crucial, occupying our minds,
               is if the shots were made at close range, (these) are not consistent 
              with forensic findings,' she added.</p>
              <p>Asked whether at least some of the victims could have been 
              killed by 'friendly fire,' Ms de Lima said: 'We are not focusing (on 
              that), but we should never miss that. Otherwise our report will be less 
              than thorough.' The panel has asked the Hong Kong police to help with 
              the ballistics aspect of the investigation, and a group of Philippine 
              investigators are currently in the Chinese territory awaiting their 
              counterparts' findings, she said.</p>
