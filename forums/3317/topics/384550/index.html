              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Right before her eyes, Julie Chiang watched the
              computer screen as someone used her Facebook account – pretending to be
              her, asking her friend for money and claiming she had been mugged in
              London. </span></p>
              <p><span>"It was surreal to watch the conversation happen right in front
              of me," said Ms Chiang, who had been woken up in Singapore by her
              friend's phone call on Friday morning.
              <br> <br> "He told me he was on Facebook now, talking to 'me', and I was saying I needed money to go home."
              <br> <br> The hacker even used Ms Chiang's husband's name, which could be found on her Facebook profile, in the conversation.
              <br> <br>Even as the unfolding scam began to dawn on her, a second friend
              living in New Zealand messaged her to say she was having the same
              conversation.
              <br> <br> Reports of such incidents – known as a 419 scam – though few, are on the rise among Facebook users.
              <br> <br>Fraudulent individuals collect log-in information through phishing
              sites and access Facebook accounts to send inbox or chat messages or to
              update the person's profile. And they claim to be stranded in a foreign
              country and ask friends to send money, usually through a money transfer
              service.
              <br> <br>"While the total number of people who have been impacted is small,
              we take any threat to security seriously and are redoubling our efforts
              to combat the scam," said Facebook in a blog post in September.
              <br> <br> The scam had previously been perpetrated through emails. 
              <br> <br>But more cyber criminals are leveraging on social engineering as a
              means of deceiving users, said systems engineering manager Ronnie Ng
              from Symantec Singapore.
              <br> <br>"Social engineering takes advantage of our natural tendency to
              trust one another, rather than relying solely on technological means to
              steal information," he said.
              <br> <br>Indeed, Ms Leong Su-Lin, who was chatting with "Julie" yesterday
              morning, said the scam seemed believable because it was a "live"
              conversation.
              <br> <br>"Someone was actually responding to the questions I was asking; it
              wasn't an automated thing, which is why I went along with it," Ms
              Leong, 32, told MediaCorp from New Zealand.
              <br> <br>"They were also hitting on a 'soft spot' by saying she was hurt. I
              was very concerned, so although she sounded a bit strange, I thought
              maybe it's because she was still traumatised."
              <br> <br>But something felt amiss. "I thought it was strange she was on
              Facebook and not at the police station or at an embassy," she said.
              <br> <br>Mr Ng said people need to be more aware of where they post personal
              information and who they allow on their social networks. In addition,
              online users should be careful of clicking on links from unknown
              senders and use up-to-date security software, he advised.
              <br> <br>"They should also be on their guard if they receive suspicious
              messages from friends, such as requests for money," he said. "Users
              should always double-check with their friend. When in doubt, do a
              search on the Internet to see if it's a known scam."
              <br> <br>Thankfully for Ms Chiang's friends, they did just that, and she has
              since reported the incident to Facebook. "I've not heard of this
              happening, so it'll be good for more people to know about it," she
              said.
