              <p><span>SINGAPORE: He wanted to help his friend resolve his marital
              problems, but lawyer Dixon Ng did it the wrong way - and got a two-year
              suspension for his pains. </span></p>
              <p><span>In January 2006, Ng forged two court judgements to help
              businessman Vincent Ng placate his wife. The latter was an engineer
              with his own firm, JCV Consultants, and a director of RJ Crocker
              Consultants. <br> <br> The businessman was allegedly involved in an affair with a Shanghainese
              lounge hostess who had run off with $150,000 belonging to his wife. <br> <br> Meanwhile, his two companies had filed claims against two other firms for non-payment; Ng was the lawyer in both cases.  
              <br> <br> Ng wanted to help his friend mollify his wife by giving her the
              impression that a sum close to what she had lost was coming in. So, the
              lawyer created two judgements to falsely state that $120,000 was
              arising from the two claims. In reality, neither of the cases reached
              the courts. <br> <br> Two months later, Vincent Ng filed a complaint with the Law Society against Dixon Ng about the draft judgements.  
              <br> <br> On Tuesday, the lawyer told the Court of Three Judges he had never
              intended to pass the drafts off as proper judgements and had not
              attempted to mislead anyone. <br> <br> "I had a close friend who was being physically abused by his wife. I
              had to pick him up in the middle of the night in the middle of a road
              because his wife hit him while driving. And he called me, crying," said
              Ng. <br> <br> "I did not do this for any purpose other than to assist my friend, whom I thought was my friend at that time."  
              <br> <br> Chief Justice Chan Sek Keong said, while he appreciated that Ng wanted
              to help, it was a serious offence to create documents. "You did not
              obtain any monetary benefit but nevertheless, a court document is a
              court document. Anyone looking at a court document will be influenced
              by it," he said. <br> <br> Later, Ng told reporters that his friend had filed the complaint because the two had fallen out over money. </span></p>
