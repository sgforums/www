              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: A former officer from AETOS Security Consultants was 
              on Monday jailed two years for offences including asking an underage 
              girl to either have sex with him or give him money after he had caught 
              her smoking and littering.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Twenty-six-year-old 
              Eddie Quek Yu Meng, who used to be attached to the National Environment 
              Agency (NEA) as an enforcement officer, spotted the 15-year-old student 
              committing the offences near Woodlands Civic Centre at around 5pm on 
              October 31, 2008.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>He took down her particulars but instead of reporting her to the relevant authorities, released her on the spot.<br><br>Quek
               later called the girl on February 10, 2009 and pretended to be an NEA 
              officer, even though he had already left AETOS in November 2008.<br><br>The
               pair met up at Block 365 Woodlands Avenue 1 at around 4pm where the 
              girl pleaded with Quek not to inform her parents and school about her 
              offences.<br><br>Quek asked what she could give him in return for helping her.<br><br>He claimed a girl once had sex with him while a boy paid him after he agreed to help them.<br><br>The 15-year-old girl refused to have sex with him and she made a police report after telling her boyfriend about her ordeal.<br><br>Besides
               this, Quek had also accepted a S$50 bribe from an unknown Chinese man 
              whom he had caught littering near Woodlands MRT station in September 
              2008.<br><br>This, in exchange for not taking enforcement action against the man.<br><br>Quek had also used a forged Singapore-Cambridge GCE O Level certificate on November 13, 2007 to apply for a job at a bookshop.<br><br>He
               had found the original document in a pile of discarded items near a 
              lift and decided to use it even though he did not even complete his 
              primary school education.<br><br>Quek then pasted his own name onto the certificate and made a copy of it before applying for the job.<br><br>The tanned, bespectacled man had also been caught with two other forged documents in his possession.<br><br>One of them had the Singapore Police Force logo on its letterhead.<br><br>It contained instructions on how a strip search was supposedly conducted on both men and women.<br><br>The other bogus document was a blank Notice to Attend Court, purportedly signed by a Certis CISCO officer.<br><br>For asking the girl for gratification, Quek could have been jailed up to five years, fined a maximum of S$100,000 or both.<br><br>And for being in possession of the forged documents, for each charge, he could have been jailed up to four years and fined.<br><br>-CNA/wk</span></span></p>
