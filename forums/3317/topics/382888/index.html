              <p><strong>Comatose for 23 years, Belgian feels reborn</strong></p>
              <p>BRUSSELS â€“ Helped by a therapist, Rom Houben's outstretched finger
              tapped with surprising speed on a computer touchscreen, spelling out
              how he felt "alone, lonely, frustrated" in the 23 years he was trapped
              inside a paralyzed body.</p>
              <p>After a doctor found he was wrongly
              diagnosed as being in a vegetative state, and worked out a way for him
              to communicate, Houben said he now feels reborn.</p>
              <p>"And just
              like with a baby, it happens with a lot of stumbling," the 46-year-old
              Belgian wrote, tapping out the words in Dutch for Associated Press
              Television News on Tuesday as an aide guided his hand.</p>
              <p>A
              leading bioethicist, however, expressed skepticism that Houben was
              really communicating, saying the responses seem unnatural for someone
              with such a profound injury and an inability to communicate for decades.</p>
              <p>Injured
              in a car crash in 1983 when he was 20, Houbon was diagnosed as being in
              a vegetative state, though doctors now believe he was conscious the
              whole time.</p>
              <p>An expert using a specialized type of brain scan
              that was not available in the 1980s says he finally realized Houben was
              suffering from a form of "locked-in syndrome," in which people are
              unable to speak or move but can think and reason, and provided him with
              the equipment to communicate.</p>
              <p>Now, assisted by a speech
              therapist who moved his finger letter-by-letter along a touch-screen
              keyboard, Houben says years of being unable to move or express himself
              left him feeling "alone, lonely, frustrated, but also blessed with my
              family."</p>
              <p>"It was especially frustrating when my family needed
              me," wrote Houben, who says he heard his father died during that time,
              but was unable to show any emotion. "I could not share in their sorrow.
              We could not give each other support."</p>
              <p>"Just imagine. You
              hear, see, feel and think but no one can see that. You undergo things.
              You cannot participate in life," he wrote.</p>
              <p>The therapist,
              Linda Wouters, told APTN that she can feel Houben guiding her hand with
              gentle pressure from his fingers, and that she feels him objecting when
              she moves his hand toward an incorrect letter.</p>
              <p>Despite the
              occasional typo, the responses seemed fluid and conversational Tuesday.
              Suffering from a cold, he opened the interview by typing out, with the
              help of his therapist: "You catch me at a bad moment, I have looked
              better."</p>
              <p>Dr. Steven Laureys of Belgium's Coma Science Group,
              whose testing uncovered Houben's misdiagnosis three years ago, says he
              has discovered some degree of consciousness using state-of-the-art
              equipment like PET scans on other patients and looks at about 50 cases
              from around the world a year.</p>
              <p>But none are as extreme as that
              of Houben, who was fully conscious inside a paralyzed body. Many center
              on the fine distinction between a vegetative state and minimal
              consciousness.</p>
              <p>Arthur Caplan, a bioethics professor at the
              University of Pennsylvania who has had no direct contact with Houben or
              personal knowledge of the case, said he is skeptical of Houben's
              ability to communicate after seeing video of his hand being moved along
              the keyboard.</p>
              <p>"That's called 'facilitated communication,'"
              Caplan said. "That is Ouija board stuff. It's been discredited time and
              time again. When people look at it, it's usually the person doing the
              pointing who's doing the messages, not the person they claim they are
              helping."</p>
              <p>Houben's mother, Fina, told the AP her son has been communicating for three years and she believes no one is guiding him.</p>
              <p>"At
              first he had to push with his foot on a sort of computer mouse which
              only had a yes-no side," she said in a telephone interview. "Slowly he
              got better and developed through a language computer and now
              communicates with this speech therapist holding his hand."</p>
              <p>Dr.
              James Bernat of Dartmouth Medical School said he could not comment on
              the facts of Houben's case specifically. However, he called Laureys "a
              very rigorous scientist and physician ... one of the world's leaders"
              in the field of brain imaging in people with consciousness disorders.</p>
              <p>Houben's
              mother said her son has become so proficient at punching sentences that
              he has even started writing a book. He has also written an article
              titled "Hidden wealth ... the force of silence" for the in-house
              magazine at the 't Weyerke institute in eastern Belgian where he is
              being treated.</p>
              <p>Asked Tuesday how he felt when his
              consciousness was discovered, Houben tapped out rapidly with the help
              of his aide: "I especially felt relief. Finally...able to show that I
              was indeed there."</p>
              <p>Laureys said he is now re-examining dozens
              of other cases. In a recent study, 40 percent of the patients diagnosed
              as being in a vegetative state were in fact minimally conscious.</p>
              <p>American
              experts acknowledged a vegetative state diagnosis can often be wrong.
              But in most cases, they said, it involves a patient who is minimally
              conscious, whose muted and intermittent signs of awareness might be
              overlooked, rather than a patient like Houben, who is fully conscious
              but paralyzed.</p>
              <p>Experts blamed the difficulty of diagnosis,
              insufficient training of doctors and a lack of follow-up to look for
              subtle signs that a once-vegetative patient has actually improved.</p>
              <p>"Many
              people recover over time," said Dr. Joseph J. Fins of the Weill Cornell
              Medical College. "It's very easy for the label that is affixed at one
              point to sort of become eternalized, and so no one questions the
              diagnosis."</p>
