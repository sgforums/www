              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT">KUALA LUMPUR: An Indian national who
              was working as a waiter in Malaysia was shot dead in a 'revenge' attack near a
              restaurant which was full of footbal fans watching live telecast of a FIFA World
              Cup match.
              <br><br> The killer then ran across the street to a waiting car
              that sped off. Dash, 30 worked as a waiter in a restaurant in the Kota Damansar
              suburb near here.
              <br><br> Football fans watching the live telecast World Cup
              2010 match between South Africa and Mexico at a restaurant in Kota Damansara on
              Friday night were jolted by the sound of a gunshot. They were shocked to learn
              that the target, who later died in hospital, was a waiter who had just gone off
              duty.
              <br><br> It was close to midnight, and the waiter, an Indian national
              known only as Dash was making his way to the restaurant workers' dormitory
              located near the restaurant in Dataran Sunway when a man approached him. From a
              foot away, the man shot Dash in the stomach.
              <br><br> Petaling Jaya district
              deputy police chief Superintendent Abdul Razak Eliyas said yesterday that Dash
              was rushed to Sungai Buloh Hospital but died after arrival.
              <br><br> About 50
              people were watching the World Cup game at the restaurant at the time, Razak
              said.
              <br><br> "An initial investigation showed that the victim was shot in
              his abdomen. We found a bullet slug on the floor near the body.
              <br><br> "We
              believed the killer use .9mm semi-automatic gun. Closed-circuit television
              camera recordings reveal that the killer was wearing a dark blue shirt with
              black pants.
              <br><br> "The killer also wore a full-face motorcycle helmet and
              was waiting for the victim at the stairs."
              <br><br> Razak said that after
              shooting Dash, the killer ran across the road to a waiting Proton Perdana being
              driven by an accomplice and they sped off.
              <br><br> He said the killing was
              well planned and police believe the motive was revenge.
              <br><br> "We believe
              we can quickly solve this case," he said, adding that police were searching for
              the suspects.
              <br><br> The restaurant's owner, who declined to be named, said
              the victim had been working at the restaurant for only four
              months.
              <br><br> "We expect to catch the killer and his getaway driver as soon
              as we view the CCTV recordings and record statements from witnesses that will
              reveal several vital details to the investigators," he said</span></p>
