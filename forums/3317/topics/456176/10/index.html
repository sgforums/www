              <div class="news_detail">
              <div>
              <p>SINGAPORE: The prosecution on Wednesday asserted that 
              the law professor accused of being corrupt in the sex-for-grades trial 
              "has a flair for drama".</p>
              <p>Tey Tsun Hang, who is defending himself 
              in the trial, is accused of corruptly obtaining gifts and sex from his 
              former student Darinne Ko, 23, between May and July 2010, in return for 
              lifting her grades.</p>
              <p>Taking the stand for the third consecutive 
              day, the 41-year-old traded barbs with lead prosecutor Andre Jumabhoy. 
              The prosecution is trying to prove the voluntariness of Tey's statements
               to the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB).</p>
              <p>Tey has 
              maintained throughout that he was coerced into making confessions to the
               CPIB. He has said his six CPIB statements were made under duress.</p>
              <p>Over the past two days, he testified the threats made and events that transpired during the recording of the statements.</p>
              <p>Among the accusations, Tey said CPIB officers humiliated him, made callous remarks and hurled vulgarities at him.</p>
              <p>On
               Tuesday, Tey said CPIB Deputy Director Teng Khee Fatt had fabricated 
              some parts of his statements, which were recorded by the officer in May 
              2012.</p>
              <p>Mr Teng had recorded three of Tey's six statements.</p>
              <p>On Wednesday, Tey clarified the word "fabricated" insinuated criminal intent and that it was not his words, but Mr Jumabhoy's.</p>
              <p>Mr Jumabhoy went through multiple examples of threats and oppression raised over the past two days by Tey.</p>
              <p>But he pointed out that Tey never questioned Mr Teng and two of his officers when they went to court in January this year.</p>
              <p>Tey admitted he failed to do so.</p>
              <p>But he explained that he had been on medication and had problems recollecting details.</p>
              <p>Mr Jumabhoy then asked Tey if he thought his demonstrations over the last few days were dramatic.</p>
              <p>Tey
               said he was not sure how they are perceived but that he was just trying
               his best to recollect and tell his side of the story.</p>
              <p>This led the prosecution to charge that Tey clearly has a flair for drama.</p>
              <p>Tey rebutted, saying he is a law professor and no dramatist.</p>
              <p>Prosecution is trying to make the point there are currently two accounts of what transpired during the recording sessions.</p>
              <p>One account was told by the officers in January this year and the other one by Tey.</p>
              <p>The prosecution is saying that Tey's account is made up.</p>
              <p>But Tey said the prosecution has no basis for this and said the CPIB was a "confession-centric organisation".</p>
              <p>Known as a "trial within a trial", the hearing is meant to determine if the CPIB statements are admissible in court.</p>

              <h1 class="news_title">CPIB fabricated parts of statements: law prof in sex-for-grades trial</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE: The National University of 
              Singapore law professor involved in a sex-for-grades corruption trial 
              said in court Tuesday that the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau 
              (CPIB) fabricated parts of his statements.</p>
              <p>Tey Tsun Hang, 41, is 
              defending himself against six counts of corruptly obtaining 
              gratification in the form of gifts and sex from his then-student Darinne
               Ko Wen Hui, 23, between May and July 2010 in return for lifting her 
              grades.</p>
              <p>Tey is currently contesting that six of his CPIB statements are inadmissible as they were not given voluntary.</p>
              <p>On
               Tuesday, his second day on the stand, Tey said that CPIB's deputy 
              director Teng Khee Fatt had typed out what he wanted Tey to say while he
               was recording Tey's statement in May 2012.</p>
              <p>Mr Teng had recorded 
              three of the six statements in question. The first was recorded on 17 
              May, the second on 18 May, and the third on 24 May.</p>
              <p>When 
              questioned by the prosecution at the end of the court session on 
              Tuesday, Tey said that the first statement recorded by Mr Teng on 17 May
               was partly fabricated while the second, recorded on 18 May, was "pretty
               much" made up.</p>
              <p>Earlier in the day Tey told the court that the 
              investigator had heaped expletives on him when he wanted to make changes
               to the first of six statements.</p>
              <p>He said that he could not continue reading what was recorded in the statement as he was too affected by Mr Teng’s outburst.</p>
              <p>Tey
               then said that the recording officer became impatient with him and 
              threatened him whenever he would not make certain points in his second 
              statement.</p>
              <p>Tey also said that he was ill and on psychoactive medication during the recording of the third statement.</p>
              <p>He
               added that he was in a state of helplessness, and signed the confession
               in "silent protest" after feeling like he was a “victim of oppression”.</p>
              <p>Tey
               continued by saying that he was in a dissociative state and that 
              nothing registered in his mind during the recording of the next three 
              statements.</p>
              <p>The district judge called for a short break during the
               trial to allow Tey to regain his composure after he broke down and 
              cried on the stand; Tey became overwhelmed with emotion when recounting 
              how he had to take care of his father, who had undergone two brain 
              surgeries, while Tey himself was ill.</p>
              <p>As Tey is currently 
              contesting the admissibility of his CPIB statements, the court will to 
              decide if his statements are admissible at the end of the “trial within a
               trial”.</p>
              <p>The main corruption trial will take place thereafter.</p>

              <h1 class="news_title">Law prof in sex-for-grades case denies fabricating evidence</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE: The law professor accused of
               corruption in the sex-for-grades case has denied the prosecution's case
               that he fabricated evidence.</p>
              <p>Tey Tsun Hang, 41, who maintains 
              that his confessions were extracted under duress, is accused of 
              corruptly obtaining gifts and sex from his former student, Darinne Ko, 
              in return for giving her better grades.</p>
              <p>Continuing the 
              "trial-within-a-trial" hearing where Tey is contesting the voluntariness
               of his six statements to the CPIB, lead prosecutor Andre Jumabhoy put 
              it to Tey that officers from the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau 
              had at no stage threatened or badgered him into confessing.</p>
              <p>Tey disagreed.</p>
              <p>A key issue that was raised on Thursday morning was the admission of some of Tey's cautioned statements.</p>
              <p>The prosecution objected to the move, stating that the documents might prejudice the court.</p>
              <p>But the district judge said this would not be an issue.</p>
              <p>The court is to decide if the statements are voluntary or not, and only after that, will the main corruption trial will begin.</p>

              <h1 class="news_title">Law prof in sex-for-grades trial was "inventing evidence": prosecution</h1>
              <div class="news_detail">
              <div>
              <p>SINGAPORE: The law professor defending himself in the 
              sex-for-grades corruption trial "was clearly inventing evidence as he 
              went along".</p>
              <p>The prosecution said this in its oral submissions on Monday in the "trial-within-trial" hearing.</p>
              <p>The
               hearing is to determine if law professor Tey Tsun Hang was coerced into
               confessing to the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB).</p>
              <p>Tey,
               41, maintains that the six statements he gave to the CPIB were made 
              under threat and duress and the confessions are therefore not admissible
               in court.</p>
              <p>But prosecutor Andre Jumabhoy said in his written 
              submissions that Tey's evidence is "internally inconsistent" and that 
              there is no credibility.</p>
              <p>He said Tey had put one set of 
              allegations to the prosecution witnesses but in his evidence, he came up
               with a different set of allegations, which he had never put to the 
              prosecution witnesses.</p>
              <p>Mr Jumabhoy said Tey could not offer any proper explanation for why he had failed to put these new allegations to the witnesses.<br><br>As
               for Tey's explanation that he had been suffering from acute stress 
              disorder, Mr Jumabhoy said Tey was the only source of information for 
              the diagnosis.<br><br>Tey's psychiatrist, Dr Michael Yong, also admitted
               it was possible that his diagnosis could be wrong if the information 
              provided to him was incorrect.</p>
              <p>The prosecution said Tey's 
              claims that he was forced by CPIB to give the statements despite his 
              pleas of not being in a fit state to give statements "are inconsistent 
              with evidence that he was keen to go to CPIB to explain himself".<br><br>Given these reasons, prosecution argued that the CPIB statements are admissible as they were made voluntarily.</p>
              <p>Tey
               faces allegations that he corruptly obtained gifts and sex from his 
              former student, Darinne Ko, in return for giving her better grades 
              between May and July 2010. </p>

              <h1 class="news_title">Sex-for-grades law prof "fabricated and exaggerated" some evidence says judge</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE – The Chief District Judge 
              said he finds it hard to believe the law professor's claims that the 
              Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) threatened him into 
              confessing.</p>
              <p>In deciding whether Tey Tsun Hang's six statements
               to the CPIB were made voluntarily or not, judge Tan Siong Thye said he 
              is "of the view the accused had fabricated and exaggerated some of the 
              evidence".</p>
              <p>A key issue raised in the judge's 45-minute oral 
              grounds for decision was why Tey did not complain about the CPIB 
              officers to anyone.</p>
              <p>If Tey's claims that the CPIB coerced him 
              into making statements were true, the judge asked why Tey did not lodge a
               police report then.</p>
              <p>Judge Tan said it is difficult to believe
               that Tey was coerced on all six occasions as he had opportunity to seek
               advice from his Dean from the law faculty at the National University of
               Singapore, as well as his fellow law professors.</p>
              <p>He pointed 
              out that there is no evidence that Tey had told the Alexandra Hospital 
              medical team of the harsh CPIB treatment, so that the doctors could have
               taken some form of action.</p>
              <p>Given that Tey was a former 
              district judge, a former state counsel and a law professor, the judge 
              said the accused should have known what he could have done.</p>
              <p>The
               judge added that if Tey's claims were true, one would expect him to be 
              subjected to the same harsh treatment when he made the cautioned 
              statement, which listed the allegations against the CPIB.</p>
              <p>He 
              added that if the allegations were true, the CPIB officers would have 
              recorded Tey's statement on 9 April 2012, when he went to the CPIB 
              headquarters after leaving the hospital.</p>
              <p>Instead, the judge pointed out that Tey was told to go back as he said he was not feeling well.</p>
              <p>As
               for the alleged threats to arrest his wife, the judge said even if they
               were true, they were empty threats, simply because Tey's wife was 
              overseas at that time and such arrests were not under CPIB's 
              jurisdiction.</p>
              <p>The other key issue relates to Tey's claims that
               he was on psychoactive medication during the period when he recorded 
              the six statements.</p>
              <p>Judge Tan said despite Tey being on medication, he could still recall "a tremendous amount" of detail of what took place.</p>
              <p>The judge said the medication did not appear to affect Tey's mind as he had claimed.</p>
              <p>As
               for Tey's claims that he was badgered, the judge said persistent 
              questioning is part of essential interrogation and some discomfort is to
               be expected.</p>
              <p>In this case, the judge said there is no evidence there was prolonged and harsh badgering which could result in oppression.</p>
              <p>The
               judge added that Tey had three accounts of the allegations and the 
              "shifting defence makes his case less likely to be believed".</p>
              <p>Now that the CPIB statements are admitted, the main corruption trial will continue.</p>
              <p>Tey,
               41, faces allegations of corruptly obtaining gifts and sex from his 
              former student, 23-year-old Darinne Ko, in return for lifting her grades
               sometime between May and July 2010.</p>

              <h1 class="news_title">Law prof in sex-for-grades trial says former student deserved poorer grades</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE: The National University of 
              Singapore (NUS) law professor embroiled in the sex-for-grades corruption
               trial said his former student deserved poorer grades than he had given 
              her.</p>
              <p>Tey Tsun Hang faces six allegations that he obtained 
              gifts and sex from former student, Darinne Ko, some time between May and
               July 2010, in return for lifting her grades.</p>
              <p>In one of his 
              six statements to the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB), Tey
               said Ms Ko did not deserve the 'B+' grade she was given for her test on
               Equity and Trust.</p>
              <p>The 41-year-old said Ms Ko "deserved to just pass the paper".</p>
              <p>In
               the statement made in the evening of 5 April 2012, Tey also said 
              23-year-old Ms Ko should not have gotten a "B" grade for the Personal 
              Property Law paper.</p>
              <p>He said in the statement Ms Ko "was a borderline failure".</p>
              <p>The statement, which was Tey's second, was recorded by CPIB officer Wilson Khoo.</p>
              <p>It also stated that Tey was expecting gifts from Ms Ko, which she gave willingly.</p>
              <p>But on Wednesday during the cross-examination of Mr Khoo, Tey said these comments could not have come from him.</p>
              <p>For example, Tey pointed to the words "borderline failure".</p>
              <p>He said there's no such category used at NUS, so he could not have said it.</p>
              <p>Tey is making the point that the statement is false.</p>
              <p>Earlier, CPIB officer Bay Chun How testified in court over Tey's first statement, recorded on 5 April 2012.</p>
              <p>The trial continues.</p>

              <div class="news_detail">
              <div>
              <p>SINGAPORE: The law professor accused of corruptly 
              obtaining gifts and sex from a former student on Friday continued to 
              take issue with words and phrases in his statement recorded by the 
              Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB).</p>
              <p>Tey Tsun Hang, 41, 
              faces six allegations that he obtained gifts and sex from his former 
              student, 23-year-old Darinne Ko, in return for giving her better grades 
              between May and July 2010.</p>
              <p>On Friday morning, Tey said he could 
              not have used the words "corrupt intent" in the statement recorded by 
              CPIB's Deputy Director Teng Khee Fatt, much less volunteer the 
              definition of those words, "so he could be nailed on the wall".</p>
              <p>"So
               are you seriously proposing a person under interrogation would want to 
              volunteer to you, to describe to you in great detail, detailed meaning 
              ‘of corrupt intent’ so he could be nailed on the wall?" said Tey.</p>
              <p>Mr
               Teng replied Tey had used the words "with corrupt intent" in his 
              previous statements and he was trying to find out from Tey what he had 
              meant by it.</p>
              <p>But Tey argued that Mr Teng had given "the most 
              ludicrous proposition for a person under interrogation and psychoactive 
              medication to volunteer the minute definition exercise of ‘corrupt 
              intent’, so as to help himself be nailed on the wall". Mr Teng repeated 
              that Tey had told him so.</p>
              <p>Tey also accused Mr Teng of typing some 
              paragraphs himself but the witness said that "was exactly what Professor
               Tey had told me" to do.</p>
              <p>Tey, a former district judge, said 
              throughout on Thursday and Friday Mr Teng's "linguistic expressions" 
              used in court "are similarly manifested in all three statements" he had 
              recorded on 17, 18 and 24 May 2012. Mr Teng disagreed.</p>
              <p>A phrase raised during the hearing was described by Tey as "downright nonsensical" - "Bad faiths mean wrong conscientious".</p>
              <p>Mr Teng again said it was what Tey had wanted to put in the statement.</p>
              <p>In
               an earlier statement, Tey had said he had given better grades to Ms Ko 
              for two papers, in Personal Property Law as well as Equity and Trust.</p>
              <p>In his later statement recorded by Mr Teng, he was allowed to retract that point.</p>
              <p>On
               Friday, Tey said it was because by then, Mr Teng had already received 
              information from the National University of Singapore that the 
              alteration of grades in those two modules "had no basis whatsoever".</p>
              <p>Mr
               Teng explained that Tey was "trying to confuse" him by telling him that
               he changed Ms Ko's grades at first and saying he did not later.</p>
              <p>The trial continues. </p>

              <h1 class="news_title">Law prof in sex-for-grades trial says "he was in love" with his former student</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE: The law professor accused of
               corruption in the sex-for-grades trial said he loved his former student
               and that he never wanted to take advantage of her.</p>
              <p>Tey Tsun 
              Hang, 41, faces six allegations that he corruptly obtained gifts and sex
               from 23-year-old Darinne Ko, in return for lifting her grades between 
              May and July 2010.</p>
              <p>Taking the witness stand in his own defence
               on Monday, Tey recounted his relationship with Ms Ko, saying he was in 
              love with her.</p>
              <p>He added that she would address him as "dearest dinosaur" and gave him an iPod filled with songs they listened to together.</p>
              <p>Describing
               Ms Ko as "charming", "vivacious" and "an intellect", Tey also told the 
              court they would send each other poems - hers in English and his in 
              Mandarin - as a declaration of their love for one another.</p>
              <p>Tey
               also went through the list of gifts Ms Ko showered on him, which 
              included among other things, a Montblanc pen, CYC tailored shirts and an
               iPod.</p>
              <p>Tey also gave an explanation of his cheque book entries that were mentioned in court in January this year.</p>
              <p>The
               court had heard then that Tey had paid Ms Ko for those gifts as well as
               for the dinner at Garibaldi's. The bill for that dinner was dated 21 
              July 2010.</p>
              <p>Tey said he had issued a cheque for S$2,500 in July 2010 before Ms Ko left for an overseas study stint.</p>
              <p>Back in January 2013, he said the amount is slightly more than the value of the gifts mentioned in the first four charges.</p>
              <p>But in January this year, Ms Ko said no such cheque was given to her.</p>
              <p>Tey said he made the cheque out to Ms Ko but she refused to accept it.</p>
              <p>Tey said he paid her in cash after that.</p>
              <p>At
               that time, lead prosecutor Mr Andre Jumabhoy pointed out that the 
              cheque was dated early July 2010 while the dinner bill was dated 21 
              July.</p>
              <p>So Mr Jumabhoy said Tey is purporting to pay for a dinner even before it had taken place.</p>
              <p>But
               on Monday, Tey explained that Ms Ko had been arranging for the 
              Garibaldi dinner weeks before the actual appointment as all nine 
              attendees had different schedules. And because it was arranged weeks 
              before, Tey said he had a rough idea of the cost of the dinner.</p>
              <p>By then, Tey said he also found out from a friend, the cost of the Montblanc pen.</p>
              <p>He
               said he added the costs of the dinner, pen and other gifts and wrote a 
              cheque amounting to S$2,500 to Ms Ko for the items to reimburse her.</p>
              <p>Tey
               said that prosecution's point about him being able to foretell the cost
               of a dinner in the future was a "hurtful supposition".</p>
              <p>The move for Tey to testify follows the wrap of the prosecution's case on Monday morning.</p>
              <p>The defence has to lay out its case now.</p>

              <div>
              <p>SINGAPORE: The law professor defending himself in a 
              sex-for-grades corruption trial took the stand for a second day in court
               on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>Tey Tsun Hang, 41, is defending himself against six 
              counts of corruptly obtaining gratification in the form of gifts and sex
               from his then-student Darinne Ko Wen Hui, 23, between May and July 2010
               in return for lifting her grades.</p>
              <p>On Tuesday, day 21 of the 
              trial, Tey corrected parts of his statements made at the Corrupt 
              Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB). He denied ever making certain 
              points.</p>
              <p>For example, Tey said in the statements that Ms Ko did not deserve to pass one of her papers marked by him.</p>
              <p>However on Tuesday, Tey said he never made such a statement.</p>
              <p>He pointed out that Ms Ko was on the Dean's List during her first year at the National University of Singapore’s Law Faculty.</p>
              <p>Tey said Ms Ko was not on the Dean's List in 2010 when they were dating.</p>
              <p>He also reiterated that his relationship with Ms Ko was without corrupt intent.</p>

              <p>SINGAPORE: The law professor accused of corruption in 
              the sex-for-grades trial will be going to the Institute of Mental Health
               (IMH) for assessment.</p>
              <p>Tey Tsun Hang, 41, faces six allegations of
               obtaining gifts and sex from his former student Darinne Ko, in return

              <p>On 
              Thursday morning, Tey's lawyer made an application for his client to see

              trial.</p>
              <p>The move comes after Tey felt unwell on Wednesday and had to seek treatment at the National University Hospital.</p>
              <p>There, he was diagnosed with acute hyperventilation and was referred to a forensic psychiatrist at IMH.</p>

              <h1 class="news_title">Not wrong to have relationship with student: law prof in sex-for-grades trial</h1>
              <div class="news_detail">
              <div>
              <p>SINGAPORE: The law professor defending himself in a 
              sex-for-grades corruption trial on Wednesday said he did not think it 
              was wrong for him to have a relationship with a student.</p>
              <p>Tey Tsun 
              Hang, 41, is defending himself against six counts of corruptly obtaining
               gratification in the form of gifts and sex from his then-student 
              Darinne Ko Wen Hui, 23, between May and July 2010 in return for lifting 
              her grades.</p>
              <p>Tey on Wednesday told the court that he did not see 
              anything wrong with him continuing to teach Ms Ko, even though their 
              relationship ended in late 2010.</p>
              <p>He however admitted that he 
              failed to declare the relationship and gifts to the National University 
              of Singapore (NUS), as required by the university's code of conduct.</p>
              <p>Lead
               prosecutor Andre Jumabhoy then charged that Tey tried to conceal the 
              relationship and gifts from NUS so that he could continue teaching Ms 
              Ko.</p>
              <p>Tey denied this, saying that he tried to stop Ms Ko from enrolling in one of his courses after their relationship ended.</p>
              <p>Ms Ko enrolled in a course taught by Tey in 2011.</p>
              <p>Mr Jumabhoy pointed out that by that point time, Tey had already taught Ms Ko two other subjects.</p>
              <p>"Two
               out of three courses isn't bad, is it Mr Tey?" said the prosecutor, to 
              which Tey replied: "If you are saying I advantaged her in the two 
              courses, the results show that she was not."</p>
              <p>Another point of contention was the payment for gifts.</p>
              <p>Ms
               Ko allegedly gave Tey a Frederic Chopin edition Mont Blanc pen, two CYC
               tailored shirts, and an iPod. She also paid for a group dinner hosted 
              by Tey at an Italian restaurant. The items and dinner amounted to about 
              S$2,415.</p>
              <p>During the first tranche of the trial in January this 
              year, Tey said he issued a cheque amounting to S$2,500 in July 2010 
              before Ms Ko left for an overseas study stint.</p>
              <p>However when Ms Ko testified in January, she said no such cheque was given to her.</p>
              <p>Tey then said that he made the cheque out to Ms Ko but she refused to accept it, leading him to pay her in cash.</p>
              <p>Ms Ko however also denied receiving the cash.</p>
              <p>On
               Wednesday, when asked if he found it odd that Ms Ko denied ever 
              receiving the cheque and cash, Tey said his "heart sank" when he heard 
              her answer.</p>
              <p>Tey also told the court on Wednesday that he was aware
               and concerned that Ms Ko was earning only a small allowance from her 
              internships and thus wanted to pay her back for the gifts she had 
              bought, as well as the dinner for which she paid.</p>
              <p>Tey said he did 
              an estimate before the dinner took place as he wanted to reimburse Ms Ko
               before she left Singapore. Ms Ko was to leave the country on 3 August 
              2010.</p>
              <p>This prompted the prosecution to ask why Tey did not pay for
               the Mont Blanc pen and the tailored shirts first; Mr Jumabhoy pointed 
              out that by 15 June, 2010, Tey knew the cost of the pen but did not pay 
              her.</p>
              <p>Tey replied saying that it was because he did not want to sully their relationship by talking about money.</p>
              <p>Mr
               Jumabhoy however pointed out that on 22 June 2010, while the pair was 
              at the tailor's, Tey could have offered to pay for Ms Ko's shirts but he
               did not.</p>
              <p>Tey explained that he had, at the back of his mind, wanted to pay Ms Ko back for the pen and shirts.</p>
              <p>However
               he added that it was "not nice" to reimburse Ms Ko item by item so he 
              decided to work out the cost of the dinner and issue a cheque for all 
              the gifts.</p>
              <p>Tey said he innocently thought to reimburse her in one sitting, which was why he made out the S$2,500 cheque to her.</p>
              <p>Another
               point of contention in court on Wednesday was a revelation by the 
              defence, who said that Ms Ko had asked for Tey to reimburse her S$1,000 
              upon returning from her overseas stint in 2011. Ms Ko did so after 
              requests from her mother, said Tey.</p>
              <p>This lead the prosecution to 
              stress that it was the first time the court heard Ms Ko's mother wanted 
              S$1,000 from Tey, and that it was very different from Ms Ko's court 
              testimony.</p>
              <p>Ms Ko had previously testified that Tey did not pay her
               for the gifts or dinner. The dinner was hosted by Tey but by late 2010 
              the pair had broken up.</p>
              <p>Tey on Wednesday said he paid Ms Ko as he did not want "to quibble" over it.</p>
              <p>This
               led Mr Jumabhoy to point out that Tey "should be aggrieved", adding 
              that nowhere in his statements did Tey ever mention such an important 
              point, which could clear him of the charges.</p>
              <p>"But this is an important point!" said Mr Jumabhoy. "The basis for saying 'I'm not corrupt' is 'I have paid back every penny'.”</p>
              <p>The
               prosecutor also pointed out that if Tey's account is accurate, the law 
              professor had gone over and beyond by paying Ms Ko the S$1,000.</p>
              <p>This lead Tey to explain again that he did not want to quibble over money.</p>
              <p>The prosecution's case is that Tey never paid Ms Ko for any of the gifts nor the dinner.</p>
              <p>Ms
               Ko was saddled with an unpaid bill for six months for a dinner hosted 
              by Tey before she sought reimbursement in early 2011, said the 
              prosecution.</p>
              <p>Tey disagreed.</p>
              <p>After lunch, the trial was adjourned for about an hour after it started as Tey was sick and had to see a doctor.</p>
              <p>The trial continues.</p>
