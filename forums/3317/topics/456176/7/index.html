               National University of Singapore (NUS) law professor at the centre of a
               sex-for-grades scandal has filed two criminal motions – one against the
               school and the other against the public prosecutor.</span><br><br><span>In
               a statement to reporters at the Subordinate Courts after his second 
              pre-trial conference yesterday, Tey Tsun Hang said he was requesting the
               grades of students from the university, and “critical witness 
              statements” from the public prosecutor.</span><br><br><span>Criminal motions enable accused people with complaints to have their arguments heard in the High Court.</span><br><br><span>Tey’s
               lawyer Peter Low told The Straits Times that he had earlier asked NUS 
              for the grades, but the school had only “given some, but not others”.</span><br><br><span>One of the grades not given was that of the former student Tey had allegedly been involved with, Ms Darinne Ko Wen Hui.</span><br><br><span>The
               professor faces six counts of obtaining gifts and sex from Ms Ko in 
              2010. The 23-year-old, who graduated from NUS in June, is believed to be
               working at a law firm here.</span><br><br><span>A spokesman for the Attorney- General’s Chambers confirmed Tey’s applications but declined to comment further.</span><br><br><span>“As the matter is fixed for hearing before the High Court, it will not be appropriate for us to comment further,” she said.</span><br><br><span>When asked about the criminal motion against the university, NUS’ spokesman declined comment as the case is ongoing.</span><br><br><span>Mr Low said the motion against NUS was filed on Aug 31; the motion against the public prosecutor was filed last Monday.</span><br><br><span>Both will be heard at the High Court on Sept 24, while the trial for the case is scheduled to start on Oct 15.</span><br><br><span>In
               his statement yesterday, Tey said that the public prosecutor had “again
               pressed for early trial dates”, despite requests by his lawyer for more
               time to prepare his defence.</span></div>

              <p><strong>Sex-for-grades case: NUS professor "coerced into confession"</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: National University of Singapore (NUS) Law professor 
              Tey Tsun Hang, who is at the centre of the sex-for-grades scandal, 
              claims he was coerced into confessing to his alleged offences.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>According to his 
              lawyer, Mr Peter Low, Tey was diagnosed with Acute Stress Disorder and 
              Altered Mental Status after he was arrested, and was in a "fragile 
              mental state throughout the interrogation sessions".</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Tey faces six corruption charges for allegedly showing favour to his student, Darinne Ko Wen Hui, between May and July 2010.<br><br>In a hearing on Monday, Tey's defence counsel, which now includes MP for Aljunied GRC, Sylvia Lim, filed four criminal motions.<br><br>The motions were filed against the National University of Singapore, Alexandra Hospital and the prosecution.<br><br>Mr Low said he wanted information from NUS on the grades of Ms Ko and four other students.<br><br>He
               said this was "relevant" as his client was "coerced into signing 
              confessions" and "forced into admitting to taking gifts such as tea 
              leaves and obtaining sex in exchange for unjustified favourable grades."<br><br>In
               response, NUS, represented by lawyers from Drew &amp; Napier, said it 
              will comply with the judge's decision on whether NUS has to disclose the
               grades.<br><br>Mr Low also said he wanted Tey's psychiatric and medical reports from Alexandra Hospital. <br><br>Mr Low told the court that Tey was on psychoactive drugs when he made his confessions.<br><br>He
               said Tey was rushed to Alexandra Hospital within 12 hours of his arrest
               and interrogated at the Corrupt Practices Investigations Bureau (CPIB).<br><br>The court heard that Tey was then treated and diagnosed with Acute Stress Disorder and Altered Mental Status.<br><br>Mr
               Low added that "false confessions" were extracted from the day Tey was 
              discharged from the hospital right through the last interrogation 
              session.<br><br>Mr Low then requested for disclosure of Tey's 
              hospitalisation record, medical prescriptions, and identities of the 
              nurses who attended to him.<br><br>But in response, Alexandra Hospital claimed it had already given a "very detailed report" which included such information.<br><br>Lawyer
               for Alexandra Hospital, Ms Kuah Boon Theng, added it will "readily 
              provide" clarifications if Tey's counsel team required more information.<br><br>Mr
               Low also wanted clarification of charges and critical witness 
              statements from the prosecution, to better prepare Tey's defence.<br><br>He said this included times and places of the alleged intercourse.<br><br>Lastly,
               the defence counsel also requested for trial dates, which were 
              originally fixed to start three weeks from Monday, to be postponed to 
              mid-December onwards.<br><br>Mr Low told the court this is to allow "sufficient time for proper preparation".<br><br>He said "the rush for an early trial hampers proper preparation of Tey's defence and prejudices his chances of a fair trial."<br><br>A judgement is expected to be given on Tuesday.<br><br>- CNA/cc</span></span></p>

              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: The National University of Singapore (NUS) law 
              professor who is on trial for corruption in a sex-for-grades case will 
              defend himself in court. </span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Tey Tsun Hang, 41, made the request in an unexpected twist minutes into the trial on Thursday morning.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Although confusion and disagreement arose over his request, the matter was eventually sorted out after an hour.<br><br>Tey
               appeared to be ready to defend himself. He arrived in court dressed in a
               grey pin-striped suit. He later changed into a court dress after he 
              asked to defend himself.<br><br>He is accused of obtaining gratification
               in the form of sex on two occasions, as well as gifts including a 
              Montblanc pen, an iPod and tailor-made shirts between May and July 2010.<br> <br>The prosecution said these were inducements to show favour in his assessment of Ms Darinne Ko Wen Hui's academic performance.<br><br>Ninety minutes into the trial, key prosecution witness Darinne Ko was called to the stand. <br><br>The 23-year-old former student of Tey said they came to know each other in January 2010.<br><br>She
               told the court she liked Tey as a friend and had given him the 
              740-dollar Montblanc pen as a belated birthday gift in May 2010. <br><br>She
               also bought him two custom-made shirts worth more than S$230 and an 
              iPod Touch worth S$160 from an online forum as a romantic gesture.<br><br>Ms Ko told the court that they were dating at that time, "so it did not seem incongruous" to give Tey gifts.<br><br>The
               court heard that as the two interacted more frequently in April 2010, 
              Tey would meet Ms Ko for lunch about two to three times a week. He would
               pick her up from her workplace and pay for the lunches.<br><br>Tey is 
              also accused of corruptly obtaining gratification in the form of payment
               of a bill of S$1,280 for a dinner he hosted at Garibaldi restaurant in 
              July 2010. <br><br>The dinner for nine was meant to thank his former students, including Ms Ko, for helping him with research work.<br><br>But Ms Koh later revealed that after their relationship ended, she asked for Tey to pay her back S$1,000 and he did so.<br><br>Some
               six hours into her testimony, Ms Ko recounted her very first sexual 
              experience, which was with Tey in his NUS office in July 2010. She was 
              clearly distressed as she teared and tried to cover her face with one 
              hand. This was a clear contrast to the calm and collected manner in 
              which she answered other questions.<br><br>Ms Ko told the court she had sex with Tey because she loved him.<br><br>The
               court was also told Tey went to the United States in September 2010 to 
              visit her when she was there for an overseas study stint.<br><br>But they got found out by Ms Ko's then-boyfriend, who reported the matter to her parents.<br><br>Eventually, she was made to cut all ties with Tey and did so.<br><br>The
               prosecution said in its opening statement that Tey had revealed 
              confidential class ranking as well as results to Ms Ko to demonstrate 
              his power over her.<br><br>It said Tey had taken advantage of his student and the transactions were "tainted with an objectively corrupt element".<br><br>The trial continues. <br><br>- CNA/xq</span></span></p>

              <p><strong>Key witness in sex-for-grades trial claims CPIB coercion</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: The prosecution in the sex-for-grades corruption 
              trial involving a law professor, turned against its key witness on the 
              second day of the hearing by impeaching her credibility.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>It argued on Friday 
              that star witness Darinne Ko Wen Hui's testimony on Thursday  had 
              deviated from her first statement to the Corrupt Practices Investigation
               Bureau, taken in April last year.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Tey Tsun Hang, a 
              former district judge, faces six counts of corruptly obtaining 
              gratification in the form of gifts and sex from Ms Ko, between May and 
              July 2010.<br><br>The gifts included tailor-made shirts, an iPod Touch and a Montblanc pen.<br><br>The prosecution said these were inducements to show favour in Tey's assessment of Ms Ko's academic performance.<br><br>In a dramatic twist to the closely-watched trial, Ms Ko said she was coerced into making parts of her first CPIB statement.<br><br>She said the CPIB recording officers were only willing to record some of what she told them.<br><br>The
               23-year-old added that in relation to the gifts she showered on Tey, 
              one CPIB recording officer "received specific orders" to record within 
              the parameters of her agreement "with the (CPIB) boss".<br><br>These came minutes after the prosecution applied to impeach her credibility for parts of her testimony made on Thursday.<br><br>The
               swift move follows discrepancies in a few areas, including her amount 
              of interaction with Tey after they broke up and the details of photos 
              taken after they had sex.<br><br>Earlier in the day, the prosecution showed Ms Ko photographs of her and Tey, supposedly taken after they had sex.<br><br>When
               asked about some of the photos, Ms Ko said she could not remember when 
              and where it took place. Apparently, this is inconsistent with her 
              statement to the CPIB.<br><br>Ms Ko said on Thursday she gave the 740-dollar Montblanc pen to Tey as a belated birthday gift.<br><br>But prosecution pointed out that she failed to mention it in any of her CPIB statements.<br><br>To this, Ms Ko admitted she had "failed to convey to them (CPIB) at that point in time".<br><br>Ms Ko then said that she amended "only parts" of the first statement "which were coerced", in her subsequent statements. <br><br>She also said she stated clearly previously that the reasons for the gifts were due to her "feelings of affection" for Tey.<br><br>With
               impeachment, the judge will have to decide at the end of the trial, 
              which parts of Ms Ko's evidence to take into consideration.<br><br>The trial started with Tey asking the prosecution for information on his former students' grades, including that of Ms Ko. <br><br>Some
               four hours were spent going through more than 30 applications, of 
              which, six were granted and the rest were deemed irrelevant by Chief 
              District Judge Tan Siong Thye, who denied some of his requests. <br><br>At one point in time, he told Tey off for wasting the court's time as some of the information have already been provided. <br><br>The trial continues.<br><br>- CNA/xq</span></span></p>

              professor on trial for corruption in a sex-for-grades cross-examined his
               former student on Monday.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Tey Tsun Hang, 41, 
              is accused of obtaining gratification in the form of gifts and sex, in 
              exchange for lifting 23-year-old Ms Darinne Ko Wen Hui's grades.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>When Ms Ko took the stand, Tey questioned her in a gentle manner.  <br><br>She
               gave an account of the circumstances leading to the recording and her 
              endorsement of her first statement made on 2 April 2012.<br><br>Ms Ko 
              said she was hauled in by two officers from the Corrupt Practices 
              Investigation Bureau (CPIB), at about 7am or 8am during the examination 
              period.<br><br>She said she was deprived of sleep, felt scared and 
              anxious, and was interrogated until about 7pm before she was brought to 
              see CPIB's deputy director, Teng Khee Fatt. <br><br>She said the recording officer had told Mr Teng she had been uncooperative.<br><br>Mr Teng, she said, told her that the evidence she gave the CPIB was "not making out the elements of the charge against Tey".<br><br>During
               their two-and-a-half-hour conversation, she said Mr Teng told her that 
              corruption is a two-sided offence and that indemnity could be granted if
               the need arose.<br><br>She also said Mr Teng had wanted her to write 
              that she had given the gifts because she wanted "favour" from Tey but 
              she refused. <br><br>The two then argued about the terms to be used and 
              finally settled on the words "undue prejudice", which she took as 
              "treating her unfairly".<br><br>"I was slightly more comfortable with 
              that compromise even though it was still not an accurate depiction of 
              the true state of affairs," said Ms Ko.<br><br>When asked by Tey what 
              was the true state of affairs, Ms Ko said: "I only bought Prof Tey the 
              gifts because I liked him and we were in a relationship."<br><br>But Mr Teng didn't buy this answer, she said.<br><br>Ms Ko said he told her that it was not possible for a girl to buy a guy gifts.<br><br>She
               said Mr Teng also insisted that the reason why she bought those gifts 
              was so that Tey would show her favour vis-a-vis her grades.  <br><br>Ms Ko said she was told she was not allowed to go home until the CPIB recorded a statement from her.  <br><br>When asked if the statement was accurate, Ms Ko said it wasn't.  <br><br>She said the inaccuracy pertained to her motivation for showering Tey with gifts.<br><br>Earlier in the day, the prosecution went through the impeached parts of the statements and evidence provided by Ms Ko.<br><br>Lead
               prosecutor Andre Jumabhoy singled out differences in areas such as the 
              time that Tey had called Ms Ko and revealed to her confidential ranking 
              and grades before the release of the results.<br><br>Ms Ko had told the 
              CPIB that Tey had called at about 11am but told the court last week that
               he called a few minutes before the official release of the results.<br><br>Another area was the bill for the Garibaldi dinner, which she had paid.<br><br>With impeachment, the judge will decide at the end of the trial which parts of evidence to take into consideration.<br><br>- CNA/ck</span></span></p>

              two CYC tailored shirts and an iPod touch.<br><br>She said at no point did Tey ask for the gifts from her and that she had given them to him on her own accord.<br><br>Tey
               put it to Ms Ko that he had paid her for those gifts, as well as for 
              the dinner at Garibaldi, which had a bill dated 21 July 2010.<br><br>He said he had issued a cheque amounting to S$2,500 in July 2010 before she left for an overseas study stint. <br><br>This amount, he said, is slightly more than the value of the gifts mentioned in the first four charges. <br><br>But Ms Ko said no such cheque was given to her. <br><br>Tey then said he made out the cheque to Ms Ko but she didn't encash it.<br><br>So he paid her in cash, he said.<br><br>Lead
               prosecutor Mr Andre Jumabhoy raised doubts, pointing out that the 
              cheque was dated early July 2010 while the dinner bill was dated 21 
              July.<br><br>He said Tey is purporting to pay for a dinner even before 
              it had taken place. "It shows a remarkable ability on his part to 
              establish not only future events but the price that such events entail,"
               said Mr Jumabhoy.<br><br>The prosecutor also argued that Ms Ko's testimony that she did not receive the cheque caused "irreparable damage" to Tey's case.<br><br>Tey,
               a former district judge, faces allegations of obtaining gratification 
              in the form of gifts and sex from Ms Ko between May and July 2010, in 
              exchange for lifting her grades. <br><br>If convicted, he could be jailed up to five years and fined S$100,000.<br><br>- CNA/ck</span></span></p>
