              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Economic restructuring to raise productivity must be a
               priority if Singapore is to raise living standards and strengthen 
              competitiveness among businesses.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>That's the message 
              from Education Minister Heng Swee Keat to businessmen at a Lunar New 
              Year event at the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry 
              (SCCCI).</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The wishlist of the Chinese Chamber for the upcoming Budget is more help for businesses, especially SMEs.<br><br>President
               of SCCCI Teo Siong Seng said: "The general mood of the outlook for this
               year will be tougher than last year. One is actually the tightening of 
              manpower, but that we actually support because there's no U-turn in 
              terms of tightening of foreign labour. We're also concerned about the 
              escalating costs of doing business, and also the environment externally 
              whether Europe or US, is actually very unstable. So overall, the 
              businessmen are more cautious about the outlook for this year."<br><br>So
               raising productivity is a must and the Chamber has some suggestions - 
              enhance productivity grants under the Productivity and Innovation Credit
               scheme and make it easier for businesses to qualify for them; give 
              businesses more credit support by restoring the credit support scheme - 
              it used to be 80 per cent during the financial tsunami in 2008, and was 
              later brought down to 50 per cent; and re-look the Certificate of 
              Entitlement (COE) scheme to reduce transport costs.<br><br>Mr Teo said: 
              "COE has been going up. We actually urge the government to re-look the 
              COE scheme. We also urge the government that some of the heavy duty 
              vehicles for commercial uses, for example dump trucks - can there be a 
              special category for commercial vehicles? They can put out rules like no
               carrying of passengers, so that people don't abuse it, but we hope they
               can consider, especially for commercial use vehicles to give it a 
              special category. Because many of our members cannot afford to renew 
              their fleet and they have to bring up the cost of transportation."<br><br>Referring
               to the debate on the Population White Paper, Mr Heng reminded 
              businessmen that Singapore cannot rely on expansion of manpower to 
              develop its enterprises.<br><br>He said restructuring the economy to 
              raise productivity is a priority. He added that the government has 
              started tightening manpower growth, and he shared, but these adjustments
               will take time.<br><br>Mr Heng said: "Well, going forward the economic 
              restructuring to raise productivity is of utmost priority, and I'd like 
              to see the government, businesses and our people working closely 
              together to make this major transition.<br><br>"I believe that raising 
              productivity will be the key to our future, the key to raising wages of 
              all workers in Singapore, and to create opportunities for our young 
              people. But at the same time, we need a period of transition and we 
              should make the best use of this period of transition to make 
              significant progress."<br><br>Asked about the White Paper's impact on 
              the Our National Conversations which he spearheads, Mr Heng said he 
              would make a formal statement on this soon.<br><br>Mr Teo said the Chamber generally agreed with the projections for economic growth in the Population White Paper.<br><br>"Not
               to forget we are in the middle of Asia where it's a high-growth area. 
              So if our growth is too low, you know some people say 'why don't we 
              relax a bit more', can we slow down? I don't think we can. Because if we
               do that, foreign capital won't come, and Singapore economy will hollow 
              out," Mr Teo shared.<br><br>But he added that one concern SMEs have is that the measures to tighten foreign labour could leave them out in the cold.<br><br>He
               said: "The concern we have for the White Paper is the one to two per 
              cent foreign labour growth. Not to forget we are building so many units 
              of houses. We talk about increase in healthcare, nursing staff. We talk 
              about doubling MRT lines. So this one to two per cent, is it enough to 
              cater for this? Then what is left for the SMEs? One to two per cent may 
              look like a lot but actually we think with so many projects going on, 
              it's not going to be enough."<br><br>- CNA/al/ck</span></span></p>
