            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>Hundreds of thousands of Greeks are
              walking off their jobs at airports, schools, hospitals and even
              the Acropolis to protest Prime Minister <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/george-papandreou/">George Papandreou</a>’s 6.6
              billion-euro ($8.7 billion) austerity plan, challenging a
              government seeking European bailout funds to stave off default.</p>
              <p>Today’s 24-hour strike, the first this year that will shut
              the <a title="Open Web Site" rel="external" href="http://www.aia.gr/">Athens International Airport</a> for a full day, takes place
              after European Union ministers signaled they may renegotiate
              terms of Greece’s latest rescue, sending the nation’s stocks
              down the most in 17 months.</p>
              <p>The country’s largest public-sector union, known as <a title="Open Web Site" rel="external" href="http://www.adedy.gr/">ADEDY</a> and representing at least 400,000 state workers, called the
              walkout and a march on parliament to protest plans to put 30,000
              public workers on reduced pay, raise property taxes and cut
              pensions and wages. The demonstration defies calls by the
              government to show unity in the struggle to avert a default.</p>
              <p>“We are at the worst circumstances under the worst
              conditions,” Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos said at a
              news conference in Athens yesterday. “We are dependent on the
              aid and loans of our institutional partners. That is the
              situation of the country. And we must make superhuman efforts to
              win this wager of history.”</p>
              <h2>Rising Debt</h2>
              <p>The government is dependent on outside financing as the
              economy contracts and the unemployment rate stands at more than
              double <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/germany/">Germany</a>’s. The Greek state, which employs about 750,000,
              carries a debt load that will reach 356.5 billion euros in 2011,
              or the equivalent of 161.8 percent of gross domestic product,
              the highest in the EU and three times the ratio of <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/poland/">Poland</a>.</p>
              <p>The strike, which forced cancellation of flights into and
              out of the <a title="Open Web Site" rel="external" href="http://www.aia.gr/">Athens International Airport</a> and closed schools,
              followed a decision by euro area finance ministers to delay the
              release of the next 8 billion-euro loan installment under a 110
              billion euro bailout approved in May 2010 until after Oct. 13.
              The government has enough cash to operate until mid-November,
              Venizelos said.</p>
              <p>Greece’s 10-year bonds fell yesterday, pushing the yield up
              50 basis points, or 0.50 percentage point, to 23.1 percent, more
              than double the rate on July 21, generic pricing for euro-
              denominated government securities shows. <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/greece/">Greece</a>’s 4.59 percent
              bond due in 2016 is trading at 35.5 cents on the euro for a
              yield of 35 percent, down from a price of 64 cents on July 22.</p>
              <h2>Stocks Slump</h2>
              <p>The nation’s ASE stock index lost 6.3 percent yesterday,
              the most since May 2010, led by a 15 percent slump in <a class="web_ticker" title="Get Quote" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=ETE:GA">National
              Bank of Greece SA. (ETE)</a> European equities dropped for a third day,
              the longest-losing streak in four weeks, as EU policy makers
              signaled private investors may need to take on bigger losses
              than earlier estimated as part of Greece’s bailout.</p>
              <p>Violence during strikes in June caused 800,000 euros in
              damage to state property in <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/athens/">Athens</a> over two days as Papandreou
              battled for political survival in parliament.</p>
              <p>The 59-year-old premier then won a confidence vote and
              backing for a new five-year package of budget cuts and state
              asset sales to secure further international aid by stemming
              defections from members of his Pasok party.</p>
              <p>Venizelos introduced measures to plug the budget gap for
              2011 and 2012, including a property tax approved by parliament
              on Sept. 27 and further cuts to pensions and wages for state
              workers, after inspectors from the <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/international-monetary-fund/">International Monetary Fund</a> and EU halted a review of Greece on Sept. 1.</p>
              <p>While strikes and protests are common in Greece, the timing
              of the latest confrontation may cause investors to take notice,
              said Antonio Garcia Pascual, the chief southern European
              economist at <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/barclays-capital/">Barclays Capital</a> in <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/london/">London</a>.</p>
              <p>“It’s important to understand the degree of participation
              in these strikes,” he said in a telephone interview yesterday.
              “If it’s a massive demonstration with really large numbers,
              then surely investors will take note of that.”</p>
              <h2>Airports Shut</h2>
              <p>Air traffic controllers and employees at the <a title="Open Web Site" rel="external" href="http://www.hcaa.gr/home/index.asp">Hellenic Civil
              Aviation Authority</a> will cease work for 24 hours today, the first
              all-day work stoppage for aviation workers this year. <a class="web_ticker" title="Get Quote" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=AEGN:GA">Aegean
              Airlines SA (AEGN)</a> canceled all its flights and Olympic Air axed 89
              flights, according to an e-mailed statement from both Athens-
              based carriers. Schools, archaeological sites and museums also
              are closed.</p>
              <p>“We have workers who have had their wages cut by 40
              percent and with the new measures it will surpass 50 percent,”
              ADEDY Chairman Costas Tsikrikas said by phone from Athens.
              “These measures, and all the measures that have been passed so
              far, are putting the heaviest weight on workers and pensioners,
              not on those who earn the most and have sent their money outside
              Greece to foreign banks.”</p>
              <h2>General Strike</h2>
              <p>The <a title="Open Web Site" rel="external" href="http://www.gsee.gr/">General Confederation of Labor</a>, or GSEE, the country’s
              largest private sector union that represents workers at state-
              run companies and utilities, plan to participate in the walkout
              and called a general strike for Oct. 19.</p>
              <p>Greece’s average <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/unemployment-rate/">unemployment rate</a> is expected to climb to
              16.4 percent next year from 15.2 percent in 2011, according to
              ministry forecasts. Germany’s jobless rate was 6.9 percent in
              September. The economy contracted 4.5 percent in 2010 and will
              shrink 5.5 percent this year, <a title="Open Web Site" rel="external" href="http://www.minfin.gr/portal/en">Finance Ministry</a> forecasts show.</p>
              <p>“We have taken decisions as a government and as a
              parliament but as a society we have not taken a clear
              decision,” Venizelos said yesterday. “Unfortunately our
              society, our country, is hostage to great contradictions.”</p>
              <p>Employees at <a title="Open Web Site" rel="external" href="http://www.ose.gr/">Hellenic Railways Organization</a>, Greece’s
              state-run rail company, and the suburban rail network
              surrounding Athens will also take part. Dockworkers,
              journalists, health-care and municipal workers plan to join the
              strike.</p>
              <h2>Public Transit</h2>
              <p>Public transit employees are working today in order to help
              carry protesters to central Athens for midday demonstrations and
              marches to parliament. Transit employees have held a series of
              24-hour strikes and work stoppages since Sept. 2 to protest
              involuntary transfers and wage cuts that were part of an
              overhaul of the public transit industry adopted last year by
              Greece’s parliament.</p>
              <p><a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/europe/">Europe</a>’s financial leaders are fighting on multiple fronts,
              trying to repair Greece’s economy while insulating Italy and
              <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/spain/">Spain</a> and shoring up banks that the IMF says face as much as 300
              billion euros in credit risks.</p>
              <p>Ministers are considering reshaping a July 21 agreement
              that foresaw investors contributing 50 billion euros to a second
              rescue package totaling 159 billion euros. The original accord
              calls for debt exchanges and rollovers, with private investors
              facing losses of 21 percent, according to the International
              Institute of Finance.</p>
