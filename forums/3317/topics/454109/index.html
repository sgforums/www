              <h1>Newlyweds killed in NZ car crash</h1>
              <p><img style="vertical-align: middle;" src="http://www.straitstimes.com/STI/STIMEDIA/image/20120616/ST_20120617_NZPIX3_3166226.jpg" alt="" width="330" height="220"></p>
              <p>A Singaporean couple on their honeymoon in New Zealand were killed in a traffic accident on Friday, just eight days after they were married.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Lieutenant Mohamed Najibullah Suhaimi, 26, and Ms Raihana Mohd Rashid, 25, were believed to have died on the spot at Mangatawhiri, south of Auckland, after a two-vehicle crash, Singapore's Berita Minggu newspaper said.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>They were married in Singapore on June 7 and left for New Zealand on Monday.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Lt Mohamed Najibullah was with the Singapore Armed Forces, while Ms Raihana was a nurse at KK Women's and Children's Hospital.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>New Zealand media reports said the accident on State Highway 2 in Mangatawhiri occurred at about 1.20pm along a stretch of road known to be dangerous.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is believed to be one of the most deadly stretches in the country, with 30 deaths since 2001. The government recently reduced the speed limit at one section of the highway to 90kmh from 100kmh, said the APNZ News Service.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The car, driven by one of the Singaporeans, apparently lost control and hit a van. The two occupants of the van were unhurt.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Singapore's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it was aware of the incident. 'We extend our condolences to the families of the two Singaporeans who have died,' said a ministry spokesman.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'We are in contact with their next-of-kin in Singapore and will continue to provide all necessary assistance to them.'</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The father of Ms Raihana, who met Berita Minggu at his home in Tampines yesterday, said that the last time he spoke to his daughter was two days ago, when he was about to leave for a trip to Penang. She was the second child in a family of five.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'She asked me where I was. She asked me to take care of myself and not to forget to take my medicine, and sent her regards,' said Mr Mohd Rashid Abu Bakar, 57.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'When I arrived in Penang, I received the news that she was involved in a terrible accident. I felt very weak and was lost for words,' he said.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Mr Mohamed Najibullah was the youngest of three siblings.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>His mother, Madam Julaiha Ismail, 64, told Berita Minggu that her son called on Thursday, and sounded very happy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The couple's remains will be flown home to Singapore tomorrow, the paper said.</p>
