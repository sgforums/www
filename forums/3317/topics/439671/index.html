              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Analysts said flats sold under the Design, Build and 
              Sell Scheme (DBSS) may be losing their relevance, as the gap in the 
              housing market they previously served is now covered by Build-To-Order 
              (BTO) flats.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The income ceiling to qualify for a BTO flat was recently raised to S$10,000 - the same as DBSS flats. </span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Since the public 
              outcry over the record-breaking asking prices of a previous DBSS launch,
               Centrale 8, and the following clamp-down on land sales for such 
              projects, some analysts believe the days of DBSS projects are numbered.<br><br>But in the housing market, it's all about location and pricing.<br><br>Belvia in Bedok is the latest DBSS project to be launched.<br><br>It saw a healthy crowd, receiving more than 200 applications on its first day.<br><br>Raymond
               Chia, CEO of CEL Development, said: "Bedok Reservoir is a mature 
              estate; we feel there's a ready demand. If you look at houses around 
              here, they are mainly 20 to 30 years old. People who've grown up in the 
              area, they are familiar with the surroundings and amenities. Out of 
              convenience and to be near their parents, this can be a choice to them."<br><br>And instead of being a negative impact, Mr Chia sees the outcry over Centrale 8 as a "talking point".<br><br>Developer
               Sim Lian's Centrale 8 made the news in June when its highest asking 
              price for a DBSS flat was S$880,000 - almost as expensive as Executive 
              Condominiums, which boast amenities such as swimming pools and tennis 
              courts.<br><br>Sim Lim eventually backed down and slashed $100,000 off its priciest units.<br><br>The 488-unit Belvia project has 3-room to 5-room units, and an indicative price of $570 per square foot.<br><br>"Transport
               is quite convenient, and a new MRT is coming up. And it's near to the 
              PIE and if you want to go somewhere it's very convenient," said one 
              Singapore resident. <br><br>"I grew up in the East, and my parents are 
              just staying nearby. I think the location is tied with the price. So I 
              believe with the new MRT to be built, I think the price to pay is 
              justifiable," said another.  <br><br>Market watchers point out that DBSS projects are public housing and have to be priced accordingly.<br><br>Mohd
               Ismail, CEO of PropNex, said: "DBSS price should be at least 20 per 
              cent cheaper than executive condos, or slightly more; it could be about 
              25 per cent, that would be ideal. <br><br>"It would make very little 
              sense for someone to pay a high price where the differentiation between 
              executive condos and (DBSS flats) is not even 20 per cent. Then I think 
              you're not entering into a good deal." <br><br>Two other DBSS projects will be launched later this month in Clementi and Jurong.<br><br>- CNA /ls</span></span></p>
