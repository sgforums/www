              <p>SINGAPORE: Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has called on new Singapore citizens to play their part, as co-authors of the next chapter of the Singapore story.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He was speaking at a citizenship ceremony held at the Teck Ghee Community Club, in his Ang Mo Kio constituency Saturday morning (Oct 24), where about 200 new citizens from Ang Mo Kio and Sengkang West received their citizenship certificates.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Add your own distinct experiences, skills, abilities - contribute to the Singapore story and together, make a better future here for all of us," said Mr Lee, as he addressed the new citizens.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Mr Lee noted that while new citizens have spent time in Singapore and are sinking their roots in the country, taking up citizenship here is still a major life decision.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He also quoted the late pioneer leader S Rajaratnam who said: "Being a Singaporean is not a matter of ancestry. It is conviction and choice."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Many of you have come from different backgrounds, but each of you spent time here and decided to make this your home," said Mr Lee. "And you've decided, I hope not just because this is a comfortable place and a safe and secure place to bring up your family, but also, I hope, because you believe in Singapore, you identify yourself with what we stand for in Singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"We stand for a multi-racial society, a nation of opportunity, a fair and just society, a place where tomorrow is always be better than today."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"This is what we have been celebrating this year at SG50," said Mr Lee, who pointed out how the country's forefathers slogged so that the next generation can have better lives.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"We commit ourselves to continue to build on what they have done, to continue striving always to do better, always to take Singapore forward."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Mr Lee also called on new citizens to add their distinctive experiences to enrich Singapore's culture and society, and strengthen the economy. He asked them to work with both old and new citizens to build a better future.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He also highlighted the links between new citizens and Singapore. For example, Mr Sunder Moorthy and his wife, who came from India, are active grassroots leaders in Teck Ghee.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Mr Moorthy came to Singapore in 1992 for work. He was joined by his wife in 1997. Their now 16-year-old son was born in Singapore. Mrs Moorthy has been volunteering in the Residents' Committee for eight years.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"We did not have any difficulty right from the beginning because she had been in the RC and I had been involved in activities along with her and that way, we felt we always had a lot of friends, new friends, and most importantly we got to know a lot about good food, different varieties of food and people," said Mr Moorthy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"I came to know about many events that are organised by the different community," added his wife. "Like Chinese New Year events, Hari Raya Haji events and then Deepavali and then we come to know about different cultures when we go there and participate with the other community members."</p>
