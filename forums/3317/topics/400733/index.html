              <p>The parents of this boy reported that their son, currently in Primary 4,
               was assaulted in school by older boys from Primary 6. The school's 
              principal had apparently asked the parents not to lodge a police report.<br><br>They
               were later shocked to discover that the school has a history of gangs 
              and extortion cases.<br><br>In the parents' email:<br><br>"My son was 
              assaulted in school at 12.30pm May 27 by the more senior Primary 6 boys.
               This happened in the school compound during school hours. The punch 
              resulted in severe bruising on his cheek and his spectacles to be 
              damaged. <br><br>"What lead to the assault may be contributory but the 
              initiation and brutally of the assaulted is not expected out of students
               in primary schools.<br><br>"Whilst in school trying to understand the 
              sequence of events from the school principal, we are shocked by her 
              intention to keep it under wraps by dissuading us from lodging a police 
              report. <br><br>"She was nonchalant of our request to treat this as a 
              serious assault case. My wife was ridiculed by the principal when she 
              insisted that she wanted to lodge a police report, as we did not get 
              assurance from her that she will deal with this case professionally and 
              forcefully.<br><br>"Our further research into the recent school 
              developments frightens us. We were informed that the boy who had 
              assaulted my son had gone through 2 public canings. There were also 
              cases of gangs and extortion in the school. <br><br>"I feel that if the 
              principal is incapable of handling this increased violence in her 
              primary school, then the appropriate authorities need to be called in 
              rather than trying to put her career above the welfare and safety of 
              students she is dutifully entrusted in care.</p>
