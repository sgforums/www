              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>BANGKOK: The Thai 
              government has launched a new programme to help its rice farmers. But 
              with Thailand being a world leading exporter of rice, critics said the 
              move could hurt the country's position.<br><br>For over 30 years, Thailand has been the world's biggest exporter of rice. <br><br>This
               year alone, the country is expected to produce over 20 million tons of 
              it, despite rising competition from its regional rivals. <br><br>But that could change soon.<br><br>One
               of the key policies of newly-elected Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra
               is a rice pricing scheme, under which the government buys rice from the
               farmers at a price of 15,000 baht (US$480) - 50 per cent more than the 
              regular market price. <br><br>What is primarily aimed to help Thailand's
               eight million rice farmers could have broader implications on the 
              domestic and international markets.<br><br>It was one of the factors that helped the Puea Thai Party win the elections last July, thanks to its rural supporter base. <br><br>But according to critics, not all farmers will equally profit from this scheme.<br><br>Dr
               Nipon Poapongsakorn, president of the Thailand Development and Research
               Institute said: "Those farmers who have rice to sell to the government 
              benefit. But farmers and consumers, particularly farmers who do not have
               rice to sell, do not benefit at all."<br><br>Dr Poapongsakorn explained
               that farmers who do not produce rice for their own consumption will 
              have to buy the staple at a higher price.<br><br>Thailand's Commerce 
              Ministry has tried to calm fears of spiralling costs for both the market
               and the taxpayer, saying the pricing scheme will cost much less than 
              the estimated US$12.8 billion. <br><br>But opponents see too many fault lines and much prefer the price guarantee scheme of the previous Democrat-led government.<br><br>Niphond
               Wongtra-ngan, former president of the Thai Rice Millers Association 
              said: "Under the price guarantee programme (of the Democrat-led 
              government), money went to the farmers faster. The guaranteed price was 
              10,000 baht per ton. Should farmers sell rice at 6,000 to 7,000 baht, 
              they will get compensated."<br><br>Furthermore, private rice exporters 
              accuse the government of monopolising the rice trade, as collusion among
               a few exporters close to the administration and price fixing could 
              occur.<br><br>Internationally, the pricing scheme will also cause ripple effects on the market.<br><br>Dr
               Poapongsakorn said: "I expect that the world price of rice will 
              increase, because we are one of the major exporters... But who benefits?
               Our competitors - not Thailand!"<br><br>After all, the consumer could be the one who ultimately pays the bill, as the price of rice is set to increase. <br><br>As for the farmers, it has yet to be seen if they will really benefit from the new pricing scheme.</span></span></p>
