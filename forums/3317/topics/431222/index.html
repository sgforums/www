              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Investments in Singapore's water industry have 
              doubled in size in the last five years - up from S$660 million in GDP 
              value-add in 2005.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>And the government is confident it can meet its target of S$1.7 billion in annual GDP value-add by 2015.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Over the years, 
              Singapore has turned what used to be a scarcity into its strength and 
              now the water industry is seen as a growth area for the country.<br><br>In
               2006, the target was to grow the sector such that it will contribute 
              S$1.7 billion in annual GDP value by 2015, and to create 11,000 jobs.<br><br>Representatives
               from the Environment &amp; Water Industry Programme Office (EWI) on 
              Thursday expressed confidence that the target would be met.<br><br>The EWI is an inter-agency office, led by national water agency PUB, the Economic Development Board and IE Singapore. <br><br>They
               gave figures showing that investments by water companies in the last 
              five years, when fully realised, will add about S$590 million in value 
              add to the economy, as well as create about 2,300 professional and 
              skilled jobs.<br><br>Singapore is now home to about 70 local and international water companies.<br><br>At the same time, Singapore companies have also secured overseas projects worth a total of S$8.4 billion.<br><br>Key
               markets include the Middle East and China. For instance, the technology
               used to recycle water - similar to the technology behind Newater - is 
              being applied to a plant in the Bundamba Advanced Water Treatment Plant 
              in Queensland, Australia.<br><br>The EDB said that Singapore's strength lies primarily in research and development as well as providing support for companies.<br><br>Yeoh
               Keat Chuan, Assistant MD of the EDB, said: "The early part of the 
              effort was focussed on rolling out a number of initiatives relating to 
              R&amp;D. That typically takes a longer gestation period.<br><br>"We are 
              at the point now where we're hoping to see some of those results, where 
              technologies get rolled out into the marketplace after being test-bedded
               in Singapore, and that will generate higher value-added projects."<br><br>One
               key activity is the test bedding of new technologies, which Singapore 
              has made easier due to the infrastructure, accessibility and the 
              willingness to take on these often capital-intensive projects.<br><br>Singapore's willingness to take on capital-intensive test-bedding projects, is also a draw for foreign companies.<br><br>PUB
               said since 2006, there have been 107 test-bedding projects conducted 
              here in collaboration with PUB and private R&amp;D firms and 
              institutions.<br><br>Ng Han Tong, Director of Industry Development at 
              the PUB, said: "In their own country, they find difficulties finding 
              test-bedding sites for their technologies to be tested. That's one 
              reason.<br><br>"Secondly, if they need to do test-bedding, they have to 
              travel very far. But Singapore is so compact, so concentrated, they are 
              always in close proximity to their test-bedding."<br><br>Over the next few years, government agencies plan to continue Singapore's focus on research and development.<br><br>They are also looking to expand their presence in markets like China and emerging ones such as India and Indonesia.<br><br>One strategy would be to serve as matchmakers between water tech companies and financing companies.<br><br>Goh
               Chee Kiong, Director of the Cleantech Division at the EDB, said: "They 
              tend to be capital-intensive. And very often, financing is the 
              bottle-neck. Because if they can't raise the financing, even at the 
              governmental level, they'll find it difficult to implement their plans 
              for their populations.<br><br>"That will be what we hope could be the value that Singapore can provide to companies and countries in the region."<br><br>- CNA/ir/ac</span></span></p>
