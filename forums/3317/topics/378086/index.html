              <p>SINGAPORE: They have been hauled to court
              many times for staging protests and other activities in public, with a
              guilty verdict the regular outcome.</p>
              <p>On Tuesday, however, a
              group of Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) leaders and activists were
              acquitted of holding a procession without a permit.</p>
              <p>On Sept
              16, 2007, five of them had marched from Speakers’ Corner to Queenstown
              Remand Prison to mark the first anniversary of a protest led by SDP
              secretary—general Chee Soon Juan at the World Bank—International
              Monetary Fund meetings in 2006.</p>
              <p>The group, comprising SDP
              chairman Gandhi Ambalam, assistant secretary—general John Tan, central
              executive committee member Chee Siok Chin, SDP supporter Yap Keng Ho
              and human rights activist Chong Kai Xiong, also wore white T—shirts
              with the words "Democracy Now" and "Freedom Now".</p>
              <p>In his
              written judgment, District Judge John Ng noted that the group had
              walked mainly on pedestrian pathways and did not attract "any
              significant" attention of the public.</p>
              <p>They also did not carry
              any of the usual equipment associated with a protest, such as placards
              or banners, and the walk did not disrupt pedestrian flow.</p>
              <p>The
              judge said: "It was a group of people walking purposefully in a public
              place from one point to another, but on this occasion, it never
              amounted to a procession."</p>
              <p>He added that there has to be a
              distinction drawn between "walking in a group from one point to
              another, even if it was to commemorate an event, and being part of a
              procession".</p>
              <p>When contacted, Institute of Policy Studies
              senior research fellow Gillian Koh told MediaCorp: "The judgment
              suggests at face value that there are political activities that seem to
              be acceptable which we never thought would be allowed."</p>
              <p>She
              said that political activists should look at the previous cases and the
              specifics of the judgment, and "they would want to be cautious in
              staging political activities in order to avoid running afoul of various
              laws".</p>
              <p>The five SDP leaders and activists had been charged for
              participating in a procession without a valid permit. Each of them
              could have been fined up to S$1,000 if convicted.</p>

              <p>are you one of the stupid people who think that because i do not like someone means i must love their enemy?</p>
              <p>sheesh...</p>
              <p>grow up!</p>
              <p>this time, the judge did the right thing.. KNN, if not, people in a group walk around can get arrested for "participating in a procession"</p>
              <p>like that, if i walk, and lots of people follow me without me asking them to follow, i can get arrested..</p>
              <p>like that, the bloody DJs in Crass 95 also should be arrested for walking from Jurong Point to Parkway Parade..</p>
              <p>they may be idiots who support the SDP, that's their right and their burden to bear... but their walking doesn't violate any laws.. and rightly so...</p>
              <p>learn to differentiate things... it'll do your very little credibility a world of good</p>
