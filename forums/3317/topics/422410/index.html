              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: More people are approaching licensed moneylenders since the opening of Singapore's two casinos about a year ago.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Moneylenders' 
              Association of Singapore president David Poh said the association has 
              seen about a 40 per cent jump in the number of loans offered.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Figures from the Law
               Ministry's Insolvency &amp; Public Trustee's Office showed an eight per
               cent increase in the number of licensed moneylenders in 2010 compared 
              to the year before.<br><br>There were 239 licensed moneylenders as at end December 2010, compared to 221 in 2009. <br><br>The
               number of such companies joining the the industry's association has 
              also gone up three times in a span of just one year, from 50 in 2009 to 
              160 in 2011. <br><br>But dealing with problem gamblers is a somewhat 
              risky business for these agencies, especially when borrowers struggle to
               pay off interest rates which can amount to 18 per cent per annum. <br><br>Mr Poh said it is often more difficult to collect debts from gamblers, as they tend to gamble away the borrowed money.<br><br>Debt recovery companies Channel NewsAsia spoke with said they are also getting busier.<br><br>A
               co-owner of Tri-Credits said while it was good that his company is 
              seeing an increase in takings from offering loans, it is often difficult
               to recover the debts.   <br><br>"Everybody is giving excuses such as, 
              they lost money in the (casinos) and they can't afford to repay such a 
              big amount," he said.<br><br>To address this problem, the Moneylenders' 
              Association has put up a database of people deemed as risky borrowers, 
              on its website.<br><br>Mr Poh said with this system, people can pay a 
              service charge and ban their family members from borrowing money, 
              through the website. <br><br>He added that 20 to 30 spouses have been banned since last year and that the numbers are increasing.<br><br>The number of mediation cases the association handles is also on the rise, with about three to five cases daily. <br><br>Moneylending companies said they are also seeing younger borrowers, those in their 20s, struggling to pay off debts.<br><br>Mr Poh said these younger borrowers tend to be working adults. <br><br>The
               law states that for loans not exceeding S$3,000 given with security -- 
              or "secured loans" -- where the borrower's annual income is less than 
              S$20,000, the maximum rate of interest that a moneylender can charge is 
              12 per cent per annum. <br><br>For loans not exceeding S$3,000 given 
              without security -- or "unsecured loans" -- where the borrower's annual 
              income is less than S$20,000, the maximum rate of interest that a 
              moneylender can charge is 18 per cent per annum.<br><br>For loans above S$3,000, the rate of interest will be agreed upon between the moneylender and the borrower.<br><br>-CNA/wk</span></span></p>
