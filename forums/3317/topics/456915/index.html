              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE - With as much as S$10 billion in public contracts 
              awarded each year, a question has been cropping up often of late: Is the
               process as robust and as fair as it can be?</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Such increased 
              scrutiny of the Government's procurement process has been stirred most 
              recently by the National Parks Board's (NPark) purchase of 26 foldable 
              Brompton bicycles via online tender. But concerns have also been 
              fleetingly raised in other scandals, involving fraud and 
              sex-for-contracts over the last two years.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>While they feel the 
              current policies are generally sound, civil servants, businesses and 
              academics pointed out to TODAY some areas that need tweaks.<br><br>NET NOT CAST WIDE ENOUGH?<br><br>All
               government ministries, statutory boards and public agencies here make 
              the majority of their purchases of goods and services through the 
              Government Electronic Business (GeBIZ) online portal.<br><br>Only the 
              roughly 55,000 businesses which have registered as trading partners can 
              view the details of and bid for business opportunities put up by the 144
               government bodies.<br><br>Is the Government casting its net wide enough
               to get value-for-money deals? One civil servant pointed out: "There 
              might be some out there who are not registered as trading partners, but 
              may be able to offer a better deal."<br><br>But corporate governance experts said GeBIZ, as a mode of inviting bids, is "the most transparent, open and efficient".<br><br>National
               University of Singapore (NUS) accounting don Ho Yew Kee said returning 
              to the days of publicising tender notices through newspaper ads - buying
               ads in all newspapers for several days - is not only costly but also 
              leads to the same "no-win conclusions" on companies' grouses that 
              trawling through GeBIZ daily is a tedious process.<br><br>"How many days
               of ads would be considered as sufficient and fair?" he asked. 
              "Traditionally, it's the hunter that looks for the prey; it should be 
              the same in business - the seller has to look for the buyer."<br><br>Still,
               should not concessions be made when it comes to contracts for goods 
              that are "not typical" - items that public agencies rarely or have never
               before sourced for?<br><br>It would be reasonable, one point of view 
              goes, for the agency to directly alert potential suppliers via email, 
              letter or phone call. In the NParks case, other suppliers of Brompton 
              bikes here said they were not informed of the call for tenders.<br><br>MORE INCENTIVE TO SIGN UP<br><br>On
               why he believes the GeBIZ registration system works nonetheless, 
              Associate Professor Mak Yuen Teen from NUS said the prerequisites - such
               as a company's assets and revenue - weed out "just any Tom, Dick or 
              Harry from bidding for jobs".<br><br>"You have to think of the rules 
              involved, such as whether a supplier is capable of delivering or how 
              reliable he is, because we are talking about public money," he said.<br><br>Still,
               GeBIZ could be made more intuitive and user-friendly to attract more 
              bona fide suppliers. "Having more players completes the market because, 
              then, no one seller can easily capture the market," said Assoc Prof Ho.<br><br>He
               suggested making the registration process less tedious and lowering the
               S$320 yearly fee a company has to pay for each additional account it 
              wants to sign up. The email-alert service for relevant business 
              opportunities, which companies can opt in for, can also be improved, 
              added Assoc Prof Mak, as some have bemoaned the filter's adequacy.<br><br>SKEWING THE PROCESS BEFORE IT STARTS?<br><br>Preventing
               personal or working relationships from tainting procurement procedures 
              is perhaps the most basic safeguard needed in any model.<br><br>But 
              companies that have bid for public contracts point out that when 
              government bodies "don't even know what exactly they want" - a product 
              or system new to the market, or a complex and lengthy project they 
              haven't handled before - potential vendors are gathered for "closed-door
               request-for-proposal" sessions to formulate the specifications.<br><br>Such
               "market-testing" could lead to the Government not getting the most bang
               for its buck, as one company remarks: "Why would I want to put my best 
              ideas out there when there's no guarantee that I would get the 
              contract?"<br><br>Or, it could skew the tender process. A company can 
              "feed its unique selling points" to the public agency, such that the 
              tender specifications eventually put out are so close to what that 
              company can offer, that this "makes its chances of winning higher", said
               another senior executive who has won consulting contracts with some 
              public agencies.<br><br>(In the NParks case, for instance, eyebrows were
               raised when the tender specifications for the foldable bikes were so 
              specific as to limit the available choices. The NParks officer in charge
               of the purchase and the winner of the S$57,200 deal - the only bidder -
               are also friends on Facebook. A probe is under way.)<br><br>A civil 
              servant acknowledged that "informal negotiations" are carried out with 
              "regular vendors" on some occasions, even before a contract is put up 
              for bids.<br><br>CHECK AND BALANCE <br><br>Assoc Prof Mak noted that 
              "safeguards should come in before the tender is called". For example, 
              detailed evaluation criteria - the weightage given to price, quality, 
              efficiency, for instance - should be set for each potential purchase in 
              advance, he suggested.<br><br>Those preparing tender specifications 
              should be different from those reviewing them before posting on GeBIZ, 
              so as to prevent collusion, said a civil servant.<br><br>Perhaps 
              external consultants who cannot bid for the contract should be roped in 
              to help the public agency craft tender specifications for products it 
              has limited knowledge about, suggested Assoc Prof Ho.<br><br>However, an
               obsession with criteria can verge on the absurd. One civil servant 
              recounted having to purchase durians for a function, under rules 
              requiring that tender specifications be detailed and measurable: "How do
               you define or measure how sweet the durians are, or how big they have 
              to be?"<br><br>SHOULD MINIMUM BAR BE SET?<br><br>Although the 
              Government's procurement rules do not mandate a minimum number of quotes
               before a contract can be awarded, Assoc Prof Mak said this should not 
              be a "hard and fast" practice.<br><br>Agreeing, Assoc Prof Ho said: "If 
              there's only one bid, one must ask if it's so specialised that very few 
              vendors can take part; whether the deadline is so short that vendors do 
              not have enough time to put in a bid; and whether other vendors were 
              contacted."<br><br>A civil servant noted that the current rules can make
               some procurement officers "lazy". If there is just one bid, and the 
              officer wants to cancel that tender and call for a fresh round, "he has 
              to put up several papers to justify it, to ensure there is no abuse of 
              the system".<br><br>If he does not cancel the tender, however, he is 
              only required to prove that the single bid "is indeed a fair price" - 
              but what is fair "is debatable", she said.<br><br>Some, including a 
              TODAY letter writer, have suggested that for contracts above a certain 
              amount, the grounds for award should be published. But Assoc Prof Ho 
              pointed out: "I can say anything I want, for example, that his quality 
              is better than the rest."<br><br>Also, those who lose the contract may not want commercially sensitive details of their bid to be published.<br><br>BOX-TICKING EXERCISE<br><br>Finally,
               some required service or product may be so very specialised, that 
              forcing the purchase to go through GeBiz would just be "going through 
              the motions", said Assoc Prof Mak. <br><br>When the subject is one with - for example - national security sensitivities, a public tender would also present a conundrum.<br><br>In
               cases where there is "strong justification", it may be "better to go 
              through a separate 'paper-based' process with the requisite checks and 
              balances", Assoc Prof Mak said. "If everything has to go through GeBiz 
              even though it does not make sense, it can become a box-ticking 
              exercise. Worse, people will play games around it." - </span><span class="path">TODAY</span></span></p>
