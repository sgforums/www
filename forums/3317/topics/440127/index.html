              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: The recent case where two Singaporean women were 
              detained and made to do nude squats at a Johor detention centre for 
              alleged immigration offences would have to be resolved in accordance 
              with Malaysian laws and rules, said Law and Foreign Affairs Minister K 
              Shanmugam.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>He was replying to a question in Parliament on Friday about the June incident.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Mr Shanmugam said he
               understands and shares the concerns Singaporeans have over the 
              treatment of the two women who were detained temporarily at the Pekan 
              Nanas Detention Depot.<br><br>He added that he is confident the incident would not affect the overall bilateral ties between Singapore and Malaysia.<br><br>Giving
               a detailed account of what Singapore has done so far on the case, Mr 
              Shanmugam said Singapore raised concerns officially with the Malaysian 
              Ministry of Foreign Affairs on a number of occasions.<br><br>He said the
               Malaysians have assured Singapore that they will investigate the 
              allegations and convey the outcome to Singapore as soon as it is ready.<br><br>In
               its last correspondence with Singapore on September 9, the Malaysian 
              High Commission in Singapore had informed Singapore that a thorough 
              investigation of the case had been completed.<br><br>However, the report is being finalised by the Malaysian Attorney General's Chambers.<br><br>Mr
               Shanmugam said: "We are all aware of recent media reports that the 
              Malaysian Minister for Home Affairs has made a statement on this case to
               the Malaysian Parliament. <br><br>"He was reported to have said that 
              based on the probe, the female Malaysian immigration officer had carried
               out the body search on the two Singaporean women in an orderly manner 
              and the inspection was according to that stated under the Detention 
              Depot's Standard Operating Procedure. <br><br>"We have sought a 
              clarification from both the Malaysian High Commissioner in Singapore and
               the Malaysian Ministry of Foreign Affairs about the statement because 
              as far as we are aware, the investigations have not yet been concluded. <br><br>"The
               Malaysian High Commissioner informed us that it did not have any 
              further information on the Malaysian Minister of Home Affairs' statement
               in the Malaysian Parliament and that his ministry will be seeking an 
              update from the Malaysian Attorney General's Chambers on the status of 
              the investigation."<br><br>Mr Shanmugam said the Malaysian High 
              Commission here has said it will provide Singapore with the official 
              report of the investigation as soon as it is finalised.<br><br>He said: 
              "I know that many Singaporeans are anxious for an expeditious resolution
               to this case. So are we. We have registered our concerns with our 
              Malaysian counterparts and reminded them of their commitment to conduct a
               thorough investigation and update us on the outcome of those 
              investigations.<br><br>"We will continue to press for the official 
              investigation report but even as we do this, it is important to bear in 
              mind that this matter would have to be resolved in accordance with 
              Malaysian laws, rules and regulations."<br><br>Mr Shanmugam also said 
              the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority does not keep track of 
              incidents where Singaporeans' passports are not stamped at the Johor 
              Bahru immigration, unless reported. <br><br>The minister also took the 
              opportunity to remind Singaporeans travelling to Malaysia, in particular
               those travelling by road to Johor, to always check and ensure their 
              passports are stamped at the entry and exit by the Malaysian 
              authorities.<br><br>- CNA/al</span></span></p>
