              <p>my friend, you don't know the truth...............i'll just talk about Thaksin and Southeast Asia since it has more relevance for us.</p>
              <p>when Thaksin fled from Thailand, where did he go ? England...........the same destination as those Russian Jewish oligarchs that fled Russia after Putin went after them. i won't backtrack too much about how Yeltsin and Gorbachev played out that charade that was the Soviet collapse.............</p>
              <p>like these Russian jews, Thaksin became extremely rich but wasn't he just a police officer to begin with ? and he was only in his 40's when he was PM of Thailand................his meteoric rise was bankrolled by someone else..........</p>
              <p>later when Thaksin sold his stake in Shin Corp or whatever, he sold it to Temasek becoz we are still a Crown colony. he knew his end was coming when he was ordered to sell out to Temasek and off to England he went..............</p>
              <p>now he's in Cambodia, another country ruled by a puppet of the jews.........Hun Sen. this bastard seized full power after the Prince Sihanouk went abroad and yet Hun Sen was never blasted in the press or forced to relinquish absolute power by the UK or US and yet these 2 always make noise about Myanmar, etc...........</p>
              <p>M'sia also has 1 jewish puppet in Anwar, i knew he was in deep trouble right after Mahathir pegged the ringgit to the USD before Anwar went into prison.................it was in the papers months ago that Anwar is a close friend of a very powerful US jew, Brzezinsky (spelling may be wrong)............this guy is known as ''handlers'' of previous US presidents.............meaning US puppet-presidents are told what to do by this Brzezinsky who is just a middle-level manager............</p>
              <p>so think about it.............a Muslim Malay in M'sia..........not a Muslim Arab, mind you......................a Malay from M'sia being a close pal with a very powerful Jew in US......................something is up..............</p>

              us.</p>
              <p>when Thaksin fled from Thailand, where did he go ?
              England...........the same destination as those Russian Jewish
              oligarchs that fled Russia after Putin went after them. i won't
              backtrack too much about how Yeltsin and Gorbachev played out that
              charade that was the Soviet collapse.............</p>
              <p>like these Russian jews, Thaksin became extremely rich but
              wasn't he just a police officer to begin with ? and he was only in
              his 40's when he was PM of Thailand................his meteoric
              rise was bankrolled by someone else..........</p>
              <p>later when Thaksin sold his stake in Shin Corp or whatever, he
              sold it to Temasek becoz we are still a Crown colony. he knew his
              end was coming when he was ordered to sell out to Temasek and off
              to England he went..............</p>
              <p>now he's in Cambodia, another country ruled by a puppet of the
              jews.........Hun Sen. this bastard seized full power after the
              Prince Sihanouk went abroad and yet Hun Sen was never blasted in
              the press or forced to relinquish absolute power by the UK or US
              and yet these 2 always make noise about Myanmar, etc...........</p>
              <p>M'sia also has 1 jewish puppet in Anwar, i knew he was in deep
              trouble right after Mahathir pegged the ringgit to the USD before
              Anwar went into prison.................it was in the papers months
              ago that Anwar is a close friend of a very powerful US jew,
              Brzezinsky (spelling may be wrong)............this guy is known as
              ''handlers'' of previous US presidents.............meaning US
              puppet-presidents are told what to do by this Brzezinsky who is
              just a middle-level manager............</p>
              <p>so think about it.............a Muslim Malay in
              M'sia..........not a Muslim Arab, mind you......................a
              Malay from M'sia being a close pal with a very powerful Jew in
              US......................something is up..............</p>
