              <p><strong>Geithner: U.S. hits debt limit, special measures put in place </strong></p>
              <p>The federal government hits the $14.3 trillion debt ceiling today, the Obama administration announced, requiring extraordinary measures that can stave off a default for a few more months.</p>
              <p>In a letter to Congress, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner told Congress he will halt investments in two big government pension plans Monday.</p>
              <p>Geithner has said that various accounting maneuvers can delay a government default until Aug. 2.</p>
              <p>The announcement comes as <a style="text-decoration: none; color: #00529b;" href="http://content.usatoday.com/communities/theoval/post/2011/05/obama-failure-to-raise-debt-ceiling-could-unravel-financial-system/1">President Obama and aides</a>warned that messing around with the debt limit could threaten economic recovery.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">"If investors around the world thought that the full faith and credit of the United States was not being backed up -- if they thought that we might renege on our IOUs -- it could unravel the entire financial system," Obama told CBS News last week.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p>White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters today's milestone on passing the debt limit is "a reminder that we need to have a vote to lift the debt ceiling because the consequences of not doing so would be quite serious indeed. Those who suggest otherwise are whistling past the graveyard."</p>
              <p>Congressional Republicans say they will support an increase in the debt ceiling only if the Obama administration proposes major budget cuts.</p>
              <p>"Everything should be on the table except raising taxes, because raising taxes will hurt our economy and hurt our ability to create jobs in our country," said House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, appearing on CBS' <em style="font-style: italic; font-weight: normal;">Face The Nation</em>.</p>

              <p>This Obama is a real idiot. In order to finance his medicare, he spend 14 trillion. Everybody blames Bush for subprime but this joker will be known as the idiotic president to plunge the world into Great Depression. USA fundamentals are so shaky that the speculators will have a good time spooking the US markets. The whole world is so badly tied to USA. China, Japan, RUssia, Singapore, Malaysia - everybody bought US bonds. Moody and Standards downgrade US debt, then interest rates start to skyrocket, thats when USA starts to default. China will be in trouble, it will drag Australia and S.E.A and Japan with it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>USA overspends. Just look at them - they have 12 mega aircraft carriers. Each one cost $20billion. Do they need 12 mega aircraft carriers? NASA eats up $100billion a year. Wars in Iraq and Afganistan eats up $200billion a year. USA waste aid money to Pakistan - like $10 billion a year when the country is still sponsoring terrorism. USA waste another $8billion a year to Colombia to eradicate drug smuggling when they can solve it in their own homeland by instituting mandatory death sentence for drug smugglers and save lots of money.</p>

              <p>Not sure how much we have but US bonds are attractive because of the high interest rate they offer: up to 4% per annum if over 30 years. And no one believes that the US will ever default. Many think it's just not possible because of the severe repercussions over the entire world.

              <p>Does it really work that way? lol....There's been a surge of consumption demand by China in recent years and heavy foreign investment which contributes to their own inflation. And it's not so much of US printing money to devalue their currency, they have no choice. Their economy, investments, technology and labour takes so much USD to sustain, not to mention maintenance of military all over the world.</p>

If the supply of a country's currency increases, we should see that it takes more of that currency to purchase a different currency than it did before. <strong>Suppose there was a big jump in the supply of the Canadian dollar. We would expect to see the Canadian dollar become less valuable relative to other currencies.</strong> So the Canadian-to-U.S. Exchange rate should decrease, from 67 cents down to, say, 50 cents. Each Canadian dollar would give us less American dollars than it did before. Similarly, the U.S.-to-Canadian exchange rate would increase from $1.49 to $2.00, so each U.S. dollar would give us more Canadian dollars than it did before, as a Canadian dollar is less valuable than it used to be.</span></p>

We argue that China’s current account surpluses and foreign direct investment inflows, and occasionally large non-FDI capital inflows, combined with the objective of limiting exchange rate appreciation, have the potential to compromise China’s monetary policy goal of limiting inflation.</span></p>
