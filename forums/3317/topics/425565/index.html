               added the present state of affairs in Singapore is "still a work in 
              progress", especially with the overall global terror threat to the 
              country "not significantly less" from five or 10 years ago.<br><br>Mr Lee said the nature of the terrorist problem has morphed and terrorists are innovating their methods.<br><br>So governments too have to upgrade.<br><br>He cited self-radicalisation as an example of a new challenge Singapore has to deal with.<br><br>-CNA/wk</span></span></p>

              <p>You got to face the hard truths.</p>
              <p>You and your father are peranakans.</p>
              <p>Majority of Singaporeans are not peranakans.</p>
              <p>That is why as long as nation building is in yours or your father's hands, it can never succeed.</p>
              <p>These are the hard truths.</p>
              <p>You imposed all the alien, westernised systems onto the local people and try to suppress their local culture.</p>

              <p>Cant help but to voice out this.</p>
              <p>Why sporean have common identity?</p>
              <p>Simple, as you can see now, sporean are working to make sure their family have 3 meals to eat per day. Make sure children has pocket money to go to school. Make sure pub, telephone bills pay up on time. Make sure saving account got money to deduct via giro for certain bills such as housing loans.</p>
              <p>As such, sporean saving is fully stretched and save not much per month. They will not have the luxury to dine out, shopping, holidays.</p>
              <p>Then what? They started to join brisk walk excerises, this and that organised by the pap which is foc. Everybody come together in another words.</p>
              <p>Is that call common identity?</p>
