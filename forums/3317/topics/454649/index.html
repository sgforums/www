              Former SPH senior staff charged with corruption, CBT
              
              SINGAPORE: A former senior management of Singapore Press Holdings was charged on Tuesday with a total of 10 counts of corruption and criminal breach of trust.
              
              Peter Khoo Chong Meng, 49, was the senior vice president of the English and Malay News Division.
              
              Khoo allegedly obtained gratifications amounting to $83,500 from Liaw Kim Chew in exchange for furthering Liaw's business.
              
              It is believed that Khoo received between $5,000 and $30,000 from Liaw on eight occasions from 2006 to 2010.
              
              In return, Khoo allegedly awarded Liaw with business deals from SPH's Editorial Project Unit, which Khoo was in charge of.
              
              Khoo also allegedly took shopping vouchers worth more than $22,000 between 2007 and 2010.
              
              As part of his duties, Khoo headed the committee which held events to raise funds for The Straits Times School Pocket Money Fund.
              
              He was dismissed from SPH in September 2010.
              
              Khoo declined to speak to the media. He is out on an extended bail of $115,000. He will be back in court on 10 July.
              
              If he pleads guilty, the prosecution will proceed with two charges of corruption and one charge of criminal breach of trust.

               The Straits Times School Pocket Money Fund.<br><br>Turning up in court on Friday with his family and supporters, Khoo kept his eyes closed when his plea was taken.<br><br>Khoo, who is married with a 7-year-old son, also declined to speak the media later.  <br><br>This
               is his second appearance in court after he was charged in June with a 
              total of 10 counts of corruption and criminal breach of trust.<br><br>Court documents revealed that he misappropriated shopping vouchers worth S$11,548 between May 2007 and July 2010.<br><br>The
               vouchers, which were sponsored or purchased by SPH, were to be given to
               readers for news tip-offs, but Khoo used them to purchase items for his
               own use, including a 50-inch plasma TV, a refrigerator and air tickets.
               <br><br>Khoo also obtained gratifications amounting to S$83,500 from a 
              supplier, Liaw Kim Chew in exchange for furthering Liaw's business.<br><br>Between
               November 2007 and September 2010, Khoo received bribes between S$5,000 
              and S$30,000 from Liaw, a managing director for Sino British Industries,
               Retro Development and Rifo Global.<br><br>Liaw asked about contracts 
              with SPH, and Khoo told Liaw that he could bid for some jobs with SPH as
               the media company regularly ordered items such as T-shirts and 
              stationery for its promotional events.<br><br>On one occasion, Khoo 
              received S$30,000 in cash from Liaw as a reward for helping Liaw secure a
               SPH contract, worth S$198,000, for the sale and purchase of 100,000 
              "coin-banks."<br><br>Khoo was dismissed from SPH in September 2010.<br><br>In
               a 29-page written mitigation plea, he was said to have been "very 
              troubled  and depressed" by the offenses before he voluntarily confessed
               to the authorities, including his employers at the Straits Times.<br><br>Khoo's
               lawyer, Mr Alfonso Ang, noted this in his plea, saying that his client 
              was "genuine and remorseful" and "handed on a platter the case against 
              himself to SPH and the authorities."<br><br>It was also stated in the 
              plea that Khoo had since made full restitution to SPH for both the value
               of the vouchers and the monies he had corruptly received from Liaw. <br><br>Khoo will be sentenced on November 16.<br><br>- CNA/wm</span></span></p>
