              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: In his Lunar New Year Message, Prime Minister Lee 
              Hsien Loong says the best way to strengthen the Singaporean core is to 
              encourage more Singa­poreans to marry, and have more children.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>He says this remains the government's top priority.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The Year of the 
              Dragon has been rounded up with the Parliamentary Debate on the 
              Population White Paper and Mr Lee said it was a difficult but valuable 
              debate.<br><br>He hoped it has helped Singaporeans better appreciate the country's demographic challenges and choices. <br><br>"MPs
               aired Singaporeans' concerns over our population trends, and discussed 
              our choices. We now have a roadmap to safeguard Singaporeans' well-being
               and livelihoods, which will be reviewed nearer 2020. The government 
              will also give priority to resolving the current strains on 
              infrastructure, particularly in transport," he said.<br><br>Mr Lee said 
              families are the basic building blocks of Singapore society as they 
              shape the identity and sense of self, transmit values and anchor the 
              people in a rapidly changing world. <br><br>He said Lunar New Year is an
               important occasion to celebrate with families. It is a time to thank 
              the elders for their sacrifices bringing children up and when parents 
              shower love on their own children, and teach them to respect their 
              elders and stay together as one family.<br><br>Mr Lee said Singaporeans should do their best to keep such traditions alive, especially as social norms change.<br><br>He also stressed that the government will continue promoting strong and healthy families. <br><br>He said the Marriage &amp; Parenthood package this year was a big step forward. <br><br>The
               government enhanced the Baby Bonus, gave first-timer parents priority 
              in booking BTO flats (Parenthood Priority Scheme), and gave each newborn
               a Medisave grant. <br><br>These hongbaos will help parents cope with the practical issues of raising children. <br><br>But
               more important than financial incentives, he said, is fostering a 
              pro-family social environment, and reaffirming Singaporeans' mindsets 
              towards having children. <br><br>"That is why we also introduced 
              paternity leave and shared parental leave, and strengthened maternity 
              protection for pregnant employees. I hope Singaporeans take advantage of
               these measures and have more babies. I also hope that over time, young 
              people, couples, employers and society at large will become more 
              supportive of marriage and parenting," he said.<br><br>Mr Lee also urged
               Singaporeans, as they celebrate Lunar New Year, to spare a thought for 
              those who are going through difficult times, such as the less fortunate 
              or families who have recently lost loved ones. <br><br>He urged Singaporeans to invite them to their celebrations as they are all part of the larger Singapore family. <br><br>Mr Lee noted that the Year of the Snake is said to bring peace and prosperity.<br><br>Even so, he cautioned that Singapore's fate cannot be left to traditional beliefs. <br><br>He urged all to work hard to create a brighter future and he is confident that the nation will succeed.<br><br>Concluding,
               Mr Lee urged Singaporeans to appreciate what the country has achieved 
              together, and resolve to keep the nation harmonious and prospering.<br><br>Mr Lee wishes all Singaporeans a Very Happy Chinese New Year!<br><br>- CNA/de</span></span></p>

              <p>The agenda is simple: ask singaporeans get married and have children. And if we can't do it, they import the foreigners and blame us: "There you go". Then 40 years down the road and when these imported foreigners become old, we have to import even more foreigners to support these 1st generation foreigners.</p>

              <p>This fellow has no credibility that is why I urge all citizens to vote him out.   People who are still banging hope there will be positive change from him and PAP can forget it they will not change.   </p>

              <p>the root cause of the problem are a few.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>(1)one major is the policies we had in the past, stopping down to 2 is genocide and anyone with an average intelligent will aso know that its bad for business and genocidal! th concept is the same as looking at the platform of an mrt station that do not have barrier shuitter safety doors! you dont need an intelligent man to scream out such a flaw, see such an error.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>(2)two, thue the years we have been fed with the worn g direction in life, luxury and 5cs oveshadow our family ties and core human values. as such we pursue material need over the limit of what an average human being need and they have a chance to raise our standards of living beywond that the lower income group can mange. now with full speed ahead even many of our middle income groups are feeling the hyperdrive!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>(3)population imabalnce. bring in haftlings at the worng time and improper thinking that it will increase our population actually accelerated the numbers of our aging problem!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>solution?</p>
              <p>(1)yes we see is to increase our birthrate - and its iproper and weird to see so many people of differt bntaionalities getting ogather married. is it true love that will withstand the true test of time or just an instinct to mate and raise a family out of peer religion relative family friends pressure? the rate at which such things happen should never be fast too!</p>
              <p>beside having subsidiaries angpows to newborns, we must also ensure foriegners or people who will leave spore later donot benefit from such conadies. its after al our very own spore people onies. we want to have average 2 child per married couple? then we can make more expenses negligible or free for the first 2 children! once we hit the quota we will have the perfect solution!  TO HAVE NEW BORNS NE CITIZENS THAT ARE BELOW 10 YEARS OLD AND WILL NOT AGE 20 YEARS DOWN THE ROAD TO MAKE OUR AGING POPULATION THEN WORSE!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>(2)fine tuning new citzens PRs and cheap labor and foreign talents.</p>
              <p>we syill need them, but gahemn cannot wanton anyhow add ttheir numbers.</p>
              <p>new citizens PRs - if they are talented, true to wanna stay here for life, financially sound and skiled with no criminal recrds, healthy bad habits then we sure welcome them! however theur numbers to be keep at a standard (or adjustable) to fine tune our population number fluctautions periodcially. it can be reviewed and adjusted yearly or bi-yearly. it should not be a easy quick solution for people to plot the graphy and submit the report to higher ups for show only!</p>
              <p>foreign talents are suaully classified under 2 classes - skilled talents and PMETS. if we need one or two talents specially skilled ones, why not we havr to means we have to. PMETs. please regualte at a ratio of intake against our singaporean numbers. say like 1 foreign talent against 3 sgreans and nore more than this!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>cehap labor- are laborers costruction workers, serice line people. should not go by the rario but rather should be controlled as thses belongs to the rat category. if we dont regulate their  number sin their numebrs can multiply very fast.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>also we should watch out for  sub classes of unlawful labor that may take a fraction of our jobs away from singaporea, and also at the same time casues social security problems. these are suually people tha cums in on social visit passes not as toursits intention, or illegally!</p>

              <p>in short, we should not have a number (lie 69) in any white paper. and we should not be buidling so many infratcure to suport a popualtion number that should stop now and be maintain, reviewed yearly. we should improve our infractsure and see wht's worng what's redundant for show only isnetad of giving silly excuse slike increase apy andpay more fair to increase the srrvice standards. stupid or not, you can tell it by people's faces. we have to take it by the numbers. and review the increas in sg newboard babies yearly to see if the bonuses and goodies works. not just make a paper, and then wait 20 years later then see results and fine tune. we should review, work tune on it every eayr.</p>
              <p>road map ? we dont need one. we should work and adjust and change every eayr to monitor our newbord growth figure!</p>

              <p>Can I just ask 2 questions?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Firstly, why is the darn thing paid in installments? Families who are really struggling with the starting stages of raising a kid would like a lump sum of $6000. So why installments?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Secondly, why is the Baby Bonus Cash Gift offered to everyone? Shouldn't that only be for the people who cannot afford to have a kid? Instead of giving Cash Gifts to the super rich, we can not give it to them and give a increased amount to the poorer people who need it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Right?</p>
