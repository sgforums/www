              <p><span>SINGAPORE: For fresh graduates, jobs in the banking and financial sector have lost some shine. 
              <br> <br> This year's JobsFactory Employers of Choice survey showed a significant
              drop in the rankings of financial institutions, with only four banks in
              the top 10 - DBS Bank leading in sixth position - compared to six last
              year. The other banks were Citigroup, Barclays Capital Global Services
              and Deutsche Bank.
              <br> <br>Singapore Airlines (SIA) is the employer of choice - for the second
              year running - followed by Apple Computer, Google, 3M and ExxonMobil. <br> <br> "The SIA brand name is synonymous with quality, class and growth. Many
              fresh graduates translated that positive brand image to mean a
              desirable work place," said JobsFactory's director Lim Der Shing.
              <br> <br>But this has not meant an increase in applications from fresh
              graduates due to the "difficult operating environment", SIA told
              MediaCorp. <br> <br> "The recruitment freeze is still currently in place, although there are
              plans to resume limited recruitment for cabin crew to address
              attrition," said spokesman Nicholas Ionides. <br> <br> SIA, however, has been receiving applications from fresh graduates for
              positions in the station manager trainee and pilot trainee schemes.
              <br> <br>Likewise, Google has not hired any fresh graduates, but is open to
              hiring more as the economy improves next year, said South-east Asia
              head of corporate communications Dickson Seow. Google moved up two
              notches to third place this year, and Apple, from seventh to second.
              <br> <br>"Apple's good performance this year could be due to its growing
              reputation as a global leader in technological innovation and marketing
              savvy, while Google's increasing dominance on the Internet and
              attractive corporate culture could be reasons behind its popularity,"
              said Mr Lim.
              <br> <br>The banking and financial sector remains the most sought after
              industry to work in after airline and travel, engineering, government
              and public service, and education. It is still regarded as a sector
              where "good salaries are possible", said Adecco's director of
              information technology Rohit Chattree.
              <br> <br>Salary expectations also increased although "attractive pay,
              bonuses and other monetary compensation" came in second to "good career
              growth and opportunities" for an employer of choice. It rose about 5
              per cent to S$2,805 from S$2,655 last year. Among top graduates, the
              increase was about 6 per cent - to S$2,944 from S$2,767.
              <br> <br>Graduates may look for higher salaries if the sector they want to
              work in is recovering quickly and experiencing growth, said Mr
              Chattree, referring to pharmaceuticals, and, to a lesser extent, IT.
              <br> <br> It could also be that more than half of the 3,000 polled were those with a Second Upper Honours or Magna Cum Laude and above.
