              <p>Police are investigating a <span id="lw_1321756611_0" class="yshortcuts"><span id="lw_1321756948_0" class="yshortcuts">Facebook</span></span> post by a full-time national serviceman (NSF) that criticises Islam.</p>
              <p>This is the second such incident this week after an ex-Young PAP (YP) member was discovered to have posted an offensive photo on the same social networking site against Islam.</p>
              <p>A police spokesperson confirmed that investigations into the matter are 
              going on after a letter of complaint was sent to The Straits Times Forum
               Page, <span id="lw_1321756611_6" class="yshortcuts"><span id="lw_1321756948_6" class="yshortcuts">Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen</span></span>, Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Defence <span id="lw_1321756611_7" class="yshortcuts"><span id="lw_1321756948_7" class="yshortcuts">Mohamad Maliki Osman</span></span>, former <span id="lw_1321756611_9" class="yshortcuts"><span id="lw_1321756948_9" class="yshortcuts">PAP MP Maidin Packer</span></span> and sociopolitical blog The Online Citizen (TOC), reported <em>The Sunday Times</em> (ST).<br> <br>The NSF who posted the picture of text has been identified as <span id="lw_1321756611_5" class="yshortcuts"><span id="lw_1321756948_5" class="yshortcuts">Christian Eliab Ratnam</span></span>.
               His post included inflammatory statements about Islam, stating, among 
              other things, that Islam is not a religion but "an authoritarian, 
              political doctrine which imposes itself by force", wrote the same paper.<br> <br>Ratnam's <span id="lw_1321756611_1" class="yshortcuts"><span id="lw_1321756948_1" class="yshortcuts">Facebook</span></span> account has since been shut down.<br> <br>In
               a post on Friday on TOC, Ratnam apologised for the post, saying that he
               was not affiliated to any group or organisation, and added that he did 
              not want to "cause disharmony and unrest in Singapore".<br> <br>ST also discovered that Ratnam is apparently a pro-Israel and Jewish supporter.<br> <br>Not only did his <span id="lw_1321756611_2" class="yshortcuts"><span id="lw_1321756948_2" class="yshortcuts">Facebook</span></span> page contain the image of Israel's flag and the symbol for the <span id="lw_1321756611_8" class="yshortcuts"><span id="lw_1321756948_8" class="yshortcuts">Israel Defence Forces</span></span>, he is also a member of the <span id="lw_1321756611_3" class="yshortcuts"><span id="lw_1321756948_3" class="yshortcuts">Facebook</span></span> group for Israelis and Jews living in Singapore.<br> <br>Ratnam also made a post on a <span id="lw_1321756611_4" class="yshortcuts"><span id="lw_1321756948_4" class="yshortcuts">Facebook</span></span> group called "anti-feminist empire", where he directed readers to the 
              group called "Submissive and Obedient Wives (For G-d and Husband)", 
              which was started by his wife.<br> <br>It calls for wives to be submissive and obedient to their husbands and quotes from the Bible and Torah.</p>

Many of Singapore's most prominent Chinese have had baba backgrounds. </span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Lee Kuan Yew, who became prime minister of Singapore aged just 35, is the most obvious example.</span></span></strong><span style="color: #333333;"> He claims a Hakka heritage, although his upbringing was that of a baba: at home, he spoke English with his parents and baba Malay to his grandparents. "Mandarin was totally alien to me and unconnected with my life," Lee said of his childhood.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-size: 1.2em; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; line-height: 1.3em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: -webkit-auto; border: 0px initial initial;"><span style="color: #333333;">For Lee, Chineseness was an acquired skill and later a political necessity. He was not brought up as a Chinese with a focus on China, </span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">but as a baba who looked to England.</span></span></strong><span style="color: #333333;"> He followed the conventional career path of a baba and went to London to study law. And so Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore became </span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Harry Lee of Fitzwilliam College,</span></span></strong><span style="color: #333333;"> Cambridge. His father had given him and</span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> two of his brothers English, as well as Chinese, names</span></span></strong><span style="color: #333333;">. </span></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>After World War II, the previously respectable designations such as "Baba"
                      and "Peranakan" became almost terms of abuse if used by the "non-Baba
                      Chinese".</p>
              <p>The non-Baba Chinese gave the Babas condescending names, which implied that
                      they were not "complete Chinese" because of their (supposed) inability to
                      speak "Chinese", <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">their alleged adoption of "foreign" (i.e. non-Chinese)
                      cultures and their British orientation.</span></strong></p>
              <p>The Japanese Occupation turned the Peranakan world upside-down by
                      triggering important changes in the political role of the Babas as well as
                      in their cultural identity.</p>
              <p>Many Babas fell victim because they were among the groups targeted during
                      the Japanese sook ching operation. Hastily arranged "intermarriages"
                      between Nyonyas and non-Baba Chinese were to lead to radical changes in the
                      Baba way of life and to "sinicisation".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> The British patronage of the Babas
                      was interrupted in 1942 and was never again fully restored.</span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>AS "sons of the soil", the Straits Chinese British Association's Straits
                      Chinese defended their citizenship (or subjecthood) rights against the
                      China-born Chinese and those first-generation Singapore-born Chinese who
                      had a dual loyalty.</p>
              <p>The chasm between the Babas and the sinkehs (literally "guests", or recent
                      immigrants from China) may also be illustrated by the typical occupations
                      of the China-born Chinese which self-conscious Babas would have shunned.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">With the increased ambiguity of the status of the Babas, many of them
                      neither dared to admit they were Babas nor spoke Baba Malay in public.</span></strong></p>
              <p>The
                      days of Baba Malay as an inter-group language of commercial value were also
                      gone, and Baba Malay stagnated and became confined to the domestic domain. 
                      The once flourishing literary activities in Baba Malay came to a grinding
                      halt and wayang peranakan and dondang sayang were in crisis.</p>
              <p>Thus, the most
                      important "Malay" aspect of the previous Baba identity was indeed in
                      decline.</p>
              <p>HOWEVER, there were early warning signs of the Babas' loss of influence.</p>

              <p>Eventually, with the waning British influence, the failure of the
                      secessionists, the death of conservative "Baba politics" and the rapid rise
                      of the People's Action Party which led to self-rule in 1959, the Babas
                      reached the second crucial turning-point in their social history.</p>
              <p>This
                      usually ignored turning-point was marked by self-rule and the takeover by
                      the PAP.</p>
              <p>Although leading members of the PAP, such as Lee Kuan Yew, Dr Toh
                      Chin Chye and Dr Goh Keng Swee, were publicly described as English-educated
                      Babas, the Babas as a group were openly belittled as "deculturalised".</p>

              <p style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit; margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;">Stated simply, the <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Jewish view of Jesus of Nazareth is that he was an ordinary Jewish man and preacher</span></strong> living during the Roman occupation of the Holy Land in the first century C.E. The Romans executed him - and also executed many other nationalistic and religious Jews - for speaking out against Roman authority and abuses.</p>
              <h3 style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 12px; font-style: inherit; margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; text-decoration: inherit; color: inherit;">Was Jesus the Messiah According to Jewish Beliefs?</h3>
              <p style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit; margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;">After the death of Jesus, his followers - at the time a small sect of former Jews known as the Nazarenes - claimed he was the Messiah prophesied in Jewish texts and that he would soon return to fulfill the acts required of the Messiah. The <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">majority of contemporary<span style="color: #ff0000;"> Jews rejected this belief</span> and Judaism as a whole continues to do so today.</span></strong> Eventually, Jesus became the focal point of a small Jewish religious movement that would evolve into the Christian faith.</p>
              <p style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit; margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Jews do not believe that Jesus was divine</span></span></strong>, the Son of God, or the Messiah prophesied in Jewish scriptures. He is <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">seen as a "false messiah,"</span></strong> meaning someone who claimed (or whose followers claimed for him) the mantle of the Messiah but who ultimately did not meet the requirements laid out in Jewish beliefs.</p>

              <p>The babas, on the other hand, also known as Straits
              Chinese, were Chinese more in name than practice.</p>
              <p>They assimilated with both the local Malays and the
              colonising British, whom they especially admired. </p>
              <p>The babas became the lawyers, the civil servants and
              the politicians; they attended the local English-language schools
              run in the tradition of the UK's public schools, and Oxford and
              Cambridge.</p>
              <p>Although the sinkeh dominated Singapore's population,
              <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">it was the babas
              who dominated public decision-making.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">In effect,</span> <strong style="color: #333333;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">a baba minority captured sinkeh
              Singapore</span></strong><span style="color: #333333;">, and
              that</span> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">minority's attitudes were more those of Victorian
              England</span></span></strong> <span style="color: #333333;">than
              China.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">It was the babas who were
              the framers of Singapore's rules and institutions. Many of
              Singapore's most prominent Chinese have had baba
              backgrounds.</span> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Lee
              Kuan Yew, who became prime minister of Singapore aged just 35, is
              the most obvious example.</span></span></strong> <span style="color: #333333;">He claims a Hakka heritage, although his
              upbringing was that of a baba: at home, he spoke English with his
              parents and baba Malay to his grandparents. "Mandarin was totally
              alien to me and unconnected with my life," Lee said of his
              childhood.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">For Lee, Chineseness was
              an acquired skill and later a political necessity. He was not
              brought up as a Chinese with a focus on China,</span> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">but as a baba who looked to
              England.</span></span></strong> <span style="color: #333333;">He
              followed the conventional career path of a baba and went to London
              to study law. And so Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore became</span> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Harry Lee of Fitzwilliam
              College,</span></span></strong> <span style="color: #333333;">Cambridge. His father had given him and</span> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">two of his brothers English, as well as Chinese,
              names</span></span></strong><span style="color: #333333;">.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Did Lee run Singapore as
              a piece of Asia mired in Chinese ways?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">No.</span> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">He ran it in a manner to which a British colonial
              administrator would have aspired.</span></span></strong></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After World War II, the previously respectable designations such
              as "Baba" and "Peranakan" became almost terms of abuse if used by
              the "non-Baba Chinese".</p>
              <p>The non-Baba Chinese gave the Babas condescending names, which
              implied that they were not "complete Chinese" because of their
              (supposed) inability to speak "Chinese", <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">their alleged adoption of "foreign"
              (i.e. non-Chinese) cultures and their British
              orientation.</span></strong></p>
              <p>The Japanese Occupation turned the Peranakan world upside-down
              by triggering important changes in the political role of the Babas
              as well as in their cultural identity.</p>
              <p>Many Babas fell victim because they were among the groups
              targeted during the Japanese sook ching operation. Hastily arranged
              "intermarriages" between Nyonyas and non-Baba Chinese were to lead
              to radical changes in the Baba way of life and to
              "sinicisation".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The British
              patronage of the Babas was interrupted in 1942 and was never again
              fully restored.</span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>AS "sons of the soil", the Straits Chinese British Association's
              Straits Chinese defended their citizenship (or subjecthood) rights
              against the China-born Chinese and those first-generation
              Singapore-born Chinese who had a dual loyalty.</p>
              <p>The chasm between the Babas and the sinkehs (literally "guests",
              or recent immigrants from China) may also be illustrated by the
              typical occupations of the China-born Chinese which self-conscious
              Babas would have shunned.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">With the
              increased ambiguity of the status of the Babas, many of them
              neither dared to admit they were Babas nor spoke Baba Malay in
              public.</span></strong></p>
              <p>The days of Baba Malay as an inter-group language of commercial
              value were also gone, and Baba Malay stagnated and became confined
              to the domestic domain. The once flourishing literary activities in
              Baba Malay came to a grinding halt and wayang peranakan and dondang
              sayang were in crisis.</p>
              <p>Thus, the most important "Malay" aspect of the previous Baba
              identity was indeed in decline.</p>
              <p>HOWEVER, there were early warning signs of the Babas' loss of
              influence.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Eventually, with the waning British influence, the failure of
              the secessionists, the death of conservative "Baba politics" and
              the rapid rise of the People's Action Party which led to self-rule
              in 1959, the Babas reached the second crucial turning-point in
              their social history.</p>
              <p>This usually ignored turning-point was marked by self-rule and
              the takeover by the PAP.</p>
              <p>Although leading members of the PAP, such as Lee Kuan Yew, Dr
              Toh Chin Chye and Dr Goh Keng Swee, were publicly described as
              English-educated Babas, the Babas as a group were openly belittled
              as "deculturalised".</p>
