              <p><span>SINGAPORE : A couple who created a commotion by strolling nude at Holland Village were charged in court on Thursday.
              <br> <br> The man is Jan Philip, a 21-year-old Swedish student on an exchange programme in Singapore.
              <br> <br> He had been with Eng Kai Er, a 24-year-old Singaporean who is studying in Sweden.
              <br> <br> They are accused of appearing naked in public at about 11pm on January 24 at Lorong Mambong.
              <br> <br> If convicted, the pair could be fined up to S$2,000, jailed for up to three months, or both.
              <br> <br> They will be back in court at the end of this month. - CNA /ls </span></p>

              <p>do you think it's appropriate for someone of responsibility and power to act in such a manner ? ... that's where scholars are headed, no ? ... or do you think good marks and a high IQ in schools is a license to do whatever you like ? ... to demonstrate some alien libertine values that's totally at odds with our society ? ... what she did ... was to give a free show to a bunch of men ... I frequent a pub directly opposite tangos (where it started), and till today, some of the fellows there are still gleefully showing me the pics they got on their hp that night.</p>
              <p>we are an asian country after all, with still very traditional values ... I feel so sorry for her parents, now that her name's splashed all over the media ... imagine your daughter stripped bullocks naked down the main street with an ang moh ... this would give older folks a heart attack ... let's cut the bullshit about liberty and personal choice and what not shall we ? ... would this be something you'd do yourself ? ... would this be something you'd let your parents know you did ? ... end of story !</p>
              <p>if she thinks this society is too stiffled for her tastes, then by all means, walk down naked through stockholm for the rest of her life and never come back ....</p>
              <p>sure, we need all the talents we can get, but I draw the line at the fabric of our society ... there are plenty of foreigners lining up out there, other ang mohs even, whom we can import, with no penchant for walking naked down mainstreets ....</p>

              <p><span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A*STAR scholar, Swede charged with appearing nude in public</span></strong><br><span class="update"><em>By Zul Othman, </em><a href="http://www.todayonline.com/"><span style="color: #cc0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>TODAY</em></span></span></a><em> | </em></span><span class="update"><em>Posted: 10 April 2009 0630 hrs</em></span></span></p>
              <p><br>SINGAPORE: <span style="color: #ff0000;">She is a PhD scholar with A*STAR, the Agency for Science, Technology and Research, who is studying at the Karolinksa Institute in Sweden, and he, a Swedish student on an exchange programme.</span> <br><br>The young couple who caused a stir when they walked down Holland Village in the buff on January 24, were charged in court on Thursday with appearing nude in public. <br><br>Jan Philip, a 21-year-old Swede, and 24-year-old Eng Kai Er, a Singaporean, remained silent when they appeared before District Judge Shaiffudin Saruwan. <br><br>It is not known why it took so long before the duo was hauled before the judge. However, their long-awaited court date went by quickly after their lawyer, Mr William Chan, asked for an adjournment to write in to the Attorney-General's Chambers. <br><br>TODAY understands that by writing in, the lawyer would be appealing for the charges to be withdrawn and the accused be let off with a warning. The lawyer could also make an appeal to have the charges reduced. <br><br>If convicted under the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act, the couple could be fined up to $2,000 and/or jailed up to three months each. <br><br>Mr Philip was offered bail of $5,000 and had his passport impounded. Eng did not need to post bail as she is a Singaporean. <br><br><span style="color: #ff0000;">A National Science Scholar, Ms Eng is listed on the A*STAR website as pursuing a PhD in infection biology. The National Science Scholarship (PhD) prepares scholars for key leadership roles in Singapore's science and technology future. <br><br>When contacted, a spokesperson for A*STAR told TODAY the Agency is concerned that the woman charged in court for the offence is an A*STAR scholar. And she added: "However, as the matter is now before the courts, we would prefer not to make any further comment until the case is resolved."</span> <br><br><span style="color: #0000ff;">In her teens, Ms Eng was a competitive ice skater who got to represent Singapore in Skate Asia, the largest ice-skating competition outside the United States. She was also a member of Mensa, an association whose members are defined by their high IQs. <br></span><br>Her father Mr Eng Weng Kiong told TODAY his daughter is a nice and lovely girl, and the family is standing by her. <br><br>During their 15-minute stroll down the popular hangout in January, the couple were said to have walked hand-in-hand and waved to patrons of the eateries along Lorong Mambong. They were also said to have stopped at a bar and chatted with its patrons. <br>Pictures of their jaunt were later posted on the Internet by a member of the public.The pair were arrested shortly after, but were released on bail. They will appear in court again on April 30. -</p>
