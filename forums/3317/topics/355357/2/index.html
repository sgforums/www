              ST also reported SM Goh's concern about lack of public graciousness.
              
              SM Goh: Hygiene is gracious act Sat, Apr 11, 2009
              The Straits Times
              	
              THE recent food poisoning incident at the Geylang Serai market shows how poor hygiene can have a wide impact on public health, Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong said on Saturday.
              
              He urged Singaporeans to view hygiene as part of gracious behaviour, during a community event to welcome new residents of his Marine Parade GRC.
              
              'If you have poor hygiene in public places, littering, food all over the place, rats running around the market, that's very ungracious behaviour,' he said.
              
              Rats! Wrong topic !

              <p><strong>Couple who walked in nude at Holland Village fined S$2,000 each</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : A couple who walked nude at Singapore's Holland Village in January, were fined S$2,000 each on Thursday. 
              <br> <br> However, they escaped a jail term as Singapore's Miscellaneous Offences
              Act stipulates that an offender can be fined a maximum S$2,000, or
              jailed 3 months, or both.
              <br> <br> The pair, students at a Swedish university, appeared in court on Thursday. 
              <br> <br>In January, 21-year-old Swede Jan Philip, and 24-year-old
              Singaporean Eng Kai Er, had stripped at a nearby car park and walked
              naked at Holland Village, a popular hangout amongst foreigners.
              <br> <br>In mitigation, Philip claimed he misapprehended the law regarding
              obscene acts, and did not know public nudity is an offence in
              Singapore.
              <br> <br>The court also heard testimonials of Eng, who was described as a
              person who contributes to society through her research work in
              infectious diseases. <br> <br> The A*STAR scholar has also been involved in street projects in the past, promoting safe sex education. </span></p>

              <p>I'm thinking that A*Star will convene an inquiry panel and punish her in some way.....</p>
              <p>I don't think it'll come to outright termination of her scholarship, since there's no academic fraud involved like stealing some other dude's research.....</p>
              <p>I'm guessing warning letter + putting her scholarship on probation for the remainder of the term, i.e. one more mistake and she's kaput.</p>

              <p><strong><span class="newsTitle">Nude stroll in Holland Village was for the ‘thrill’</span></strong></p>
              <p>They had a street agog with curiosity and a nation wondering about their naked jaunt down Lorong Mambong in Holland Village.</p>
              <p>Yesterday, a district court heard that the couple had done it for the "thrill" of it all.</p>
              <p>And for that, Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*) PhD scholar Eng Kai Er and Swede Jan Philip were fined $2,000 each, after pleading guilty to strolling in the buff in public on Jan 24 at about 11pm.</p>
              <p>Defence lawyer William Chan said in mitigation that the act was "spontaneous" and that both Eng and Philip had been drinking at Holland Village, he said.</p>
              <p>The lawyer added that before they decided to take their clothes off, Philip had checked to see if public nudity was a crime.</p>
              <p>He had looked up the Penal Code, which stated that obscene acts are illegal, but he did not realise public nudity was an offence.</p>
              <p>Mr Chan said the duo were unfamiliar with Singapore law and had "misapprehended" the statute.</p>
              <p>Although Eng is a Singaporean, she has been studying overseas and "misunderstood that while certain things are accepted overseas, they are not here in Singapore".</p>
              <p>He added that "public nudity is frowned upon, but nudity itself is a natural aspect of a person" and "nudity per se is not obscene and is not illegal".</p>
              <p>The two had walked in a "graceful and dignified manner" with no lewd gestures, obscene speeches or touching of any parts of their bodies.</p>
              <p>"There was no reaction of disgust. The people reacted with cheers as was reported in the newspapers," said Mr Chan, pointing out that the act was committed late on a Saturday night at a place "well-known for expatriates and locals to relax and drink" with no children or housing estates nearby.</p>
              <p>A Housing Board estate sits on the fringe of Lorong Mambong and the eateries there are popular with families.</p>
              <p>The lawyer said the pair regretted their actions and are students with "a future and bright prospects to contribute to society, whether Singapore or internationally".</p>
              <p>He added that Eng is involved in projects to "help prostitutes who need education and assistance" and helps in handing out safe sex pamphlets to make travellers going to the Riau Islands.</p>
              <p>Eng, 24, is currently pursuing a biomedical science course at Sweden's Karolinska Institue.</p>
              <p>When contacted for comments about the sentence, an A*Star spokeswoman said: "Naturally, we are disappointed that one of our scholars is guilty of an offence. A*Start will now review the matter with Kai Er and decide on the appropriate course of action."</p>
              <p>Philip, 21, is an exchange student at the National University of Singapore and is expected to leave the Republic soon.</p>
              <p>Approached for comments as they left the court separately, Ms Eng did not say anything, while Mr Philip said "goodbye" in Mandarin.</p>
              <p>Both Eng and Philip had arrived together for the court session clad in black and white suits.</p>
              <p>They wore caps and sunglasses, using umbrellas to shield their faces from photgraphers as they got out of the car.</p>
              <p>Eng also wore a mask.</p>
              <p>They looked calm throughout the session, smiling and speaking to each other occasionally.</p>
