              Party (PAP) will choose members for the party's highest policy-making 
              body, the Central Executive Committee (CEC), when the party holds its 
              biennial conference on Sunday.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>It will be the first PAP conference after the May 2011 General Election.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>All eyes are on how 
              far the party has transformed itself and on its postmortem of the 
              party's performance in the last General Election, said Nominated MP, 
              Assistant Professor Eugene Tan from the Singapore Management University.<br><br>Asst
               Prof Tan said: For me, one of the major things I look at is how well is
               the party going to address diversity -- the diversity of views -- the 
              fact that people no longer look to the PAP as the answer for all their 
              problems.<br><br>"There is now the increased competitiveness in our 
              political landscape and Singaporeans see the value in a more competitive
               landscape.<br><br>"In a way, they have internalised what the PAP 
              government has always preached, that good governance is of vital 
              importance and for many Singaporeans, their view is that good governance
               would require the political landscape to be a lot more competitive and 
              diverse."<br><br>On their part, PAP MPs said there has been more engagement with party members on the ground.<br><br>MP
               for Chua Chu Kang GRC, Mr Zaqy Mohamad, said: "This is where I think 
              that a change in the approach in terms of having engaged the branches, 
              going to party seminar and then going to party convention, the approach 
              is a lot more different from the past, because in the past, the 
              perception of the PAP is top down.<br><br>"There is a lot more engagement today.<br><br>"There
               is a greater need for consensus not just with Singaporeans, but also 
              within the party in terms of how we want to shape our future together."<br><br>Trade
               and Industry Minister of State Teo Ser Luck said: "It is also very 
              important that the voices of the people are heard and also when it is 
              heard, (whether they are) taken seriously and how can it be a channel of
               feeder of opinions into the revision of policies.<br><br>"That's very 
              important because the demographics are slowly changing as well. We have a
               greying population, but at the same time the younger generation have 
              their point of view -- they are more well informed and shape their own 
              thoughts differently."<br><br>Apart from Party Secretary-General and Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, several other party members, are also expected to speak.<br><br>Elections
               to the CEC are held once every two years and political watchers feel a 
              good number of those expected to form Singapore's fourth generation of 
              leadership team would be vying for places in the CEC.<br><br>And the 
              decision as to who will make it to the CEC is in the hands of the party 
              cadres, who will cast their votes at the start of the day's proceedings 
              on Sunday morning.<br><br>- CNA/lp</span></span></p>
