              <div class="story_headline2"><strong> Hwa Chong teachers take students' belongings 'to teach them a lesson'</strong></div>
              <div class="story_headline2"><br></div>
              <div class="story_headline2">Some teachers removed items like laptops, PSP, iPod and even wallets 
              left in an empty classroom by students who were attending an event in 
              another part of Hwa Chong Institution, said a STOMPer. <br><br>A teacher later explained that this was to "teach the students a lesson they will not forget".<br><br>The
               STOMPer asks if removing the students' belongings was necessary. The 
              students were also made to write letters of apology and assure the 
              teachers that they would not leave their belongings unattended, before 
              they claimed the items.<br><br>According to the teachers, the school had
               received complaints from parents who blamed the teachers for their 
              sons' lost belongings.<br><br>The STOMPer wrote in an email:<br><br>"On 
              Monday (Jul 19), while a couple of classes are attending the opening 
              ceremony for the Asia-Pacific Young Leaders Summit, some teachers went 
              into the empty classrooms and took away students’ valuables. <br><br>"According
               to a teacher, twenty laptops, two wallets, one PSP console and one iPod
               were taken away by the school during this 'casual inspection'.<br><br>"At
               first we did not know who took our belongings, thinking it may be just 
              that we misplaced them, but later on in the day we were told to meet a 
              teacher to reclaim our 'lost' belongings. <br><br>"Upon meeting the 
              teacher, he told us to write a letter of apology together with proof of 
              assurance that we would not leave our belongings lying around 
              unattended, before we can claim our belongings.<br><br>"The teacher 
              explained that it was necessary because parents have complained to them,
               blaming them for their sons’ lost belongings in the school. The school 
              admin also wanted to teach the students a lesson that they will not 
              forget. <br><br>"The teacher also highlighted the risk of theft by the 
              workers doing construction work near our school. He said that only 
              belongings that were not well kept or secured were removed.<br><br>"But I would like to ask the school admin and the public as a whole, is this move really necessary and moral?<br><br>"I
               have seen the panic and despair of my friends and classmates when they 
              had discovered that they lost their belongings. One of my friends lost 
              his wallet, with cash, his EZ-link card and even his IC inside. <br><br>"Before
               we knew that the school had taken them, we even suggested to him that 
              he make a police report. This is the severity of such an action.<br><br>"One
               of my friends brought his laptop to do schoolwork, but he is denied 
              this opportunity to do so by the school. I believe that he is not the 
              only one.<br><br>"Furthermore, some of us are required to move from 
              class to class between lessons. This would mean that locking of the 
              classrooms is impractical as a solution to this. Furthermore if a thief 
              is really that determined to break into the class, he can climb through 
              the windows or break them.<br><br>"Must we all then, get metal chains to chain all of our belongings by our side wherever we go anywhere in school? <br><br>"I don’t see why the students, being potential victims of theft, should be punished for being just that."</div>
