              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The babies have been reunited with their biological parents and are doing well.</span></span></p>

              incident came to light when one of the parents noticed that the baby 
              taken home wore an identification tag belonging to another mother.<br><br>This happened about an hour after they brought him home.<br><br>KKH
               said all babies have double tags, and this baby had an incorrect tag 
              and a correct tag on his legs when he was given to the wrong parents.<br><br>The hospital suspected that checks were not carried out properly when the baby was being discharged.<br><br>The other baby, also a boy, was with the wrong parents for about 10 hours.<br><br>He was wearing two correct tags but was given to the wrong set of parents during discharge.<br> <br>The hospital informed the parents after a blood test of the first baby confirmed the mix-up.<br><br>It has conducted DNA tests on the babies and is waiting for the results.<br><br>KKH
               said on Monday that it deeply regrets this error and is now carrying 
              out thorough investigations to find out how this error occurred.<br><br>It is extending full support to both families -- medically and emotionally.<br><br>Both mothers have been offered counselling by the hospital.<br><br>KKH
               said it takes a very serious view of the incident and it unreservedly 
              apologised to the parents for this error and pledged to take all steps 
              to prevent any recurrence.<br><br>A full review is being carried out, and the Ministry of Health has been informed.<br><br>- CNA/lp</span></span></p>

              <p><strong>Hospitals rely on tags, staff, parents to prevent mix-up of babies</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Hospitals in Singapore have in place robust procedures to ensure that parents do not go home with the wrong baby.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>But they also rely on staff and parents to prevent mistakes. </span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Channel NewsAsia 
              checked with five hospitals on their systems, a day after KK Women's and
               Children's Hospital (KKH) revealed its mix-up over two babies who were 
              discharged to the wrong sets of parents on Sunday.<br><br>All babies are tagged and are carefully checked to ensure that they are matched with their mothers.<br><br>Still, the unexpected had happened at KKH.<br><br>The baby who left the hospital first had two correct tags with his mother's name.<br><br>The second baby was wearing mismatched tags. <br><br>One tag had the name of his mother, while the other carried the name of the mother of the first baby.<br><br>This incident has left many wondering why the checks were not thorough enough.<br><br>Other maternity hospitals that Channel NewsAsia checked with also rely on tagging.<br><br>Each
               baby is given two tags minutes after birth and when it is time to leave
               the hospital, staff would check both tags to confirm their identities.<br><br>Mount Elizabeth Hospital takes extra simple steps, such as getting the mothers to read out the babies' tags.<br><br>It also uses Radio-frequency identification to match baby and mother.<br><br>Mount
               Elizabeth Hospital's chief executive officer, Dr Kelvin Loh, said: 
              "Only if the baby goes off the correct mother, the tag will give off a 
              pleasant chime.<br><br>"If the baby goes to the wrong mother, it will 
              actually sound off an alarm so that will be an additional mechanism that
               will help to match the baby to the right mother."<br><br>At least one other hospital is looking at using new technology to ensure that newborn babies are paired with the right mothers. <br><br>KKH
               is still investigating the mix-up and is working with the health 
              ministry to ensure this will be the only and last mix-up incident.<br><br>- CNA/lp</span></span></p>

              <p><strong>DNA tests confirm babies reunited with biological parents</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: The DNA tests have confirmed that the two babies who 
              were given to the wrong parents in a mix-up by KK Women's and Children's
               Hospital (KKH) were reunited with their biological parents.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>KKH said on Tuesday that it received the results on 23 November from the Health Sciences Authority (HSA).</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The babies were reunited with their biological parents hours after the mix-up happened on 18 November.<br><br>Turning
               to the investigations into the mix-up, KKH said early findings 
              confirmed that the problem stemmed from an incorrect replacement tag and
               failure to verify the identification tags when the babies were being 
              discharged.<br><br>KKH said it takes an extremely serious view of the 
              incident and has put in place more measures to tighten the 
              identification process and ensure that staff follow the guidelines.<br><br>Parents will be more involved in verifying the baby at birth and in the ward nursery.<br><br>After
               staff have thoroughly checked the mother's identity and tags, mothers 
              will read back and confirm the particulars on the tags - after birth and
               at the time of discharge.<br><br>The father or mother will also be 
              involved in affixing the first identification tag, and in verifying the 
              second identification tag at the ward nursery.<br><br>KKH has also tweaked the way identification tags are affixed to ensure that they don't fall off.<br><br>The tags will be affixed closest to the narrowest section of the baby's ankle, allowing just a finger-tip's space.<br><br>Two nurses will verify the identification tag in the ward and at the time of discharge.<br><br>They'll
               also verify both the ankle tags with the particulars on the cot each 
              time the baby is carried out and placed back in the cot, such as for 
              feeding and bathing.<br><br>Measures have also been tightened in the replacement of identification tags.<br><br>Mothers will be informed about the replacement.<br><br>Two nurses will verify the reprinted tag before it is affixed to the baby.<br><br>KKH is also stepping up monitoring and auditing to ensure compliance.<br> <br>"Following
               this unfortunate incident, we have strengthened and added to our 
              processes and protocols and reinforced with all staff the need to be 
              vigilant and strictly adhere to these processes and protocols for the 
              care of our patients at all times," KKH's director of nursing Tan Soh 
              Chin said.<br><br>The hospital will continue to review all processes to enhance and tighten the identification process.<br><br>- CNA/ck</span></span></p>

              <p><strong>KKH to implement all recommendations by committee in baby mix-up case</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: A Review Committee has come up with 15 
              recommendations to prevent another baby mix-up at KK Women's and 
              Children's Hospital (KKH).</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Two newborn babies were wrongly discharged to their mothers in an incident in November.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The measures involve
               tightening processes regarding identification of newborns, ward 
              operations, the discharge process, and implementing new technology.<br><br>There
               will be two staff involved in the tagging and re-tagging of babies at 
              all times. Parents will verify the baby's particulars.<br><br>The way a baby is tagged will be refined to ensure that the tag does not drop off easily.<br><br>There will also be proper documentation for tracking the movement of babies in and out of the nursery.<br><br>At
               a media conference on Wednesday, Chief Executive Officer of KKH 
              Professor Kenneth Kwek said the hospital has accepted all the 
              recommendations made by the four-member committee, and they will be 
              implemented by the end of next month. <br><br>Most of the recommendations made had already been acted on and implemented within a week of the incident. <br><br>The hospital will act on the remaining recommendations by the end of January.<br><br>Professor Kwek also said 17 people involved in the incident have been taken to task.<br><br>Three
               staff nurses directly involved in the mix-up have received disciplinary
               action. They received written warnings, were suspended from work for a 
              week with no pay, and have been taken out of clinical duties for at 
              least three months. <br><br>They will be closely supervised and their performance reviewed for at least six months.<br><br>Fourteen ward staff involved also received warnings or counselling.<br><br>Professor
               Kwek said the hospital extended an offer of compensation to the parents
               over and beyond the cost of their stay, but would not give further 
              details.<br><br>The committee noted that the mix-up was triggered when 
              the babies were placed in wrong cots. This resulted in a wrong 
              identification tag being applied to one baby.<br><br>KKH earlier said 
              the incident came to light when one of the parents noticed that the baby
               taken home wore an identification tag belonging to another mother.<br><br>The
               hospital suspected that checks were not carried out properly when the 
              baby was being discharged. The other baby was with the wrong parents for
               about 10 hours.<br><br>The Ministry of Health said the lapse by KK 
              Women's and Children's Hospital (KKH) in not safeguarding and ensuring 
              patient safety was unacceptable.<br><br>It said the lapse revealed that 
              more work needs to be done to root and reinforce the culture of safety 
              across the organisation and in all of its activities. <br><br>The 
              Ministry's statement came after a Review Committee tasked to look into 
              the recent incident where two babies were discharged to the wrong 
              parents found that the mix-up was due to a lack of compliance with 
              established procedures.<br><br>MOH has written a stern letter to the CEO
               of KKH to register its disappointment and concern on the lack of 
              supervision and oversight, especially with regard to patient identity 
              and safety in the nursery.<br><br>It has also directed the Chairman of 
              KKH's Patient's Safety Council to step up the council's oversight of 
              ensuring patient safety and compliance by the staff.<br><br>MOH said 
              KKH's leadership will need to take all necessary steps to close gaps and
               to make improvements including conducting periodic audits to check for 
              compliance. <br><br>The Review Committee was chaired by Professor Ho Lai
               Yun, Senior Consultant of the Department of Neonatal and Developmental 
              Medicine at the Singapore General Hospital.<br><br>- CNA/de</span></span></p>
