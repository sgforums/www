              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has cautioned 
              Singaporeans to pay attention to new fault lines that have appeared 
              between new citizens and native Singaporeans.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Speaking at Teck 
              Ghee Community Club's racial harmony celebrations, Mr Lee said new 
              citizens may be ethnically similar, but fault lines may develop as the 
              new citizens have different norms, habits and attitudes.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>So he said Singaporeans must watch out for instances of social friction, especially online.<br><br>Mr
               Lee said new citizens and those born in Singapore must work together to
               ensure that differences do not affect social stability.<br><br>"The new
               arrivals - to embrace the Singapore values and norms and try and fit in
               as Singaporeans. And Singaporeans - to encourage the new ones to 
              integrate, to help the new ones to fit in."<br><br>In his speech, PM Lee reminded Singaporeans the reason for racial harmony celebrations. <br><br>He
               cited the two racial riots of 1964 when Singapore was part of the 
              Federation of Malaysia. The riots left more than 30 dead, 500 injured 
              and thousands arrested.<br><br>Looking back, Mr Lee said Singapore has come a long way but challenges remain.<br><br>He
               pointed out that the ease of joining online communities amplifies 
              intolerant views as people are less restrained in cyberspace.<br><br>Mr Lee said the peace that Singapore now enjoys did not happen by chance, but by pure effort and deliberate policies.<br><br>These
               include ensuring equality, meritocracy and setting up institutions like
               the Presidential Council for Minority Rights and the Presidential 
              Council for Religious Harmony to protect those groups' interests.<br><br>And it's important to continue to do so.<br><br>PM
               Lee said: "In normal times, we get along well together, but when 
              there's a crisis for example, if there's a terrorist attack, then even 
              though we're under pressure, stay together and we don't pull apart."<br><br>So as the population becomes more diverse, Singaporeans will have to work harder at keeping social cohesion.<br><br>Mr Lee added, that perhaps Singaporeans can start today.<br><br>"Today
               of course, is the first day of Ramadan, and we wish our Muslim friends a
               happy fasting month and I hope you'll accept your Muslim friends' 
              invitation to visit them during the month of Ramadan, if they invite you
               to break fast with them, take the opportunity to invite them for dinner
               the next time if you can," he said.<br><br>And bit-by-bit, he said, this will keep the Singapore society harmonious. <br><br>- CNA/ck</span></span></p>

              <p>dear PM.. when you guys came up with the idea to bring in citizens to "boost the numbers" particularly GDP and per-capita numbers, did you not think that bringing in very very "capable" and high paying people would cause these very people to cloister themselves away from the normal people because they have the financial clout to do so?</p>
              <p>did you not realise that by coming from other countries, they will bring in their own culture and norms, and will be able to buy their own comfort zones by again, cloistering themselves away from the normal citizens?</p>
              <p>worse, these new citizens will have the financial clout which you idiots in power love.. and will happily take them into your inner circles.. and listen to them, increasing their influence on you...</p>
              <p>these things are happening now..</p>
              <p>in the RCs, we have new citizens from PRC who cannot carry out a coherent conversation in English (which is the language of government) yet are part of the committee, saying, bragging.. that they have access to the MPs.. and ministers.. and speak to them a lot...</p>
              <p>so how... when you send kar-kias to the "meet the people" sessions and yet these new citizens who cannot converse with the rest of Singapore have your ear.. you don't think these fault lines won't widen?</p>
              <p>it is up to you, PM, to fix this.. not by telling us to plaster over the fault lines.. it is up to you to shut the hell up about these "new citizens" and your FTs.. and live among the normal people, to listen to them and know what it is like.. otherwise, it's all hot air from you.. and your idiots in power...</p>

              Of cos it is our fault, the elites once mention that they have the mandate of the Singaporean which is true, at least it was shown during the last G.E and the G.E before.  Since the majority of the Singaporean agree with the FT policy, and now cannot agree that the FT have more right than Singaporean.  Then of cos it is the Singaporean fault.

              "He pointed out that the ease of joining online communities amplifies intolerant views as people are less restrained in cyberspace."
              
              Less restrained = more naked truth... Some people just cannot handle the truth.... But as with all things read and heard, take a pinch of salt and lots of common sense...
              
              "He cited the two racial riots of 1964 when Singapore was part of the Federation of Malaysia. The riots left more than 30 dead, 500 injured and thousands arrested."
              
              Locally bred Singaporeans are docile, its the foreigners and the NEW citizens he should be watching out....
              
              "These include ensuring equality, meritocracy and setting up institutions like the Presidential Council for Minority Rights and the Presidential Council for Religious Harmony to protect those groups' interests."
              
              Ha! Ho Ching he de he neng? Leading by example...
              
              "And it's important to continue to do so"
              
              How about those elderly? Those unfortunate enough to live with little or no dignity. That's a minority, right?
              
              "PM Lee said: "In normal times, we get along well together, but when there's a crisis for example, if there's a terrorist attack, then even though we're under pressure, stay together and we don't pull apart."
              
              The enemies have infiltrated and are among us.... They are a terror to behold but no they are not terrorists.
              
              "So as the population becomes more diverse, Singaporeans will have to work harder at keeping social cohesion."
              
              Deal with the rich - poor gap and I guarantee you social cohesion will follow.
              
              "And bit-by-bit, he said, this will keep the Singapore society harmonious."
