              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: The National Kidney Foundation has launched its first major public fundraising campaign in six years. </span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The charity stopped all fundraising activities in 2005 after a scandal involving its then CEO, T T Durai.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Instead of asking 
              for donations to a general fund, the charity wants donors to sponsor the
               cost of an artificial kidney for patients.<br><br>The NKF has seen a 35
               per cent increase in number of patients over the last five years, and 
              it expects to handle more patients when times get tougher. <br><br>The NKF currently has 2,400 patients in its 24 centres and takes in about 300 new patients every year.<br><br>An artificial kidney or dialyser removes waste products and cleans a renal patient's blood during dialysis.<br><br>For 57-year-old Mok Heng Teck, whose kidneys failed 28 years ago, the artificial kidney is a life saver.<br><br>But it doesn't come cheap.<br><br>It
               could cost up to S$1,800 per month to use the machine for 
              non-subsidised patients. Subsidised patients pay up to S$50 per month.<br><br>"We
               have to encourage people to help us. In order for us to sustain our 
              life and our normal activity, we need people to support us in order to 
              pay for the dialyser, because it's very expensive," said Mr Mok. <br><br>The artificial kidney is at the centre of the NKF's new year-long campaign, known as "Be an A.K. Giver". <br><br>The
               campaign is a combination of fundraising and also an attempt to 
              increase public awareness about the importance of an artificial kidney.<br><br>For S$30, you can sponsor the cost of an artificial kidney, which can be used for about a month.<br><br>The
               majority of kidney patients require a new artificial kidney each month,
               while in more severe cases, some patients may require a new artificial 
              kidney everyday.<br><br>NKF CEO Eunice Tay said she understands the 
              public wants to know where and who the donations will go to, and 
              explained that the NKF will be able to provide such details.<br><br>With the bleak economic outlook, NKF said it will be tough getting donations in the year ahead.<br><br>"It
               costs us over S$1 million a week to operate the NKF, and it is indeed 
              going to be a real challenge to keep on having enough funds... So we'll 
              have to keep thinking of how we can help the patients, using the help 
              from the community," said Ms Tay.  <br><br>Some 300 grassroots leaders from the Ang Mo Kio-Hougang constituency are chipping in to help needy patients.<br><br>Member of Parliament for Ang Mo Kio Yeo Guat Kwang has pledged to match their donations dollar-for dollar.<br><br>"I
               think it's also important for me as an adviser to mobilise my 
              grassroots leaders by leading by example... to encourage all our 
              grassroots to do our part so that every resident will also do their 
              part," said Mr Yeo. <br><br>Their donation will benefit patients at the Hougang-Punggol Dialysis Centre.<br><br>The NKF hopes more people will come forward to help.<br><br>- CNA/cc</span></span></p>
