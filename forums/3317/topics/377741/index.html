              <p><strong>France Telecom CFO blames email for staff stress</strong></p>
              <p>NEW YORK - A top executive at France's biggest telecommunications
              company, which is dealing with a spate of suicides, warned that the
              barrage of emails from smartphones and personal computers was stressing
              out employees.</p>
              <p>While France Telecom Chief Financial Officer
              Gervais Pellissier did not directly blame suicides on around-the-clock
              email, he said workers in all big companies are under more pressure in
              the age of the BlackBerry.</p>
              <p>"Today for people working in
              business, whatever the level, whether they are CEO or even first- or
              second-rank level employees, they are always connected," he told
              Reuters in an interview on Thursday.</p>
              <p>France Telecom, which
              operates under the Orange brand, has come under public scrutiny after
              22 workers committed suicide and another 13 attempted to kill
              themselves since the start of 2008.</p>
              <p>Pellissier said some
              employees were clearly feeling a lot of pressure due to the
              privatization of France Telecom, but he added that this was compounded
              by new technologies that cause work to encroach increasingly on
              personal lives.</p>
              <p>"When you were an average employee in a big
              corporation 15 years ago, you had no mobile phone or no PC at home.
              When you were back home, work was out," he said.</p>
              <p>Research in
              Motion's popular BlackBerry has been dubbed CrackBerry in the United
              States, where some users say they are addicted to checking emails.</p>
              <p>Pellissier said such practices may be taking a bigger toll on workers than has been acknowledged by his company or others.</p>
              <p>As
              a result a fragile employee with difficulties would probably have more
              confusion with "more mixture between personal life and professional
              life than in the past."</p>
              <p>"That is probably something we've not
              undertaken, not only at France Telecom but, it's more a global society
              issue, the impact of the new ways of working on personal behavior,"
              Pellissier said.</p>
              <p>He did not say how the balance could be addressed but noted that his company was taking the suicides very seriously.</p>
              <p>France
              Telecom Chief Executive Didier Lombard said earlier this month the
              company was adding surveillance and counseling services as the pace of
              suicides among employees had picked up. One man had stabbed himself in
              the stomach during a staff meeting while a woman threw herself out a
              window.</p>
              <p>Pellissier talked about stress caused by workers
              changing jobs, skills and locations as France Telecom recreates itself
              as a private company from a government agency. More than 15,000 of its
              roughly 102,000 workers had big job changes in the last five years as a
              result of the privatization, he said.</p>
              <p>He said the company would have to do a lot in the coming weeks to help resolve the suicide problem.</p>
              <p>"It's a serious issue. We have to deal with it," he said.</p>
