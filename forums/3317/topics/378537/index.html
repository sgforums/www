              <p class="caption">Hillary Clinton: "Extremists are threatening the authority of the state"</p>
              <p class="caption"> </p>
              <p>   </p>
              <p class="first"><strong>The US secretary of state has said
              that a militant attack on Pakistan's army HQ is evidence of an
              increasing threat against the authority of the state.</strong></p>
              <p class="first"> </p>
              <p class="first"> </p>
              <p>Speaking
              in London, Hillary Clinton said that despite the attack, the US
              remained confident about Pakistan's control over its nuclear weapons.</p>
              <p>The attack, which began on Saturday and turned into a siege, ended hours ago after hostages were released.</p>
              <p>Correspondents say the attack is highly embarrassing for Pakistan's leaders.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>"Yesterday
              was another reminder that extremists ... are increasingly threatening
              the authority of the state, but we see no evidence they are going to
              take over the state," Mrs Clinton said.</p>
              <p>"We have confidence in the Pakistani government and military's control over its nuclear weapons," she added.</p>
              <p>UK
              Foreign Secretary David Miliband said Pakistan faced a "mortal threat",
              but there was no risk of its nuclear weapons falling into terrorist
              hands.</p>
              <p>The two officials also stressed other shared aspects of foreign policy:</p>
              <ul class="bulletList">
              <li>Mrs
              Clinton warned that the international community would not wait
              "indefinitely" for Tehran to meet its obligations on its nuclear
              programme, while Mr Miliband said Iran would never have a better
              opportunity to establish normal ties with the rest of the world </li>
              <li>The
              US secretary of state said Washington was committed to implementation
              of the Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland and a "lasting peace
              that brings the benefits of peace to the people". She said Republican
              dissidents were "out of step" with the peace process </li>
              <li>Mrs
              Clinton said that their joint resolve in the fight against the Taliban
              was "strong and clear", and that they were determined to work with the
              new Afghan government</li>
              </ul>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Major operation</strong></p>
              <p>On Sunday morning Pakistani security forces freed more than 40 hostages held at the base, in the city of Rawalpindi.</p>
              <p>Military
              officials said three hostages and two soldiers died in the operation
              along with at least four militants. Four militants and six soldiers
              died in the initial attack.</p>
              <p>The sound of blasts and gunfire rang out as Pakistani special forces entered the compound for the pre-dawn raid.</p>
              <p>Army spokesman Maj Gen Athar Abbas said the forces had met resistance in what he described as a "very skilled" operation.</p>
              <p>They found the hostages being held in a room "with a terrorist who was wearing a suicide jacket", he said.</p>
              <p>Gen Abbas said the commandos had "acted promptly" and shot the suspected hostage taker "before he could pull the trigger".</p>
              <p>The
              attack came as the army was preparing for a major operation against the
              Taliban, which officials say have claimed responsibility.</p>
              <p>The Taliban had been threatening to carry out attacks unless operations against it were stopped.</p>
