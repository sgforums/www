              <p>Dear expats, here’s a word of caution when you hit the dance clubs — steer clear of girls and drinks together.</p>
              <p>Lawyers <em>The New Paper </em>on Sunday spoke to say they have 
              spotted some surprising similarities in a series of outrage of modesty 
              cases they have handled in the past year.</p>
              <p>The story is usually the same. Mr Expat goes clubbing, gets drunk and
               accepts the advances of women who snuggle up to them on the dance 
              floor. Not long after, he is confronted by a group of men accusing him 
              of molestation (or molest in local lingo). And because Mr Expat is too 
              drunk to recall details, he chooses to compensate the woman rather than 
              fight it out in court.</p>
              <p>There were 96 cases of outrage of modesty reported in nightspots island-wide last year and 108 cases the year before.</p>
              <p>The seeming trend of club-goers attempting to make a quick buck out of expats here is beginning to worry lawyers.</p>
              <p>“By targeting expats, the chances of getting money from them are high
               as they can’t afford to get into trouble with the law,” said lawyer 
              Chia Boon Teck, a partner at <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=Chia+Wong+LLP&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">Chia Wong LLP</a>. “Sometimes, they would even be willing to pay on the spot.”</p>
              <p>“Some of them have to travel frequently for work and may not want 
              their cases to drag or their passports to be taken away. They do have a 
              great urgency to settle the cases.”</p>
              <p>Last year, Mr Chia handled three such cases involving foreigners, two
               of whom hold high positions in multinational companies (MNCs). Police 
              reports were made in all three cases.</p>
              <p>Two paid S$5,000 and S$8,000 respectively to the alleged victims. The
               third refused to pay and was prepared to go to trial, where the case 
              was later dropped.</p>
              <p>“All three cases are fairly similar,” explained Mr Chia. “They took 
              place on the dance floor. There was no befriending prior to the 
              allegations. It was very straightforward — ‘I was on the dance floor and
               he molested me’.”</p>
              <p>“These women would come forward and say that they can tell the difference between an accidental touch and molest.”</p>
              <p>“If they claim trial and the men go to court and tell the judge that 
              they were too drunk to remember what happened, the women’s side of the 
              story would be unchallenged.”</p>
              <p>“Unless (the women) are caught telling lies on the witness stand, the
               judge would have little choice but to accept their side of the story.”</p>
              <p>Mr Chia added that one can even be caned or jailed in the worst-case 
              scenario of an aggravated form of molest involving the breasts and 
              private parts.</p>
              <p>“Don’t go alone. Make sure that there is at least someone sober to be a witness,” advised Mr Chia.</p>
              <p>While ruling out the idea of organised scams, lawyer Steven Lam of <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=JTJB+LLP&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">JTJB LLP</a>, too, warns men to be wary when they drink.</p>
              <p>One of the cases he handled last year involved a high-profile foreign
               businessman who was drinking with his associates when they were joined 
              by a group of young men and girls. He was later confronted and accused 
              of a crime he couldn’t remember if he committed. One of the men then 
              proposed to settle the case for S$10,000, which the expat did, on top of
               some alcohol for the whole group.</p>
              <p>The lawyers said they can never be sure about such cases, however.</p>
              <p>Said lawyer Amolat Singh from <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=Amolat+and+Partners&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">Amolat and Partners</a>,
               “Maybe these expats tend to take greater liberties as they are in a 
              club and they might have been misinformed or have a misconception about 
              women here as compared to those back home.</p>
              <p>“Maybe the women are really victims.”</p>
              <p>For a woman to scream molest, she does not need many witnesses, said a bouncer who wanted to be known only as Yusz.</p>
              <p>“The dance floor is too packed, and even if we play back the CCTV 
              footage, we may not be able to see much on camera,” said Yusz, 33, who 
              used to head the security unit of a chain of 14 clubs here. He usually 
              got about five or six cases of molest reported from the 14 clubs every 
              month.</p>
              <p>Said Mr Dennis Foo, chief executive officer of <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=St+James+Holdings&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">St James Holdings</a>,
               “Today’s women…know their rights and the law. Even though they may seem
               very liberal on the dance floor, that doesn’t mean that men can take 
              advantage of them easily.”</p>
              <p>“If you don’t want to be accused of molest, don’t get drunk,” agreed 
              Miss Deborah Dayani, a 25-year-old public relations consultant who 
              parties twice a month. “And keep your hands to yourself.”</p>
              <p>She noted that some local women, who “literally dirty-dance with the <em>ang mohs</em> (Caucasians)”, are sometimes responsible for sending out wrong signals too.</p>
              <p>While ‘touch and pay’ may seem like the easiest option for most 
              expats, Mr Paulo Filvino Assis Brito, 27, prefers relying on the law.</p>
              <p>Said the Portugal national who has been working here as an IT analyst
               in a French bank for three years: “It’s normal to be rubbing against 
              one another on the dance floor. If a woman is sticking so closely to me 
              and I touch her butt, that is normal.”</p>
              <p>“If she wants to make a police report, I would tell her to go ahead.”</p>
