              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said Singapore must 
              find workable solutions to keep its society vibrant and forward-looking,
               maintain its economic vitality and strengthen the Singapore core, as it
               faces the challenge of population growth.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>In his 2012 New Year message on Saturday, Mr Lee described population as a "particularly complex and critical challenge".</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Mr Lee said the 
              country needs to balance the conflicting factors, make judicious 
              compromises and accept the unavoidable trade-offs. <br><br>He highlighted the conflicting factors that have to be considered:<br><br>Singaporeans
               need to have enough children to replace themselves, yet getting married
               and having children are ultimately personal decisions. <br><br>A 
              vibrant economy needs enough workers and talent, yet it runs into 
              physical and social constraints if it admits too many foreign workers 
              too quickly.<br><br>Diversity enriches society, provided the new arrivals adopt Singapore's values and culture.<br><br>Mr
               Lee said the government is tightening the inflow of foreign workers to a
               more sustainable rate but companies are already feeling the pinch, 
              especially small and medium enterprises.<br><br>He said individual Singaporeans will feel it too because many foreign workers do jobs that serve citizens.<br><br>Mr Lee said admitting fewer foreign workers also means forgoing business opportunities and accepting slower growth. <br><br>He said the government must do its utmost to raise productivity, to make up in quality what it will miss in quantity. <br><br>The
               prime minister said these population issues affect all Singaporeans, 
              and will be discussed over the next year to understand better what's at 
              stake and what choices have to be made as a nation.<br><br>Mr Lee said 
              how Singaporeans manage the difficult trade-offs, like the population 
              issue, reflects the strength of the community. <br><br>He said as the nation matures, its society is increasingly diverse and the public debate has become more open and robust.<br><br>Mr
               Lee said just as important is how well its people relate to one another
               in a shared home - not only in good times when there are fewer 
              frictions and it is easier to get along, but also when they encounter 
              tough issues and when passions run high and different points of view 
              have to be bridged.<br><br>- CNA/fa</span></span></p>

              <p>When Singapore was rapidly growing and developing, with construction here and there, it was discovered that the saplings planted to replace the trees that are cleared will  not grow fast enough.</p>
              <p>So the trees that were supposed to be cleared, had their branches trimmed, and the trunk with roots dug out, and the whole torso replanted at site. These stubs then regrow rapidly. It was dubbed "instant trees".</p>

              <p><strong>Measures concerning population need to be discussed comprehensively: PM Lee</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Speaking to the media at the annual Chinatown 
              lightup, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said the government will need to
               discuss measures concerning population from a comprehensive point of 
              view.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>In his 2012 New Year message on December 31, Mr Lee had described population as a "particularly complex and critical challenge".</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>He was asked by 
              reporters if the government will be doing more to grow the population 
              this year, as it will soon be the year of dragon.<br><br>Mr Lee said: 
              "It's a dragon year so I hope they will be a few more babies, maybe more
               than a few more. I don't think we have reached the point of specific 
              extra measures yet but it is an issue which we would have to discuss 
              from a comprehensive point of view.<br><br>"(It is) not just about how 
              many babies Singaporeans are having but also our population, the trends,
               our economy, ageing, space, all the different factors which we have to 
              take into account when we talk about population. It is something that we
               would like to talk about this year."<br><br>On the upcoming budget to 
              help Singaporeans deal with high inflation, Mr Lee said the Grow and 
              Share package at last year's budget has given some significant help.<br><br>He added that the government will have to see how things are for this year's budget.<br><br>When asked about the report on the review of ministerial salaries, Mr Lee said that he is studying the report.<br><br>- CNA/fa</span></span></p>

              <p>I don't understand. How Mr Lee is able to relate the growth in foreign workers to growing the economy? Is Singapore planning to become a low tech manufacturing orientated country or high knowledge based economy? Because I see a lot of the so-called foreign talent imported are low skilled. If Singapore plans to compete with China on manufacturing then ultimately Singapore will lose out. Singapore has got to differentiate itself from the rest of its competitors and this means moving away from low-skilled based economy.</p>
              <p>Importing too many foreign workers will also hurt the singaporean economy because when there is a downturn, the government is unable to send back all the foreign workers causing a glut in the supply of jobs.</p>
