              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: According to the Consumer Confidence Index of global 
              marketing research firm Nielsen, consumers are more optimistic about 
              personal finances and job prospects - and are out shopping and enjoying 
              themselves. </span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Globally, Singapore 
              ranks 15th on consumer confidence, behind Malaysia in ninth place and 
              Indonesia in second spot. India is in the top spot. </span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The mood to spend 
              appeared to be reflected in the Nielsen survey, which found that 
              Singaporeans feel upbeat about their finances. <br><br>Consumers whom Channel NewsAsia spoke to did not seem to be hit hard by inflation and did not intend to cut back on spending. <br><br>Consumer confidence rebounded to its highest level in over 12 months. <br><br>For next 12 months, more than half of those polled see their personal finances as good, even excellent. <br><br>The Consumer Confidence Index for Singapore rose 4 points to 98, up from 94 in Q2. <br><br>There
               is also an upswing in the number who are are planning to invest in 
              stocks and shares, or say it is a good time to buy what they want or 
              need. <br><br>"Property prices continue to rise, be it residential or 
              non-residential. Retail sales have also gone up in the last quarter," 
              explained Ms Joan Koh, the managing director of Nielsen in Singapore and
               Malaysia. <br><br>"And perhaps there have been less of negative news coming from Europe which could actually make consumers (feel) more settled." <br><br>The poll was conducted in August and September. <br><br>A seasonal bias may be possible, as people gear up for the year-end splurge, especially for holidays. <br><br>Inflation remains high and is likely to persist into next year. <br><br>But economists say the tight labour market is helping to keep salaries up and prices affordable for now. <br><br>"With
               such a low unemployment rate, companies are trying to commensurately 
              keep their staff. So if prices go up, salaries - if they go up 
              commensurately, people feel they can still afford," said Ms Annie Koh, 
              dean of executive education at Singapore Management University. <br><br>"My
               bigger concerns might be if inflation costs keep going up, then wage 
              costs catch up with it. So people may have to make a decision on which 
              part of their money earned will go to where. Their sentiments to spend 
              would be to move to cheaper options. That's how people manage inflation 
              domestically." <br><br>- CNA/ck</span></span></p>
