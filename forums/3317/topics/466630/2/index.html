              <p>Their policemen killed were actually police commando leh.....their crack unit.</p>
              <p>I won't say their forces suck or anything.</p>
              <p>1. Its disrespectful to the deceased.</p>
              <p>2. I have never been ambushed before. Best I do not comment unlike others who call them incompetent. Refer back to point 1.</p>
              <p>Lastly, I think people dont realise that whacking them immediately with APC is not an easy decision to come to.</p>
              <p>M'sia just brokered a deal with the Moros and Pinoy govt. To whack the Moros who came from the troublesome region immediately after that = LPPL.</p>
              <p>In fact, its probably this reason that led to these events in the first place. The guerillas know they would be given time to prepare at Sabah after announcing their presence.</p>

              <p style="font-size: 14px; color: #333333; margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 21px; font-family: Arial;">If such a precedent was to be set, then Singapore should be returned to Johor and Penang to Kedah, he said.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px; color: #333333; margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 21px; font-family: Arial;">“Their (Sulu Sultanate's) claims are difficult to come to terms with as what has been accepted for such a long time cannot be changed,” he added.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px; color: #333333; margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 21px; font-family: Arial;">“Even if the matter is taken to the International Court, Malaysia would have a better chance of winning as Sabah had been part of the country for a long time.”</p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px; color: #333333; margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 21px; font-family: Arial;">Prof Khoo said that although the state was originally part of Sulu, the British North Borneo Company had taken control of North Borneo, now known as Sabah, in 1882.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px; color: #333333; margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 21px; font-family: Arial;">He said transmigration of Filipinos into Sabah had been ongoing as they felt they belonged to this part of the region although the Malaysian authorities regarded them as illegal immigrants.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px; color: #333333; margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 21px; font-family: Arial;">“I am surprised why they resorted to arms this time around,” he said.</p>

              <p style="font-size: 14px; color: #333333; margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 21px; font-family: Arial;">“We have inherited agreements made in the past,” he said, adding that social media users and the Opposition in both Malaysia and the Philippines appeared to be provoking the situation in Sabah.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px; color: #333333; margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 21px; font-family: Arial;">“They appear to be politicising the situation to discredit the governments of the two countries,” he said, adding that the people should reject those who put politics before national sovereignty and security.</p>

              <p style="font-size: 14px; color: #333333; margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 21px; font-family: Arial;">He cited the Cobbold Commission 1963 findings that the majority of Sabahans agreed for their state to be part of the Federation of Malaysia.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px; color: #333333; margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 21px; font-family: Arial;">(The commission, headed by former <span class="knx-annotation"><a style="color: #003399;" rel="foaf:homepage" href="http://archives.thestar.com.my/search/?q=Bank%20of%20England">Bank of England</a></span> <span class="knx-annotation"><a style="color: #003399;" rel="foaf:homepage" href="http://archives.thestar.com.my/search/?q=Lord%20Cobbold">governor Lord Cobbold</a></span>, was also responsible for the drafting of the Federal Constitution prior to the formation of Malaysia).</p>

              <p>simple. since now happen i think the My military should have full authority to execute  military action in full swing and restore peace and lives of the locals back  to before.</p>
              <p>from nwo on the My navy hasto step in. since likely that frsh rebels may be coming in via sea, the navy smaller cruisers and ships can help patrol and take down and sink any enemies in sight. more regular fighter plane patrols with wider radar coverage can definitely deter them. if they are too small to be detected, i think combat helicopters can be deployed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>All along the coast guards and solders should be deployed, and given orders shoot to kill.</p>
              <p>the villagers there should all be informed and to report any strangers or suspecious people likely rebels. dont tell me their house got no phones? give them a hot line. a heavily guarded HQ control and hotline section should be set up, with help form the local or nearest radio transmitting stations if need to.</p>
              <p>since now the existing ah gua rebels blended in, the My military should deploy non-uniformed spies into the villagers. they will gather information and sniff out suspected rebels cellsa nd hide out.</p>
              <p>LAST AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, THE AIM IS TO STOP FRESH REBELS POSSIBLY COMING IN. AND TO CUT OFF ALL MEANS AND LINE SOF WEAPONS AMMO EQUIPMENT SUPPLIES, REINFORCEMENTS FROM REBELS GROUPS THAT MIGHT BE PLANNED TO LAND OR HAVE BEEN SEPARATED..</p>

              <p>Malaysia police have paramilitary type.. like sg, our paramilitary will be the Gurkhas, police but train as a soldier... and most country law, need special excutive orders to mobilize the military including sg..so unleashing the military in public may also pose other serious consequences... so the gov maybe reluctant at first...</p>
              <p>eg in US, the regular army and the national guards... they have a law, that the regular cannot be deployed in their home country only their national can be delpoyed in homeland..</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think these filipino terrorists have planned this intrusion for a long time. They probably have setup bases in different areas within Sabah prior to their intrusion within Sabah and probably outside Sabah like near the border between Sabah and Kalimantan in Indonesia. I think their plans were to instigate some of the filipinos living within Sabah which estimated around 800,000 and secondly making them as their 'sparrows' or spies. They probably trying to make the issue like in Mindanao. The worse scenario I can anticipate from the further actions of these terrorists is that they would try to make the population of Sabah frighten and instill fears to the general public. I think the probabilities of these filipino terrorists of using bombs or suicide bombers in the town areas to create more terror is quite inevitable. The Malaysian government should seek co-operation with the Indonesian government assistance too to prevent these filipino terrorists from setting up bases within their territory near Sabah and Sarawak border. I won't rule out the involvement of filipino communist insurgents too. It seems like the typical way of the communist infiltration besides terrorism.</div>

              Not civil war but they are trying to create civil unrest and lastly trying to destroy the credibilities of the Malaysian government peace brokerage in Mindanao which would be finalised in April this year.....probably the filipino communists propaganda too at work here.

I've visited Kota Kinabalu once in 2010 and it reminded me of the time when Singapore was 30 and 40 years ago. I've a friend who is living in Lahad Datu, who is working as a Librarian in the National Library there. I didn't know she has married a year ago until I call her last week to see whether she is ok there and her kampung is safe. Well, I'm glad when she said that she and her husband are doing fine and well. The situation there are under control. I told her to take care and to be careful.</div>

              <p>who at m,alaysia sabah allow those illegals to massther?</p>
              <p>and why have situation there beenlike that for many years and no one bothers to do something to it? national guard lah what lah this lah that lah, unless you have navies and airpower (like combat helicopters and jets), what use is the national guard? even in keeping the palce peace.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the diffecne is they have a gun and th animals in cage have no guns. but when the animals becum humans that carries gun, then the national guars seems like seesee girls already up foir a match.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>advice to the MY gahmena nd army very simple, and they can keep it very simple.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>due to political shift in philipines, some of they baron/jarl/militant groups/ lesser criminal groups/extremist/ had decided to shift their base illegally to sabah due to excuses of claims and geographical locatiom. MY made a mistake ina llow many of their people illegals to also mass there.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>now the military action must press on. that sabah land do not belong to the philipines, and the people tehreare illegals, armed people in unifomr or not entering the couuntry are considerd extremist, terrorist. invaders. they have to get off the island say sorry internationally, or die figting to the alst man. no international court case needed. unless philipines givernemnt represent them. any way either case they have to boot out of teh island, amred and illegals both types.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>WHAT'S TAKING THE MY ARMY AND GAHMEN SOLONG TO SETTLE THIS CASE? NO ONE WILL SAY THEY ARE BAD IF THEY START A MASSIVE ASSAULT AND KILL ALL THE INVADERS ON BAORD AND ROUND UP ALL THE ILLEGASL AND ASK THE PHILIPINES TO PAY FOR THEIR AIR OR SEA FARE HOMW. WHAT A GOOD CHANCE NOW FOR THE MY PM TO DO THINGS RIGHT AT SABAH ONCE AND FOR ALL NOW!</p>

(<a style="color: #e76229;" title="raja muda escapes arrest" href="http://www.rappler.com/nation/23536-raja-muda-escapes-arrest-sabah">Read: Raja Muda escapes arrest</a>)</p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;"> </p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;"><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">After the botched Merdeka plan, Musa retired from the military. It's unclear what he did for a living in the succeeding years. Somewhere in between, he became the deputy chief of staff of the RSF.</span></p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">Simunul Mayor Nazif Ahmad Abdurahman said Musa lived a retiree’s life. He would farm every now and then and was often seen buying fish from the port on early mornings. Musa’s wife, Aurelia, is the principal of Simunul Elementary School.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">Musa’s home, a tattered wooden abode with a run-down car parked in a makeshift garage, is located by the side of the RSF camp in Simunul. <span style="line-height: 1.3em;">From his house, he would have a good view of the entire camp, especially the meeting area where RSF members held regular meetings before the standoff.</span></p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">Ibnohasim Akmad, an RSF member from Sulu, said Musa is their more visible leader, not Raja Muda.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">Akmad, who was left behind when the group went to Sabah, said that during his one-month stay before the Sabah standoff, Raja Muda – who lives in Barangay Tubig Indangan, a kilometer away from the camp -- only visited their camp "sometimes."</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">It was Musa, Akmad said, who taught them about “military rules.”</span></strong></p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">“He just taught us certain formation then we were briefed about rules and regulations about the military, how to do it as military, how to follow military laws,” Akmad said.</span></strong></p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">Akmad refused to provide details of their “trainings," but denied these included firing guns.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;"><strong>He said goodbye</strong></p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">Musa’s wife, Aurelia, said he told her about their plan before the group left for Sabah.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">“The truth is, he said goodbye. Even if I didn’t want him to go, I can’t do anything about it,” she said in Filipino over the phone.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;"><span class="easy_img_caption" style="line-height: 0.5; width: auto !important; font-size: 12px !important; display: inline-block; vertical-align: top; background-color: #f2f2f2; text-align: center; max-width: 640px; margin: 10px; min-width: auto !important; min-height: auto !important;"><img class="thinglinkFetching" style="max-width: 100%; vertical-align: middle; display: block; margin: 0px; background-color: #404042; height: auto !important; width: auto !important;" title="COMMANDER'S HOME.

Aurelia said Musa had gone to Sabah twice this year to visit his siblings in Lahad Datu.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">At the height of the second Malaysian assault on Lahad Datu on March 5, a police official told us: “<em>Kapag si Musa ang nawala o nahuli, wala na, dun na mabubuwag iyan</em>, (If Musa dies or is captured, that’s when the forces will be defeated)."</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">A few hours after, the <a style="color: #e76229;" href="http://www.rappler.com/nation/23275-kirams-ceasefire-in-sabah-malaysia">Kiram family declared a ceasefire</a> – an appeal that <a style="color: #e76229;" href="http://www.rappler.com/nation/23295-malaysia-rejects-ceasefire,-demands-surrender">Malaysia rejected</a>.</p>

              <p style="color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">When news broke about the Jabidah massacre on Corregidor Island in 1968, Sambas’ father, a former barangay chairman for 20 years, quickly travelled from Tawi-Tawi to Manila to fetch his son from Fort Bonifacio.They returned to their home in Barangay Manuk Mangkaw on Simunul Island.</p>

              <p style="color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">After Sambas left Fort Bonifacio, he was never able to do what he has always aspired for – to become a soldier again.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">A framed certificate that shows Sambas had completed his initial Jabidah military training course hangs on the wall of Sambas' house. Aurelia said his husband served as 2<sup style="position: relative; font-size: 11px; line-height: 0; vertical-align: baseline; top: -0.5em;">nd</sup> lieutenant of the Jabidah commando unit.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">"Under the Crescent Moon" tells Sambas' story as the first Jabidah recruit to be commissioned officer by the Army. "[Sambas] remembers that day in 1967 when he saw [then Maj Eduardo] Martelino's recruits jogging on the rugged streets of Simunul. 'They looked like they were having fun.' One morning, Martelino passed by Sambas' house, looking for the latter's father who was then a municipal official. Martelino ended up talking with Sambas who signified his interest in joining the troops he saw."</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">"It didn't take much on Martelino's part to lure Sambas into joining the Sabah mission. Sambas claimed they were told early on about this plan even while they were still in the training camp in Simunul. He was thrilled by the prospect of becoming a soldier and joining an elite mission at that. In August 1967, Sambas joined Martelino's men in their combat training at Camp Sophia, which overlooked the sea."</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">Sambas lived his post-Jabidah life hoping that he could one day return to the army.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">Promises were made but none pulled through, including one by the late Brig. Gen. Eduardo Batalla, then commander of the Philippine Constabulary in Western Mindanao, whom Sambas’ wife said was his contemporary in the military.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;"><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">Battalla had supposedly said he would help Sambas return to the military once he became a general. Batalla had reason to make such a promise; he, too, was one of the young officers assigned to train the Muslim recruits on Corregidor Island, according to the book.</span></p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;"><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">But Batalla was slain in Zamboanga City i</span>n a 1989 botched operation against gang leader Rizal Ali.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">“He became frustrated and disappointed. He suffered from low self-esteem,” Sambas' wife told us.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">Sambas spent most of time at home and was never able to get a decent job. None of his 3 kids were able to finish schooling.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;"><strong><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">Failed dreams</span></strong></p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">At 64, Sambas still held on to his dream of going back to service, and his wife continues to question why none of those who said they would help him ever got back to them.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">Unlike Musa, Sambas did not tell his wife that he was going to Sabah. Aurelia said Sambas quietly and hurriedly packed his things on the day of February 14.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">“I asked him where he was going but we couldn’t talk to him. He wasn’t answering,” she said.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;"> </p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">She only learned about the Sabah standoff after watching TV news, the main source of information for Simunul residents. The family was able to contact Sambas during the first two days of their stay in Sabah.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">But they have not heard from him since.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">Would Musa and Sambas repeat history and live to tell another Sabah story? </p>
