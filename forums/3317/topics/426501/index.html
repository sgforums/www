              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Home Affairs and Law Minister K Shanmugam said 
              Singapore will need to constantly leverage on science and technology to 
              enhance operational capabilities in homeland security.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>One way is to work 
              with youths and tertiary institutions to get them to take "a serious 
              role" in helping to make Singapore safe against security threats.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>A group of 
              polytechnic and university students have topped the Novel Automobile 
              Barrier Challenge, which was first launched in September last year. They
               beat 26 other entries to emerge as the top three winners.<br><br>The 
              challenge requires participants to come up with a kind of barrier that 
              will effectively stop a moving vehicle travelling at 60 kilometres per 
              hour, from crashing into a building or a facility.<br><br>It is 
              understood that this is the first time that the Home Affairs Ministry 
              has organised such a challenge with a tertiary institution and it said 
              it is the first of many to come.<br><br>The winning team from the 
              National University of Singapore walked away with a cash prize of 
              S$8,000. One of the team members, Mr Tan Chun Liang, who is a PhD 
              student from the School of Design and Environment, explains how the 
              barrier works.<br><br>Mr Tan said: "The design is extremely portable, 
              and we actually designed it so it does not look like a barrier...car 
              hits metal, metal hits ground and ground hits spike. Car stops."<br><br>Some of the other ideas received may also be adopted by the ministry but feasibility studies will still need to be conducted.<br><br>Dr
               Lee Fook Kay, Chief Science and Technology Officer with the Home 
              Affairs Ministry, said: "We have barriers but a lot of the barriers are 
              fixtures that we put in the building. Those which are more portable are 
              not so effective, so that's why we are reaching out to the students to 
              see whether they can come up with good solutions. And I think students 
              also tend to look at the economical way of looking at the problem. So 
              they may not be very expensive solutions but they work.<br><br>"If you 
              look at events, people do put barricades but some of these are pretty 
              heavy to transport and they are quite a burden. So the ideas that the 
              students have come up with are really very novel. They are deployable 
              and very portable. Students tend to really think out of the box."<br><br>A
               Memorandum of Understanding with NUS is also on the cards to facilitate
               sharing of information and ideas in science and technology.<br><br>Mr 
              Shanmugam said: "MHA aims to stay ahead of evolving security threats, 
              and ensure that the Home Team is always prepared in the face of an 
              ever-changing security environment. A strong partnership with our 
              educational institutions facilitates capability, expertise development 
              and promotes mutual interest."<br><br>Mr Shanmugam added that such partnerships will take Singapore's homeland security capabilities to the next level.<br><br>-CNA/ac</span></span></p>
