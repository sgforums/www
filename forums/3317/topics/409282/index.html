              <p>HEMP..............better known as Marijuana..............used to be given out as a medicine..............</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif; font-size: small;">Marijuana is a great danger to the oil, alcohol, tobacco industries, chemical and pharmaceutical companies. They have suppressed the truth from 
                                                    the people. If marijuana was utilized for its vast 
                                                    array of commercial products, it would ruin their companies.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif; font-size: small;">###  Henry Ford’s 
                                                    first Model-T was built to RUN ON HEMP FUEL and the car itself 
                                                    was CONSTRUCTED FROM HEMP !!! On his large estate, Ford was photographed 
                                                    among his hemp fields. The car 
                                                    had hemp plastic panels whose impact strength was 10 TIMES STRONGER THAN STEEL!!!</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif; font-size: small;">The facts cited here, are verifiable in the <em>Encyclopedia Britannica</em> which was printed on hemp paper for 150 years :</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif; font-size: small;">1) All schoolbooks 
                                                    were made from hemp or flax paper.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif; font-size: small;">2) It was legal 
                                                    to pay taxes with hemp in America from 1631 until the early 1800s.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif; font-size: small;">3) Refusing 
                                                    to grow hemp in America during the 17th and 18th centuries was against 
                                                    the law!</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif; font-size: small;">4) George Washington, 
                                                    Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin and other founding fathers grew hemp.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif; font-size: small;">5) For thousands 
                                                    of years, 90% of ships’ sails and rope were made of hemp. 
                                                    The word ‘canvas’ is Dutch for cannabis. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif; font-size: small;">6) 80% of all 
                                                    textiles, fabrics, clothes, linen, drapes, bed sheets, etc., were 
                                                    made from hemp until the 1820s.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif; font-size: small;">7) The first 
                                                    crop grown in many states was hemp. Hemp was the largest cash crop until the 
                                                    20th century.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif; font-size: small;">8) In 1916, 
                                                    the U.S. Government predicted that by the 1940s all paper would 
                                                    come from hemp. Since 1 acre of hemp equals 4.1 acres of trees, plans 
                                                    were in the works to implement such programs.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif; font-size: small;">9) Quality 
                                                    paints and varnishes were made from hemp seed oil until 1937.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif; font-size: small;">10) In 1938, 
                                                    hemp was called ‘Billion-Dollar Crop.’ the first 
                                                    time a cash crop had business potential to exceed a billion dollars.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif; font-size: small;">11) <em>Mechanical 
                                                    Engineering Magazine</em> (Feb. 1938) published an article entitled 
                                                    ‘The Most Profitable and Desirable Crop that Can be Grown.’ 
                                                    It stated that if hemp would be the single largest agricultural crop in the U.S. and the world.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif; font-size: small;">12) US Department of 
                                                    Agriculture in 1942 encouraged 
                                                    ‘patriotic American farmers’ to grow 350,000 acres of 
                                                    hemp each year for the war effort.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif; font-size: small;">From <em>Popular 
                                                    Mechanics</em>, February 1938:</span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif; font-size: small;">“It 
                                                      has a short growing season and can be grown in any state… Hemp can add immeasurably to American agriculture and industry.” </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif; font-size: small;">In the 1930s, innovations in farm machinery would have caused 
                                                      an industrial revolution when applied to hemp. This single resource 
                                                      could have created millions of new jobs generating thousands of 
                                                      quality products. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif; font-size: small;">Hemp, if not made illegal, would have brought 
                                                      America out of the Great Depression.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif; font-size: small;">*** The Hearst Paper Manufacturing Division owned vast acreage of timberlands. The Hearst Company supplied 
                            most of the paper products and stood to lose billions because 
                            of hemp.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif; font-size: small;">*** In 1937, DuPont 
                            patented the processes to make plastics from oil and coal. Synthetics such as plastics, cellophane, celluloid, methanol, 
                            nylon, rayon, Dacron, etc., could now be made from oil. Natural 
                            hemp industrialization would have ruined DuPont.</span></p>

              <p>Anyways the reasons or should I say , "conspiracies"  and policies aside.. I fast forward to why the world is looking at decriminlisation now. And the reason is simple.</p>
              <p>It's about how criminalisation is something other than a largely futile, vastly wasteful, 
              destructively counter-productive wallow in wilful ignorance which future
               generations will look back on in slack-jawed disbelief.</p>
              <p>When we look back at those that have been criminalised, or sent to the gallows...  I wonder is that also why morality is on a decline.</p>
              <p>Now imagine decriminlisation.. and u have hectares of land. ooooh yeah...</p>
