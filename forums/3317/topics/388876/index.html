              <h1>Local education consultancy offers foreign students “100% admission into government schools”</h1>
              <p><span class="time">January 22, 2010</span></p>
              <p><strong>Written by Our Correspondent</strong></p>
              <p>A local education consultancy in Singapore has put up a banner in a HDB estate claiming that it will be able to secure foreign students “100% admission in government schools”:</p>
              <p>In an email circulated to prospective clients, the company added that it will be able to increase their clients’ chances of gaining entry into their preferred schools without elaborating more on it:</p>
              <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21222" title="educationforeignermsg" src="http://www.temasekreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/educationforeignermsg.jpg" alt="educationforeignermsg" width="560" height="277"></p>
              <p>Please refer to website for the above: - <a href="http://www.temasekreview.com/2010/01/22/local-education-consultancy-offers-foreign-students-100-admission-into-government-schools/">http://www.temasekreview.com/2010/01/22/local-education-consultancy-offers-foreign-students-100-admission-into-government-schools/</a></p>
              <p>It also regurgitated blindly the pro-foreigner policies of the ruling party:</p>
              <p><em>“The Singapore government is encouraging foreign talents to Singapore. In recent years, Singapore has a great influx of foreigners These foreigners are working here and are fast becoming PRs and citizens of Singapore.”</em></p>
              <p>It is not revealed if some of its clients are “peidu mamas” from China – an euphemism for China women who are divorced or estranged from their husbands and brought their children to further their studies in Singapore.</p>
              <p>As most are not allowed to work legally in Singapore, many end up in the vice trade or as mistresses of Singapore men to support their children education.</p>
              <p>How these women can be classified as “talent” is anybody’s guess, but according to the ruling party’s lax definition, anybody from China is considered a “talent”, be it masseurs, construction workers, cleaners and even prostitutes.</p>
              <p>Education Minister Dr Ng Eng Hen told Parliament lately that 10 per cent of the enrollment in Singapore primary schools are PRs.</p>
              <p>If foreigners are included, the figure is probably much higher.</p>
              <p>The issue of Singapore citizens competing with PRs and foreigners for limited places in primary schools especially the good ones is fast becoming a sore point among Singaporeans who feel they are not getting a good deal from the ruling party.</p>
              <p>Stung by increasing frustration, resentment and anger from the middle and upper classes of voters whom they cannot afford to alienate, the ruling party made some cosmetic changes to its lop-sided education policy this year.</p>
              <p>Singapore citizens are now entitled to one more ballot than PRs who now have to pay higher school fees for their primary and secondary school educations.</p>
              <p>However, many Singaporeans remain skeptical about the measures taken which were criticized as being “superficial” and “inadequate”.</p>
              <p>The additional ballot granted to citizens will be diluted in the face of the relentless influx of foreigners, many of whom are bringing their entire families to Singapore.</p>
              <p>It will serve no more than an incentive for PRs to join grassroots organizations to boost their chances of getting a place in the school of their choice for their children.</p>
              <p>Despite the rising chorus of protests from the ground, the ruling party continues to insist that immigrants are “essential” for Singapore.</p>
              <p>Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong made a half-hearted attempt to placate Singaporeans by promising to “slow” the intake of foreigners instead of reversing it.</p>
              <p>At the rate foreigners are allowed to flood the island, Singaporeans may soon find themselves in the minority in Singapore public schools which are supposedly funded by taxpayers for citizens only.</p>

              <p>One thing nobody here seems to question is this: local parents need to ballot for vacancies in schools, so HOW is it possible for this education agency to offer a 100% guarantee for vacancies for the foreign children.</p>
              <p>Either they are lying about their 100% guaranteed places, or they are given a quota of reserved vacancies for the foreign children.</p>

              <p>“Amazing how this kind of mindset has spread even within our own Citizens. Making money without consideration of the “effects” to their own “Blood”. See, this is how, the PAPe teaches you…its OK to be a Traitor.”</p>
              <p>Its ok – with the spurs in our “hides” – we HAVE to become MORE hard-driving and hard-striving.</p>
              <p>Loyalty? Moral values? seriously… who cares about there?</p>
              <p>Being the HARD-DRIVING and HARD-STRIVING Singaporean – I will learn from these foreigners and do whatever it takes (i.e. refuse to get out of the bus, protest outside MOE, etc…..) to get what I WANT – at ALL cost – even to the extent of betraying Singapore.</p>
              <p>This is afterall, what the LKY wanted from us right?</p>

              <p>“…“peidu mamas” from China – an euphemism for China women who are divorced or estranged from their husbands and brought their children to further their studies in Singapore.</p>
              <p>…many end up in the vice trade or as mistresses of Singapore men to support their children education…”</p>
              <p>Considered to be very hard striving and hard driving – something which our leaders would want us to follow.</p>

              <p>Yes 100% agree:</p>
              <p>Singapore is not a country.</p>
              <p>It is just a road side toilet where everyone can stop by, relieve themselves and move on.</p>
