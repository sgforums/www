              <p><strong>Law Minister explains court sentencing of Dr Woffles Wu</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Law Minister K Shanmugam responded to comments that 
              the sentence meted out to plastic surgeon Dr Woffles Wu was too lenient.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Dr Wu was fined 
              S$1,000 on Wednesday for abetting Mr Kuan Kit Wah, then 76, to provide 
              misleading information to the police in November 2006.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The car belonging to Dr Wu, was travelling at 91 kilometers per hour (kmph) on Adam Road when the speed limit is 70kmph.<br><br>In
               a blog post, MP for Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC Hri Kumar Nair said such 
              offences are serious and that others who had been convicted of similar 
              offences had been jailed.<br><br>Mr Shanmugam said the incident raises four questions.<br><br>Firstly,
               why Dr Wu was charged under section 81(3) of the Road Traffic Act; 
              secondly why abetment; thirdly why he was given a fine; and lastly why 
              there was a lapse of six years before Dr Wu was taken to task.<br><br>Mr Shanmugam explained that the offence was committed in 2006 when section 204 of the Penal Code had not been enacted yet. <br><br>Under usual provisions at that time, a person would be charged under Section 81(3). <br><br>As for why Dr Wu was charged with abetment, Mr Shanmugam said the 52-year-old "did not make the misleading statements himself." <br><br>The minister said the statements in question were made by Mr Kuan, which was why the charge could only be that of abetment.<br><br>Mr
               Shanmugam stressed that investigations are ongoing, as to who the 
              driver actually was and that the case has not been concluded.<br><br>He 
              said the decision to prosecute was made by the Attorney-General's 
              Chambers (AGC) and that it is independent in making those decisions.<br><br>As
               for sentencing, Mr Shanmugam said the courts make that decision and a 
              fine is apparently "within the norm of usual sentences" under that 
              charge.<br><br>Noting that there have been cases where the offender was 
              jailed, the law minister points out that fines are more commonly meted 
              out.<br><br>In this particular instance, Mr Shanmugam said "no money passed hands".<br><br>He
               added that Mr Kuan was also not charged and that could have been 
              because the AGC took into account the fact that Mr Kuan is now over 80 
              years of age.<br><br>As for why it took six years for Dr Wu to be 
              prosecuted, Mr Shanmugam said the police were unaware of the offences at
               that time. <br><br>He said information was given only much later through a complain to the AGC, made "more recently". <br><br>Once the complaint was received, authorities investigated and thereafter the AGC decided to charge Dr Wu.<br><br>Mr Hri Kumar Nair said Mr Shanmugam has answered some of the public's questions on the case.<br><br>But
               it may be useful, Mr Hri said, if the public could understand why some 
              cases involve jail terms while some only received fines.<br><br>Turning 
              to the case of the 25-year-old, dubbed the sticker-lady, who was 
              arrested for vandalism, Mr Shanmugam said there are no hard and fast 
              rules on what's considered art on public buildings.<br><br>He said the government must look at the consensus of the majority and how the majority would like society to be structured.<br><br>Charges have yet to be filed on sticker-lady, Samantha Lo.<br><br>Mr Shanmugam's comments were made on the sidelines of a community event.<br><br>- CNA/ck</span></span></p>

              <p><strong>AGC clarifies media reports on Woffles Wu case</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: The Attorney-General's Chambers has clarified some 
              media reports about the case against Woffles Wu. Wu was fined S$1,000 
              for getting someone else to take the rap for two speeding incidents.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The AGC said in a 
              statement that Woffles Wu was charged for abetting his employee Kuan Yit
               Wah to give false information to the police about the incidents in 2005
               and 2006. It was Kuan who gave the false information.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Wu, who did not give
               any information to the police, was charged with abetting Kuan to do so,
               which is an offence under the Road Traffic Act. <br><br>There was no evidence of payment or gratification given to Kuan. <br><br>Kuan, who is 82 years old, was given a stern warning.<br><br>The
               AGC said in general, fines or short custodial sentences are imposed for
               wilfully providing false information, under the Road Traffic Act. 
              Custodial sentences are typically imposed under this section when there 
              are aggravating features, such as many instances of the offence 
              committed by the same person.<br><br>The AGC said some media reports refer to cases in which a jail term has been imposed under section 204A of the Penal Code. <br><br>It
               said the accused could not have been charged under that provision for 
              intentionally perverting the course of justice. This is because the 
              accused committed his offence in 2006, before that particular section of
               the Penal Code was enacted in 2008.<br><br>The position of the accused 
              is therefore different from others who were subject to section 204A and 
              who have been punished with a jail term.<br><br>On the facts of this 
              case, the AGC said as there was no major accident or injury, it was 
              considered appropriate to proceed under the Road Traffic Act rather than
               invoke the general provisions of the Penal Code.<br><br>-CNA/ac</span></span></p>
