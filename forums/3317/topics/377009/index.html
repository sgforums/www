              <p class="hn-byline">(AFP)
              –
              <span class="hn-date">1 day ago</span></p>
              <p>SYDNEY — An Australian town pulled all bottled water from its
              shelves Saturday and replaced it with refillable bottles in what is
              believed to be a world-first ban.</p>
              <p>Hundreds of people marched
              through the picturesque rural town of Bundanoon to mark the first day
              of its bottled water ban by unveiling a series of new public drinking
              fountains, said campaign spokesman John Dee.</p>
              <p>Shopkeepers
              ceremoniously removed the last bottles of water from their shelves and
              replaced them with reusable bottles that can be filled from fountains
              inside the town's shops or at water stations in the street.</p>
              <p>"Every
              bottle today was taken off the shelf and out of the fridges so you can
              only now buy refillable bottles in shops in Bundanoon," Dee told AFP.</p>
              <p>The
              tiny town, two hours south of Sydney, voted in July to ban bottled
              water after a drinks company moved to tap into a local aquifer for its
              bottled water business.</p>
              <p>"In the process of the campaign against
              that the local people became educated about the environmental impact of
              bottled water," said Dee.</p>
              <p>"A local retailer came up with this
              idea of well why don't we do something about that and actually stop
              selling the bottled water and it got a favourable reaction," he said.</p>
              <p>Dee
              said the 2,000-person town had made international headlines with their
              bid, which he hoped would spur communities across the world to action.</p>
              <p>"Whilst
              our politicians grapple with the enormity of dealing with climate
              change what Bundanoon shows is that at the very local level we can
              sometimes do things that can surprise ourselves, in terms of our
              ability to bring about real and measurable change that has a real
              benefit for the environment," he said.</p>
              <p>The cash savings only made the project more compelling, he added.</p>
              <p>"I
              think that's why this campaign is doing so well, because we're saying
              to people you can save money and save the environment at the same
              time," said Dee. "The alternative doesn't have a sexy brand, doesn't
              have pictures of mountain streams on the front of it, it comes out of
              your tap."</p>
              <p>Activists say bottling water causes unnecessary use of
              plastics and fuel for transport. A New South Wales study found that in
              2006, the industry was responsible for releasing 60,000 tonnes of gases
              blamed for global warming.</p>
