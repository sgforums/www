              <p><strong>Universal Studios theme-park at Sentosa to offer 18 unique rides and attractions</strong></p>
              <p><span>Singapore: Island resort Sentosa will soon be home to the world’s
              tallest duel roller-coaster ride and movie stars such as Marilyn
              Monroe, Shrek and the motley mob of Alex, Marty, Melman and Gloria last
              spotted in Madagascar,the movie.
              <br> <br>The Universal Studios theme-park which will be housed on the 49
              hectares Resorts World at Sentosa, revealed Tuesday its two dozen
              attractions, including 18 rides and attractions specially created or
              adapted for Singapore.
              <br> <br>“Universal Studios Singapore will be its own unique experience and
              family destination with many new rides, shows and themes that can’t be
              found at other Universal Studios parks around the world,” said Tom
              Williams, chairman and CEO, Universal Parks &amp; Resorts. <br> <br> Williams said of Tuesday's unveiling of some of the theme-park's
              attractions, that attention was paid to location-specific creatives and
              designs so as to offer both first-time and devoted Universal Studios
              visitors, an exciting, different and memorable experience.
              <br> <br> The theme-park will feature seven zones, each with its own iconic food outlets and entertainment attractions.
              <br> <br> Tied-in to movie favourites, are the Madagascar and Far Far Away zones, featuring attractions for both young and old.
              <br> <br>Visitors can explore Shrek's swamp home, a castle and party at a
              Knight Club, or 'move it, move it' with wacky King Julien at a beach
              party after outwitting the Foosa in an original, one-of-a-kind
              immersive river ride that should be as wild as the lemur tribe of
              Madagascar. <br> <br> Sci-fi buffs will have a city of their own and be able to join in the
              Human vs Cylons battle on the Battlestar Galactica dueling coasters,
              the tallest of its kind in the world. Another battle in this zone is
              the highly-anticipated Transformers ride which debuts at Universal
              Studios Singapore before heading out to the US theme-park. <br> <br> As for adventure-seekers, they can trip to the 1930's Golden Age of
              Egyptian Exploration to discover the Sphinx, Pharaoh's tombs and
              mummies in the Revenge of the Mummy attraction, or take on the Lost
              World zone inhabited by dinosaurs at the redesigned Jurassic Park
              Rapids Adventure and Waterworld, with death defying stunts. <br> <br> At the Hollywood zone, visitors can expect Broadway-style theatre
              modelled after the famous Hollywood Pantages Theatre and walk down
              Hollywood Boulevard complete with the famous Walk of Fame.
              <br> <br>Without hopping on a jet, visitors will be transported to New York
              for a slice of the Big Apple, from NY-style pizza to movie-set scenes,
              including a special effects stage with Steven Spielberg who offers
              behind-the-scenes peeks and Stage 28 for star wannabes who get a chance
              to be part of a movie production.
              <br> <br>“Asians love movies and we are proud to introduce the region’s
              first and only Universal Studios theme park" said Tan Hee Teck, CEO of
              Resorts World Sentosa.
              <br> <br>According to Tan, the project is in the final stages of
              construction, and Universal Studios Singapore will be one of the
              biggest and most exciting theme-parks in the world.
              <br> <br>Apart from Asia's only Universal Studios theme park which will have
              30 restaurants and food carts, as well as 20 retail stores and carts
              supporting the various attractions, Resorts World boasts the world’s
              largest Marine Life Park, a destination spa – ESPA and a designer
              casino.
              <br> <br> Resorts World at Sentosa is slated to have its soft opening in early 2010. </span></p>
