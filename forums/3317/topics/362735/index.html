              <p>One man was injured when a glass panel fell from the 18th floor of 1 Finlayson Green this morning.</p>
              <p>The incident happened at about 10.30am.</p>
              <p>The injured man, a Chinese in his early 40s, suffered cuts on his head.</p>
              <p>He was taken to Singapore General Hospital in an ambulance.</p>
              <p>Debris from the window occupied the rightmost lane of Robinson Road causing congestion.</p>
              <p>It's not known how the window fell.</p>
              <p>30-year-old Marvin Camuay was across the road when the incident happened.</p>
              <p>He described what he saw.</p>
              <p>"When we saw it, the window glass had dropped already. (Were there
              any people injured?). We just saw one vehicle got smashed on the front
              side. (What vehicle?). I think it was a Toyota family car or something.
              (How many people were inside the car?). I think 2 or 3 people. (And
              then what happen after that?). I think they settled it with the
              management inside, later we saw a lady, she was injured. I think she
              was inside the car because later on they settled with the security and
              the management of the building, 30 minutes or so they went out and were
              assisted into the car."</p>
              <p>Police investigations are still on-going.</p>

              <p><strong>Property owners, tenants encouraged to check windows every 6 months</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Property owners and tenants are encouraged to check
              and maintain windows in high-rise buildings at least twice a year.
              <br> <br>In a joint statement, the Building and Construction Authority (BCA)
              and the Housing and Development Board (HDB) said the safety of exterior
              features such windows are critical in Singapore's densely built
              environment as these could cause serious injuries. <br> <br> BCA said since it introduced legislation to retrofit casement windows
              in October 2004, the number of fallen window incidents has gone down
              significantly.
              <br> <br> In 2005, the number was 125 but this has dropped to an average of 52 cases per year from 2006 to 2008. 
              <br> <br>BCA and HDB said all property owners are responsible for ensuring
              that their windows are well maintained so that they do not fall off and
              cause danger to the public.
              <br> <br>The statement came a day after a huge glass window went crashing
              down 18 floors from a high-rise building in downtown Singapore on
              Thursday morning.
              <br> <br> A man in his early 40s suffered cuts on his head as a result of the accident. 
              <br> <br> He was believed to be working on the glass panel on the 18th floor of the AIA Building. 
              <br> <br> Fortunately there were no vehicles or pedestrians when the glass panel came crashing down. </span></p>
