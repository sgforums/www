              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Singapore's current Budget Terminal may be shifted to
               make way for a fourth terminal that analysts say is likely to take 
              place closer to the end of the decade.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>That is because once
               the ASEAN Open Skies agreement is in place by 2015, passenger traffic 
              will likely grow by at least five per cent each year.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Analysts Channel NewsAsia spoke with said with the growth of passenger volume, comes the need for expansion.<br><br>Changi
               Airport's existing three terminals can accommodate about 70 million 
              passengers annually, and passenger traffic this year is likely to exceed
               last year's 42 million.<br><br>Shukor Yusof, and aviation analyst with 
              Standard &amp; Poor's, said: "We still have some capacity with Terminal 3
               still not being maximised yet, there's still a lot of room there.<br><br>"But
               beyond that, obviously there is going to be a need to expand the 
              airport with the new terminal, given the increase in low cost travel, 
              even in the expansion of new discount carriers in the region."<br><br>Given
               the economic uncertainties, the remaining capacity is likely to be 
              taken up once the ASEAN Open Skies agreement kicks in, in 2015. The 
              agreement will fully liberalise air travel between the grouping's 
              10-member states.<br><br>Mr Yusof said: "It will vary obviously because 
              we are going into a very difficult period for the next, two, three years
               at least, because of the problems in Europe, in North America. But that
               being the case, there is still tremendous growth in this part of the 
              world, and that's going to be increased in our opinion when 2015 Open 
              Skies kicks into place, depending on how quickly countries in the 
              region, in ASEAN react to that.<br><br>"The potential for that is huge, 
              it could be anywhere between five to 10 per cent (growth) for some 
              countries or even more than that, depending on how they exploit the 
              possibilities of that happening.<br><br>"I think they will have to agree
               to whether they want to construct a new terminal when open skies kicks 
              in in 2015, and then they will have an idea of how the traffic flow will
               be, and how the rest of the ASEAN developing as well, that will give 
              them a sense of indication as well, how the market is going to be like.<br><br>"Certainly,
               I think there is no doubt that there will be a need for Terminal 4, 
              beyond this decade. But if they do decide, then the construction will 
              probably begin towards the later part of this decade, which is after 
              2015."<br><br>Gary Ho, senior lecturer of Aviation Management &amp; 
              Services at Temasek Polytechnic, said: "The philosophy at Changi is 
              always build ahead of demand, so if you look at Terminal 3, that's how 
              they built it. Our airport has always been sized, way before the need 
              arises."<br><br>In March 2008, the Transport Ministry confirmed that 
              Singapore will have a Terminal 4 at Changi Airport. This was mentioned 
              in Parliament, just two months after the opening of Terminal 3 in 
              January. Since then, authorities have been working on the master plan 
              but little has been revealed about the details.<br><br>There have been 
              talks that Terminal 4 is likely to be located on reclaimed land, along 
              Changi Coast Road, near to runway three. But sources tell Channel 
              NewsAsia that the area where the current Budget Terminal is located is 
              another potential site.<br><br>Mr Yusof said: "It would be possible for 
              them to do that, but then again, they would have to relocate the low 
              cost terminal somewhere, so they would have to weigh that in their 
              decision. I think anywhere within the boundaries of Changi within the 
              proximity of the three terminals, would be an excellent choice because 
              of the connectivity."<br><br>Mr Ho added: "If you look at the location 
              of the current budget terminal, it is very small, you know you are 
              constrained by the SATS Building, the Inflight Catering Centre, and you 
              are also constrained by the golf course, and also some of the ancillary 
              services. If you are going to build Terminal 4 there, you are actually 
              building a terminal that is very constrained."<br><br>It is understood 
              that if the Budget Terminal makes way for Terminal 4, all budget 
              carriers will then operate out of Terminals 1 and 2.<br><br>-CNA/ac</span></span></p>
