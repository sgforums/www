              <p class="first">Stefanie Sun took a step that shocked the public two
              years ago by choosing to take a break from her career at a time when
              many thought she was at her peak. Making a comeback after the long
              deserved break, Sun still holds onto her faith and love for singing to
              step into showbiz again.</p>
              <p>Stefanie Sun started her singing career in 2000. With her short
              hair, unique vocals and charisma, she managed to make a name for
              herself within just a short span of time and emerged as the queen of
              local pop with her rising popularity. But just as the path to greater
              heights presented itself before her, Sun chose to slow down, twice.</p>
              <p>"I did talk to my parents at that time, that I want to remain where
              I am, and not sign any contract. There was a period of time when some
              records company tried to approach me, but I declined it all. I decided
              to take a rest that year was due to too much work piling up. I was also
              feeling a little depressed and empty, so I had to take a break.</p>
              <p>As for
              the past year, I admit that it is due to my lack of own opinions; I
              have no idea what is the next step. I don't know if I should move on or
              stay the same. Besides other personal work, I did attend trade shows,
              became a spokesperson and handled some projects during my break. The
              rest of my time would have been spent dining, watching television
              programmes and reading. I'm either at my home or my parents' place,"
              Sun said.</p>
              <p>It may take a lot of courage to leave the industry but it takes even
              more for the artist to decide to return to it. As Sun reappears in the
              limelight, the media praised her for her courage and bravery.</p>
              <p>"I
              think they are right. There was a period of time when I felt
              incompetent, finding difficulty in whatever I do. But now, I begin to
              see things in a different light, I would think nothing is impossible,
              it is just a matter of whether you want it or not. If you want
              something to happen, it will happen. This is the experience and
              confidence that I've accumulated during the past two years," Sun said.</p>
              <p>Returning
              to the stage after two years, Sun sets to challenge herself with a
              concert tour. Although already been through much in the industry, faced
              with a concert that means a lot to her comeback, Sun reveals that she
              feels the jitters.</p>
              <p>"My heart beat so fast that it felt like it
              was going to drop out of my mouth during the first concert (in Taipei).
              When I get too nervous, I will start to break down and cry at a certain
              point, because you will feel the fear. During my first concert, I shed
              a tear before I stepped out to the stage," Sun revealed.</p>
              <p>Besides
              her career, Sun's relationship with her rumored Holland boyfriend is
              also stealing quite a bit of media attention. When asked by fans if her
              boyfriend would attend the concert as a show of support, Sun toned down
              immediately.</p>
              <p>"At that time, I skipped the question when my fans
              started probing about my relationship. I know there are a lot of people
              out there who are concerned about my love life, but I don't wish to
              share too much about my private life," Sun said.</p>
              <p>Although Sun did
              not reveal when her next album will be out, she promised her fans that
              she will be presenting her new songs on stage during her 11 July
              concert at the Singapore Indoor stadium.</p>
