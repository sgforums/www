              <p>RETIRED ministers who serve 18 years or more receive annual pension 
              payouts approximately equal to one-tenth of their annual salaries, the 
              Prime Minister's Office (PMO) disclosed in a letter to The Straits Times
               Forum on Friday.</p>
              <p>Annual salaries of ministers vary from year to year.</p>
              <p>The latest available Public Service Division (PSD) figures are for 
              2009, when an entry-grade minister received an annual salary of $1.57 
              million. The Prime Minister's salary that year was $3.04 million.</p>
              <p>Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean said the PMO saw the 
              need to clarify the 'actual situation' because of the 'misinformation' 
              that had been circulating on the Internet after the May 7 election.</p>
              <p>Online forum postings in recent days have been claiming that
               Mr George Yeo may continue to receive a seven-digit sum as pension 
              every year, even after stepping down as Foreign Minister following his 
              electoral defeat in Aljunied GRC.</p>
              <p>'The actual position is quite different from the 
              misinformation that has been going around,' said Mr Teo, acknowledging 
              that public 'consternation' may have resulted.</p>

              look, i'm reasonably good with numbers and government lingo but i don't understand what the PSD statement is trying to say.
              
              just tell me, how much is an average minister's pension, ok?

              <p>In a nut shell.</p>
              <p>After serving at least 18 years, entitled to pension, which is one year salary divided by 10, per year.</p>
              <p>That means LSL pension will be $304,000 per year, just shaking leg.</p>
              <p>That also means Mr George Yeo, if he has already served at least 18 years, and is eligible for retirement from government service, would be entitled to a six-figure pension per year, not seven-figure pension.</p>
              <p>It is not known if Mr George Yeo will receive any pension.</p>

              <p>Lol...</p>
              <p>Maximum is 2/3 of last drawn annual salary... Where did the 10% come from?</p>
              <p>The Singapore Government website on the Statutes should not be fake right?</p>
              <p><a href="http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/non_version/cgi-bin/DisplayContent.pl?DOCID=1978-REVED-219&amp;VID=888373251-000117&amp;WEF=latest&amp;TYPE=simple&amp;mode=and&amp;version=currentVersion&amp;query1=minister%20pension">http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/non_version/cgi-bin/DisplayContent.pl?DOCID=1978-REVED-219&amp;VID=888373251-000117&amp;WEF=latest&amp;TYPE=simple&amp;mode=and&amp;version=currentVersion&amp;query1=minister%20pension</a><br></p>
              <p>He is more than 55 years old and has served 23 years and is entitled to the maximum of 66.67% of last drawn annual salary according to the statutes.</p>
              <p>Entry-level is already 1.57 million, so why it is wrong to say that his annual pension of 7 digits is wrong? I did not fail my maths.</p>
              <p>Two-thirds of 1.57 million is 1,046,666 while not taking into account of any increase over the years since 1.57 million is only entry-level. Wake up fellow Singaporeans!</p>

And dont beat around the bush or try to detort any information to the public.
