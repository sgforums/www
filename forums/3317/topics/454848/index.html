              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Mr Yong Nyuk Lin, a member of Singapore's first Cabinet, has died.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>He was 94.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The late Mr Yong was the brother-in-law of former Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew's late wife, Madam Kwa Geok Choo.<br><br>Born in Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia, Mr Yong served as a minister from 1959 to 1976.<br><br>A Raffles College science graduate, his portfolios included Education, Health and Communications. <br><br>He
               helped to shape modern Singapore by carrying out measures to increase 
              access to education, establish sustainable population growth, improve 
              public transport and reduce traffic congestion. <br><br>The late Mr Yong was the general manager of Overseas Assurance Company when he resigned to stand for elections in 1959.<br><br>He became a Member of Parliament in Geylang West.<br><br>That
               year as Education Minister, Mr Yong launched a Chinese literacy drive, 
              using Mandarin as a common language of all Chinese dialect group.<br><br>He also started adult education classes to teach Malay. <br><br>In
               addition, Mr Yong doubled the intake of students in schools, converting
               each school into two by providing morning and afternoon sessions.<br><br>He
               ran a crash programme to train the teachers needed and promoted many of
               the seniors to be principals, headmasters and headmistresses.<br><br>In 1963, he moved to the Health Ministry.<br><br>His
               Ministry increased public cleanliness by implementing a hawkers' code 
              to raise hygiene standards, banning cattle from built-up areas and 
              reorganising refuse collection.<br><br>In 1966, the Population and 
              Family Planning Board was formed to slash Singapore's unsustainably high
               rate of 29 births per thousand. <br><br>It offered advice and subsidised contraceptives to all eligible married women. <br><br>Mr Yong was transferred to the new Ministry of Communications in 1968. <br><br>Among
               the projects the department handled during his tenure were the creation
               of Singapore Airlines and the Singapore Telecommunications Authority, 
              the expansion of civil aviation and Singapore's container port 
              facilities, and early studies of the feasibility of the MRT.  <br><br>But much of his energies were devoted to traffic and public transport.<br><br>In
               order to reduce traffic and congestion, he raised the cost of car 
              registration by 25 per cent, encouraged car-pooling, acted to suppress 
              the pirate taxi trade, and introduced school buses and bus lanes. <br><br>The
               biggest anti-congestion measure he implemented, which drew 
              international attention on its launch in mid-1975, was the Area 
              Licensing Scheme (ALS) - the forerunner of the Electronic Road Pricing 
              system (ERP).  <br><br>Mr Yong received the Order of Nila Utama on 
              National Day in 1990 for his contributions prior to the merger and 
              separation of Singapore.<br><br>- CNA/cc</span></span></p>
