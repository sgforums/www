              <p>Last year's general election which saw the ruling People's Action 
              Party's (PAP) vote share slip to 60.1 per cent, showed that many had 
              "lost faith in the government", said former Foreign Affairs Minister 
              George Yeo.<br><br>Speaking at a farewell dinner at Punggol Community 
              Club on Saturday, Yeo urged politicans from both the ruling and 
              opposition parties to work together with people's interest at heart and 
              "link the hearts together, broaden our minds," reported the Sunday 
              Times.<br><br>Yeo added that the vote share showed that many had "lost faith in the government" and "that is not a good thing". <br><br>"When
               a country is divided, many problems will arise," Yeo said. He pointed 
              out that even though former Aljunied grassroots leader Dr Ang Yong Guan 
              crossed over to opposition Singapore Democratic Party last year, Yeo 
              stressed that "we can all work together," the same paper reported.<br> <br>"This is an effort everyone must pool together - government, people, all political parties," he told attendees at the dinner. <br><br>Yeo
               officially relinquished his role as grassroots advisor and branch 
              chairman to Aljunied GRC on 1 January this year and had serve 23 years 
              in the ward. He was replaced by veteran grassroots leader Anthony Loh, 
              73.</p>

              Casinos strike me as a rich, natural breeding ground for many types of crimes. Casinos are to criminals what garbage dumps are to rats, or shit is to houseflies. Specifically, a casino environment is supportive of the following species of criminal offences - theft, robbery, extortion, cheating, drug trafficking, consumption of illegal drugs, illegal moneylending, money laundering, vice activities, human trafficking and other immigration-related offences...
