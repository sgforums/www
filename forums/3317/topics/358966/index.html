              <p class="first">LONDON - The son of Max Mosley, president of Formula
              One's governing body, has been found dead at his home in London, a
              police source said on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>Alexander Mosley, 39, a respected economist, was discovered by a
              relative on Tuesday at his house in the Notting Hill area of west
              London, the Sun newspaper said on its website.</p>
              <p>"I can confirm
              that a man in his late 30s was found dead yesterday at an address in
              W11," a London police spokeswoman said. "He was pronounced dead at the
              scene. We are not treating this as suspicious."</p>
              <p>A police source confirmed the dead man was Mosley's son.</p>
              <p>Max Mosley, 69, is the son of the 1930s British fascist leader Oswald Mosley.</p>
              <p>"The
              FIA extends sincere condolences to the Mosley family on the sad news of
              the death of Alexander Mosley," the International Automobile Federation
              said in a statement.</p>
              <p>"Our thoughts are with Alexander's family
              and friends, and we would request that the media respect the Mosley
              family's privacy at this difficult time."</p>
              <p>A post mortem to confirm the cause of death was taking place.</p>
              <p>Eddie Jordan, a former Formula One team boss, said he was "devastated" by the news.</p>
              <p>"Max and Alexander particularly were very close," the founder and former owner of the Jordan team told Sky News.</p>
              <p>He said the father and son shared "a great intellect," describing Alexander as a "hugely clever and talented computer expert."</p>
              <p>"It's totally tragic, he was such a bright boy. I'm devastated for them."</p>
              <p>Last
              year Mosley, the FIA president, won 60,000 pounds in damages from a
              newspaper which breached his privacy by publishing details of his part
              in a sado-masochistic orgy.</p>
              <p>During the court case, Mosley
              revealed that neither his wife of almost 50 years nor his sons knew
              about his interest in sado-masochism until the newspaper article.</p>
