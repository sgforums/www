              <p>Singapore’s government should ease restrictions on freedom of expression
               instead of making excuses not to do so, a US-based human rights group 
              said on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>In its annual report released on Monday which assessed progress on human rights in more than 90 countries over the past year, the <span id="lw_1327380462_9" class="yshortcuts">Human Rights Watch</span> (<span id="lw_1327380462_5" class="yshortcuts">HRW</span>)
               pointed out how the government had either dismissed or contested the 
              recommendations to improve its civil and political liberties made by the
               United Nations Human Rights Council’s Universal Periodic Review (UPR) 
              process in May last year.</p>
              <p>The UN report, it said, had highlighted areas of concerns such as use of
               preventive detention, defamation suits and restrictions on public 
              protests among others.<br><br>“<span id="lw_1327380462_0" class="yshortcuts">Singapore</span>'s claims of exemption from human rights standards are just lame excuses for abuses,” said <span id="lw_1327380462_6" class="yshortcuts">HRW</span>’s deputy Asia director Phil Robertson. <br><br>“The people of <span id="lw_1327380462_1" class="yshortcuts">Singapore</span> deserve the same rights as everyone else, not more clever stories justifying government oppression."<br><br>The
               group said that legislations such as the Internal Security Act (ISA) 
              and the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act grant the government 
              “virtually unlimited powers” to detain suspects without charge or 
              judicial review.<br><br>Those laws, it added, have been used to imprison
               government critics without trial, as well as criminal suspects who 
              should be charged under the penal code. It suggested that the government
               should also use the criminal code to prosecute terrorism suspects in 
              line with international procedures.<br><br><span id="lw_1327380462_7" class="yshortcuts">HRW</span> also took issue with policies which ensure the government’s tight reins
               over the media, which it said enable censorship, and control over 
              films, music and computer games.<br><br>It singled out the Newspaper and
               Printing Presses Act, which requires publications to renew registration
               annually, and gives the government a “free hand” to control circulation
               of foreign publications.<br><br>Freedom of association is also heavily 
              scrutinised in the country, it said, with the Registrar of Societies 
              having the right to deny registration to associations of 10 or more 
              members and that police permits are required for any public event 
              involving five or more people.<br><br>"<span id="lw_1327380462_2" class="yshortcuts">Singapore</span>'s
               leaders may sometimes listen to the electorate's concerns over social 
              and economic rights, but they are apparently deaf to pleas for political
               space to organise and speak out without fear of prosecution,” Robertson
               said. <br><br>“It’s telling that Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong in his 
              2012 New Year’s message didn’t say a single word about civil and 
              political rights.”<br><br>The group also called for the mandatory death 
              sentence and judicial sentences which include caning to be banned, 
              adding that the latter punishment amounts to torture. It added that 
              British colonial laws on same-sex relations should be repealed due to 
              its discriminatory nature and invasion of privacy.<br><br>Meanwhile, <span id="lw_1327380462_8" class="yshortcuts">HRW</span> commended the country for improving rights protections and working 
              conditions for around 196,000 of foreign domestic workers through 
              vigorous prosecution of employers and recruiters who physically abuse 
              workers, fail to pay wages or subject workers to dangerous conditions.<br><br>However,
               it said that the government should include these workers under the 
              Employment Act to ensure they have access to rights under the 
              legislation.<br><br>In the review in May last year, the panel formed by the UN had recognised <span id="lw_1327380462_3" class="yshortcuts">Singapore</span>’s
               progress in improving human rights protections for women, children, 
              migrant workers, and promoting racial and religious harmony. <br><br>Local media also reported
               that the panel had recommended that the country abolish the death 
              penalty, but the government contested that its low crime rates reflect 
              the success of capital punishment.<br><br><span id="lw_1327380462_4" class="yshortcuts">Singapore</span> also dismissed the need to establish the national human rights institution – as suggested by the panel.</p>

              <h1 class="story-header">FBI plans social network map alert mash-up application</h1>
              <p>The bureau has asked contractors to suggest possible solutions including the estimated cost.</p>
              <p>Privacy campaigners say they are concerned that the move could have implications for free speech.</p>
              <p>The FBI's Strategic Information and Operations Center (SOIC) posted its "Social Media Application" market research request onto the web on 19 January, and it was subsequently flagged up by New Scientist magazine.</p>
              <p>The document says: "Social media has become a primary source of intelligence because it has become the premier first response to key events and the primal alert to possible developing situations."</p>
              <p>It says the application should collect "open source" information and have the ability to:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Provide an automated search and scrape capability of social networks including Facebook and Twitter.</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li>Immediately translate foreign language tweets into English.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>The FBI says the information would be used to help it to predict the likely actions of "bad actors", detect instances of people deliberately misleading law enforcement officers and spot the vulnerabilities of suspect groups.</p>
              <p>It listed websites that the centre planned to monitor. They include YouTube, the photo service Flickr, and Itstrending.com - a site which shows popular shared items on Facebook.</p>
              <p>It also highlighted words it looked out for. These include "gangs", "small pox", "leak", "recall" and "2600" - an apparent reference to the hacking-focused magazine.</p>
              <p>"Social networks are about connecting people with other people - if one person is the target of police monitoring, there will be a dragnet effect in which dozens, even hundreds, of innocent users also come under surveillance," said Gus Hosein, the group's executive director.</p>
              <p>The group noted that it was seeking information from the UK's Metropolitan Police Service about its use of social networks.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
