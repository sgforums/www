              <p>WASHINGTON – One Metro transit train smashed into the rear of
              another at the height of the capital city's Monday evening rush hour,
              killing at least six people and injuring scores of others as the front
              end of the trailing train jackknifed violently into the air and fell
              atop the first.</p>
              <p>Cars of both trains were ripped
              open and smashed together in the worst accident in the Metrorail
              system's 33-year history. District of Columbia fire spokesman Alan
              Etter said crews had to cut some people out of what he described as a
              "mass casualty event." Rescue workers propped steel ladders up to the
              upper train cars to help survivors scramble to safety. Seats from the
              smashed cars spilled out onto the track.</p>
              <p><span id="lw_1245725215_0" class="yshortcuts" style="background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; cursor: pointer;   -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial;">D.C. Mayor Adrian Fenty</span> said six were confirmed dead. <span id="lw_1245725215_1" class="yshortcuts" style="background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; cursor: pointer;   -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial;">Fire Chief Dennis Rubin</span> said rescue workers treated 76 people at the scene and sent some of
              them to local hospitals, six with critical injuries. A search for
              further victims continued into the night.</p>
              <p>A Metro official said the dead included the operator of the trailing train. Her name was not immediately released.</p>
              <p><span id="lw_1245725215_2" class="yshortcuts" style="background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; cursor: pointer;   -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial;">President Barack Obama</span> sent his condolences to the victims of the crash.</p>
              <p>"Michelle
              and I were saddened by the terrible accident in Northeast Washington,
              D.C., today," Obama said in a statement issued Monday night. "Our
              thoughts and prayers go out to the families and friends affected by
              this tragedy."</p>
              <p>The president also thanked rescue personnel who helped to save lives.</p>
              <p>The
              crash around 5 p.m. EDT took place on the system's red line, Metro's
              busiest, which runs below ground for much of its length but is at
              ground level at the accident site near the Maryland border in northeast
              Washington.</p>
              <p>Metro chief John Catoe said the <span id="lw_1245725215_3" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc; cursor: pointer;">first train</span> was stopped on the tracks, waiting for another to clear the station
              ahead, when the trailing train, one of the oldest in the Metro fleet,
              plowed into it from behind.</p>
              <p>Officials had no explanation for the accident. <span id="lw_1245725215_4" class="yshortcuts" style="background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; cursor: pointer;   -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial;">The National Transportation Safety Board</span> took charge of the investigation and sent a team to the site. DC police and the <span id="lw_1245725215_5" class="yshortcuts">FBI</span> also had investigators at the scene to help search the wreckage for any overlooked injured or <span id="lw_1245725215_6" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc; cursor: pointer;">dead passengers</span> and evidence.</p>
              <p>Officials
              would not say how fast the train was traveling at the time of the
              accident. The crash occurred in an area with a sizable distance between
              rail stations in which trains are allowed to travel at higher speeds,
              Metro spokeswoman <span id="lw_1245725215_7" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc; cursor: pointer;">Candace Smith</span> said.</p>
              <p>Investigators
              are searching the wreckage for the trains' devices that record
              operating speeds and commands, NTSB member Debbie Hersman said.</p>
              <p>Each
              train had six cars and was capable of holding as many as 1,200 people.
              Hersman said the trains were bound for downtown. That would mean they
              were less likely to be filled during the afternoon rush hour.</p>
              <p>The trains had pulled out of the <span id="lw_1245725215_8" class="yshortcuts">Takoma Park station</span> and were headed in the direction of <span id="lw_1245725215_9" class="yshortcuts">the Fort Totten station</span>.</p>
              <p>More
              than 200 firefighters from D.C., Maryland and Virginia eventually
              converged on the scene. Sabrina Webber, a 45-year-old real estate agent
              who lives in the neighborhood, said the first rescuers to arrive had to
              use the "jaws of life" to pry open a wire fence along rail line to get
              to the train.</p>
              <p>Webber raced to the scene after
              hearing a loud boom like a "thunder crash" and then sirens. She said
              there was no panic among the survivors.</p>
              <p>Passenger
              Jodie Wickett, a nurse, told CNN she was seated on one train, sending
              text messages on her phone, when she felt the impact. She said she sent
              a message to someone that it felt like the train had hit a bump.</p>
              <p>"From
              that point on, it happened so fast, I flew out of the seat and hit my
              head." Wickett said she stayed at the scene and tried to help. She said
              "people are just in very bad shape."</p>
              <p>"The people that were hurt, the ones that could speak, were
              calling back as we called out to them," she said. "Lots of people were
              upset and crying, but there were no screams."</p>
              <p>One man said he was riding a bicycle across a bridge over the Metro tracks when the sound of the crash got his attention.</p>
              <p>"I didn't see any panic," Barry Student said. "The whole situation was so surreal."</p>
              <p>At Howard University Hospital, Dr. Johnnie Ford, an emergency
              room doctor, said a 14-year-old girl suffered two broken legs in the
              accident. A 20-year-old male patient "looked like he had been tumbled
              around quite a bit, bumps and bruises from head to toe," Ford said.</p>
              <p>Homeland Security Department spokeswoman Amy Kudwa said less
              than two hours after the crash that federal authorities had no
              indication of any terrorism connection.</p>
              <p>"I don't know the reason for this accident," Metro's Catoe
              said. "I would still say the system is safe, but we've had an
              incident."</p>
              <p>Monday's crash was the third major subway or <span id="lw_1245725215_10" class="yshortcuts">commuter rail crash</span> in a big city in the past nine months. In the earlier accidents:</p>
              <p>• In September 2008, a <span id="lw_1245725215_11" class="yshortcuts">commuter rail train</span> and a <span id="lw_1245725215_12" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc; cursor: pointer;">freight train</span> crashed in <span id="lw_1245725215_13" class="yshortcuts">Los Angeles</span>, killing 25 people. The crash was blamed on an engineer on the <span id="lw_1245725215_14" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc; cursor: pointer;">commuter rail</span> sending text messages on a cell phone.</p>
              <p>• Last month about 50 people were injured in Boston when one trolley rear-ended another. The conductor admitted to <span id="lw_1245725215_15" class="yshortcuts">sending a text message</span> when the crash occurred.</p>
              <p>No reason was given for the Washington crash, but some safety experts are concerned about the recent increase.</p>
              <p>"I'm not sure if everyone in the safety system is paying the
              proper attention that needs to be paid," said Barry Sweedler, a San
              Francisco-based safety consultant and former investigator and manager
              at the NTSB. "These things shouldn't be happening."</p>
              <p>However, Robert Lauby, a former NTSB rail investigator, said the increase in accidents could well be mere coincidence.</p>
              <p>"Just because you had them doesn't mean there's a specific issue that caused them," Lauby said.</p>
              <p>The only other time in Metrorail's 33-year history that there
              were passenger fatalities was on Jan. 13, 1982, when three people died
              as a result of a derailment underneath downtown. That was a day of
              disaster in the capital — shortly before the subway crash, an <span id="lw_1245725215_16" class="yshortcuts">Air Florida plane</span> slammed into the <span id="lw_1245725215_17" class="yshortcuts">14th Street Bridge</span> immediately after takeoff in a severe snowstorm from <span id="lw_1245725215_18" class="yshortcuts" style="background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; cursor: pointer;   -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial;">Washington National Airport</span> across the <span id="lw_1245725215_19" class="yshortcuts">Potomac River</span>. The <span id="lw_1245725215_20" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc; cursor: pointer;">plane crash</span> killed 78 people.</p>

              <p><strong>Metro cited for safety issues in 2006: investigator</strong></p>
              <p class="first">WASHINGTON (AFP) - - The US capital's subway system
              was cited in 2006 over safety concerns with the same type of train as
              one involved in Monday's deadly crash but Metro failed to update or
              replace them, investigators said.</p>
              <p>The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) scoured the wreckage
              of two commuter trains hunting for clues to the worst subway accident
              in Washington's history, which killed nine people and injured some 80
              others.</p>
              <p>Metro officials said they still had no clue as to why one
              train plowed into the back of another on an above-ground section of the
              system's Red Line at the start of Monday's evening rush hour.</p>
              <p>But
              the NTSB raised poignant questions about the safety of the 1000-series
              train -- among the oldest in Metro's 33-year history -- which rammed
              into a newer train on the same track, with a reminder of its earlier
              recommendations that went unheeded.</p>
              <p>"We made recommendations in 2006 about the crash-worthiness of the 1000-series cars," the NTSB's Debbie Hersman told reporters.</p>
              <p>"We
              recommended to WMATA (Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority)
              to either retrofit those cars or phase them out of the fleet.</p>
              <p>"They have not been able to do that and our recommendation was not addressed, so it has been closed in an unacceptable status."</p>
              <p>That
              2006 report said the 1000-series was "vulnerable to catastrophic
              telescoping damage and complete loss of occupant survival space."</p>
              <p>Hersman
              noted that the lead car of the moving train was severely compressed by
              the impact, with "50 feet of that 75 feet (15 of 23 meters)... of
              survivable space lost or compromised, and so that's very significant."</p>
              <p>The
              federal agency that has taken over investigation of the crash also said
              that train's operator, 42-year-old Jeanice McMillan, had been driving
              the system's trains for just three months, after about six weeks of
              training.</p>
              <p>McMillan, whose train slammed into the other one with
              such force that it thrust the carriage of one train on top of the
              other, died in the crash.</p>
              <p>Preliminary investigations determined
              that the striking train was in "automatic mode" and that the emergency
              brake had been depressed, indicating the operator may have tried to
              stop the train before the fatal collision, Hersman said at a press
              conference near the scene of the crash.</p>
              <p>"We have not yet made any determination about the cause of this accident," she said.</p>
              <p>Hersman
              said the NTSB had formally requested access to McMillan's mobile phone
              records but stressed that that was "not a specific area we are singling
              out."</p>
              <p>Last September, 25 people were killed when the conductor of
              a commuter train in Los Angeles was sending text messages on his mobile
              phone while at the controls.</p>
              <p>The NTSB had 19 investigators
              working on the probe of Monday's accident which turned a routine
              commute into a nightmarish disaster scene.</p>
              <p>They were expected to
              gain access soon to nine data recorders on the newer, struck train,
              which should shed light on what caused train 112 to hurtle into train
              214, which was stopped on the same track.</p>
              <p>No data recorders appeared to be on the older train.</p>
              <p>The
              Washington Post, citing Metro sources, reported late Tuesday that the
              first two cars of train 112 were two months overdue for a brake
              inspection.</p>
              <p>Concerns have focused on onboard computers that
              control the trains' speed and braking, the track signal system designed
              to prevent train collisions, and on the age of train 112, one of
              Metro's roughly 300 1000-series train delivered from 1975 to 1978.</p>
              <p>"We
              are aggressively seeking to replace the 1000-series railcars... and we
              had taken action before this tragedy to achieve that objective," WMATA
              board chairman Jim Graham said.</p>
              <p>Hersman said it was too early to
              say whether train 112's age, McMillan's relative lack of experience, or
              the overdue brake checks were determining factors in the crash.</p>
              <p>Washington
              Mayor Adrian Fenty said eight of the dead had been identified,
              including David Wherley, who had led the District of Columbia National
              Guard, and his wife.</p>
              <p>"I had the opportunity to work with him as he commanded the troops in DC and as he sent them off to war." Fenty said.</p>
              <p>Metro,
              which said the investigation could take several weeks or months,
              carries some 800,000 people daily through Washington and nearby suburbs
              in Maryland and Virginia.</p>
              <p>The only other Metro crash involving passenger fatalities was in January 1982, when three people died after a derailment.</p>
