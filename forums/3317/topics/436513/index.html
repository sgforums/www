              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Singapore's Law Ministry is studying the possibility 
              of licensing three to five top Queen's Counsel (QCs), to work as 
              independent practitioners and argue in court.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>This arrangement is 
              to cater to the needs of mid level law firms who are unable to get 
              Singapore's Senior Counsel to take on cases for their clients.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Law Minister K 
              Shanmugam said most big corporations or financial institutions are 
              already the clients of these Senior Counsel and hence cannot act for 
              others wanting to sue their own clients.<br><br>The minister shared this development with aspiring law students at the Singapore Legal Forum.<br><br>He also said that Singapore is emerging as a leader in Alternative Dispute Resolution.<br><br>Mr
               Shanmugam said that within a few short years, Singapore has already 
              been ranked as among the best in the world, taking away work from New 
              York and other centres. But he cautioned law firms from remaining purely
               national in nature.<br><br>He said: "A lot of things which are routine 
              which can be done elsewhere may move. There is a business model growing 
              up that is taking work away from lawyers in the West and moving it to 
              large pools of lawyers sitting in Bangalore, doing the opinions and 
              sending it back. What it means is that we need to find a niche, a way of
               individualising ourselves and making ourselves relevant.<br><br>"It is 
              going to be a challenge but we will work together. It is becoming 
              increasingly difficult for legal markets to be ring-fenced from 
              international competition. We will be very focused at looking at the 
              trends and making sure that we are not behind the curve, we will make 
              sure that it continues to be a vibrant legal market."<br><br>There was also a word of advice from the minister for those who want to have overseas attachments.<br><br>Mr
               Shanmugam said: "You got to get beaten up, you got to get scolded...in 
              courts. Get a few dismissals then you start seeing law in a different 
              perspective. And after the pupillage, two years in a local law firm and 
              then going overseas for attachment, gives you the experience."<br><br>On the current job market in Singapore, Mr Shanmugam noted that there continues to be a shortage of lawyers.<br><br>This year, there are about 350 reading Law with the NUS Law Faculty and the Singapore Management University's Law School.<br><br>-CNA/ac</span></span></p>
