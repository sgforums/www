              <p>SEOUL, South Korea – North Korea fired five short-range missiles off
              its east coast on Monday, news reports said, even as South Korea
              proposed working-level talks with its communist neighbor.</p>
              <p>South
              Korea's Yonhap news agency, citing an unidentified South Korean
              government official, said the North test-fired two short-range missiles
              on Monday morning and three others on Monday afternoon from mobile
              launch pads.</p>
              <p>Yonhap said the missiles were surface-to-surface KN-02 rockets with a range of up to 75 miles (120 kilometers).</p>
              <p>The
              reported launches were the first since the regime conducted a barrage
              of seven ballistic missile tests in early July, and come despite signs
              North Korea is reaching out to rival South Korea and the United States
              after months of heightened tensions over its missile and nuclear
              programs.</p>
              <p>The South's conservative government has reciprocated
              by taking more steps to engage more with the North, but shows no signs
              of easing its pressure on the North to disarm.</p>
              <p>U.S. Secretary
              of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said in Belfast Monday that the
              American efforts to proceed with talks with North Korea on its nuclear
              ambitions will proceed despite the new tests.</p>
              <p>"Our goal remains
              the same," she told reporters after a meeting with Northern Irish
              business leaders. "Our consultations with our partners and our allies
              continues unabated. It is unaffected by the behavior of North Korea.'</p>
              <p>Clinton was to fly later to Moscow to meet with Russian leaders on a variety of issues, including nuclear reduction concerns.</p>
              <p>Yonhap
              said the North has issued a no-sail zone in areas off the country's
              east and west coasts Oct. 10-20 _ an apparent indication the country
              could carry out more missile tests.</p>
              <p>YTN television network
              carried a similar report to Yonhap, saying the missiles were fired off
              from sites south of the country's Musudan-ri missile site on its
              northeast coast.</p>
              <p>South Korea's Defense Ministry and the
              National Intelligence Service _ the country's main spy agency _ said
              they could not confirm the reports.</p>
              <p>Earlier Monday, South Korea
              proposed working-level officials of the two sides meet Wednesday
              discuss how to prevent floods in the Imjin River running through their
              heavily armed border. The South also proposed a separate meeting of Red
              Cross officials on Friday to discuss reunions of families separated by
              the 1950-53 Korean War.</p>
              <p>However, Unification Ministry spokesman Chun Hae-sung said that Seoul had no plan to resume high-level dialogue with the North.</p>
              <p>Ties
              between the divided Koreas had been soured after conservative South
              Korean President Lee Myung-bak took office early last year with a
              pledge to get tough with Pyongyang's communist government. Tension on
              the peninsula further heightened after the North conducted a long-range
              rocket test in April and a second nuclear test in May.</p>
              <p>Pyongyang,
              however, has recently reached out to Seoul and Washington. The regime
              toned down its threatening rhetoric, released detained South Korean and
              American citizens and pledged to resume key stalled joint projects with
              South Korea.</p>
              <p>The Korean War ended in a cease-fire, not a peace treaty, which means that the two Koreas are still technically at war.</p>
