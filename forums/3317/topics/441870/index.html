              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Over the last three years, about five foreign workers go missing each week on average.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>On Saturday morning,
               Channel NewsAsia was at the scene when an employer who found his 
              missing worker, handed him over to the police.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Once they saw the 
              missing foreign worker, employer James Ng's staff held on to him while 
              security personnel called the police. Mr Ng then took a photo as 
              evidence.<br><br>Shortly after, six officers arrived in three police cars to conduct investigations.<br><br>Mr
               Ng said his 42-year-old worker is from Anhui, China, and had run away 
              from his dormitory in Geylang in April. Mr Ng alleged that his worker 
              had gone to work illegally for another construction company.<br><br>The 
              worker was interrogated for three hours at Jurong industrial estate 
              before he was brought to the police station. He is expected to be 
              deported within a week.<br><br>Mr Ng said employers are liable for 
              missing workers, and they may face legal repercussions, if workers get 
              into any accident. He added that he is still trying to find three other 
              missing workers, all from China, and is offering a reward of S$2,000 for
               each of them.<br><br>Mr Ng said: "The workers say they've lost a lot of
               money, so they can't go back to work. And when another company offers 
              them a higher pay, they go there to work instead."<br><br>It is illegal for employers to recruit missing workers, and those who do so may get caned or jailed.<br><br>In
               a reply to Channel NewsAsia, the Manpower Ministry said the number of 
              foreign workers who go missing is not large. It said that between 2008 
              and 2010, fewer than three out of every 1,000 workers in Singapore go 
              missing. This amounts to about 250 cases annually.<br><br>The ministry 
              said a worker is considered missing if he is not repatriated once his 
              work permit is cancelled, and most of these workers were eventually 
              found and repatriated.<br><br>-CNA/ac</span></span></p>
