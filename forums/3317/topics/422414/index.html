              <div class="content">
              <p>SEOUL (AFP) - – North Korea has asked the United States to resume 
              food aid suspended two years ago and pledged to allow international 
              monitors to oversee its distribution to the public, a report said 
              Wednesday.</p>
              <p>South Korea's JoongAng Ilbo newspaper said Han Sang-Ryol, 
              Pyongyang's deputy ambassador to the United Nations, made the request on
               January 14 at a meeting with Robert King, the US special envoy on human
               rights in North Korea.</p>
              <p>Han told King in New York that the North was willing to allow 
              monitoring of the food aid "as much as the US wants", it quoted a 
              diplomatic source in Washington as saying.</p>
              <p>King, who is visiting South Korea this week, said in a statement 
              through the US embassy that he was aware of the report but "we do not 
              normally discuss meetings with other governments".</p>
              <p>US food aid was suspended in March 2009 after the North rejected a 
              proposal to increase the number of Korean-speaking monitors, whose role 
              was to ensure aid reached the general public and was not diverted to the
               military or the regime.</p>
              <p>But Washington does not believe Pyongyang has met its conditions, 
              the source told JoongAng, adding that even if it did, the resumption of 
              shipments would take time because of congressional procedures.</p>
              <p>King, in an interview with Yonhap news agency Wednesday, did not 
              refer to the JoongAng report. No decision has been made on resuming food
               aid to North Korea, he was quoted as saying.</p>
              <p>US policy is to base humanitarian assistance on need "and no political consideration should be involved", King said.</p>
              <p>Its other principles were to balance demands and requests since 
              resources are limited, and to ensure transparency in distribution.</p>
              <p>The North suffered a famine in the 1990s which killed hundreds of 
              thousands and has since relied on overseas aid to help feed its people.</p>
              <p>But donations have dwindled amid international concern over its missile and nuclear programmes.</p>
              <p>South Korea used to ship 400,000 tons of rice a year plus 300,000 tons of fertiliser to its neighbour.</p>
              <p>The shipments ended in 2008 as relations worsened under a new 
              conservative government in Seoul, which linked major assistance to 
              nuclear disarmament.</p>
              <p>Aid groups have warned that the North's chronic food shortages would worsen this year.</p>

              <p>if N. korea collapse,</p>
              <p>for south korea, ROK govt. may have to spend all their economies and even reserves to rebuilt northern korea. Refugees from north problem is a concern also.</p>
              <p>for china, refugee problems as south korea, and also for political concern for they are having US friendly nation sharing border with them, united korea under ROK may also initiate territorial issue with china.</p>
              <p>for US, i not so sure so i conjure that since NK has willingly let the food come in with supervision that the food will go to the civilians, US have to send in food in order not to let the rest of the world think that, US is using food as weapon,</p>
