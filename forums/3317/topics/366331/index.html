              <p class="first">NEW YORK (AFP) - - Wall Street swindler Bernard Madoff
              was sentenced Monday to 150 years in jail for masterminding an "evil"
              multi-billion-dollar investment scam that cheated thousands of people
              around the world.</p>
              <p>"It is the judgment of this court that Bernard Madoff should be
              sentenced to 150 years in jail," Judge Denny Chin said as he handed
              down the maximum term possible on 11 charges of fraud, theft and
              perjury.</p>
              <p>He described Madoff's crimes as "extraordinarily evil"
              and said it was "not merely a bloodless crime that takes place on paper
              but one that takes a staggering human toll."</p>
              <p>The tough sentence
              came even after Madoff, the former chairman of the Nasdaq, made a
              courtroom apology to his victims. "I am sorry," he told them simply. "I
              don't ask for forgiveness."</p>
              <p>"I leave a legacy of shame to my
              family. I am responsible for a great deal of suffering and pain. I live
              in a tormented state," said the disgraced 71-year-old financier who now
              faces spending the rest of his life in prison.</p>
              <p>"I cannot offer an excuse for my behavior," he added. "How do you excuse deceiving investors... and 200 employees?</p>
              <p>"How
              do you excuse lying to my sons and two brothers? How do you excuse
              lying to a wife who stood by you for 50 years and still stands by me?
              There is no excuse for that."</p>
              <p>Some of Madoff's victims vented their fury as they addressed the court.</p>
              <p>Cheryl Weinstein blasted Madoff as "a monster" and a "beast."</p>
              <p>"He
              walks among us. But he is a beast who has fed upon us to satisfy his
              own needs... I am asking you to keep in a cage behind bars," she said.</p>
              <p>Breaking
              into tears, Burt Ross, who lost five million dollars, said Madoff "has
              truly earned his reputation of being the most despised person in
              America today."</p>
              <p>"I only hope that his jail sentence is long
              enough so that his jail cell becomes his coffin," said Michael
              Schwartz, 33, who said the money stolen from his family had been set
              aside to take care of his mentally disabled brother.</p>
              <p>Judge Chin
              gave Madoff 10 days to appeal the sentence, but noted there had not
              been a single letter from friends or family testifying to his good
              deeds. "The absence of such support is telling," he said.</p>
              <p>Madoff's
              wife, Ruth, finally broke her silence Monday to lash out her husband,
              saying: "All those touched by this fraud feel betrayed; disbelieving
              the nightmare they woke to.</p>
              <p>"The man who committed this horrible fraud is not the man whom I have known all these years," she said in a statement.</p>
              <p>White
              House spokesman Robert Gibbs weighed in later by saying the maximum
              sentence handed to Madoff would send an effective warning to other
              investors.</p>
              <p>"The judge wanted to send a very strong signal to
              anybody that invests money on behalf of others of the amazing
              responsibility that they have to those investors and to the country,"
              he said, adding "that message will be heard loud and clear."</p>
              <p>The
              former Wall Street icon can expect to face a high security experience
              in jail rather than a more lax "prison camp" that other white collar
              criminals might be receive, according to former federal prosecutor
              William Devaney.</p>
              <p>The decision, Devaney told AFP, is not for the judge but the court can make recommendations to the Bureau of Prisons.</p>
              <p>Defense
              attorney Bradley Simon told AFP he thought Madoff would end up "with
              people who have committed other type of offences, more violent..."</p>
              <p>The
              verdict came some six months after the biting economic downturn forced
              Madoff to unmask himself as behind one of the biggest financial scams
              in history.</p>
              <p>Prosecutors say about 13 billion dollars was handed
              to Madoff. The financier himself has talked about losing some 50
              billion dollars, which is believed to be the amount that would have
              been paid out had the funds been properly invested.</p>
              <p>Among
              Madoff's victims were Hollywood celebrities, international movers and
              shakers, some of the world's most famous banks and Jewish charities,
              some of which were forced to close after the scheme unraveled.</p>
              <p>Madoff
              told the court in March that of the billions of dollars that passed
              through his hands during the three-decade scam, he never invested one
              cent in the market. Instead he stashed the funds in a Chase Manhattan
              bank account.</p>
              <p>The funds were then used to pay out "dividends" to investors in what is known as a "Ponzi scheme."</p>
              <p>One
              lingering issue is how to return the stolen funds. Of the billions of
              dollars that were lost, prosecutors say only one billion dollars has
              been recovered.</p>
              <p>The judge deferred the issue of restitution for
              another 90 days to give court-appointed liquidators more time to
              recover the missing funds.</p>

              <p><strong>Jailed Madoff's New York penthouse seized</strong></p>
              <p class="first">NEW YORK (AFP) - - US authorities seized the Manhattan
              penthouse owned by convicted Wall Street swindler Bernard Madoff,
              forcing out his wife Ruth who was still living there.</p>
              <p>"The US marshalls went and seized the property," marshall spokeswoman Nikki Credic confirmed to AFP.</p>
              <p>Madoff
              was sentenced on Monday to 150 years in jail for masterminding what the
              judge described as an "extraordinarily evil" multi-billion-dollar
              investment scam that cheated thousands of people around the world.</p>
              <p>Ruth
              Madoff, who has not been shown to be complicit in her husband's
              elaborate "Ponzi" scheme, released a statement after the sentencing
              that condemned the former Nasdaq chairman's actions.</p>
              <p>On Thursday she "voluntarily left" the seven-million-dollar Manhattan suite after officials arrived, Credic said.</p>
              <p>The
              court ordered Madoff forfeit more than 170 billion dollars in illegally
              obtained assets and in an accompanying order a district court also
              stipulated Ruth Madoff be stripped of 85 million dollars in assets,
              leaving her with 2.5 million dollars in cash.</p>

              <p><strong>Madoff family to be sued over missing billions</strong></p>
              <div class="content">
              <p>NEW YORK (AFP) - – Bernard Madoff claims
              he ran his multi-billion dollar Ponzi scheme alone, but close family
              members face lawsuits this week in a widening probe, the
              government-appointed trustee told CBS television.</p>
              <p>Trustee
              Irving Picard and his chief lawyer David Sheehan told CBS's 60 Minutes
              program that Madoff relatives and many so-called victims profited
              massively.</p>
              <p>For example, Madoff's immediate family used the
              fraudulent investment firm "like a personal piggy bank," Sheehan said,
              while major investors earned billions of dollars -- possibly in full
              knowledge that this was a scam.</p>
              <p>"We've found that there have been quite a few people who have gotten out more than they put in," Picard said.</p>
              <p>Lawsuits
              are expected to be filed by the trustee this week against Madoff's sons
              Mark and Andrew, his brother Peter and niece Shana, CBS reported.</p>
              <p>The
              suits are part of a legal onslaught stretching far beyond Madoff, who
              is serving the first months of a 150-year prison sentence.</p>
              <p>Picard
              is charged with finding where Madoff's billions vanished so that
              genuine victims -- some left penniless after entrusting everything to
              the fraudster -- can be compensated.</p>
              <p>Just before his arrest
              and the collapse of his pyramid scheme in December last year, Madoff
              sent clients a statement claiming his fund was worth about 64.8 billion
              dollars.</p>
              <p>Picard and Sheehan, who rarely talk directly to the
              media, estimate the scheme in reality contained 36 billion dollars.
              They say half of this was disbursed before the collapse, while the
              other 18 billion dollars disappeared.</p>
              <p>So far, Picard has
              snared just 1.5 billion dollars, including revenues from such easy
              targets as luxury residences in Manhattan, Long Island and Florida kept
              by Madoff and his wife Ruth.</p>
              <p>But now the focus is tightening on Madoff's inner circle.</p>
              <p>CBS
              reported that Picard's team found Madoff's sons and brother took out 80
              million dollars in salaries over the last seven years, while Ruth spent
              millions of dollars from company funds for shopping and other
              extravagances.</p>
              <p>Family members were also investors in Madoff's
              fake company, raking in fantastic returns, CBS reported. Mark and
              Andrew, for example, withdrew more than 35 million dollars from
              accounts opened with almost no original investment.</p>
              <p>"Whether
              or not they have a criminal problem we will pursue them as far as we
              can pursue them," Picard warned. "If that leads to bankrupting them --
              then that's what will happen."</p>
              <p>Madoff's family deny
              complicity, as do the thousands of people who put money into the fund,
              then received steady returns from what they were told were legitimate
              investments, but in fact was money stolen from fellow investors.</p>
              <p>Sheehan said the family was too close to Madoff's daily work not to have known about the scam.</p>
              <p>"My
              belief is, yes, they knew, and the reason I believe that is they were
              officers of this -- of these companies, and directors in certain
              instances as well, and also compliance officers in a very highly
              regulated environment."</p>
              <p>"Clearly they would have to have known
              what was going on given their own personal transactions, the longevity
              of what was happening, and the responsibilities as officers," Sheehan
              said.</p>
              <p>Also in the cross-hairs are many of those investors who say they lost money with Madoff.</p>
              <p>Some,
              the officials say, will not only fail to be reimbursed, but may have to
              pay back profit made during the decades that Madoff's fraudulent
              business went undetected.</p>
              <p>Picard said about half of Madoff's
              clients received more in returns than they invested originally, making
              them beneficiaries, not victims.</p>
              <p>"At the end of the day, they
              were in a Ponzi scheme, unfortunately for them. So, all they get (in
              compensation), at best, is what they put in," Sheehan said.</p>
              <p>The
              trustee's main targets, though, are the heavy hitters who, Sheehan
              says, "knew exactly what was going on -- and participated in it."</p>
              <p>One
              of those being sued is billionaire investor and philanthropist Jeffry
              Picower, whose statements from Madoff indicated an astonishing 950
              percent return on his investment, amounting to billions of dollars in
              profits.</p>
              <p>"This is a very, very sophisticated guy. He gets a
              statement like that -- that's off the charts. He doesn't know anything
              about that?" Sheehan asked.</p>
              <p>Another big investor facing a
              lawsuit, Stanley Chais, withdrew more than a billion dollars in profits
              from his Madoff account. Both he and Picower deny wrongdoing.</p>
              <p>Madoff's high rolling wife Ruth has already been brought to heel.</p>
              <p>CBS said she has to report to the trustee any time she spends more than 100 dollars. "She's living very modestly," Picard said.</p>
              <p>Sheehan said ultimately the blame should be spread wide.</p>
              <p>"I think, as everyone, you know, was participating in this, and just feeding at this trough of greed," Sheehan said.</p>
              <p>"What they were looking for was it to continue. They were hoping it was never going to end."</p>
