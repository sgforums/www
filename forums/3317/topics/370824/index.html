              <p><strong><span class="newsTitle">Man who died in Triathlon was fit and had quit smoking</span></strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Lee Wee Sing, 42, died Sunday afternoon after he competed in the swim leg of the OSIM Singapore Triathlon.
              <br> <br> According to a press release, Mr Lee was spotted struggling and
              disoriented during the swim at East Coast Park by a marshal at 1:06pm.
              <br> <br> He was competing in the Olympic Distance Mix/Open relay category.
              <br> <br> He was immediately brought to shore by a jet ski.
              <br> <br>When he reached the shore, he was foaming at the mouth and
              unconscious, and paramedics immediately performed cardio-pulmonary
              resuscitation (CPR) on him.
              <br> <br>Two doctors also rushed to the scene and subsequently took over the
              CPR and applied an automated external defibrillator on Mr Lee.
              <br> <br> He was transferred to the Changi General Hospital (CGH) at 1:25pm
              <br> <br> CGH informed the organisers at 2:35pm that Mr Lee had died.
              <br> <br> The cause of death is under investigation.
              <br> <br> Mr Lee was married with a 12-year-old daughter.
              <br> <br>Mark Tay, President of Triathlon Association, who was at CGH with
              Mr Lee's family said: "At this moment, we are doing our best to render
              the family any assistance they may require in this point in time. We
              are sad that this has happened. We will only be able to share more
              details once the investigation is completed."

              <p><strong>Cause of death of CEO at OSIM triathlon still unknown</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: The cause of death of Lee Wee Sing is still not known.
              The 42-year-old CEO of Deutsche Telekom Asia died on Sunday at the OSIM
              Singapore Triathlon.
              <br> <br>Family members said he was fine before the race. His wife, Choo
              Share Lin, said all was well when she had breakfast with her husband
              before the race.
              <br> <br>According to Madam Choo, Mr Lee started exercising last year after
              he quit smoking. Mr Lee also swam regularly with her in the pool.
              However, he struggled during the 1.5-kilometre swim off the East Coast
              of Singapore.
              <br> <br>Mdm Choo said: "I think the open sea... it was the first time for
              him. During school time, we used to swim in open seas, but doing this
              kind of contest was the first time for him."
              <br> <br>Mr Lee's two team-mates - who were to do the cycling and running
              portions of the race following the swim - said Mr Lee was fit and had
              trained hard for the race, but they gave this warning to other
              first-time participants.
              <br> <br>One of his team-mates, Alan Teo, said: "I think on our own, we had
              been training pretty extensively. He did his running... his swimming.
              He had been swimming literally everyday."
              <br> <br>Another team-mate, Ernest Chia, said: "Being well-prepared is one
              thing, (but) to stretch yourself beyond your threshold is probably
              something you would like to think twice."
              <br> <br>The Singapore Triathlon Association (TAS) is giving moral support
              to the family. The association, which organised the event, said safety
              measures were in place. <br> <br> President of the TAS, Mark Tay, said: "The Water Safety Committee was
              quick enough and went down to the site on Sunday and they had a
              discussion with us to understand the whole incident, how it happened...
              <br> <br>"I'm very sure all the authorities, including TAS and SSC
              (Singapore Sports Council), will look into this and see how we can
              improve further and to prevent such a tragedy from happening again."
              <br> <br>The family of Mr Lee confirmed that it will be a month before the
              coroner will inform them about the cause of Mr Lee's death. Meanwhile,
              his wake is being held at his residence and the funeral will take place
              on Thursday at 11am.
              <br> <br> Mr Lee leaves behind his wife and a nine-year-old daughter.
