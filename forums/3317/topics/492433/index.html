              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Plot to hit Singapore's Marina Bay with rocket from Batam foiled</span></strong></p>
              <div>
              <div>SINGAPORE: Indonesian authorities have arrested six terror suspects, including the group leader who had plans to fire a rocket from Batam in an attack on Singapore’s Marina Bay.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>The men, aged between 19 and 46, were arrested at various locations across Batam. A stash of weapons was found at one of the locations, a housing complex, according to Indonesian media reports.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>The six were allegedly from terrorist group KGR@Katibah GR – whose ringleader Gigih Rahmat Dewa, 31, is said to be behind the plot to attack Marina Bay. </div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>The other five suspects are: Trio Syafrido, 46, a bank employee, and factory workers Eka Saputra, 35; Tarmidzi, 21; Hadi Gusti Yanda, 20; and M Tegar Sucianto, 19. The group is suspected of harbouring two Uighurs, according to Indonesian police.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>“Yes, there were indeed plans for the attack. But the plans did not materialise,” Indonesian national police spokesperson Boy Rafli Amar was quoted in reports as saying.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>The plan to fire the rocket missile from Batam was hatched with the help of Bahrun Naim, an Indonesian fighting for Islamic State in Syria, reports said. Naim is believed to be one of the masterminds of an attack in January in central Jakarta, in which eight people were killed including the four attackers.</div>
              </div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>
              <div>Gigih Rahmat is suspected of receiving and channelling funds for radical activities sourced from Bahrun.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Mr Boy Rafli said police had yet to determine the motive behind the plot or when the suspects were planning to launch the attack with rocket missiles – evidence of which has not been found.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>The suspects are currently being investigated at special counter-terrorism squad Densus 88's headquarters for their involvement in Islamic State's Indonesian terror network.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div><strong>SINGAPORE 'AWARE' OF TERROR PLOT</strong></div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>In response to media queries, Singapore’s Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) said it is aware of the attack plan and has been working with the Indonesian authorities since the discovery of the plot.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>“Our security agencies have been coordinating closely with the Indonesian authorities since the discovery of this attack plot, to monitor the activities of the group and to apprehend those involved. We are grateful for the good cooperation by the Indonesian authorities and their actions to apprehend the group,” the ministry said.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>The Singapore police and other agencies have stepped up inland and border security measures in response to this threat and the “prevailing security situation”, MHA added.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>“This development highlights the seriousness of the terrorism threat to Singapore, and the importance of the SGSecure national movement. The public are advised to remain vigilant.”</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div><strong>PLOT "DOES NOT COME AS A SURPRISE"</strong></div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Singapore Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Law K Shanmugam called on citizens to be "extra alert".</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>"This does not come as a surprise," said Mr Shanmugam. "I have spoken several times, about plans being made in places just outside Singapore, to target Singapore – we were serious about the threats. The attacks can come from terrorists who seek to come into Singapore; and they can come from terrorists who locate themselves just outside Singapore. Our small size increases these risks."</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>"We were aware of the plans being made to attack us with rockets," he added. "We worked closely with the Indonesian authorities. We are grateful for the actions they have taken. This shows the importance of co-operation between countries."</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>"Next week, during National Day, I will be in Indonesia, for a security conference, chaired by Indonesia and attended by Ministers from this region.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>"Our people have to be extra alert. We have to emphasise the importance of SGSecure, and the role that everyone has to play."</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>In comments posted on Facebook, Deputy Prime Minster Teo Chee Hean called on Singaporeans to stay vigilant.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>"This shows the seriousness of the threat we face," said Mr Teo. "We are grateful for the good co-operation by the Indonesian authorities and their actions to apprehend the group."</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>"In response to this threat and the prevailing security situation, Police and other agencies have been stepping up inland and border security measures," he added. "This development highlights the seriousness of the terrorism threat to Singapore, and the importance of the SG Secure national movement."</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>"All of us must remain vigilant," Mr Teo said.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Minister in the Prime Minister's Office Chan Chun Sing also posted comments on Facebook, calling the plot "extremely serious".</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>"It is something that we have been concerned for a long time. With the proliferation of such weapons, coupled with radical terrorist ideology, we can never take our security for granted," said Mr Chan.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>"Our security agencies and the Indonesian counterparts have done well to foil this plot. But we must always remember that we have to get it right, first time every time, all the time; while the attackers only need to get it right one time, anytime. Our safeguard is eternal vigilance by our security agencies and every Singaporean," he added.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>"Even should they ever succeed in their plot, we must never let them destroy our unity or deprive us of our normalcy," Mr Chan said. </div>
