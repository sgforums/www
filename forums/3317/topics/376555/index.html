              <p><strong>Govt’s enhanced marriage and parenthood package not encouraging couples to have more children</strong></p>
              <p>The government's enhanced marriage and parenthood package introduced
              last year has played a significant role in attracting women back to
              work. <br> <br> About 9 in 10 working mothers with young children surveyed said so. <br> <br> But asked if the package would encourage them to have more children, less than half of the 230 women surveyed said yes. <br> <br> The high cost of living, competitive education system and a lack of
              personal space are several reasons for them not wanting to have more
              children. <br> <br> The survey was conducted by the NTUC's Women Development Secretariat to
              assess the impact of the enhanced measures on a woman's decision to go
              back to work, as well as have more kids. <br> <br> The enhanced package provides among other benefits, four months
              maternity leave, up from three and longer child care leave, from two to
              six days a year. <br> <br> While less than half of the women wanted more kids, more than 9 in 10
              of the women generally felt their companies were supportive of female
              employees utilising their maternity and child care leave. <br> <br> Eight in 10 of the women also said they had no problems applying for such leave. <br> <br> However, slightly more than one in 10 percent felt their performance
              appraisals were affected despite the good work they feel they've been
              putting in. <br> <br> Director of the Women's Development Secretariat, Madam Halimah Yacob,
              believes the results show that most employers have adjusted well to the
              enhanced leave benefits. <br> <br> Most also do not hold a women's pregnancy against her in deciding on career advancements. <br> <br> But there will continue to be a minority of employers who practise
              discrimination against pregnant women, Madam Halimah acknowledged. <br> <br> She urged people to speak up against them and make it difficult for them to continue with their ways. <br> <br> Madam Halimah also urged workers to be more understanding of colleagues who are mothers-to-be. <br> <br> Three hundred unionists and HR practitioners who attended a seminar
              this morning on fair employment practices were also encouraged to
              introduce and practise human resource policies that look beyond gender
              or family status.</p>
