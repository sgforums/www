              <p>Entrepreneurship going overboard? STOMPer boyslikesgirls does not think it is socially responsible for this Singaporean guy to 
              create online dating websites where men can pay money for a date with 
              'beautiful women, guaranteed'. <br><br>According to the report in The 
              New Paper today (Jul 31), the ex-Hwa Chong JC boy has set up the 'sugar 
              daddy' website to provide an opportunity for any man, who is able to 
              pay, to date attractive women. <br><br>Singapore-born Brandon Wey has 
              created a stir in the United States for creating several 'sexy' websites
               where 'generous' members can bid for dates with 'attractive' women. <br><br>His latest website is What's Your Price, which tagline reads, 'Everyone has a price, what's your price?'. <br><br>The STOMPer shares:<br><br>"I'm quite stunned to see such a site appear.<br><br>"It's like a social escort online service.<br><br>"Who knows what the people who buy dates will do also.<br><br>"Plus, money can't buy you love!<br><br>"I was even more stunned to see it was created by a Singapore-born person.<br><br>"Entrepreneur-ing? Yes, but...not socially responsible."</p>

              <h1 class="headline">Dating site set up by S’pore-born man draws flak</h1>
              <p>Would you pay up to US$1,000 for a date with an attractive woman?</p>
              <p>That's what dating website WhatsYourPrice.com
               asks -- and believe it or not, tens of thousands of people believe in 
              the idea, either from the payer's or the payee's point of view.</p>
              <p>Singapore-born founder Brandon Wey, 40, now a US citizen, established the US-based website in April.</p>
              <p>Its simple, practical concept, albeit criticised and controversial, 
              has since attracted 50,000 members -- 60 per cent of whom are men -- and
               has helped to arrange more than 10,000 dates, reported <em>The New Paper </em>on Sunday.</p>
              <p>How it works: a member joins one of two categories: "Generous", 
              meaning the member makes monetary offers to people for dates, or 
              "Attractive", where members join with the objective of being paid for a 
              date, if the amount offered is agreeable to both.</p>
              <p>"Attractive" members can 'wink' at "Generous" members they might be interested in to invite them to make offers to them as well.</p>
              <p>"If you're an attractive person, time is very valuable because you 
              get a lot of attention and asked out a lot of the time," explains Wey. 
              "This is an opportunity for you to be compensated," he said.</p>
              <p>He added that the monetary component provides incentives for 
              "attractive" members of the site to give "generous" ones willing to pay 
              enough money a chance at a date.</p>
              <p>"We're turning dating into a free market where the opportunity of a first date can be bought or sold," he said.</p>
              <p>The site earns money by taking a cut of between five and 10 percent 
              of the final agreed-upon price between the "generous" and "attractive" 
              members who agree to a date. The "generous" party then pays the balance 
              to the "attractive" person when they meet.</p>
              <p>News networks such as Gawker and MSNBC and talk shows like The O'Reilly Factor
               have called it "sexist" and "no different from prostitution", but Wey 
              says the controversy and negative attention was what he targeted in 
              choosing the website's name.</p>
              <p>In a survey he conducted to evaluate public opinion of his site, he 
              told the paper from Las Vegas, where he lives, that people were 
              initially offended because of the up-front and "confrontational" style 
              that the site adopted.</p>
              <p>"But after they rationalised it... they realise it's not prostitution," he said. "You're really paying to break the ice."</p>
              <p>Nonetheless, such a situation inevitably sets itself up for 
              dodginess, with users who were spotted seeking regular sugar daddies and
               even partners for threesomes.</p>
              <p>"They can certainly hint at something on their profiles. They are 
              welcome to describe personality or even the kind of fantasies they 
              have," he said, qualifying that they cannot say outright that they are 
              escorts, however, as those will be removed for abuse of the site.</p>
              <p>Wey was quick to add that he has a team of webmasters who have 
              removed hundreds of members who were "scammers" or "cam girls" (girls 
              who sell sex over webcam). He said also that the team checks users' 
              mailboxes in the event of suspicious activity, to find out if site 
              members are asking to be paid for their time.</p>
              <p>There are also users who write on their profiles that they are 
              looking for "discreet affairs", "married dating" and "casual 
              encounters", but Wey says he does not get judgmental.</p>
              <p>"As counter-intuitive as it is, a lot of men use the website to keep 
              their marriage," he said. "It's a challenge a lot of men have. I've gone
               through it myself," added Wey, who is himself divorced from his wife, 
              who is 13 years younger than him.</p>
              <p>"You make a decision to get married because you fall in love. But as 
              you grow older, you earn more money and you have attention from more 
              women. I found it difficult to manage that," he admitted.</p>
              <p>He adds that it is not his job to be a moral judge, and he still 
              thinks it is wrong to cheat, but maintains that he is simply responding 
              to a void in the dating arena.</p>
              <p>"There's a market demand and I'm providing a service," he says.</p>
              <p>The St Andrew's Secondary and Hwa Chong Junior College alumnus runs two other dating sites apart from this one: SeekingArrangement.com, which was labelled by ABC News as a "sugar daddies" dating site, and SeekingMillionaire.com.</p>
              <p>He is looking to expand his network to China, now believing that Asia
               will be more accepting of his concept than the West has been thus far, 
              even though the site has members from a long list of countries.</p>
              <p>"With a website, everything becomes more transparent and honest when it's out there in the open," he said.</p>
              <p>-- Yahoo!</p>
