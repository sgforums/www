              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Former MediaCorp actor Ng Aik Leong, better known as 
              Huang Yiliang, was fined $3,000 on Thursday for hurting a woman who 
              failed to clean up after her dog. </span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The 50-year-old man,
               who left MediaCorp in 2008 and currently owns a production house, 
              pleaded guilty to voluntarily causing hurt.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The altercation took place near Toa Payoh Lorong 2 on May 20, 2011.<br> <br>48-year-old
               Mdm Tan Buay Huang was walking her dog when Ng noticed from inside his 
              car that she did not dispose of her dog's faeces properly.<br> <br>He drove up to her and scolded her for not cleaning up.<br><br>Both
               parties started to quarrel and the incident escalated to the point 
              where Ng and the victim started video-recording and taking pictures of 
              each other with their handphones.<br> <br>The court also heard that Mdm Tan later tried to prevent Ng from leaving by standing in front of his car.<br> <br>Ng then got out of his car, grabbed Mdm Tan's neck and pushed her aside, causing her to fall.<br> <br>He continued taunting her while holding her down forcefully.<br> <br>In
               his mitigation, Ng's lawyer Mr Bala Chandran, said the scuffle arose as
               a result of Mdm Tan's actions rather than Ng's own volition.<br> <br>He added that Ng was "merely doing a civic duty by requesting the victim to pick up her dog's faeces".<br> <br>However,
               in response, Deputy Public Prosecutor Crystal Tan argued that Ng was 
              clearly badgering Mdm Tan by taunting and honking at her.<br> <br>In 
              addition, she said video footage revealed that Ng had admitted he was 
              bothering Mdm Tan intentionally, and even threatening to send her to 
              jail.<br> <br>In sentencing, District Judge Lee Poh Choo addressed the 
              root of the incident, noting that it "arose from the ungracious 
              behaviour of an irresponsible dog owner".<br> <br>While she said that Ng
               was right in confronting Mdm Tan, she added that he had "unfortunately 
              went overboard", and reacted in an "ungentlemanly manner".<br> <br>The court also heard that Mdm Tan, who suffered multiple abrasions, will not be seeking compensation. <br> <br>Ng could have been jailed up to two years, and fined $5,000.<br><br>- CNA/wm</span></span></p>
