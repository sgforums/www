              <p>LAST Friday's report ('JC students branded 'dogs' on Wikipedia') 
              serves as a stiff reminder that we should never take our race relations 
              for granted.</p>
              <p>Recent incidents have shown the damage one can cause by 
              using new media irresponsibly. Over the past few months, we have 
              witnessed errant young people going on new media and hurling insensitive
               remarks against another from a different culture. Under the cloak of 
              anonymity, these comments were made with total disregard for the 
              feelings of others.</p>
              <p>Nanyang Technological University Associate Professor Cherian
               George's view on using new media to make a public stand against 
              offensive speech, we believe, is the way forward in combating such 
              deplorable acts.</p>
              <p>While irresponsible use of new media poses hazards to 
              communal harmony, this same tool, when used positively, can act as an 
              effective form of community policing.</p>
              <div class="ststory_large">
              <li>First, having read such comments online, we must 
              never allow these incidents to scar the precious relationships we have 
              built over the years between our diverse communities. </li>
              <li>Second, we must always respond firmly and 
              clearly demonstrate in these media that we will not tolerate offensive 
              speech in our country. For every few who incite hate speech, there must 
              be thousands rallying to speak up against it. It is through such 
              ground-up actions that we will continue to strengthen racial harmony, 
              both in the real as well as virtual space.
              <p>We are heartened by the school's actions in shutting the 
              site down and taking steps to address the incident. We should take 
              lessons from such instances to continue to cultivate values in our 
              young, not just as educators, but as parents and well-meaning citizens.</p>
              <p>Respect for another fellow human being is basic human 
              courtesy. Our young people need to have this fundamental value of 
              humanity ingrained in them. They must come to understand that we 
              treasure the harmony we have between our diverse communities and racism 
              will never be condoned.</p>
              <p>OnePeople.sg, as the national body for racial harmony, works
               closely with self-help groups, community development councils, the 
              People's Association, government agencies, as well as community and 
              religious organisations to promote the spirit of racial and religious 
              harmony. It is where we passionately celebrate our diversity and core 
              values of our multi-ethnic and multi-religious nation. We urge fellow 
              citizens to join our movement in building these values of respect, 
              understanding and trust in our community.</p>
