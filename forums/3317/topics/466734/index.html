              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: The government has said it is prepared to consider 
              the suggestion by several MPs of giving Singaporeans a role in 
              evaluating applications for Permanent Residency and Citizenship.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Several Members of Parliament had floated the idea during the debate on the estimates for the Prime Minister's Office.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Deputy Prime 
              Minister Teo Chee Hean also addressed suggestions of having Singaporeans
               vouch for or support a person's application or consider factors such as
               being able to speak English or being involved in the community.<br><br>He said the government will study them and is open to other ideas, to fine-tune its framework.<br><br>Parliament has passed the Budget for the Prime Minister's Office<br><br>New
               citizens, Permanent Residents and integration were some of the issues 
              raised during the debate on the budget allocations for the Prime 
              Minister's Office.<br><br>Some MPs said there could be some meaningful roles for the community in the naturalisation of citizens.<br><br>MP
               for Jurong GRC Ang Wei Neng suggested that PRs be required to obtain 
              some form of community endorsement,  before clinching the Singapore 
              Citizenship that they want.  <br><br>Mr Ang said: "We could consider 
              requiring applicants for Singapore Citizenship, after satisfying the 
              current eligibility criteria, to further obtain endorsements from the 
              community. This could be in the form of obtaining endorsements from 10 
              Singaporean "community assentors" who are the applicant's acquaintances 
              in the workplace and in the neighbourhood.<br><br>"For the "assentors" 
              scheme to work, we need some rules, guidelines and safeguards to ensure 
              impartiality, fairness and to preempt undesirable implications such as 
              bribery, malpractices."<br><br>Describing the proposal as an interesting
               one, Minister in the Prime Minister's Office Grace Fu said the 
              government will consider it. <br><br>Ms Fu said: "Ultimately, effective 
              and sustainable integration can only be achieved when sincere 
              relationships are forged between new immigrants and Singaporeans. The 
              numerous opportunities in our daily lives to cultivate and nurture these
               relationships are therefore the most crucial element in the integration
               process. <br><br>"We therefore seek the support and participation of 
              everyone, both Singaporeans and new immigrants, so that we can maintain 
              the cohesion in our diverse society and safeguard our values and norms."<br><br>Singaporeans
               were also assured that the Long Term Visit Pass Plus in no way 
              disadvantages a foreign spouse's application for Permanent Residence or 
              Singapore citizenship.<br><br>Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean said: 
              "A foreign spouse will be eligible to be considered for LTVP+ if the 
              married couple has at least one Singaporean child from their marriage. 
              For those without a Singaporean child, we will look at other factors 
              such as the duration of marriage. A marriage of at least three years 
              will be considered more favourably. Each application will be considered 
              on its own merits."<br><br>But Singapore's not prepared to allow dual 
              citizenships as the government explained that it's important for 
              Singaporeans to have a long-term commitment to building a future 
              together here and having a second citizenship is unlikely to enhance 
              that commitment but could dilute it.<br><br>- CNA/de</span></span></p>

              The elites are not concern of the unfair practice in employment as this only happen to the Lesser Mortals, whereas the high up circle are well protected.  If they are really concern, if such thing happen, they should take action instead of just give a "stern warning" and close the case.  How about revoke the person PR/employment permit if they are the one that practice such unfair practice as so far most of the case that I notice, when the HR/decision maker for hiring is a foreigner, he/she will just hire his/her country fellows.  When MOM take a serious stand on this and a few lose their PR/work permit due to such unfair practice, then the other will not risk to practice this anymore.  When our elites come out some laws against Singaporean, they always come out some punishment, as they believe "if there is no punishment,rules will be broken."  How come they don't do this when it concern FT?

              <p>Simple.   They are for foreigners.    Can you still remember there was a long period of time they keep blaming Singaporeans for almost everything?  for eg, blame singaporeans on job hunting and praise foreigners for they are better than singaporeans.</p>

              <p>Simple.   They are for foreigners.    Can you
              still remember there was a long period of time they keep blaming
              Singaporeans for almost everything?  for eg, blame
              singaporeans on job hunting and praise foreigners for they are
              better than singaporeans.</p>

              I had mention that please don't blame the foreigner on these as this is human nature, I had work overseas before and when there an opening to hire someone, I would love to hire someone in Singapore (reason will be culture/working style etc will be the same, therefore will be easier for me to manage the new staffs), however most of the time, their govt policy will not allow it.  Since SG policy allow this, of course as the FT will prefer to hire their country fellow (they will be more extreme compare to Singaporean on this as most still have the village mindset).  Since the whole issue come from the policy and the majority of the Singaporean agree with the policy, why complain about this.

                  It is past experience and not past problem and I am quoting it to indicated that the problem lied in the policies which are agree by the majority of the singaporeans.  And so who to be blame on all this, even if it is true that the govt blame the singaporeans as what you claim.  Whose fault is this?  The majority of the singaporeans deserved this as they had given the elites the mandate.  The people deserved the govt they have.  Is this so difficult to understand this part.  I had heard many singaporeans cry father cry mother on how unfair the policies are, which I agree, yet when I asked that who did you vote for?  Most of the answer is the same (and you can guess), Since they had given the mandate, why complain.

              Which part of the post did I vent my anger?  I am just stating the facts that there no pointing finger here or not as the majority of the Singaporean agree with this.  And since the majority had agree, why the non stop complain.  After all it is the choice that the people make.
