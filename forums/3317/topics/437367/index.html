              <p><strong>ION Orchard hit by waste-water leak</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: ION Orchard suffered a waste-water leak that closed off one section of its shopping complex on Sunday.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The leak was 
              confined to two high-end stores facing the main street and both the 
              Louis Vuitton and Dior outlets have been temporarily closed.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The area was cordoned off and cleaning was underway when Channel NewsAsia visited the scene in the afternoon.<br><br>A strong smell of waste water lingered in the air.<br><br>The
               management of ION Orchard said the leak was discovered earlier in the 
              day between 8am and 9am, and the flow was strongest at noon.<br><br>Eyewitness
               Muhd Syahrul Nizam, who was there around 3pm, said: "You can smell 
              the... smelly smell. (At) the shop, Dior, water was dripping from the 
              ceiling.<br><br>"You could see from the outside, water was flowing down 
              towards the main street. From what I can see (the water) it's clear, but
               you can smell the water and you know it's not clean water."<br><br>ION Orchard traced the leak to a choked internal pipe at Lobby B of the building, next to the Louis Vuitton store.<br><br>It said the pipe carried waste water from its air-conditioning system and upper floor kitchens.<br><br>Muhd
               Syahrul Nizam said: "They better do a check on the whole entire 
              building, see all the pipes. You never know! You may be having your 
              lunch or dinner, and then suddenly the ceiling will just gush out all 
              this 'wonderful' smelling water!"<br><br>However, many shoppers were oblivious to the problem.<br><br>"We....were inside and we tried to come out and it was blocked, on both floors, but we don't know what happened," said a woman.<br><br>She added she did not smelled anything.<br><br>"We
               actually thought it was construction (works), and we were surprised; we
               thought to ourselves 'how come they're doing all these construction on a
               Sunday!'" said a man.<br><br>It is not the first time ION Orchard has been hit by leaks.<br><br>A sewage leak in July last year closed off the Jewellery Street section at basement two of the mall.<br><br>ION Orchard said the clean-up will be completed by the end of Sunday.<br><br>It is working closely with affected shops to enable their re-opening as soon as possible. <br><br>It is also investigating the root cause of the problem.<br><br>- CNA/ir</span></span></p>
