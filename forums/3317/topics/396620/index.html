              <p>Â </p>
              <p>KICKING of the head is now only allowed for taekwondo contestants 
              aged 18 and above, following the tragic death of a 17-year-old 
              polytechnic student during a competition last July.</p>
              <p>The Singapore Taekwondo Gymnasium (STG) issued a set of new 
              guidelines on Sept 9, two months after the incident at Kampung Kembangan
               Community Centre where Mr Vincent Tan collapsed while he was sparring 
              with his 15-year-old opponent.</p>
              <p>Previously, the STG's competition guidelines and house rules
               allowed senior contestants of 15 years and above to head kick. Under 
              the new guidelines, an ambulance will be on stand-by at the site of the 
              competition to ferry the injured to hospital.</p>
              <p>The July 5 competition was organised by Kampong Kembangan 
              Community Centre and Greenville Residents' Committee. Mr Tan, a blue 
              belt holder, was one of the contestants in the open category that day. 
              His opponent was 15 and holding a higher grade of brown belt.</p>
              <p>A video of the fight, shown at a coroner's inquiry into Mr 
              Tan's death, showed Mr Tan kicking the body pad of his opponent, who 
              kicked him back. That turning kick landed at Mr Tan's head guard.</p>
              <p>Mr Tan was seen adjusting his head guard before wobbling and
               subsequently collapsing onto the ground. He was conveyed to Changi 
              General Hospital and died four days later. A blood vessel in the neck 
              had broken, causing a blood clot in the head and swelling his brain.</p>
              <p>The inquiry continues.</p>

              <p><strong>Doc says case is 'very unique'</strong></p>
              <p>A DOCTOR who attended to a 17-year-old polytechnic student after he 
              was injured at a taekwondo tournament has described the case as 'very 
              unique'.</p>
              <p>Dr Carol Lee Wei Hsin, Registrar of the emergency department of 
              Changi General Hospital, said from her experience and reading 
              literature, there were very few cases of a ruptured carotid artery at a 
              sports event.</p>
              <p>CT scans showed that Mr Vincent Tan Sze Hao's neck artery 
              had ruptured, causing massive amount of blood to rush into the brain and
               collect. Despite an operation, Mr Tan died four days later after he was
               kicked by his 15-year-old opponent he was sparring with at Kampong 
              Kembangan community centre last July 5.</p>
              <p>The championship was jointly organised by Kampong 
              Ubi-Kembangan Citizens Consultative Committee and the Greenville 
              Residents' Committee, and supported by the Singapore Taekwondo 
              Gymnasium. Mr Tan was a blue belt holder while the 15-year-old had a 
              brown belt, one notch higher than his.</p>
              <p>Dr Lee said from the history and CT scan findings, the 
              outcome of the patient was unavoidable. His prognosis was very poor even
               on arrival at the emergency department, she added on the stand.</p>
              <p>Asked by State Counsel Adrian Loo if it would have made a 
              difference in the way she treated the patient if she were present at the
               scene, she said she did not think it would make any difference as there
               were many possible causes of the patient to collapse. She would still 
              need equipment, medication support of the scan to help her reach the 
              diagnosis.</p>
              <p>State Coroner Victor Yeo is expected to adjourn verdict to 
              another day.</p>
