              <p>Singapore Press Holdings
               (SPH) has dismissed a senior executive after he voluntarily admitted to
               receiving illegal payments and misappropriating shopping vouchers 
              handled by his Editorial Projects Unit.</p>
              <p>According to a SPH statement on Thursday, police are conducting investigations on 47-year-old Peter Khoo Chong Meng, a 22-year veteran of the media group and a vice-president in the English &amp; Malay Newspapers Division.</p>
              <p>Mr Khoo has reportedly repaid S$196,500 for payments he admitted to receiving illegally and for the vouchers he misappropriated.</p>
              <p>The vouchers were intended for branding and promotion activities of 
              The Straits Times, which his Editorial Projects Unit organises.</p>
              <p>The illegal payments are believed to be related to external vendors 
              who provided souvenirs, gifts, T-shirts and various goodie items.</p>
              <p>The news came to light after the married father of one confessed to 
              his editors earlier this week what he had done. It’s not clear over how 
              long his offences took place or if they would have been discovered at 
              all if he had not come forward.</p>
              <p>Mr Khoo also chaired the organising committee which coordinates events and activities to raise funds for The Straits Times School Pocket Money Fund (STPMF). He has been replaced in this role with immediate effect.</p>
              <p>As the Unit organises fund-raising activities for the STPMF, SPH said
               that, to the best of the company’s knowledge, none of the donations 
              made to the Fund were misappropriated.</p>
              <p>The Fund, which celebrates its 10th anniversary this year, helps 
              needy children with education and living costs in Singapore. Over the 
              past 10 years, the Fund has raised a total of $30 million through 
              various campaigns.  </p>
              <p>As recently as July this year, Khoo launched its Help-A-Kid coin bank campaign, which encouraged Singaporeans to purchase 50,000 coin banks at $5 each to help the less fortunate. </p>
              <p>The money collected by STPMF is kept in an account with the National Council of Social Service (NCSS), who in turn disburses the funds out to needy students. </p>
              <p>When contacted by The Straits Times, Khoo declined comment and said 
              his lawyers have advised him to refrain from making any statement. </p>
              <p>In a statement, SPH chief executive officer Alan Chan said: “SPH 
              takes a serious view of the matter. We are reviewing our internal 
              processes and will do whatever is necessary to tighten our procedures in
               all aspects, including that of the Pocket Money Fund. Our external 
              auditors have also been informed.”</p>
              <p>Chief editor of the newspaper, Han Fook Kwang, was also quoted as 
              saying, “This is a big setback for us. While we do not believe the STPMF
               was involved, I would like to assure our many donors and supporters 
              that it is our top priority to maintain the integrity of the Straits 
              Times Pocket Money Fund.”</p>
              <p>An editor with the media group, who declined to be named, told Yahoo! Singapore his initial reaction was one of shock.</p>
              <p>“I heard his(Khoo’s) staff were in tears. I’m surprised why a man of 
              his level would succumb to greed. I mean, it’s $200k, it’s not worth 
              losing your career over, especially, when he earns about $15k a month,” 
              he said.</p>
              <p>“His staff were disappointed because he always nagged them about 
              being prudent and cost-conscious and about being honest when dealing 
              with clients,” he added.</p>
              <p>Asked if he thought more than one could be involved, he said,” I 
              don’t think so. And it did not involve the ST Pocket Money Fund, which 
              he was in charge of.”</p>
              <p>Another sub-editor within the group, who requested to remain anonymous, said it was “disheartening” to hear the news.</p>
              <p>“People are losing confidence in charities and fundraising and to 
              have someone from the organisation embroiled in this is disheartening,” 
              she said.</p>
              <p>“Given that he was a journalist with the national paper makes it 
              worse because we tend to expect more from people of this profession,” 
              she added. </p>
              <p>Another SPH magazine editor said he was “disappointed that someone who earns so much still wants to steal.”</p>

              <p><strong>Ex-SPH exec grilled by cops</strong></p>
              <p>FORMER SPH senior executive Peter Khoo Chong Meng, 47, was hauled in for police questioning on Friday.</p>
              <p>He was grilled at Tanglin Police Division Headquarters for about 
              seven hours, from about noon following his admission to taking illegal 
              payments and shopping vouchers.</p>
              <p>Mr Khoo, dressed in a dark brown shirt, emerged from the police 
              building at about 7pm and hurried to a black Toyota Camry, declining to 
              speak to the waiting reporters.</p>
              <p>The senior vice-president in the English and Malay Newspaper Division
               of Singapore Press Holdings (SPH) confessed to receiving illegal 
              payments and misappropriating shopping vouchers meant for branding and 
              promotion activities earlier this week.</p>
              <p>He has made restitution amounting to $196,500.</p>
              <p>The news shocked everyone who knew Mr Khoo as the public 
              face of The Straits Times Pocket Money Fund, the newspaper's 10-year-old
               charity which provides financial assistance to needy students. Police 
              investigations are ongoing.</p>
