              <p>Johor Baru (The Star/ANN) - A Malaysian factory worker who claimed 
              that he scratched his "itchy" private part in front of a neighbour by 
              accident paid the price for his act.</p>
              <p>Ahmad Hairul Nizam Hussin, 23, was fined RM1,500 (US$492) in default 
              three months' jail by magistrate Mazana Sinin after he pleaded guilty to
               outraging the modesty of the 41-year-old school teacher. He paid the 
              fine.</p>
              <p>The accused was charged with exposing his private part to the victim 
              who lived in an opposite flat unit at Taman Pelangi Indah. He did this 
              at around 6am on Oct 8, 2009.</p>
              <p>According to court documents, Ahmad Hairul, who was in his room, had
               exposed his genitals to the woman who was hanging clothes along the 
              corridor of her home.</p>
              <p>In mitigation, the accused said he always kept his room window open.</p>
              <p>"I had just taken a shower and went into my room to change my clothes," he told the court.</p>
              <p>"I suddenly felt itchy and scratched my private part, but I didn't know she was watching me," he said.</p>
              <p>DPP Chua Shyue Chien prosecuted while the accused was not represented.</p>
              <p>In another case, a construction worker was sentenced to five months' jail after he pleaded guilty to threatening his wife.</p>
              <p>T. Sadivaran, 26, was accused of threatening to beat his wife to 
              death at their home in Taman Sri Putri, Skudai at around 7pm on Feb 20.</p>
              <p>He was charged under Section 506 of the Penal Code with criminal 
              intimidation which carries a maximum two years' jail, fine, or both upon
               conviction.</p>
