              <p>Senior Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Dr Balaji Sadasivan, who
               was battling colon cancer, died early on Monday morning. He was 55.</p>
              <p>Foreign Minister George Yeo broke the news of his death in a Twitter 
              message just before 10.30 am on Monday. 'Mourns the passing away of dear
               friend and colleague Dr Balaji Sadasivan,' he twitted.</p>
              <p>Dr Balaji had surgery at Gleneagles Hospital on Sept 23, 2008 to remove a cancerous tumour in the colon.</p>
              <p>Before he entered politics in 2001 as a PAP candidate, he was a neurosurgeon at Gleneagles Hospital.</p>
              <p>Soon after, he was elected as an MP for Ang Mo Kio GRC. 
              He was appointed minister of state for health and environment in 
              November 2001.</p>
              <p>From May 2006 to March this year, he was senior minister
               of state for foreign affairs and information, communications and the 
              arts. In April, his responsibility was confined to the ministry of 
              foreign affairs.</p>
              <p>Dr Balaji leaves behind his wife and two children.</p>

              <p>Poor Minister Balaji, done in by his own undoing.</p>
              <p>Moral of the story, U don't need a strong mandate, nor any mandate for that matter to do good. If U are certain about what is good, don't wait, just do it.</p>
              <p>If U really need permission to do what is good, just ask nicely, but never threaten and never assume yourself as indispensable for the good of all.</p>

              <p><strong>'An energetic leader'</strong></p>
              <p>PRESIDENT Nathan's condolence letter to Dr Balaji's widow, Dr Ma Swan Hoo:</p>
              <p>Dear Mrs Balaji,</p>
              <p>My wife and I are deeply saddened to learn of the sudden passing away of Dr Balaji this morning.</p>
              <p>He gave up his distinguished career as a neurosurgeon to 
              serve Singapore and its people. In his nine years in public office, he 
              contributed much in the different areas of Health, Transport, 
              Information, Communications and the Arts, and Foreign Affairs. He died 
              suddenly and much too soon before he could fulfil all his missions to 
              the nation and the community. I did not have the slightest suspicion 
              that his end was so close. If there was one fated to work to death, Dr 
              Balaji was indeed one. He knew no rest. While engaging deeply in one 
              activity - Sinda - he was already deeply involved in another - the 
              setting up of the Indian Heritage Centre. There must also be many other 
              areas in public life, in his service as a Member of Parliament, and at 
              various grassroots levels, that he devoted all his energy on.</p>
              <p>Through his work in Sinda and other Indian community 
              organisations, he brought about greater synergy among the Indian 
              community organisations so that they could work actively to complement 
              each other. In Sinda, he spent many hours and never hesitated, despite 
              his illness, to drop by to discuss matters as they arose. He introduced 
              other key initiatives as an adviser to several key Indian organisations 
              and steered a large part of the Indian community to active citizenry and
               community activities.</p>
              <p>I have personally known Dr Balaji over the years. He always 
              struck me as a thoughtful and extremely well-read person blessed with a 
              turn of mind that was sharp and penetrating. He was also passionate and 
              went to great lengths to pursue whatever interested him. This trait he 
              applied to whatever tasks he was given, and he took pains to tirelessly 
              cover whatever aspects, in his usual meticulous way. His research and 
              deep understanding of Indian history and culture were little known 
              beyond his friends.</p>
              <p>Singapore and the Indian community have lost a great and 
              passionate man who provided leadership and purpose in all that he 
              undertook. I have lost a close personal friend. I want to convey to you 
              and the family the deepest condolences of my wife and me and our hope 
              that you will bravely face the void that he has left in your lives.</p>
              <p>Yours sincerely,</p>
              <p>S R Nathan</p>

              <p><strong>'A sad loss to all'</strong></p>
              <p>TWO weeks ago, Dr Balaji Sadasivan had already begun wrapping up his 
              affairs as his lengthy battle with cancer took a turn for the worse.</p>
              <p>The Ang Mo Kio GRC MP had made arrangements for his division, Cheng 
              San-Seletar, to be taken care of in his absence. He had put plans in 
              place for grassroots renewal.</p>
              <p>He seemed to have had a feeling that his two-year battle was reaching
               its end. When he finally succumbed early yesterday morning, he left his
               house in order.</p>
              <p>'He asked me to see these plans through if anything happened
               to him. He also thanked me for having given him the opportunity to 
              serve,' Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said in a condolence letter to Dr
               Balaji's wife.</p>
              <p>'I was very touched that, despite his illness, his mind was 
              still on his responsibilities to residents. His untimely passing is a 
              sad loss to all of us.'</p>
              <p>Dr Balaji, who is also Senior Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, died of advanced colon cancer at age 55.</p>
              <p>He had been ill since 2008, when he underwent an operation 
              to remove a malignant tumour. Since then, he had been receiving regular 
              treatment.</p>

              <p><strong>'A man of conviction'</strong></p>
              <p>AN EXTRACT from Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's condolence letter to Dr Balaji's widow, Dr Ma:</p>
              <p>'There was a conviction and finality to Balaji. When he first entered
               politics, we encouraged him to continue seeing patients, to keep his 
              hand in as a surgeon.</p>
              <p>But Balaji soon gave this up. He explained that it would not be fair 
              to his patients, as his knowledge and skills would not be current.</p>
              <p>He had weighed the options and decided to switch from 
              medicine to politics, knowing fully the risks and consequences. He would
               give politics his all. It was a typically clear-minded decision.</p>
              <p>Two years ago, Balaji took ill while in the Middle East. He 
              had been travelling intensively on MFA business. When told of his colon 
              cancer, he received the news calmly, though as a doctor he knew what it 
              meant.</p>
              <p>He researched the drugs and treatments that he was receiving with scientific detachment, and remained cheerful and positive.</p>

              <p><strong>SM Goh says he was impressed by and grateful for Dr Balaji's attitude of service</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong said he was "impressed 
              by Dr Balaji Sadasivan's attitude of service, and grateful that he had 
              stepped forward to be counted." </span></p>
              <p><span> Dr Balaji, who was Senior Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, died on Monday. He was 55 years old. </span></p>
              <p><span>In a </span> condolence letter<span> to Dr Balaji's wife, Dr Ma Swan Hoo, Mr Goh said he had expected Dr 
              Balaji's death as Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong had told him about his 
              declining condition in Parliament two weeks ago.
              <br> <br> Mr Goh said he did not see Dr Balaji in Parliament then but he last had lunch with him in May.
              <br> <br> Mr Goh said he and his colleagues interviewed Dr Balaji to become a PAP 
              candidate in 2001, and found him "eminently suitable, given his high 
              intellect, character and sincerity."
              <br> <br> They felt he could make a bigger contribution to Singapore than being a neurosurgeon.
              <br> <br> Mr Goh said they left the decision to Dr Balaji as there was no 
              guarantee he would become a minister. But Dr Balaji decided to serve in 
              whatever position he was assigned.
              <br> <br> Mr Goh said: "When he was not promoted to minister, he said, 'no 
              problem, so long as I could serve, I would serve'. And we valued his 
              attitude, his dedication to his work. 
              <br> <br> "Of course, on the ground, (he's a) very good MP, very popular with his 
              constituents, (and he) worked very closely with the grassroots leaders. 
              But his life had come to an end - a loss to the party, a loss to 
              Singapore, and a big loss to the family." </span></p>

              <p>President S R Nathan hopes more young Singaporeans can emulate Dr Balaji Sadasivan.</p>
              <p>Even though he was a top neurosurgeon, Dr Balaji was prepared to work with people at the grassroots level. <br> <br> Speaking to reporters this afternoon at Cheng San Community Club where 
              he paid respects to the late Dr Balaji, President Nathan said Dr Balaji 
              was a rare individual. <br> <br> He also described him as an "intellectually honest person", devoted to what he was doing. <br> <br> The funeral for the late Dr Balaji will be held tomorrow at the Mandai Crematorium at 3.45 pm.</p>

              <p><strong>Hundreds send off Balaji</strong></p>
              <p>HUNDREDS of people lined the road outside the Cheng San Community 
              Club to bid a final goodbye to the late Senior Minister of State for 
              Foreign Affair Balaji Sadasivan on Thursday afternoon.</p>
              <p>They bowed their heads as his cortege passed by, in the final journey through the ward where he was an MP of Ang Mo Kio GRC.</p>
              <p>Many were residents and housewives from the nearby flats who
               made time to pay their last respects. Even construction workers stopped
               work as a mark of respect to the minister who died of advance colon 
              cancer on Monday. He was 55.</p>
              <p>Many also followed cortege procession, including an elderly woman in a
               wheelchair and several mothers pushing their babies in prams.</p>
              <p>Earlier, more than 100 grassroots leaders and residents 
              turned up at the Community Club to pay their final respects before the 
              body was moved to Mandai Crematorium for a funeral service.</p>
              <p>Among them were 20 members of the Singapore Indian 
              Development Association (Sinda), of which the late Senior Minister of 
              State for Foreign Affairs was the President.</p>
