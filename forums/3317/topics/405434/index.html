              <p> </p>
              <p><span id="ctl00_body_spnBody">1) Israel was established in reaction to the massacre of Jews during the World War 2. Israel was a project approved in the First Zionist Congress in Basel,
              Switzerland, in 1897, when nationalist Jews decided to occupy Palestine.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span id="ctl00_body_spnBody">2) The Jews are returning to
              their forefathers' land after been driven away in 70
              A.D. Famous Israeli historian
              Shlomo Sand and other historians said there was no "exodus," so "return" is meaningless. The people living in
              Palestine have not left their land in the ancient era. <br> <br>Descendents of Jews residing in Palestine are the
              people who are currently living in Palestine. Those who claim they want
              to return to their lands originate from Western and Eastern Europe and
              Northern Africa. <br> <br>Sand says there is no Jewish nation. The Jews do not have common
              history, language or culture. The only common thing between them is
              their religion, and religion does not make a nation</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span id="ctl00_body_spnBody">3) When Jewish immigrants occupied Palestine, it was an empty and uninhibited country. 
              <br> <br>However, there are documents and evidences that prove that in the
              19th century the agricultural products of Palestine were exported to
              different countries as well as a sizeable Arab population.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span id="ctl00_body_spnBody">4) The Palestinians left their country on their own free will. Israeli historians like Benny Morris and Ilan Pappe said
              that Palestinians were driven away and banished from their lands by
              using force and terror. </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span id="ctl00_body_spnBody">5) It is said that today Israel is the
              only democracy in the Middle East and it should be protected; it is the
              "government of law." <br> <br>Yet it is
              the only regime that no law defines its territory and boundaries. All countries have a constitution which defines their
              boundaries, but no such thing applies to Israel. Israel is an
              expansionist project and its law is completely
              racist; according to this law Israel is the country for Jews, and its
              non-Jew citizens are not considered human. </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span id="ctl00_body_spnBody">When one talks about these facts and the
              history of Israel, they call you anti-Semite to keep you silent. Yet they do not believe in
              the equality of Jews, Christians and Muslims, and destroys the peace
              between followers of different religions.
              <br> <br>The mass media say that Palestinians cause violence and
              terrorism but it was Israel's occupation of Palestine that is violent, stealing land from Palestinians that is violent. <br> </span></p>

              <p>If these were facts, by right they shouldn't even exist. Any country in the world to approve of them are downright ignorant.</p>
              <p>Its a bloody invasion just like how the foreigners will one day occupy Singapore. Except in our case its an inside job done by inside people rather than a direct invasion.</p>

                  and their wealth. He

              <p>Medina was once Jewish land too. Have you ever wonder how it become the second holiest city in Islam?</p>
              <p>The Jewish tribe was <strong>Banu Qurayza.</strong>They lived in Yathrib, now 
                  known as Medina. The tribe was massacred by the Muslim Arabs and their lands and valuables 
                  were taken.</p>
              <p>As for verse 48:22, The Arabs were always promised abundant spoils that they will capture.</p>
              <p>The land of Israel is home to the Jews all along. Now that they have reclaimed it, they need not wonder anymore. It won't happen again.</p>

              <p>I'm no expert. Its just common sense for people of whatever religion not to read stuff out of context. Quoting a verse without really understanding the situation behind the verse could make the verse look different.</p>

              <p>Also, not all hadiths are reliable. Hadiths are subject to authenticity. Heck you could even go around acting like some holy man and mislead people with your own version of stuff. Some don't even use them to read them in context becoz they aren't even part of the book. </p>

              <p>That's usual. Always the same excuses. Quran verses quoted out of context lah, sources from unreliable hadiths lah ......</p>
              <p>Quotes are from authentic English translation of Quran and Hadith books e.g. Sahih Bukhari. If you disagree, you have issues with the authors of the books, not me.</p>
              <p>Why don't you  quote from the authentic hadiths to support your claims instead of responding in a wishy washy manner?</p>
              <p>I am very positive that together, we can put any conspiracy theory or blatant lie to rest.</p>
