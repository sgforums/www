              <p><strong>Bangkok CBD crippled</strong></p>
              <p>BANGKOK - THE Thai capital's main financial district was partially 
              crippled on Friday following deadly grenade attacks and a tense standoff
               between die-hard, anti-government demonstrators and a government that 
              has yielded vital areas of Bangkok to them.</p>
              <p>Many banks, offices, restaurants and a major shopping complex were 
              closed along Silom Road, known as Thailand's Wall Street.</p>
              <p>Traffic was light in the normally jammed four-lane 
              thoroughfare, and even many small-time food vendors had left their 
              patches of pavement.</p>
              <p>The late-night attacks involved five M-79 grenades shot from
               near where anti-government Red Shirt protesters have been encamped for 
              weeks, and the blasts struck areas where counter-demonstrators gathered,
               but the government stopped short of directly blaming the Red Shirts.</p>
              <p>The late-night attacks killed at least one person and 
              wounded 86, according to the government's Erawan Emergency Center, which
               handles victim counts in crises and disasters.</p>
              <p>The head of a key security agency, Tharit Pengdit, urged the
               general public to avoid the area near the protests and warned that 
              anyone involved in 'terrorism' will face the death penalty. -- AP</p>

              <p><strong>Officials consider demands</strong></p>
              <p>BANGKOK - THAI government officials huddled on Saturday to consider a
               peace overture by tens of thousands of protesters demanding elections 
              in an increasingly deadly six-week street rally in Bangkok.</p>
              <p>The red-shirted supporters of ousted former premier Thaksin 
              Shinawatra said on Friday they will end a three-week occupation of 
              Bangkok's ritzy shopping district if the government dissolved parliament
               and called elections in 30 days, softening a previous demand for 
              immediate polls.</p>
              <p>It was unclear whether the military-backed government of 
              embattled Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva would agree to that 
              timetable. Analysts say he is running out of options after weeks of 
              unrest by protesters who have gained a clear upper hand.</p>
              <p>'The government might have to agree to a three-month 
              timeframe, but this doesn't mean this will ease the tensions,'said Pitch
               Pongsawat, a political scientist at Chulalongkorn University. 'There 
              doesn't seem to be any real control about what's been happening on the 
              streets.' Thai government officials were meeting on Saturday to consider
               the red shirts offer after talks with protest leaders late on Friday.</p>
              <p>Underscoring the tension, a series of grenade blasts killed 
              one person and wounded 88 on Thursday in the heart of Bangkok's business
               district. The risk of further violence remains high. Thousands of armed
               troops keep watch over red shirts at a city intersection. Royalist 
              pro-government protesters often gather outside their barricade, sparking
               minor clashes.</p>
              <p>Among their new demands, the red shirts want Abhisit to 
              begin an independent probe into a clash that killed 25 people and 
              wounded hundreds in a failed attempt to disperse the protesters on April
               10, and for troops to withdraw from their protest site. The demands 
              came shortly after army chief Anupong Paochinda offered an olive leaf of
               his own, telling commanders there would be no crackdown on the 
              protesters camped out in the capital because it would do more harm than 
              good. -- REUTERS</p>

              <p><strong>Abhisit to address Thailand</strong></p>
              <p>BANGKOK - THAILAND'S prime minister and army chief are set to address
               the nation Sunday, due to outline their plans for handling the 
              political crisis after rejecting a compromise offer from protesters.</p>
              <p>General Anupong Paojinda joined premier Abhisit Vejjajiva for his 
              pre-recorded weekly TV address, due to be aired at 9:00 am Thai time 
              (0200 GMT or 10am Singapore time). The address had been cancelled for 
              the past two weeks with no reason given.</p>
              <p>It comes after hopes for an agreement to end weeks of 
              protests, which have been punctuated by deadly street clashes, were 
              dashed as Abhisit on Saturday ruled out the 'Red Shirts' offer to 
              disperse if polls were called in 30 days.</p>
              <p>'No, I reject it. Because they use violence and 
              intimidation, I cannot accept this,' Abhisit said of the proposal which 
              would have seen a ballot held in 90 days and was a softening of earlier 
              demands for snap polls.</p>
              <p>'The dissolution (of parliament) must be done for the 
              benefit of the entire country, not just for the Red Shirts, and it must 
              be done at the right time,' he told reporters.</p>
              <p>In an immediate response, the Reds said they would now 
              prepare for a military crackdown to clear their heavily fortified rally 
              encampment which has paralysed Bangkok's upscale district for three 
              weeks.</p>
              <p>'Abhisit has ordered a crackdown on protesters within 48 
              hours, that is the information I have learned,' said Reds leader 
              Nattawut Saikuar. -- AFP</p>

              <p><strong>Abhisit address interrupted</strong></p>
              <p>BANGKOK - A HIGHLY anticipated television address by Thailand's prime
               minister and army chief went blank for several minutes Sunday after an 
              unidentified party interrupted the satellite signal, officials said.</p>
              <p>The pre-taped address, by Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva and 
              General Anupong Paojinda, began at 0200 GMT (10am Singapore time) but 
              after a short while, the television station it was being broadcast on 
              went off the air.</p>
              <p>'Someone has interrupted the satellite signal,' government 
              minister Sathit Wongnongtoey told reporters. Several minutes later, the 
              television station went back on the air and began screening the 
              programme again from the start.</p>
              <p>Abhisit and Anupong were expected to detail their plans for

              <p><strong>Abhisit declares crackdown</strong></p>
              <p>BANGKOK - THAI authorities will retake the anti-government protest 
              site in Bangkok, the prime minister Abhisit Vejjajiva said Sunday in a 
              television address made with the army chief, without disclosing when.</p>
              <p>The 'Red Shirts' rally encampment has for three weeks occupied the 
              Ratchaprasong intersection in the heart of Bangkok's retail district. 
              The protesters fear a crackdown is looming.</p>
              <p>Mr Abhisit said: 'There will be a retaking of Ratchaprasong 
              but the process, the measures, how and when it will be done, we cannot 
              disclose because it depends on several things. The solution process is 
              ongoing but may not please everyone. The government, and not only the 
              military, is preparing to be ready for what would lead to the next 
              level. I admit, I didn't expect to see such a force ready to go this 
              far.'</p>
              <p>Army chief General Anupong Paojinda appeared alongside the 
              premier in an apparent gesture to show they are united, after Anupong 
              earlier this week indicated he was extremely reluctant to launch a 
              crackdown.</p>
              <p>'We are an army for the nation, for the monarchy and for the
               people. We will do our job without taking sides. We will follow 
              government policy,' Anupong said.</p>
              <p>He also addressed rumours of rifts in the army, which has 
              been sending out mixed signals on how it prefers to handle the 
              demonstrators, after April 10 clashes that left 25 dead and more than 
              800 injured.</p>
              <p>'As for a rift in the army, it is possible there will be 
              rifts in a big organisation but the number of people who have different 
              ideas are not many, and this will not cause problems.' he said. -- AFP</p>

              <p><strong>Vow to hold key sites</strong></p>
              <p>BANGKOK - THAI protesters occupying key areas of Bangkok vowed on 
              Sunday to fight until victory following a breakdown of negotiations and a
               televised appearance by the prime minister that offered no solution to 
              the protracted, sometimes bloody crisis.</p>
              <p>The so-called Red Shirts also urged their supporters in provincial 
              areas to confront police and military reinforcements from entering 
              Bangkok. Thai media reported that more than 1,000 protesters were 
              setting up roadblocks along a major highway leading to the capital from 
              the northeast to prevent security forces from reaching Bangkok.</p>
              <p>Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva spoke in a nationally 
              televised interview alongside the army chief on Sunday, in an apparent 
              effort to dispel persistent rumors of a rift between Mr Abhisit and the 
              military. The broadcast came a day after Mr Abhisit's rejection of a 
              compromise offer by the so-called Red Shirts - who say the current 
              government is illegitimate and are demanding new elections - dashed 
              hopes that a peaceful way could be found to end the standoff.</p>
              <p>'We won't go home until we win,' a protest leader, Khwanchai
               Praipana, told supporters following Mr Abhisit's appearance. He said 
              many police and soldiers in the provinces were siding with the 
              protesters, and they had even asked Red Shirts to prevent fresh security
               forces from reaching Bangkok. 'Most police based in the provinces don't
               want to come deal with the Red Shirts in Bangkok,' he said.</p>
              <p>The Nation TV channel reported that negotiations were under 
              way between authorities and Red Shirts who had stopped 178 policemen 
              along a highway from Udorn Thani in the northeast by deflating their 
              tires.</p>
              <p>Mr Abhisit said on Sunday he was working to end the crisis. 
              'The solution process is ongoing but may not please everyone. The 
              government, and not only the military, is preparing to be ready for what
               would lead to the next level,' Mr Abhisit said in a short statement to 
              the television interviewer. -- AP</p>

              <p><strong>Thai king speaks to judges</strong></p>
              <p>BANGKOK - THAILAND'S ailing king spoke on Monday for the first time 
              since his country's political chaos began, but failed to directly 
              address the sometimes violent crisis that has paralysed Bangkok.</p>
              <p>Many in the country had seen the revered monarch as the best hope for
               peacefully resolving the standoff.</p>
              <p>But addressing newly appointed judges from the hospital 
              where he has been for more than seven months, King Bhumibol Adulyadej 
              spoke vaguely, leaving his comments open to interpretation.</p>
              <p>The 82-year-old king said the judges should set an example 
              by performing their duties well.</p>
              <p>'It will show that there are officials in the country who 
              perform their duties with strong, clear will and are determined to 
              maintain stability in the country,' he said. 'This will give people the 
              determination to perform their own duties as well.' The government has 
              been accused of failing to keep order when faced with the militant 
              protesters.</p>
              <p>The US-born Bhumibol, the world's longest reigning monarch,

              <p><strong>Thailand's Red Shirt leaders to sue government for accusing them of 
              overthrowing monarchy </strong></p>
              <p>Thailand's "Red Shirt" protest leaders say they would sue the government
               for accusing them of attempting to overthrow the kingdom's revered 
              monarchy. <br> <br> Thai authorities on Monday handed out diagrams to reporters that 
              detailed an alleged network of conspirators working to undermine the 
              royals, including core leaders of the anti-government Red Shirts and two
               former prime ministers. <br> <br> Strict legal provisions in Thai law can land anyone guilty of insulting 
              the royal institution with up to 15 years in prison. <br> <br> Army spokesman Colonel Sunsern Kaewkumnerd told reporters that 
              anti-monarchy figures had used the media to defame the royal family. <br> <br> Deputy prime minister Suthep Thaugsuban said the accused would be 
              summoned to appear in front of the authorities. <br> <br> But one of the Reds' leaders, Nattawut Saikuar, who has led a determined
               street campaign against the government, said the movement would counter
               the accusation with their own defamation law suit.</p>

              <p><strong>Thai protesters mull PM offer of November elections</strong></p>
              <p>Thailand's Red Shirts will today consider a new government proposal for 
              elections in mid-November. <br> <br> A spokesman for the protesters said last night the movement would 
              discuss the new proposal before responding. <br> <br> The new offer was made yesterday by Thai Prime Minister Abhisit 
              Vejjajiva as part of a peace plan aimed at ending a 2-month old 
              political crisis. <br> <br> He had previously said he would call a poll in December, a year ahead of
               schedule. <br> <br> Speaking on national television, Mr Abhisit said that the proposed 
              timetable is subject to all parties agreeing to a five-point 
              reconciliation process. <br> <br> These include respect for the monarchy and an independent probe into the
               current political crisis. <br> <br> The Red Shirt protesters have occupied parts of Bangkok since 
              mid-March. <br> <br> Their rallies turned violent last month when clashes between them and 
              security forces left 27 people dead and over a thousand others injured.</p>

              <p class="header"><strong>Ex-Thai PM Thaksin urges reconciliation</strong><br> <span class="update">Posted: 04 May 2010 1751 hrs </span></p>
              <p class="header"><span>BANGKOK - Thailand's fugitive ex-premier Thaksin Shinawatra called
               on his supporters on Tuesday to seek "reconciliation" following an 
              offer by the premier to hold November elections to end a political 
              crisis.
              <br> <br> "Reconciliation is good for everybody," he said in a phone-in to a 
              meeting of the opposition Puea Thai Party. "Today, don't think about the
               past, but look to the future. That is how national reconciliation will 
              happen."
              <br> <br> Hinting at a possible breakthrough in the long-running impasse between 
              the government and his supporters, Thaksin said he hoped that "good 
              things" would happen on Coronation Day on Wednesday, calling it an 
              auspicious date.
              <br> <br> "I think there should be the start of talking to create a good climate,"
               Thaksin said, adding that it was up to opposition Red Shirt protesters 
              to decide whether to accept Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva's offer of 
              November 14 polls.
              <br> <br> Thailand's anti-government protesters said earlier they were seriously 
              considering the premier's offer, but that they needed more time to 
              discuss it.
              <br> <br> Thaksin, who was in office between 2001 and 2006, was ousted in a 
              bloodless military coup and lives in self-imposed exile to avoid a jail 
              term for corruption.
              <br> <br> Many of the "Red Shirt" anti-government protesters who have been staging
               rallies in Bangkok since mid-March are seeking the return of the 
              telecoms tycoon-turned-politician, hailing his policies for the masses.

              <p><strong>Thailands's Reds optimistic on ending weeks of rallies</strong></p>
              <p>Thousands of Thai anti-government protesters remain barricaded inside 
              their encampment in Bangkok.<br> <br> They're demanding more details on the government's proposed roadmap 
              aimed at ending the tense standoff. <br> <br> The Red Shirts yesterday agreed to join Prime Minister Abhisit 
              Vejjajiva's proposed reconciliation process. <br> <br> But they are still refusing to disperse, calling on Mr Abhisit to make 
              clear when he will dissolve parliament for elections.<br> <br> They also want him to withdraw troops. <br> <br> On Monday, Mr Abhisit said that he was ready to hold elections on 
              November 14 if all parties accepted his reconciliation plan. <br> <br> But the protesters said the premier should spell out when he will 
              dissolve parliament and leave it to the Election Commission to set the 
              poll date. <br> <br> Thailand's fugitive ex-premier Thaksin Shinawatra called for the two 
              sides to settle their differences. <br> <br> Arrest warrants have been issued for many leading Red Shirts, who have 
              been defying a ban on rallies under a state of emergency in the city. <br> <br> But a government source says the authorities are ready to discuss an 
              amnesty for protest leaders.</p>

              <p><strong>Protest must end: Abhisit</strong></p>
              <p>BANGKOK - THAI anti-government protesters showed no sign of ending 
              their two-month rally in Bangkok after Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva 
              told them to quit by Wednesday and warned the public to expect trouble.</p>
              <p>Thousands of 'red shirt' protesters remain in a fortified camp in an 
              upmarket shopping district in the centre of Bangkok. Music and speeches 
              blared from powerful loudspeakers on their stage through the early hours
               of Wednesday as leaders tried to keep their supporters awake and alert.
               Most nights the volume is turned down a little until dawn.</p>
              <p>Mr Abhisit has offered an election on Nov 14 - just over a 
              year before one is due - to try to end a movement that began in 
              mid-March with a demand for an immediate poll. Twenty-nine people have 
              died in clashes and more than 1,000 have been wounded.</p>
              <p>The protesters, mostly supporters of ex-premier Thaksin 
              Shinawatra who was ousted in a coup in 2006, have accepted the election 
              date but are now pushing other demands, in particular wanting a deputy 
              prime minister to be charged in connection with a bloody clash with 
              troops on April 10 in which 25 people died.</p>
              <p>Mr Abhisit's tone has hardened in the past two days and late
               on Tuesday he told reporters the cabinet had decided that the security 
              forces needed to 'take measures' quickly.</p>
              <p>'This may affect people in the area, not just protesters but
               also people who work there and people who live there,' he said. 'So we 
              ask that the protesters make a gesture by going home tomorrow. Other 
              issues can be discussed later if they are sincere about reconciliation.'

              <p><strong>Thai army to impose curfew</strong></p>
              <p>BANGKOK - THAILAND'S army said on Sunday it would impose a curfew on 
              parts of Bangkok after two days of intense clashes between soldiers and 
              'Red Shirt' protesters left at least 24 dead and more than 200 wounded.</p>
              <p>A top protest leader urged the revered king to intervene in 
              the crisis, which has turned areas of the city into no-go zones as 
              troops fire live ammunition at protesters, some of them armed or using 
              slingshots and fireworks.</p>
              <p>Sporadic gunfire continued to echo around the fringes of the
               Red Shirts' sprawling encampment as a swathe of the city was shrouded 
              in black smoke after demonstrators torched piles of tyres in roads. One 
              shop was seen ablaze.</p>
              <p>'There will be a curfew announcement in some necessary areas
               and roads in Bangkok so that police and soldiers can differentiate 
              people from terrorists,' army spokesman Colonel Sunsern Kaewkumnerd told
               reporters. The government said schools would stay closed on Monday 
              because of the unrest.</p>
              <p>A senior leader of the Red Shirted protesters called for the
               intervention of Thailand's king, saying he was the 'only hope' for an 
              end to the two-month crisis, which has left more than 50 people dead and
               1,600 wounded. 'As people in this country, we would like his kindness,'
               Jatuporn Prompan told reporters at the rally site, where thousands of 
              protesters were camped out. 'I believe Thais will feel the same, that 
              His Majesty is our only hope.'</p>
              <p>King Bhumibol Adulyadej chastised both the military and 
              protest leaders during a 1992 uprising, effectively bringing the 
              violence to an end. But the 82-year-old monarch has been hospitalised 
              since September and has avoided commenting directly on the current 
              crisis in public. All of the fatalities in recent days have been 
              civilians. -- AFP</p>

              Molotov cocktails and firecrackers under an expressway when they were

              <p>Intense clashes between soldiers and Red Shirts around their
               protest zone in a downtown commercial district have left at least 24

              <p><strong>Thai army to impose curfew</strong></p>
              <p>BANGKOK - THAILAND'S army said on Sunday it would impose a
              curfew on parts of Bangkok after two days of intense clashes
              between soldiers and 'Red Shirt' protesters left at least 24 dead
              and more than 200 wounded.</p>
              <p>A top protest leader urged the revered king to intervene in the
              crisis, which has turned areas of the city into no-go zones as
              troops fire live ammunition at protesters, some of them armed or
              using slingshots and fireworks.</p>
              <p>Sporadic gunfire continued to echo around the fringes of the Red
              Shirts' sprawling encampment as a swathe of the city was shrouded
              in black smoke after demonstrators torched piles of tyres in roads.
              One shop was seen ablaze.</p>
              <p>'There will be a curfew announcement in some necessary areas and
              roads in Bangkok so that police and soldiers can differentiate
              people from terrorists,' army spokesman Colonel Sunsern Kaewkumnerd
              told reporters. The government said schools would stay closed on
              Monday because of the unrest.</p>
              <p>A senior leader of the Red Shirted protesters called for the
              intervention of Thailand's king, saying he was the 'only hope' for
              an end to the two-month crisis, which has left more than 50 people
              dead and 1,600 wounded. 'As people in this country, we would like
              his kindness,' Jatuporn Prompan told reporters at the rally site,
              where thousands of protesters were camped out. 'I believe Thais
              will feel the same, that His Majesty is our only hope.'</p>
              <p>King Bhumibol Adulyadej chastised both the military and protest
              leaders during a 1992 uprising, effectively bringing the violence
              to an end. But the 82-year-old monarch has been hospitalised since
              September and has avoided commenting directly on the current crisis
              in public. All of the fatalities in recent days have been
              civilians. -- AFP</p>
