              <p><strong>Bangkok death toll rises to 35</strong></p>
              <p>BANGKOK- THE number of dead from three days of street battles in 
              Bangkok has risen to 35, including the first military death, emergency 
              services said on Monday.</p>
              <p>'There were two more deaths last night including a soldier and a 
              protester,' said a member of the official emergency medical centre in 
              Bangkok, where troops and anti-government 'Red Shirt' protesters are 
              locked in a tense confrontation.</p>
              <p>The official said the number of wounded had risen to 244. 
              Among the wounded were six foreigners, he said.</p>
              <p>A 31-year-old air force member was shot while on patrol 
              Sunday night in the flashpoint Silom district, on the edge of the Red 
              Shirts' fortified encampment, the official said, adding that he died in 
              hospital. --AFP</p>

              <p><strong>Thai renegade general dies</strong></p>
              <p>BANGKOK - THAI news reports say a renegade army general who worked 
              for Red Shirt protesters has died of gunshot wounds in hospital Monday, 
              five days after he was shot by a sniper.</p>
              <p>Channel 9 television, Thai Rath newspaper and other media 
              outlets said Maj. Gen. Khattiya Sawasdiphol died on Monday. Maj. Gen. 
              Khattiya was the military strategist of the Red Shirts. He was shot in 
              the head on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>The attack triggered widespread street fighting between 
              anti-government protesters and the army in central Bangkok. At least 36 
              people - all civilians - have died in the violence.</p>
              <p>The Red Shirts have been protesting since mid-March 
              demanding the immediate resignation of Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva,
               the dissolution of Parliament and new elections.</p>
              <p>Violent clashes in Bangkok have left 35 people dead, 
              officials said Monday, after the government ruled out foreign 
              intervention to end the two-month stand-off.</p>
              <p>The worsening violence has turned parts of the city into 
              no-go zones as troops use live ammunition against anti-government 
              demonstrators, who have blocked streets with burning tyres, and fought 
              back with homemade weapons. --AP, AFP</p>

              <p>BANGKOK - THAI troops used armoured vehicles to break through the 
              main barricade into the camp of anti-government protesters in central 
              Bangkok on Wednesday, a Reuters cameraman said.</p>
              <p>He saw an armoured personnel carrier lead a fire engine through the 
              burning barricade and two more personnel carriers followed after them. 
              The protesters had earlier set alight the barricade, made up largely of 
              tyres and doused in fuel.</p>
              <p>Two people were shot in a gunfight near the main protest site.</p>
              <p>Earlier, troops opened fire at a fortified encampment of 
              anti-government protesters in central Bangkok.</p>
              <p>Associated Press reporters saw the troops positioned on an 
              overpass overlooking the encampment firing automatic rifles sporadically
               at the encampment on Wednesday. There was no sustained shooting.</p>
              <p>Some troops were also seen crouching on the elevated tracks 
              of a light rail system that runs over the encampment.</p>
              <p>The firing came after a large number of troops and armored 
              carriers gathered at the edges of the encampment at daybreak amid 
              reports of a final assault on the camp the protesters have occupied for 
              weeks.</p>
              <p>At least 39 people have been killed and more than 300 people
               wounded in seven days of clashes in Bangkok. -- AP, REUTERS</p>

              <p class="preParagraph">Convicted former prime minister Thaksin 
              Shinawatra posted a Twitter message on Wednesday, calling on the 
              government to hold talks with anti-government leaders of the United 
              Front for Democracy against Dictatorship (UDD) directly.</p>
              <p>The ousted premier said the government needed to understand that 
              holding negotiations with the UDD was way beyond him.<br><br>"Stop 
              blaming me. It has been four years and you [the government] are not 
              satisfied," the message said.<br><br>Thaksin said he had always told the
               red-shirt leaders to jointly make decisions without worrying about him 
              since they were most aware of the situation.</p>

              anti-government encampment in central Bangkok, punching a hole in the 
              tire-and-bamboo barricades and driving in with troops behind them.</p>
              <p>About 100 troops took up positions along the wall of central Lumpini

              provided the troops cover. But there were no protesters in sight, and

              <p>The troops moved past smoldering fires, apparently set by

              <p><strong>Italian journalist, two 'Reds' killed in Bangkok protests</strong><br> <span class="update">Posted: 19 May 2010 1215 hrs </span></p>
              <p><span>BANGKOK : Thai troops battled with anti-government protesters 
              Wednesday, after smashing into their rally zone using armoured vehicles 
              and tearing down towering barricades of tyres and razor wire.
              <br> <br> Gunfire was being exchanged in clashes in the protest encampment, which 
              the "Red Shirts" have occupied for six weeks, defying a military 
              containment operation launched last Thursday that left 39 dead.
              <br> <br> An AFP photographer saw two protesters lying dead inside the camp, while
               hospital officials said an Italian journalist was also killed in the 
              clashes. At least seven others were wounded and sent to hospital.
              <br> <br> In the face of the barrage, some 100 other protesters fled towards the 
              movement's main rally stage in the heart of their sprawling encampment, 
              which has shut down Bangkok's main shopping district.
              <br> <br> Reds leaders tried to quell a rising sense of panic among some 5,000 
              supporters including many women and children who are still inside the 
              rally base despite the violence and orders to leave.
              <br> <br> Some were openly crying and others put on face masks in fear of tear gas
               attacks.
              <br> <br> "Please stay calm today, no matter what happens we will stay here 
              together," leader Nattawut Saikuar said from the stage where protesters 
              were gathered for safety, directing them to a nearby Buddhist temple if 
              necessary.
              <br> <br> "Those who fear for your life go to the temple, but those who volunteer 
              to stay here you are free to do so."
              <br> <br> The government said the offensive was aimed at establishing a secure 
              perimeter around the protest base, but the military offensive now 
              appeared to be aimed at completely closing down the camp.
              <br> <br> "The operations are designed to make sure that the security officers can
               provide security and safety to the public at large. The operations will
               continue throughout the day," said government spokesman Panitan 
              Wattanayagorn.
              <br> <br> "We would like to reassure the citizens and residents of Bangkok that 
              the operations are designed to make sure that we stabilise the area," he
               said in a televised address.
              <br> <br> A senator involved in failed last-minute peace talks said he feared the 
              military operation, launched after the Reds defied a Monday deadline to 
              disperse, would cause serious loss of life.
              <br> <br> "The government has chosen to decisively enforce the law. The signals 
              are that absolutely the army will win, but the losses will be 
              unbearable," said General Lertrat Rattanavanich.
              <br> <br> "Certainly based on all the signs that I have seen there will be a 
              crackdown, not containment," added the senator, who was one of a group 
              in the upper house who tried to act as mediators.
              <br> <br> Hundreds of army and police advanced towards the protest zone in the 
              pre-dawn hours, with trucks dropping off troops wearing balaclavas and 
              carrying weapons and riot shields, while a helicopter circled overhead.
              <br> <br> Several large fires broke out at barricades and major buildings around 
              the protest zone, sending out massive clouds of black smoke that 
              obscured the Bangkok skyline.
              <br> <br> Dozens of soldiers crept along Wireless Road, which runs parallel to the
               protest zone, crouching behind trees and poles and scurrying up foot 
              bridges near the US embassy, which has been closed.
              <br> <br> "Danger zone," one soldier said, waving reporters back as muffled cracks
               rang out from nearby Lumpini park, which the protesters had spilled 
              into during an occupation that has forced hotels and shopping centres to
               close.
              <br> <br> Security forces have battled with the Reds since last Thursday as they 
              attempted to seal off the rally base, turning parts of the city into 
              no-go zones as troops used live ammunition against protesters, who 
              fought back mainly with homemade weapons.
              <br> <br> The Reds are campaigning for elections to replace the administration of 
              Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva, which they consider illegitimate 
              because it came to power with the backing of the army in a 2008 
              parliamentary vote.
              <br> <br> They are mostly supporters of fugitive ex-premier Thaksin Shinawatra who
               was ousted in a 2006 coup. A controversial court ruling ejected his 
              elected allies from power, paving the way for Abhisit's government to be
               appointed.
              <br> <br> Many countries have warned their nations against travelling to Thailand.
               Australia Wednesday said travellers should not visit Bangkok, citing 
              the deteriorating security situation. – AFP/jy</span></p>

              <p><strong>Situation under control</strong></p>
              <p>BANGKOK - Thai security forces have ended their offensive at a 
              sprawling protest encampment in central Bangkok and the situation is 
              under control, the army spokesman said on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>'The general situation is under control,' Sansern Kaewkamnerd said in
               a televised address. 'Security forces have ended their offensive.'</p>
              <p>His announcement came after seven leaders of Red Shirt 
              protesters surrendered to authorities after the deadly army assault on 
              their fortified encampment. They have been led away by police in central
               Bangkok. Sansern described them as 'terrorist leaders'.</p>
              <p>A curfew is to be imposed across Bangkok on Wednesday night,
               defence minister General Prawit Wongsuwon said after the military 
              offensive ended. Grenades exploded nearby as the Red Shirts announced 
              their decision. Two soldiers and a journalist were wounded. Angry 
              protesters also tried to set fire to a high-end shopping mall, and black
               smoke billowed over Bangkok's skyline.</p>
              <p>The Red Shirt leaders said they are ending their sit-in to 
              prevent more deaths. The army assault on their protest encampment killed
               two protesters and an Italian photographer.</p>
              <p>Away from the capital, thousands of i anti-government 
              protesters set fire to a provincial hall in the northeast, an official 
              said on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>'Some 2,000 Red Shirt protesters set fire to the Udon Thani 
              provincial hall,' the province's governor, Amnat Pagarat, told AFP. 'The
               situation is under control now after soldiers arrived and cleared 
              them,' he said. 'Two rooms on the ground floor have been destroyed,' he 
              added. -- AP, AFP, REUTERS</p>

              <p><strong>Riots after surrender</strong></p>
              <p>BANGKOK - RIOTING and fires swept Bangkok on Wednesday after troops 
              stormed a protest encampment, forcing protest leaders to surrender, but 
              sparking clashes that killed at least four people and triggered unrest 
              in northern Thailand.</p>
              <p>Protesters torched five buildings, including the Thai stock exchange 
              and Central World, Southeast Asia's second-biggest department store 
              complex, and attacked local Channel 3 television station as riots spread
               across the city of 15 million people.</p>
              <p>Power was lost in typically bustling Sukhumvit Road 
              district, an area packed with tourists and high-end residential 
              complexes, just hours after the army said the situation involving 
              thousands of anti-government protesters was under control.</p>
              <p>The chaos followed a military operation in the morning in 
              which troops in armoured vehicles and firing semi-automatic weapons 
              advanced on an area occupied for more than six weeks by thousands of the
               'red shirt' demonstrators.</p>
              <p>As they surrounded the main protest site, top protest 
              leaders offered to surrender, as supporters urged them to fight on, many
               screaming and crying as gun fire rang out nearby.</p>
              <p>Moments later, live television showed four 'red 
              shirt'protest leaders in police custody and an army spokesman said in a 
              televison broadcast the protest site was under army control and the 
              military had halted operations. But that didn't stop the unrest after 
              six days of chaotic street fighting. Rioting was seen in five areas of 
              the city as protesters lit fires and burned tyres. Some hotels set up 
              wooden barricades. -- REUTERS</p>
