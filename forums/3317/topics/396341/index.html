              <p><strong>Dissolve Abhisit's party </strong></p>
              <p>BANGKOK - THAILAND'S Election Commission recommended the embattled 
                  ruling party be dissolved on Monday, potentially handing victory to 
                  anti-government protesters who have demanded the prime minister step 
                  down.</p>
              <p>The ruling comes the same day that Thailand's influential army chief 
                  appeared to back a key demand of the protesters, saying Parliament might
                   need to be dissolved to resolve the country's violent political 
                  standoff.</p>
              <p>Together, the comments by Gen. Anupong Paochinda and the 
                  election body's decision could spell the end of Prime Minister Abhisit 
                  Vejjajiva's rule, which the protesters say is illegitimate.</p>
              <p>Mr Abhisit was largely seen as having the backing of the 
                  powerful military, which has traditionally played an important role in 
                  the country?s politics, and has not hesitated to step in with coups in 
                  times of political instability. But his control of security forces has 
                  increasingly been called into question over the past month as protesters
                   repeatedly marched through the capital. On Saturday, soldiers and 
                  police failed to dislodge demonstrators, setting off clashes that killed
                   21.</p>
              <p>The commission found the Democrat Party - Thailand's oldest -
                   guilty of misusing campaign donations. The ruling will have to be 
                  endorsed by the Constitutional Court before the party of Mr Abhisit is
                  disbanded. No date was set for the court to hear the case.</p>
              <p>'If the issue cannot be resolved through political means, 
                  then Parliament dissolution seems to be a reasonable step,' Gen. Anupong
                   told reporters. 'If people want a government of national unity, then by
                   all means, go ahead. I just want peace to prevail. Right now the 
                  circumstances dictate that a solution should be achieved through 
                  political means,' he said. -- AP</p>

              <p><strong>Red Shirt leaders escape</strong></p>
              <p>BANGKOK - THAI commandos stormed a Bangkok hotel on Friday where 
              leaders of the Red Shirt protest movement were holed up, but the mission
               ended in dramatic failure after the suspects managed to flee.</p>
              <p>One leading Red Shirt climbed down an electric cable from the third 
              floor of the hotel in Bangkok's northern outskirts before being rushed 
              away by jubilant supporters, despite the presence of dozens of riot 
              police nearby.</p>
              <p>The bungled attempt to arrest the Red Shirt leaders came 
              days after the army tried in vain to clear an area of the capital of 
              anti-government demonstrators in an operation that sparked the country's
               deadliest civil unrest in 18 years.</p>
              <p>As special forces surrounded the SC Park Hotel, Deputy Prime
               Minister Suthep Thaugsuban announced to the nation in a televised 
              address that the authorities were swooping on 'terrorists' and their 
              leaders inside the building.</p>
              <p>But the government later admitted the mission had failed and
               the red-clad movement said all of their leaders had escaped, vowing to 
              turn up the heat on embattled Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva.</p>
              <p>'Police kicked the door open and threw smoke and stun 
              grenades into the room, but luckily I ran to the window and used an 
              electric cord to climb down,' said Red Shirt leader Arisman 
              Pongruangrong. 'Now our mission is to hunt down Abhisit and Suthep. Our 
              patience is at its limit.' -- AFP</p>

              <p><strong>Red Shirts boost base security</strong></p>
              <p>BANGKOK - THAI anti-government protesters stepped up security at 
              their base in a ritzy Bangkok shopping centre on Saturday, a week after 
              bloody clashes with security forces killed 24 people.</p>
              <p>Under leaden skies, thousands of protesters gathered to commemorate 
              the deaths as medical supplies, sanitary facilities and foodstalls were 
              set up at the base that the 'red shirts'have pledged to turn into a 
              'final battleground' to oust Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva.</p>
              <p>Mr Abhisit said he would crack down on the protesters who he
               calls 'terrorists', and on Friday put his army chief in charge of 
              security operations at the expense of Deputy Prime Minister Suthep 
              Thaugsuban after a bungled attempt to arrest red shirt leaders.</p>
              <p>However, he indicated that there would be no immediate 
              attempt to dislodge the protesters, calling for patience.</p>
              <p>'There has been more talk of crackdown and possible attempts
               to take us in, so we have to make sure we are not infiltrated,' protest
               leader Nattawut Saikua said, adding that the red shirts had no plans to
               march on Saturday.</p>
              <p>The political crisis in Thailand has hit tourism, a mainstay
               of South-east Asia's second largest economy, hard and caused a selloff 
              in the stock market which has given up almost all of this year's gains 
              as foreign investors have sold heavily. -- REUTERS</p>

              <p><strong>More protests vowed</strong></p>
              <p>BANGKOK - THAILAND'S powerful army chief Anupong Paochinda yesterday 
              met top commanders as 'red shirts' pledged to escalate protests again to
               pressure Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva to call an early election.</p>
              <p>But government spokesman Panitan Wattanayagorn insisted that the 
              authorities would not use force against red shirt protesters in downtown
               Bangkok.</p>
              <p>'People want this settled quickly, but the authorities also 
              face their limitations. There are a lot of people out there and we 
              cannot do anything harsh,' he told the Associated Press.</p>
              <p>The red-shirted United Front for Democracy against 
              Dictatorship has been campaigning for more than a month in the capital, 
              and the protests showed few signs of losing steam yesterday.</p>
              <p>A daytime crowd of about 2,000 people at the upscale 
              Ratchaprasong intersection swelled to nearly 10,000 by evening.</p>
              <p>In a surprise statement yesterday, co-leader Nattawut 
              Saikuar told reporters that on May 15, all 24 leaders who have arrest 
              warrants out for them would surrender to the police.</p>

              <p><strong>Thai army to punish if needed</strong></p>
              <p>BANGKOK - THAILAND'S military vowed on Sunday to 'punish' 
              anti-government protesters if they march on Bangkok's central business 
              district, heightening fears of more violence after bloody clashes left 
              24 people dead a week ago.</p>
              <p>Red-shirted supporters of ousted premier Thaksin Shinawatra said on 
              Saturday they may take their protest to the financial district, two 
              blocks away from their main downtown protest base, on Tuesday, in 
              defiance of an emergency decree.</p>
              <p>'We won't let them go anywhere further,' army spokesman 
              Sansern Kaewkamnerd said.</p>
              <p>Sansern stopped short of using the word 'crackdown' but said
               protesters occupying the plush shopping and hotel district for a 16th 
              day, would be dealt with.</p>
              <p>'Let's say that we are left with no choice but to enforce 
              the law,' Sansern told TNN television.</p>
              <p>'If we have to clash, we will. We need to enforce the law 
              decisively. We can't just think that 'we don't want casualties', 
              otherwise the country can't move forward. Casualties would only happen 
              after security forces have tried their best to avoid them, while those 
              people are trying to take away our weapons and lives.' -- REUTERS</p>

              <p><strong>'Yellow shirts' counter-protest?</strong></p>
              <p>BANGKOK - A FRAGILE peace returned to Bangkok's key shopping district
               at the weekend, but the regrouping of the pro- government 'yellow 
              shirts' has raised concerns of possible bloody street violence in the 
              days ahead.</p>
              <p>Yesterday, they said after talks that they would take to the streets 
              if the government failed to stop protests by the anti-government red 
              shirts within a week.</p>
              <p>Several thousand supporters of the People's Alliance for 
              Democracy (PAD) met earlier on the outskirts of Bangkok to discuss how 
              to respond to the weeks- long and increasingly confrontational protests 
              by the red-shirted United Front for Democracy against Dictatorship 
              (UDD).</p>
              <p>The PAD was responsible for ousting then premier Thaksin 
              Shinawatra, whom most red shirts support, in 2006 and for kicking out 
              another ruling alliance headed by his allies two years later.</p>
              <p>Diplomats and regional security officials said the prospect 
              of the yellow shirts jumping into Thailand's toxic political mix could 
              set the stage for a bloody confrontation with pro-Thaksin red shirts, 
              who have taken over Bangkok's glitzy shopping district and waged bloody 
              battles with security forces in recent days.</p>
              <p>'The situation is already so tense. The question is, can the
               armed forces cope if all these different groups start occupying 
              Bangkok's streets?' said a South-east Asian diplomat who has lived in 
              Bangkok for more than four years.</p>

              <p>BANGKOK - THAILAND'S army is toughening up procedures for confronting

              <p><strong>Red Shirts cancel march</strong></p>
              <p>BANGKOK - THAILAND'S anti-government protesters on Tuesday cancelled 
              plans to march on Bangkok's financial hub, saying they were thwarted by 
              thousands of troops who poured in to protect the district.</p>
              <p>Soldiers and riot police descended on the Silom financial strip on 
              Monday, armed with assault rifles and laying out razor wire to block the
               demonstrators' threat to march there from their nearby rally base in 
              the retail heartland.</p>
              <p>'Red Shirt protesters will not march into Silom Road because
               the government has already sent ten of thousands of armed soldiers to 
              occupy the road,' leader Nattawut Saikuar said. 'But we will wait and 
              see, and whenever soldiers withdraw we will go there to offer our 
              support for the businessmen.'</p>
              <p>Mr Nattawut said the Reds would not make any alternative 
              plans for a march, but would instead instead focus on bolstering their 
              numbers at their sprawling rally base, in anticipation of a crackdown to
               end four weeks of rallies.</p>
              <p>'Before we go into the big battle we have to strengthen our 
              own camp because the military will soon attack us,' he said, adding that
               they expect the offensive to hit before next Monday.</p>
              <p>'Red Shirt people will stay here until we win, so if the 
              authorities want to crack down, they don't have to wait for seven days, 
              they can come right now.' -- AFP</p>

              <p><strong>Red Shirts fortify camps</strong></p>
              <p>BANGKOK - TENSIONS escalated in the standoff between anti-government 
              demonstrators and Thai security forces as the army said deadly force 
              could be used against protesters besieging the heart of the capital.</p>
              <p>The so-called 'Red Shirt' demonstrators, meanwhile, reinforced 
              defenses at their urban encampment - already shrouded with netting to 
              foil the prying eyes of potential attackers - and prepared homemade 
              weapons including hundreds of sharpened bamboo poles and broken up 
              pavement stones.</p>
              <p>No new clashes were reported as the Red Shirts, who have 
              occupied Bangkok's streets for more than five weeks, abandoned plans to 
              march into the central business district after soldiers in full combat 
              gear were garrisoned there to bar the way.</p>
              <p>The protesters consist mainly of poor rural supporters of 
              former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra and pro-democracy activists who
               opposed the military coup that ousted him in 2006. They want Parliament
               dissolved immediately and new elections called.</p>
              <p>Col Sansern Kaewkamnerd, spokesman for the government's 
              Center for the Resolution of the Emergency Situation, said the 
              guidelines for suppressing violent protests were being adjusted because 
              the authorities had found, 'terrorists infiltrating the demonstrators 
              were preparing to use weapons such as throw type bombs, sharpened sticks
               and sticks tied with nails, as well as acid'.</p>
              <p>Security forces previously were told to abide by seven-stage
               rules of engagement, where warnings would be followed by a slowly 
              escalating use of force, meant to minimise casualties. They are equipped
               with live ammunition and authorised to use it in self-defence. -- AP</p>

              <p><strong>Anger against protesters</strong></p>
              <p>BANGKOK - ANGER among Bangkok residents mounted on Thursday against 
              anti-government protesters who have entrenched themselves in the 
              capital's commercial district, causing the closure of hotels and offices
               and disrupting incomes.</p>
              <p>A loose coalition opposed to the so-called Red Shirts, who are 
              demanding that Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva dissolve Parliament and 
              call new elections immediately, planned a mass rally on Friday, further 
              splitting the city into hostile camps.</p>
              <p>They also were preparing further confrontations with the 
              protesters across an intersection adjacent to their 'occupation zone' 
              where angry residents Wednesday night scuffled with Red Shirts and 
              shouted 'Give back our city' and 'Hillbillies, get out.'</p>
              <p>The anti-Red Shirt group includes office employees, middle 
              class families, academics, some low-wage workers and members of the 
              Yellow Shirts, a group that supports the current government and who 
              themselves rampaged through Bangkok and seized the city's airports two 
              years ago.</p>
              <p>On Thursday, several hundred protesters rallied in front of 
              the regional headquarters of the United Nations, submitting a request 
              for international peacekeepers to monitor the situation in Thailand.</p>
              <p>Despite government warnings that the demonstrators would no 
              longer be able to stage marches outside their enclave, authorities did 
              nothing to stop the peaceful rally. -- AP</p>

              <p><strong>Blasts kill 1, wound dozens</strong></p>
              <p>BANGKOK - AT LEAST five grenades exploded on Thursday in the center 
              of Bangkok near a massive encampment of anti-government protesters, 
              killing one person and wounding at least 50, sending panicked people 
              running through the streets and fleeing an elevated train station.</p>
              <p>The area of the explosions has been the site of a tense standoff 
              between Red Shirt protesters, who are demanding Prime Minister Abhisit 
              Vejjajiva resign, and armed troops over the past several days. More 
              recently, a rival group of protesters has rallied in the area, 
              occasionally hurling stones and insults at the Red Shirts, creating a 
              volatile mix. Several of the blasts were near where the rivals have 
              gathered, under the elevated tracks of a Skytrain station.</p>
              <p>Army spokesman Col. Sansern Kaewkamnerd said five M-79 
              grenades were fired from grenade launchers. Among them were three that 
              fell through the roof of the Saladaeng Skytrain station, along Silom 
              Road, the center of Bangkok's business district. A fourth exploded
              on the pavement near the five-star Dusit Thani Hotel and the fifth near a
               bank, he said.</p>
              <p>TV stations reported several more blasts. Previously, 
              explosions at the site have been from fireworks. The government's Erawan
               emergency center said the blasts killed one person, identified as a 
              Thai male, and wounded at least 50.</p>
              <p>The TPBS television network reported three foreigners were 
              among the wounded. Associated Press reporters saw at least four people 
              injured after four blasts, two with serious wounds who were not moving.</p>
              <p>The streets were full of people tending to the wounded and 
              carrying away casualties. The Red Shirts, who believe Mr Abhisit came to
               power illegitimately and are pushing for him to call elections 
              immediately, have rallied in the streets for several weeks. On Thursday,
               the army warned that time was running out for the protesters to clear 
              the streets, warning they would crack down soon. -- AP</p>

              <p><strong>Seek peaceful, durable way</strong></p>
              <p>SINGAPORE on Friday urged Thais to set aside their differences and 
              seek a peaceful, amicable, and durable resolution in the 'overall 
              interest' of their country.</p>
              <p>It made the call when commenting on the tense face-off between 
              government security forces and agitated protestors in Bangkok following 
              Thursday night's grenade attacks, which killed one and wounded 86.</p>
              <p>Said a Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman, responding to 
              media queries: 'We are deeply concerned by the bomb blasts which have 
              resulted in many casualties.</p>
              <p>'We hope that all Thais, irrespective of their political 
              views, will set aside their differences in the overall interests of 
              Thailand, eschew violence, and seek a peaceful, amicable and durable 
              resolution. This is crucial not just for Thailand, but for Asean as a 
              whole.'</p>
              <p>MFA again advised Singaporeans against non-essential travel 
              to Bangkok, and those who are already in the Thai capital to remain 
              indoors and avoid travel within the city and the areas where
