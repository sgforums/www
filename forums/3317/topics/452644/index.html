              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean said greater 
              citizen interest and engagement in how the government carries out its 
              business should be welcomed, and public officers must adapt to a closer 
              partnership with those they serve.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>In his message to 
              some 130,000 public officers to celebrate Public Service Week, Mr Teo, 
              who is also Minister in charge of the Civil Service, urged public 
              officers to continue to earn the trust of the public. </span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>He said officers mark this year's Public Service Week in more challenging times.<br><br>Public
               spotlight has been cast on service lapses and on public officers who 
              were convicted or are being investigated for alleged misconduct.<br><br>Mr
               Teo said public expectations are rising, and there is more scrutiny of 
              the things done by public officers, how they do them and what they 
              achieve.<br><br>A first-class public service, he said, is not just 
              hard-working, efficient and effective, but is also humble and learns 
              from its shortcomings and always seeks to improve. <br><br>Mr Teo called on public officers to uphold the public service values of integrity, service and excellence.<br><br>On
               integrity, he said public officers must perform their duties with the 
              highest standards of honesty and impartiality, without fear or favour.<br><br>Service
               reminds public officers to work together with fellow citizens to 
              deliver better services and greater value, in a partnership of mutual 
              respect.<br><br>Excellence is the commitment to deliver greater value to Singapore and Singaporeans.<br><br>Mr
               Teo said maintaining a clean and competent public service that is true 
              to its values is the key reason why Singapore's public officers can say 
              with pride that it is one of the most trusted and respected public 
              services in the world. <br><br>Started in 2008 as an annual event to 
              build in public officers a sense of pride and belonging to the public 
              service, Public Service Week reminds officers of the important role they
               play in nation building and the need to serve with dedication and 
              commitment. <br><br>It is also a time to recognise the good work of 
              public officers and agencies, as well as members of the public who have 
              been helpful and made significant contributions as customers.<br><br>This year's celebration is themed "Serving the nation and proud of it".<br><br>There
               will be a series of activities for public officers, which include 
              observance ceremonies, learning journeys, a tea reception at Istana and 
              an awards ceremony.<br><br>- CNA/cc</span></span></p>
