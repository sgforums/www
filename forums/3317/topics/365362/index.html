              <p>Perhaps the one time we would welcome the cries of a child is during child birth.<br> <br> That moment signals the beginning of a new chapter in a couple’s life and the end of nine testing months for the mother.<br> <br> But those who know say the final hours before the child is born are
              perhaps the most emotionally charged, and physically draining- not just
              for the women.<br> <br> To a much lesser degree, the husbands who choose to be present in the labour ward also go through a rollercoaster ride.<br> <em><br> Mubin Saadat</em> reports from the frontlines of the labour ward:<br> <br> From the days when all the man had to do was sit at home and wait for
              the bundle of joy to arrive, his role in childbirth has changed
              significantly.<br> <br> Men are now drawn in throughout the entire process- from ante natal appointments to childbirth classes.<br> <br> But it’s the final hours of childbirth in the labour ward that probably
              have the greatest impact on the husband - that is, if he lasts the
              process.<br> <br> Dr Chee Jing Jye, Head of Peripartum Unit, KK Women's and Children's
              Hospital details the extent to which husbands can get involved in the
              birthing process.<br> <br> " In KK hospital husbands were first allowed in the labour ward in the
              1990s. That's when we started having single beds in the labour ward.
              And husbands are encouraged to support their wife during labour as well
              as share with them the birthing experience. For patients who deliver
              vaginally, the husband can stay with the wife in the delivery suite
              throughout the labour. After the delivery, the husbands can opt to cut
              the umbilical cord. In selected cases the husbands can even accompany
              their wives into the operating theatre should the need for a caesarean
              section arise. "<br> <br> Nowadays, the husband’s presence in the labour ward is common place.<br> <br> Some husbands play the role of a spectator, while most are active participants in the process.<br> <br> Dr Jazlan Joosoph, Specialist in Obstetric and Gynaecology at Raffles Hospital:<br> <br> " By and large, the vast majority of husbands would like to be present,
              would like to participate as much as they can in the labour process.
              Very exceptional cases would be when the husband has a phobia for blood
              or bodily fluid and they are not comfortable at all being in the labour
              ward. This very rarely happens. I have had a few patients like that.
              The husbands choose to stay away and wait outside the room until the
              whole labour process is over. Then they come in. Some husbands are very
              averse to seeing their respective spouses in pain and distress and they
              cannot handle it. In such a situation we advise the husband to step out
              for awhile. "<br> <br> Dr Jazlan adds that a proactive husband is always welcomed in the labour ward.<br> <br> In fact, husbands can play a rather crucial role in the birthing process.<br> <br> "Studies have shown that a supportive husband is good to have in the
              labour ward and this can increase that chances of a normal delivery and
              also helps to shorten the labour. The presence of the husband will also
              allow the wives to be attended to full time because sometimes the
              nurses maybe a bit busy with other patients. "<br> <br> Dr Fong Yang is a Consultant Obstetrician &amp; Gynaecologist at The Centre for Women &amp; Fertility at Mount Alvernia.<br> <br> He concurs that the help the husband provides does a great deal in motivating the woman in labour.<br> <br> "Most of the time its a supportive role, moral support. Just being
              there to hold their hands. Just to be there and understand the pain and
              whatever she's going through. And at the point of delivery when the
              wife is pushing and working very hard, sometimes it helps for the
              husband to be there and provide words of encouragement. Sometimes just
              to hold the wife and support her head as she tries pushing. All these
              little gestures give alot of motivation to them."<br> <br> So there you have it fathers, the experts have said it.<br> <br> If you felt you had been marginalized in anyway, those words should go a along way to putting your mind at ease.<br> <br> You now have the stamp of authority to assert your invaluable role in the birthing process.<br> <br> Or maybe not…<br> <br> "One incident I can recall was when I was a medical student about ten
              years ago. There was this particular incident when the medical team was
              focusing on the labouring woman when she was delivering the baby and I
              was just there observing and suddenly I could here a big loud sound on
              the floor and there was a tremor and we discovered the husband had
              fainted. The interesting thing was that the medical team was focusing
              on the wife and didn't bother about the husband. I was a bit shocked. I
              think the medical team probably knew the husband was going to faint and
              they didin't really pay much attention to him. I was there to help him.
              He fainted because he couldn't take it."<br> <br> Fainting fathers aren’t the only interesting cases doctors have seen in the labour ward.<br> <br> Dr Chee has more.<br> <br> "The most ridiculous would be one husband who responded to his wife's
              screams of pain by slapping her face. And after awhile I didn't know if
              she was screaming from the pain of her labour or from the pain form the
              slaps she was getting. For that particular case, after awhile we
              actually had to invite the husband to step out of the delivery room."<br> <br> Well thankfully, fainting fathers and slapping spouses are a rarity.<br> <br> The fact that trends have changed and husbands are now increasingly
              involved in the birthing process can only be good for the family.<br> <br> But let’s not stop at that, fathers.<br> <br> Let’s immerse ourselves deeper into the process of raising the child as well.<br> <br> I’ll leave you with Jafar, a father of two sharing his experience in the labour ward.<br> <br> " I would say the firsthand experience was a bit of a shock to me. On
              my part, I helped my wife through the breathing process and helped her
              to be calm in tense situations, and I felt I really played an important
              role in the moment. For the second child I was able to cope with the
              process easily due to my first experience. And I was also able to
              understand the situation better and guide her through the delivery."</p>
