              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>BEIJING - A top US 
              envoy said Wednesday that Washington could penalise China's four biggest
               state banks if they were found doing business with an Iranian insurance
               firm in violation of US nuclear sanctions.<br><br>David Cohen, US 
              Treasury's under-secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, was
               in China to discuss measures to prevent Iran from obtaining financing 
              for its nuclear weapons programme and means to spread its hardware.<br><br>His
               China trip followed a stop in Hong Kong, where he met with 
              representatives of the four banks -- Bank of China, China Construction 
              Bank, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and the Agricultural Bank 
              of China.<br><br>Speaking to journalists Wednesday, Cohen said he told 
              the banks that if they accepted payment from Moallem, an Iranian 
              insurer, they could be cut off from the US financial system under a 2010
               US law promoting tighter sanctions on Iran.<br><br>Moallem insures 
              Iran’s national bulk container carrier, the Islamic Republic of Iran 
              Shipping Lines (IRISL), a company with three subsidiaries, in violation 
              of United Nations Security Council resolutions.<br><br>Both Moallem and 
              IRISL have been designated as violators of anti-nuclear proliferation 
              rules set by the United States and the European Union.<br><br>Many 
              European countries no longer do business with IRISL and have closed 
              their ports to its ships, but the vessels still make calls in Asia, 
              Cohen said.<br><br>In January, the US Treasury identified several Hong Kong-based shipping companies as having strong links with IRISL.<br><br>Cohen
               also met with 20 financial institutions, local port authorities and 
              shipping companies in Hong Kong to encourage them not to deal with IRISL
               or Mohallem.<br><br>"Any foreign bank that receives payment from 
              Moallem on behalf of a client risks losing its ability to do business in
               the United States," he said.<br><br>In Beijing, meanwhile, Cohen held 
              talks with officials from China's Ministry of Finance, Ministry of 
              Foreign Affairs and ruling Communist Party in two days of meetings.<br><br>Hong Lei, a spokesman for China's foreign ministry, said Wednesday none of China's business with Iran violated UN resolutions.<br><br>"As a permanent member of the Security Council, China always implements UN Security Council resolutions," he said.<br><br>The
               United States and other world powers accuse Iran of seeking to acquire a
               nuclear weapons capacity under the guise of its civilian atomic work, a
               charge Tehran strongly denies.<br><br>Iran is under five sets of UN Security Council sanctions, as well as US ones, over its nuclear programme.<br><br>- AFP/ir</span></span></p>

              <p><em>The Iranian</em></p>
              <p><em>From "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0275927938/theiranianA/">Sunrise at Abadan: The British and Soviet Invasion of Iran, 1941</a>" by Richard A. Stewart, Major U.S. Marine Corps. (Praeger, New York,1988). In memory of Admiral Bayandor and the many valiant Iranian navymen, airmen and soldiers who died in the 1941 surprise attack. And with thanks to <a href="mailto:sepa@sedona.net">Farhad Sepahbody</a>.</em></p>
              <p>As the first glimmer of dawn lit the misty horizon on the morning of August 25, 1941, the HMS Shoreham trained her forward gun battery on the Iranian warship Palang, which was moored peacefully at an Abadan pier. A moment later, a shell slammed into the Palang, the explosion engulfing the vessel in a ball of fire and smoke. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">As the listing warship settled into the river mud, British and Soviet armies stormed across Iran's borders - commencing perhaps the most dramatic and controversial untold episode of World War II.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://www.iranian.com/History/Nov97/Abadan/Images/babr.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="195"><br>The Iranian Sloop Babr (Cougar) after being shelled <br>by the British Navy in Iran's "Day of Infamy."</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Attacked without provocation, <span style="color: #ff0000;">neutral Iran suffered her own "Pearl Harbor" three months prior to the United States' more famous Day of Infamy.</span> Iran's army was crushed, her monarch was overthrown, the beleaguered Red Army was saved from defeat, a German conquest of the Persian Gulf oil fields was thwarted, and the conditions were created for the opening showdown of the Cold War.</span></strong></p>
              <p>Few incidents of World War II relate more directly to the current crisis in the Persian Gulf than those described in this book.<em>Sunrise at Abadan</em> explains how -- more by accident than design -- the Anglo-Soviet invasion drew the United States deeply and inextricably into the affairs of Iran.</p>
              <p><em>Sunrise at Abadan</em> is intended as a scholarly rendition and analysis of these events and the attendant moral issues. In addition, the compelling political and human drama of this episode requires some portrayal to understand its moral significance.</p>

              <p>Churchill viewed the issue as a simple choice: thwarting Nazi world conquest versus scrupulously observing international convention. The Prime Minister knew that he would require at least the tacit approval of President Franklin D. Roosevelt before attacking Iran. Roosevelt could have invoked U.S. moral authority and economic power to avert the Allied invasion.</p>
              <p>But instead, his administration stood by passively, brushing aside desperate Iranian pleas until it was too late. Moreover, Roosevelt even secretly approved the plans against Iran, only to later publicly deny any knowledge of British intentions.</p>

              <p>China raps Myanmar over dam project</p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>BEIJING: Beijing has
               urged Myanmar to protect the rights of Chinese companies after the 
              government halted construction of a $3.6 billion China-backed mega dam 
              following public opposition to the project.<br><br>Myanmar President 
              Thein Sein on Friday ordered work on the Myitsone Dam on the Irrawaddy 
              River to stop -- a decision hailed by the United States as a sign the 
              military-backed leadership was listening to its people.<br><br>Chinese 
              foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei on Saturday urged "relevant 
              countries to guarantee the lawful and legitimate rights and interests of
               Chinese companies".<br><br>"The Myitsone power station is a jointly 
              invested project between China and Myanmar" and it has been "rigorously 
              examined by both sides", Hong said in a statement.<br><br>Hong called for both sides to "properly handle" the matter through "friendly consultations".<br><br>Beijing and the Myanmar government have a close relationship and the comments are a rare public display of discord between them.<br><br>The dam in the northern state of Kachin was backed by energy giant China Power Investment Corp.<br><br>Environmentalists
               warn the dam project would inundate an area about the size of 
              Singapore, submerging dozens of villages, displacing at least 10,000 
              people and irreversibly damaging one of the world's most biodiverse 
              areas.<br><br>Friday's announcement marked an unexpected U-turn by the 
              Myanmar regime. Local media had quoted the minister for electric power 
              as saying earlier in September that construction of the dam would go 
              ahead despite public concerns.<br><br>For the people of Kachin, the 
              Myitsone dam has come to symbolise the struggles they have faced for 
              decades as a marginalised ethnic group in the repressed nation under 
              almost half a century of military rule.<br><br>Activists urged China 
              Power Investment to remove workers and equipment from the site and to 
              allow local villagers who were forced to relocate to go home.<br><br>- AFP/cc</span></span></p>
