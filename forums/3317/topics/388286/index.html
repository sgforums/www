              <p><strong>Singapore taxi driver sacked by company after quarrel with PRC lady customer who lodged police report against him</strong></p>
              <p>A Singapore taxi driver by the name of Mr Tan claimed that he was sacked by his taxi company after an unhappy PRC lady customer filed a complaint against him as well as a report to the police.</p>
              <p>In an interview with Chinese tabloid Shin Min Daily, Mr Tan said he picked up the 30 plus year old passenger along Bukit Timah Road on the morning of 26 November 2009. She sounded that she is from China from her accent.</p>
              <p>The lady wanted Mr Tan to drive her to Tech Point along Ang Mo Kio Street 65 who informed her that he may need to find the exact place upon arrival there and she was agreeable.</p>
              <p>Half an hour later, Mr Tan turned into Ang Mo Kio Street 62 from Yio Chu Kang Road and was stopped immediately by the lady who kept scolding him for not knowing the way.</p>
              <p>Mr Tan was very angry at that time and blurted out:</p>
              <p><strong>“You PRC women only come to Singapore to cheat Singapore men of their CPF monies!!!”</strong></p>
              <p>She retaliated immediately by scolding him a “<strong>bastard</strong>“.</p>
              <p>After Mr Tan drove her to the intended destination, she hopped off his taxi without paying a single cent. Mr Tan followed her to ask for the $11.40 far, but the PRC lady lodged a police report against him instead.</p>
              <p>When Mr Tan tried to take a photo of her face with his handphone camera, she used her umbrella to block him and in the ensuing scuffle, Mr Tan damaged her umbrella and had to pay her $10 in compensation. The fiasco was later settled by two policemen.</p>
              <p>However, the PRC lady still went ahead and filed a complaint against Mr Tan to his taxi company which terminated his services on 4 April 2009.</p>
              <p>Due to the ruling party’s liberal immigration policies, an increasingly number of foreigners, especially those from mainland China are flocking to study, work and live in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Despite Singapore opening its doors to the PRCs, it is not even featured among the top five destinations of Chinese college students who prefer to emigrate to France, U.S.A, South Korea, Australia and Canada in a survey done by Gallup in July 2009.</p>
              <p>Many of the PRCs who came to Singapore are uncouth peasants hailing from the poorer inland provinces of China and not highly educated and trained professionals.</p>
              <p>Even then, there were media reports of PRC construction workers, masseurs and cleaners being given Singapore PRs and citizenships though they cannot speak a single word of English, the linga franca of most Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>It appears that it is a conscious policy of the ruling party to “flood” Singapore with PRCs in order to increase the population of the ethnic Chinese in Singapore.</p>
              <p>In an interview last year with National Geographic magazine, Singapore’s octogenarian leader Lee Kuan Yew said it is a “good idea” that Singapore has welcomed so many Chinese immigrants as they are more “hard-driving” and “hard-striving” than the locals.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><em>“If native Singaporeans are falling behind because “the spurs are not stuck into the hide,” that is their problem,” </em>he was quoted as saying in the article “The Singapore Solution.” by Mark Jacobson.</span><em><br></em></p>

              <p>My next door PRC wasn't those like typical seen on the streets leh, very soft spoken, and very nice kind, probably different provinces plays a big part too.</p>
              <p>Well that PRC lady is a little way too much I suppose. Agree to allow taxi driver to find the way, but yet still dare to complain not knowing the way whereby the driver already declare that he need to find the place. Hmmm.</p>
