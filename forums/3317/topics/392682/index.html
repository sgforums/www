              <p><strong>Govt to spend S$100m over 5 years to tackle challenges on ageing</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: The government will be pumping in S$100 million over
                  the next five years to tackle the problems of an ageing population.
                  <br> <br>The bulk of it will go towards taking care of the physical, social
                  and emotional needs of the elderly and avert the social isolation of
                  the elderly.
                  <br> <br>Walking has been difficult for 82-year-old Fong Foon Yee since she
                  fractured her hip in 2008. A year later, she was diagnosed with
                  intestinal cancer.
                  <br> <br> But she's been able to get by, thanks to her friend, Lim Ah Lek. Madam Lim cooks for her and helps her with her groceries.
                  <br> <br> For this, Madam Lim was given a Good Neighbour Award by Hong Kah Division in 2009.
                  <br> <br> But she said that she was just returning a kind deed.
                  <br> <br>Madam Lim added: "She came to visit me when I had an operation. It
                  was in the morning and she was there that afternoon. She's so old yet,
                  she went to the hospital. Now she needs help. I must think of her help
                  in the past."
                  <br> <br> They're now constant companions but there are many others who have no one to turn to.
                  <br> <br> And numbers show those who are isolated get depressed more easily.
                  <br> <br>According to the Ministry for Community Development, Youth and
                  Sports, those who live alone and have weak social networks have a 25
                  per cent chance of suffering from depression while those who have
                  friends and family to rely on, have a nine per cent chance.
                  <br> <br> With more senior citizens living alone, the government wants to ensure that there are enough community networks to support them.
                  <br> <br>Figures from the Department of Statistics show that the number of
                  senior citizens aged above 65 living on their own went up from about
                  15,000 in 2000 to 22,000 in 2005.
                  <br> <br> Plans include S$77 million to expand its Wellness Programme which organises social activities and health screenings.
                  <br> <br> This will mean tripling its presence from the current 12 sites. Another 25 will be set up in constituencies from this year.
                  <br> <br> S$20 million will also be pumped into a fund to support active lifestyles and lifelong learning among the elderly.
                  <br> <br> Money will be injected over five years.
                  <br> <br>The fund, called the Active Ageing Capability Fund will replace the
                  current Golden Opportunities (GO!) Fund, and will be administered by
                  the Council for Third Age (C3A).
                  <br> <br>Announcing this in Parliament on Thursday, the Minister-in-Charge
                  of Ageing Issues said he wants to give the elderly more options on how
                  to live their lives.
                  <br> <br> He called this the "Active Ageing Model" after a similar practice in Australia.
                  <br> <br>Minister-in-Charge for Ageing Issues Lim Boon Heng said: "Our
                  approach is to enable people to take care of themselves for as long as
                  possible. And for those who need support to enable them to do as much
                  as possible themselves." <br> <br> And the Centre for Enabled Living aims to do just that with a new S$3 million fund infusion.
                  <br> <br> Among other plans, it will partner voluntary welfare groups to help the
                  elderly and family members work out care arrangements to avoid checking
                  into a nursing home prematurely.</span></p>
