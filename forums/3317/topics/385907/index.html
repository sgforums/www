              <p><strong>REACH sees significant increase in views received from people</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Foreign integration, the AWARE saga and the
              controversy about not nominating the national table tennis coach for an
              award were just some issues which topped the list of subjects
              Singaporeans sent in as feedback to REACH. </span></p>
              <p><span>Singaporeans had a different view of events, which generated much feedback.
              <br> <br> One woman in the street, Nurdiyana Irnajaya, said: "The hot topic this
              year was Ris Low and the controversy and criticism that surrounded
              her."
              <br> <br>Another Singaporean, Shawn Ho said: "The feeling I get from PM and
              MM is that we still want to encourage a lot of international students
              from a diversity of backgrounds to come to Singapore to study."
              <br> <br> Kenny Tan said: "I disagree with the way the AWARE saga was played out. It's not what they do, but how they do that matters."
              <br> <br>But it was the AWARE saga which topped the list of topics
              Singaporeans responded to on the REACH website. That subject received
              1,904 inputs from Singaporeans.
              <br> <br>Dr Amy Khor, chairman, REACH and MP for Hong Kah GRC, said the
              AWARE saga had captured the attention of many contributors and feedback
              on this issue centred on the leadership tussle between the old and new
              executive committees (Exco) of AWARE, the religious beliefs of the new
              team and the perceived liberal ways of the old guard, particularly in
              their purported endorsement of homosexuality as manifested in the
              Comprehensive Sexuality Education (CSE) programme. <br> <br> Many were disappointed to learn that homosexuality was said to be
              "perfectly normal" in the CSE's instructor's guide and that AWARE had
              been engaged to administer the programme in some schools. <br> <br> Next on the hot list was Budget 2009, with 1,847 inputs. Integrating foreigners with Singaporeans attracted 498 views.
              <br> <br> On not nominating former table tennis coach Liu Guodong as Coach of the
              Year, REACH received 415 inputs. Many contributors were outraged at the
              public attacks on Liu's professionalism and integrity.
              <br> <br>They also expressed indignation at revelations that the Singapore
              Table Tennis Association (STTA) had wanted Liu to co-sign a letter,
              drafted in English even though he did not understand English, stating
              that he understood the STTA's decision not to nominate him.
              <br> <br>Two other issues which topped feedback on REACH were the H1N1
              pandemic, which had 285 inputs, and the Employment of Older Workers,
              with 117 inputs.
              <br> <br>Overall, REACH saw a 319 per cent increase in the number of
              visitors to its website from January to November this year, compared to
              the same period last year.
              <br> <br>Dr Khor said: "We have got more than two million page views on our
              discussion threads and various sites on reach website itself and more
              than 60 per cent of the feedback is ground initiated - that means it is
              not pushed by us but initiated from the ground."
              <br> <br> Among the immediate plans for 2010 is enhancing the REACH website with more interactive platforms and videos.
              <br> <br>Dr Khor said: "Over the last couple of years, ever since we
              revamped the feedback unit to REACH, we have been active on closing the
              loop, ensuring that and allaying the criticism that it is a blackhole. <br> <br> "So we have 'your feedback-our response' on our website itself. It
              actually lists out the feedback that we have received and the
              government's response - be it in terms of actual replies from the
              ministry or in terms of policy announcements in response to their
              feedback. <br> <br> "So a very good example is this foreigner issue. We have had very good
              feedback on this issue and we have sent it to the relevant ministries
              and over the last couple of months, many government leaders have come
              out and talked about the concerns, about the foreigner issue, and what
              they are going to do to allay their concerns as well as explaining to
              the public in general why we need to continue with the policy to
              attract new immigrants." <br> <br> Besides upgrading its website, REACH will also be bringing its roving
              exhibition to the central business district. It wants to widen its
              outreach to professionals so that this group too knows more about the
              programmes of REACH and how they can give their feedback.
              <br> <br> The aspirations of the younger generation have also not been forgotten. </span></p>
