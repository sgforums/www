              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The group of more 
              than 10 pirates, mainly Indonesians, took over the S$5.8 million tugboat
               called "Marina 26", as well as a barge it was pulling. The vessels had 
              left Singapore 24 hours earlier.<br><br>The pirates destroyed the 
              tugboat's Global Positioning System device and the 10-men crew were tied
               up and locked up in one of the cabins.<br><br>"We were all shivering," the vessel's master, Captain Amri Arsyad, 31, told MediaCorp in Bahasa Indonesian. <br><br>They
               were held captive for two days while the pirates re-painted the vessel 
              with leftover green paint they found onboard. The pirates then forced 
              the crew to jump into a life-raft with some food, mineral water and 
              their passports.<br><br>The next 40 hours were hell. <br><br>"We spotted
               a cargo ship and started waving and shouting for attention but it 
              passed us by. We felt really helpless. Later that afternoon, the boat 
              started to deflate and we paddled with our hands to try to reach Tioman,
               which was far away on the horizon," said Mr Amri.<br><br>Soon, they were tired and stopped paddling, letting the boat drift.<br><br>"It seemed hopeless. At the back of my mind, I thought that was the end of my life," he said.<br><br>Their
               fate changed when they were spotted by a fisherman who was passing by 
              and came to their rescue. The crew, mostly Indonesians, are now 
              recovering at Natuna Island in Indonesia.  <br><br>A search and recovery was not carried out because the area is believed to be too large to cover.<br><br>International
               information sharing centre for maritime matters, ReCAAP ISC, has 
              confirmed the incident and has circulated an incident alert with photos 
              of the tugboat. <br><br>A similar hijacking off Pulau Tioman was reported in February last year. <br><br>The
               tugboat and barge is owned by Indonesian shipping company PT. Pelnas 
              Bahtera Bestari Shipping. Its director, Miss Tresya, an avid diver who 
              frequents Pulau Tioman, contacted MediaCorp with news of the incident. <br><br>She
               said "We hope to alert vessel owners and the relevant authorities to 
              the piracy problems around our region which, we feel, have been 
              neglected.  <br><br>"The fact that this incident happened close to the 
              coast of a populated area shows that the pirates have no fear. Many 
              Singaporeans dive off Tioman and those who own vessels go there often. 
              We want to warn them of the potential danger."<br><br>-TODAY/ac</span></span></p>
