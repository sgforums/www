              <p>SEVERAL members of the National Safety Council of Singapore have been
               questioned by the Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) concerning at

              <p>Confirming this with The Straits Times last night, a police spokesman

               the details of the case at this point in time.</p>

              <h1 class="headline">National Safety Council members under probe</h1>
              <p>The Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) is investigating "key members" of the National Safety Council of Singapore "for possible misappropriation of funds," a police spokesperson told <em>The Straits Times</em> (ST) on Friday.</p>
              <p>At least $600,000 could have been misappropriated from the 45-year-old non-profit body.</p>
              <p>The paper said the investigation came after a report was filed by the Traffic Police.</p>
              <p>The Commissioner of Charities said it had stopped the council from raising funds in September last year.</p>
              <p>The council's president, Tan Jin Thong, 72, said he and several 
              council directors were questioned by the CAD in September last year. The
               investigations would take six months, he said.</p>
              <p>He admitted that the council is in "quite a pathetic situation" and hopes it will be able to overcome its problems.</p>
              <p>Deputy president Ameerali Abdeali, who is not under investigation, 
              intends to hold an internal check to  find out what happened to their 
              funds once the CAD's probe is over.</p>
              <p>The 59-year-old is the council's acting president as Tan is on medical leave.</p>
              <p>The council is currently suffering from money woes.</p>
              <p>From 20 employees, the council is down to six, who have been on no-pay leave since March.</p>
              <p>The council has been locked out of its premises at Tan Boon Liat 
              Building for owing two months' rent. However, Tan and other directors 
              said the two-month deposit the council paid should have covered the 
              amount owed.</p>
              <p>The council has also been served a garnishee order by Winson Press, 
              which prints its safety manuals. The printer is owed about $40,000.</p>
              <p>Honorary secretary-general Anthony Sia attributed the council's 
              financial woes to losing a contract to run safety courses for maids. It 
              had run the course from 2004 to 2010 and revenue was between $60,000 to 
              $80,000 a month.</p>
              <p>The Ministry of Manpower awarded the contract to another organisation in January.</p>
              <p>Paying off its debts and staff salaries will be the council's first priority when it has the money, it told the same paper.</p>
