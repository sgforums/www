              <p><strong>Ex-health minister in Malaysia sacked over sex tape</strong></p>
              <p class="first">KUALA LUMPUR (AFP) - - The ethnic Chinese party in
              Malaysia's ruling coalition has sacked a top leader over a sex-video
              scandal, triggering infighting that could erode the support of the
              minority community.</p>
              <p>The Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA) decided overnight to expel
              Chua Soi Lek, who was forced to quit as health minister last year after
              being caught on tape having sex with an unidentified woman in a hotel
              room.</p>
              <p>Chua, 62, who is married with three children, was the
              deputy president of the MCA, the second-largest party in the Barisan
              Nasional coalition which rules the Muslim-majority nation.</p>
              <p>"We
              did so with a heavy heart after giving much consideration to the damage
              inflicted upon the party image brought about by his sex scandal
              featured in the DVD," MCA president Ong Tee Keat said as he announced
              the sacking.</p>
              <p>The move comes as the Barisan Nasional attempts to
              regain support from minority Chinese and Indians, who swung away from
              the coalition in national elections last year.</p>
              <p>Prime Minister Najib Razak called on the MCA to resolve its problems quickly.</p>
              <p>"We
              need to handle it so that its effect does not hurt Barisan Nasional,"
              he told reporters. "We want a strong MCA, no doubt about it. We want an
              MCA that can represent the aspirations of the Chinese community."</p>
              <p>In
              the wake of the sex scandal, Chua resigned as the party's number three
              but was voted back in by party members to the number-two post last year.</p>
              <p>That
              set off a running battle with Ong, whom Chua said felt threatened by
              the support he had, and in recent months the sex scandal was revived
              with new questions over the legality of the acts depicted in the tape.</p>
              <p>Chua has previously accused his political "enemies" of orchestrating the release of the widely circulated video.</p>
              <p>Chua
              said Thursday he was surprised by the decision to expel him and urged
              MCA members to remove Ong, saying the party was "still drifting without
              direction and purpose."</p>
              <p>"Comrades who love the party will come to
              realise that it's time to stand up and unite to save the party.
              Otherwise, we will soon fade into oblivion," he said in a statement
              posted on his blog.</p>
              <p>"I have confidence that MCA members will not let one man self-destroy the party."</p>
              <p>Political
              analyst James Chin said the sacking was a "wrong move" that would throw
              Barisan into further disarray -- it is already plagued by infighting
              within another component party that represents Indians.</p>
              <p>"The
              Chinese community will see that a deeply divided MCA can't play the
              role of being their representatives in the government," said Chin, a
              political analyst at the Monash University campus in Kuala Lumpur.</p>
