              <p><strong>APEC summit likely to open many trade doors</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Leaders from the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
              (APEC) will be meeting in Singapore for a summit in two weeks, and the
              spotlight will be on US President Barack Obama, as he spearheads US
              efforts to promote trade with the region. </span></p>
              <p><span>According to former Deputy US Trade Representative Peter Allgeier, APEC is an important forum for the US.
              <br> <br> "First of all, there has been a lot of work within APEC to promote
              regional economic integration and good policies. It has been able to
              continue and build on that work. The other thing is that it is a very
              collaborative kind of organisation, it is not a confrontational one,"
              said Mr Allgeier.
              <br> <br>Speaking at a seminar in Singapore, he singled out the services
              sector as one key area of cooperation, especially in sectors such as
              financial services, telecoms, energy, environment and information
              technology.
              <br> <br>The US is in the process of working out a free trade pact with
              South Korea, and when passed by Congress, it is likely to signal the
              beginning of stronger US involvement in the Asia Pacific. <br> <br> "The next step really, is for ratification by both governments.
              Carrying that final step would be a sign that the United States is
              going to be increasingly engaged in Asia, and I think frankly, it is
              very much in our economic interests to approve that agreement," Mr
              Allgeier said.
              <br> <br>Looking ahead to the APEC summit, Mr Allgeier said that the meeting
              between President Obama and ten ASEAN leaders would likely open many
              trade doors. However, it would be premature to expect any talk about an
              FTA between the US and this region at the summit.

              <p><strong>150 officers from govt agencies to be appointed APEC liaison officers</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: More than 150 officers from various government
              agencies will be appointed as liaison officers for the upcoming Asia
              Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meetings, to be held in Singapore
              from November 8. </span></p>
              <p><span>The officers will provide personalised assistance to the APEC
              leaders, ministers and their spouses. In order to equip them with the
              relevant knowledge and skills, the officers have undergone training on
              areas such as protocol management, business etiquette and Singapore's
              tourism offerings.
              <br> <br>Mr Tan Kay Chuan, head of the APEC Singapore 2009 Organising
              Secretariat said: "The necessary preparations and training have been
              made to ensure that all liaison officers are well-equipped to perform
              their roles. <br> <br> "We are also confident that other than assisting the APEC leaders,
              ministers, and their spouses, the liaison officers will also put forth
              that sense of warmth and human touch which we hope to extend to our
              APEC guests as part of the Singapore Experience."
              <br> <br> The liason officers will be wearing uniforms, specially created by local designer Celia Loe from First Stop Pte Ltd.
              <br> <br>"I wanted my designs to reflect Singapore as a cosmopolitan city
              that is modern, vibrant, and engaging. I am happy that the outfit
              accentuates all these elements and, at the same time, is comfortable
              and looks distinguished," Ms Loe said.
              <br> <br>Male liaison officers will wear a grey suit with white shirt and a
              burgundy red tie, while female liaison officers will wear a pink blouse
              and a grey jacket with a choice of pants or skirt.

              <p><strong>APEC traffic rehearsals to be carried out Oct 31-Nov 1</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
              Organising Committee will be conducting traffic rehearsals on 31
              October 2009 and 1 November 2009. </span></p>
              <p><span>This is in anticipation of the APEC Leaders' Week meetings that will be held in Singapore from 8-15 November 2009. 
              <br> <br> As part of the rehearsal proceedings, certain roads will be affected. 
              <br> <br> Most of the closures will either involve lane closures or temporary
              road closures for short periods of time. Some other roads and
              expressways may also be affected as part of the rehearsals. <br> <br> The APEC organising committee says the duration of these road closures will, however, be kept to a minimum. 
              <br> <br> To minimise any potential inconvenience to motorists, the extreme right
              lane of affected roads will be set aside as a dedicated APEC Lane to
              facilitate the movement of APEC vehicles.
              <br> <br> The APEC Lane will only be closed to the public prior to and during the movement of APEC vehicles. 
              <br> <br> Motorists are strongly encouraged to tune in to the radio for the latest updates on road and lane closures. 
              <br> <br> EMAS and advisory signs will be put up on the affected roads to inform motorists of the closures. 
              <br> <br>Auxiliary Police officers and Traffic Police officers will also be
              stationed at the affected roads and junctions to regulate traffic.
              <br> <br> Parking restrictions at the peripheral roads will be strictly enforced.

              <p><strong>Singapore authorities cast a wary eye on civil groups ahead of APEC summit</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: With two weeks to go before heads of state gather for
              the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit here, Singapore is
              wary about allowing the entry of well-organised civil groups and
              disruptive individuals bent on derailing the talks or championing their
              causes. </span></p>
              <p><span> Two Falungong followers, a Malaysian and an Indonesian, were reportedly
              denied entry into Singapore at Changi Airport last week. </span></p>
              <p><span>According to the Epoch Times, the sect's publication, the pair
              tried to enter the country separately on Oct 19 and Oct 22. The report
              also said the pair had previously made frequent trips to Singapore. <br> <br> Falungong, a religious sect, was banned in China in 1999 after it was
              accused of fanning social unrest. Though it is not outlawed in
              Singapore, several of its followers here have been arrested for holding
              illegal assemblies. <br> <br> When MediaCorp cited the Falungong example and asked if Singapore was
              keeping out individuals who might pose law-and-order problems, a
              spokeswoman from the APEC Singapore 2009 organising committee said all
              requests to enter the country would be treated fairly. <br> <br> "All sovereign nations have the prerogative to decide who cross their
              borders. Singapore is no exception," she said. "This is especially so
              in the current security climate, where we have a duty to ensure the
              safety and security of the public." <br> <br> Security analyst Dr John Harrison from the S. Rajaratnam School of
              International Studies was not surprised with the entry ban related to
              APEC. <br> <br> "The (Singapore) government will get a variety of information in from
              all sources - open and classified - from partners in the region and
              around the world," he said. "It will try and mitigate threats and risks
              as early as possible." <br> <br> Apart from the task of keeping out people with backgrounds tied to
              terrorism, the authorities would have their eye on individuals who
              could use the event to carry out violent protests, Dr Harrison said. <br> <br> Three years ago, when Singapore hosted the International Monetary
              Fund-World Bank meeting, the authorities objected to 28 foreigners -
              all of whom had a history of taking part in violent protests or
              disruptive activities at previous meetings - from being allowed into
              the country. <br> <br> Then, civil society organisations were allowed to protest in a small
              corner of the meeting venue at Suntec Singapore International
              Convention and Exhibition Centre; large-scale protests were confined to
              the Indonesian island of Batam. <br> <br> Observers say that unlike the IMF event to which many civil society
              groups were invited, APEC's broader platform is not likely to warrant
              the same level of involvement and, hence, numbers of activists. </span></p>

              <br> <br> Moreover, the furniture is not just about form without function. The

              <p><strong>120 youth delegates to take on role as journalists during the APEC summit</strong></p>
              <p>World leaders will gather in Singapore for the APEC Summit in less than a week. <br> <br> And apart from engaging with one another, they may just have to deal
              with some tough questions- not from your everyday journalists. <br> <br> Our news desk with more. <br>   <br> In the last few months, 40 Singaporean youths aged between 18 and 25,
              have been preparing for what some of them say is a once in a lifetime
              opportunity. <br> <br> They have been selected to take part in the annual APEC Voices of the
              Future programme, which seeks to give them an insight into the
              organisation's role, functions and workings. <br> <br> Chairperson from the programme's organising committee Natalie Morris tells us why it’s important for youths to get involved. <br> <br> "Its very easy i think for the APEC issues to lose its relevance for
              the young people when you don't know so much about them and you have
              not had the opportunity to learn about them. So when young people get
              involved, they are encouraged to think about the issues and when they
              write about them also, they are encouraged to reflect and then they
              will get to see the relevance of APEC in their own lives and in their
              own economy." <br> <br> Taking the role as a journalist, the youths will get the chance to interview APEC economic and business leaders. <br> <br> And some of them have already set their sights on who, and what to ask. <br> <br> 23 year-old Avnish Desai an undergraduate from Singapore Management University is one of them. <br> <br> "Everyone will like to meet President Obama,perhaps Prime Minister of
              Australia, Prime minister Kevin Rudd, and if possible i will like to
              meet the President of China. I will like to meet Timothy Geithner
              himself. The man behind what's happening behind the regulations in the
              US and its impact on the rest of the world." <br> <br> While 24 year -old Ng Xue na says she has some specific questions in mind. <br> <br> "In today's context, it is not just about throwing big chunks of money
              into the financial budget to cushion the effects, but in the long run
              so how do economies actually deal with the long term issues on the
              ageing population and also global warming impact on the economic self
              and also political ties with neighbouring country." <br> <br> The youth programme will also bring together another 80 young journalists from other APEC economies. <br> <br> As part of the Voices programme, the Singaporean delegates will also be
              showcasing various aspects of Singapore to the international delegates.
              This will include trips to the Night Safari, the Marina Barrage, and
              HDB Heartlands.<br> <br> Reports written by the young journalists, will be put on the programme's website everyday. <br> <br> All of it will eventually be compiled and circulated to APEC stakeholders. <br> <br> They include the Singapore Business Foundation, Virtual Trade Mission,
              national youth focal points in the APEC economies, Singapore's Minister
              for Community Development, Youth and Sports, and Singapore's President,
              S. R. Nathan. The Voices of the Future programme is organised by the
              National Youth Council in cooperation with Singapore's Ministry of
              Community Development, Youth and Sports and the National Youth
              Achievement Award (NYAA) Council.</p>

              <p><strong>APEC meeting first event to be gazetted under new Public Order Act</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : The APEC meeting in Singapore is the first major
              event to be gazetted as a "Special Event" under the amended Public
              Order Act introduced earlier this year. </span></p>
              <p><span>Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong told local and international media
              that he does not expect disruptions from civil society groups. He said
              that unlike the IMF World Bank meeting, APEC does not engage such
              groups.
              <br> <br> Still, security is a concern.
              <br> <br>Mr Lee said the new Public Order Act was passed in time for APEC so
              that Singapore will have "adequate powers to ensure law, order and
              security".
              <br> <br> Police have the power to stop and search, request reasons for entry and deny entry to the gazetted areas. 
              <br> <br>"We can gazette certain areas and within that area, we can instruct
              people to move along and not dawdle and attempt to do something which
              is disruptive. And if they don't, we can take action against them,"
              said Mr Lee. <br> <br> "When we had a meeting in Sydney two years ago, (the Australians) spent
              $300 million building a fence surrounding the whole of the centre of
              Sydney and declared a public holiday, so all Sydney-ans could leave the
              town and leave us in solitary splendour. We're not going to do quite
              that but we hope to have a smooth and peaceful meeting," he added. <br> <br> Three years ago, when Singapore hosted the International Monetary
              Fund-World Bank meeting, the authorities objected to 28 foreigners -
              all of whom had a history of taking part in violent protests or
              disruptive activities at previous meetings - from being allowed into
              the country.
              <br> <br>During that period, civil society organisations were allowed to
              protest in a space provided within the Suntec Singapore International
              Convention and Exhibition Centre. </span></p>

              <p><strong>APEC CEO Summit in Singapore to see record turnout of leaders</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: The APEC CEO Summit in Singapore next week will see a
              record number of 1,500 participants, underscoring the strategic
              importance of this year's meeting. Taking centre stage will be world
              leaders such as US President Barack Obama and Chinese President Hu
              Jintao. </span></p>
              <p><span>Organisers of the APEC CEO Summit have launched an online discussion forum, </span>www.asiapacvoices.com<span>, featuring opinion-editorial pieces by prominent personalities and leaders to stimulate public discussion on the summit agenda.
              <br> <br> The organisers will also be distilling the proceedings for APEC leaders
              ahead of their meetings, in a bid to ensure views from every sector are
              presented to the highest level of government and business.
              <br> <br>Chong Siak Ching, chair of organising committee, APEC CEO Summit,
              said: "There is an urgency for the business community and the
              governments to come up with sustainable and new business models.
              <br> <br>"In order to do that, we need to engage the wider community from
              across the Asia Pacific and get their voices and have their say in
              terms of what is needed to rebuild the global economy."
              <br> <br>Besides the online forum, organisers are also commissioning a
              survey, asking some 300 CEOs for their views on various economic
              issues. Details of this survey will be released next week.
              <br> <br>Meanwhile, various broadcasters are busy preparing for the big
              event, getting the technical knots sorted out at Suntec Singapore.
              <br> <br>Host broadcaster MediaCorp is building the International Broadcast
              Centre, which will encompass various television broadcasting aspects
              required by international TV stations.
              <br> <br> Singapore's Channel NewsAsia is also one of the official media partners of the APEC CEO Summit.

              <p><strong>What measures will APEC endorse?</strong></p>
              <p>Asia Pacific leaders are expected to endorse measures next week, that
              will make it easier for businesses to operate across borders. <br> <br> Specific targets have been drawn up and will be presented during the Asia Pacific Economic Conference or APEC meeting. <br> <br> As host of APEC 2009, Singapore wants to see some specific targets and initiatives announced. <br> APEC's main agenda is economic integration among the 21-member economies. <br> <br> For companies, this simply means doing business in the region faster, cheaper and easier.<em> <br> <br> </em>Five areas of priority for reform have been identified - Starting
              a Business, Getting Credit, Trading Across Borders, Enforcing Contracts
              and Dealing with Permits.<br> <br> The aim is to achieve tangible results such as cutting down the cost of
              shipping a container, and reducing the number of days it takes to start
              a business. <br> A number of "champion economies" with specific strengths will share their reform programmes. <br> <br> There's also a new Supply Chain Connectivity Initiative to make the movement of goods shorter and cheaper.<em> <br> <br> </em>Choke points have been identified and measures to unblock them will be revealed.<br> <br> Mr Ravi Menon is Chairperson of APEC's Senior Officials Meeting.<strong> <br> <br> </strong> "Simplifying customs procedures and documentations, means
              that a business filling up these forms now have a much easier task. Now
              these are targets we are setting, we are working at it. It helps
              particularly small and medium enterprises who do not have the means to
              operate internationally.<br> <br> The details are not out but in some cases they may not need to fill out
              forms. If you reduce the number of days it starts to set up a business,
              that's a great help. If it takes 30 days before, now 25 days, you have
              saved 5 days in starting a business. If it takes x-dollars to ship a
              container and now it takes x-minus-y dollars to ship a container, that
              is tangible savings."<br> <br> At the end of the 8-day meeting, leaders are expected to issue a
              standalone statement which will focus on key action items they will
              commit to.<em> <br> <br> </em>These include strategies on new growth areas to foster balanced, inclusive and sustainable growth, in a post-crisis landscape.<br> <br> Something APEC leaders hope will translate to real benefits to the man in the street. <br> <br> Mr Menon again.<strong> <br> <br> </strong> "It will be about security of jobs. You're going to see a
              gradual evolution, in terms of schemes to enhance worker re-training
              and so on, and of course safety nets. <br> <br> You want to be able to give short term assistance but in the long term
              you want the person to be able to pick himself up and participate in
              the economy as part of inclusive growth."</p>

              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Delegates attending the 20th Asia-Pacific Economic
              Cooperation (APEC) Summit starting Sunday have started arriving in
              Singapore. </span></p>
              <p><span>Singapore's Changi Airport started preparing for the APEC
              delegates months ago, with arrival halls decked out with various
              signages and banners.
              <br> <br>With over 10,000 delegates expected, security is tight but there
              has been careful planning to ensure smooth traffic at transit areas and
              immigration counters.
              <br> <br>Julia Jemangin, manager of corporate communications at Changi
              Airport Group, said: "We have dedicated 12 immigration lanes, as well
              as the deployment of more than 450 volunteers throughout the airport,
              to provide the necessary assistance to the APEC delegates. <br> <br> "These volunteers have been stationed strategically at locations such
              as gate hold rooms, immigration counters, as well as the baggage claim
              belts."
              <br> <br> The volunteers have been on duty since Wednesday, and they say traffic has been smooth and swift.
              <br> <br>"So far, I have met Russian and Thai delegates. I put a sticker on
              them, and I basically take them to the immigration place, where they
              actually have a line of their own, where they pass through immigration
              at a faster pace than maybe a local tourist," said Liveina Kumar, an
              APEC volunteer.
              <br> <br> Another 160 liaison officers are stationed at the airport's VIP complex to welcome senior government officials.
              <br> <br>Besides the official work, delegates can look forward to special
              tours to local attractions, and some of them will also be given a set
              of stamps to commemorate the event.
              <br> <br> The public have also expressed interest in the stamps, with many advance orders received.
              <br> <br>Singapore Post says the stamps showcase what Singapore has to offer
              - in terms of being an attractive business venue and a vibrant city.
              <br> <br> The stamps are slated go on sale from Monday.

              <p><span>SINGAPORE: The 20th Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
              forum kicked off in Singapore with a meeting of senior officials on
              Sunday. </span></p>
              <p><span>The forum brings together 21 members located around the Pacific
              Ocean in an annual summit focused on economic growth, free trade and
              investment.
              <br> <br> More than 10,000 delegates, including leaders and ministers, are expected at the week-long event in Singapore.
              <br> <br>APEC leaders, including US President Barack Obama, Chinese
              President Hu Jintao and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, will meet on
              November 14 and 15.
              <br> <br>APEC members are Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong
              Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New
              Guinea, Peru, the Philippines, Russia, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan,
              Thailand, the United States and Vietnam.
              <br> <br>APEC's 21 member economies account for 40.5 percent of the world's
              population, 54.2 percent of its gross domestic product and 43.7 percent
              of global trade.
              <br> <br>The forum has worked to reduce tariffs and other trade barriers
              across the region. It is guided by its "Bogor Goals" (named after the
              1994 summit venue in Indonesia) of free and open trade and investment.
              Industrialised members were meant to achieve this by 2010 and
              developing economies by 2020.
              <br> <br> APEC operates on the basis of non-binding commitments, and decisions are reached by consensus.
              <br> <br>This year, the forum comes at a time when global economies are just
              recovering from the worst downturn in decades. Addressing the issue, a
              draft APEC communique stressed that "economic recovery is not yet on a
              solid footing" and "we will maintain our economic stimulus policies
              until a durable economic recovery is secured."
              <br> <br> On climate change, APEC will call it "one of the biggest challenges facing the world", according to the draft declaration. 
              <br> <br>The leaders will try to give a boost to a crunch global meeting on
              climate change next month in Copenhagen. They will stress their
              commitment to reaching a "good agreement in Copenhagen", according to
              the draft communique.
              <br> <br>The December gathering in the Danish capital will try to thrash out
              a new treaty to tackle global warming, but preparatory talks have
              become deadlocked.
              <br> <br>APEC executive director Michael Tay said the discussions on climate
              change were part of efforts to achieve sustainable economic growth.
              <br> <br>"One way is to look at energy efficiency, the sharing of best
              practices, the sharing of technology," he told AFP. "We are also
              looking at how to give better access for trade in environmental goods
              and services."

              <p><strong>APEC senior officials discuss ways to make economic growth more inclusive</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Senior officials from the 21 APEC economies
              kick-started their round of meetings on Sunday and a key topic of
              discussion was on broadening access to economic opportunities so that
              everyone can benefit from growth. </span></p>
              <p><span>The meet was ahead of the APEC Leaders Meeting next weekend to
              finalise the outcome documents for their Ministers and Leaders to
              endorse.
              <br> <br>The 21 APEC economies make up nearly 55 per cent of the world's
              trade, and their Leaders' meeting comes at a time when much of the
              world is slowly recovering from the global financial crisis.
              <br> <br> APEC's senior officials say the grouping's stance on trade is now clear, and vow to resist protectionism.
              <br> <br>"During the early days, we were not sure whether free trade was
              more important or managed trade, or some kind of protectionism for our
              companies," said Michael Tay, executive director of APEC Secretariat. <br> <br> "20 years later, APEC is all about free trade. So despite the financial
              crisis, the APEC leaders were one of the first to stand up and say we
              will not create new barriers at this time, we will resist
              protectionism. <br> <br> "The crisis has shown that employment is a big issue. If employment
              falls, people become unsettled, anxious, then they want protectionism.
              APEC would have to, in the next few years, look at inclusive growth.
              It's a new idea under the Singapore chairmanship that APEC will be
              discussing in the next few years."
              <br> <br>Chong Siak Ching, chairman of the APEC CEO Summit said: "Everyone
              is looking at what has gone wrong... we have to do ensure we don't
              repeat the mistakes of the past. <br> <br> "The CEO Summit that is happening at this point in time is a great
              opportunity for everyone who is a stakeholder in the global economy to
              come together and to discuss issues about rebuilding the global
              economy. <br> <br> "There will be many important areas that will be covered. We are
              talking about global economic governance and that is important because
              many have attributed the crisis to a failure in the whole financial
              infrastructure, both at the regulatory level and the business
              community. <br> <br> "There will also be discussion on how do we build a sustainable and a
              balanced economy, moving forward. We have to ensure that what we put in
              place today will sustain us in the long term."
              <br> <br> Senior officials are holding two retreat meetings on Sunday and they say it is all about confidence building.
              <br> <br>Said Tay: "This year is particularly important because the crisis
              has struck all of us. None of us was immune and there was a sense of
              purpose among the officials and if you ask me about the mood, there is
              a true sense of partnership this year." <br> <br> APEC's senior officials have also been discussing ways to improve the
              business environment in the 21 economies. Hence, they have come up with
              a proposal of having five target areas to be achieved, which would be
              put up to the Ministers for an endorsement.
              <br> <br> Officials have also held discussions on ways to move towards a Free Trade Area for the Asia Pacific.
              <br> <br>APEC's Leaders who meet next Saturday and Sunday are also expected
              to issue a statement on climate change ahead of the Copenhagen meeting
              next month. <br> <br> APEC economies account for approximately 60 per cent of world energy
              consumption. In 2007, APEC Leaders proposed a regional goal to reduce
              energy intensity by at least 25 per cent by 2030.

              <p><strong>APEC senior officials discussing findings of trade finance survey</strong></p>
              <p>A trade finance survey of the APEC economies has been carried out in October and November this year. <br> <br> And senior officials in Singapore have been discussing the findings of
              this survey on the final day of their preparatory meetings. <br> <br> A spokesperson for the APEC Leaders summit told a media briefing that
              the survey results address the global financial crisis and preparations
              for recovery. <br> <br> Senior officials have also been addressing the issue of accelerating regional economic integration. <br> <br> They say APEC's traditional role of keeping regional markets open will take on a greater significance in the years ahead. <br> <br> Meanwhile several reports from the APEC secretariat are expected to be released today. <br> <br> Among them the report from the committee on trade and investment and the report from the economics committee.</p>

              say that this year's APEC discussions are much more open to SME growth. <br> <br> That's because the financial crisis has opened the eyes of many leaders

              <p><span>SINGAPORE: An interactive media experience aims to introduce APEC delegates to Singapore's past, present and future. </span></p>
              <p><span>The installations will walk APEC delegates through what makes Singapore unique and offer a peek at how the city has progressed.
              <br> <br> They will also help delegates unwind as they learn more about the country's creative industries.
              <br> <br> A condensed version of the Singapore Story is shown through interactive
              "hot spots" placed throughout the APEC summit venue at Suntec Singapore
              International Convention and Exhibition Centre.
              <br> <br>Quek Swee Kuan, assistant managing director, Economic Development
              Board, said: "We thought of using technology, multimedia to show off
              the capabilities of Singapore too. And we decided to put the exhibits
              in different places, where there's high traffic so that as they move
              from one place to another something will surprise them."
              <br> <br>The installations are placed strategically throughout the venue to
              enhance the information that is being shown. For example, one toilet
              was fitted with motion sensors. So every time visitors use the toilet,
              they will be shown the story of how Singapore has managed to come up
              with innovative solutions to meet its water needs.
              <br> <br>The showcase is a collaboration between several government
              agencies, including the Singapore Tourism Board, SPRING Singapore and
              the Media Development Authority. <br> <br> The other agencies are the Singapore Economic Development Board,
              DesignSingapore Council, Infocomm Development Authority, International
              Enterprise Singapore, Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources,
              Ministry of Information, Communication and The Arts, Ministry of
              National Development, and Ministry of Trade and Industry.
              <br> <br> It was launched by Trade and Industry Minister Lim Hng Kiang.
              <br> <br> Organisers said it is a celebration of Singaporeans and how their efforts have transformed the city to what it is today.
              <br> <br>Fusing technology with design and creativity, the Singapore
              Showcase also features a souvenir booklet available at the Business
              Clock installation. This installation will be moved to Level 2 Ballroom
              foyer from November 13 onwards.
              <br> <br> The Singapore Showcase experience will also be available on a virtual platform - Virtual Singapore in Twinity. It is available </span><a href="http://www.twinity.com/">here</a><span> and will feature the APEC 2009 Leaders' Week by creating an immersive,
              multi-user experience for its members through the use of embedded video
              and 3D models of key content developed specially for the project. </span></p>

              <p><strong>APEC forum has shown itself to be useful in times of crisis</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum has
              repeatedly shown itself to be useful in times of crisis. That's the
              view of ministers and academics at a symposium to commemorate the 20th
              anniversary of APEC. </span></p>
              <p><span>The symposium on Tuesday was organised by Singapore's Institute of Policy Studies.
              <br> <br> It has been 20 good years for APEC, said Singapore's Foreign Minister
              George Yeo. But he cautioned members against resting on their laurels.
              <br> <br>Mr Yeo said: "It is quite a remarkable achievement. Many things
              could have gone wrong and there were ups and downs but because leaders
              met, because we had goals, we kept the agenda positive, so little by
              little, despite occasional problems, we pushed on.
              <br> <br>"We must keep pushing, because the moment we stop pushing, the
              moment we stop putting forth a positive agenda, there is a natural
              tendency to go backwards. The negative nay-sayers will overwhelm us in
              time.
              <br> <br>"When there are crisis moments, having a platform where leaders,
              ministers, officials, business leaders and academics meet regularly and
              establish bonds of friendship can matter decisively.
              <br> <br> "It is critical to maintain a positive agenda. It is important to consolidate and deepen APEC."
              <br> <br> Symposium participants also called for greater collaboration between APEC and other regional institutions.
              <br> <br>Ministers and experts taking part in the APEC symposium also
              emphasised the important role that the G20 countries can play in
              pushing the agenda of trade and economic liberalisation. <br> <br> In fact, ASEAN too now has a place in the G20 forum, with the ASEAN chair being invited to take part in the discussions.
              <br> <br> And experts don't see the G20 as a threat to APEC.
              <br> <br> US APEC delegate, Kurt Tong, said: "There is a great opportunity for
              APEC and the G20 to feed off each other in mutually reinforcing ways,
              much in the way that APEC and WTO have assisted each other in the areas
              of trade, investments and liberalisation."
              <br> <br>For World Bank president Robert Zoellick, a key lesson learnt from
              the global economic crisis was the need to keep promoting open markets
              - mainly through formal trade agreements.
              <br> <br>He said: "What I find most intriguing, though, out of the global
              trade and liberalisation and its connection to APEC is (that) since I
              spend my time in global bodies, most of the focus coming out of Europe
              in this crisis is now focused on regulation, compensation, bonuses.
              <br> <br>"It is quite intriguing (when it comes) to Asia, where the sense
              is: if you have a slow growth path, the idea, the real challenge is
              what structural changes do you need to have to increase the
              possibilities of growth. <br> <br> "I find that very healthy and it actually is very important as one considers future global arrangements...."
              <br> <br> For the future, ministers believe there is much work to consolidate and
              deepen the work of APEC. Among them are financial reform, climate
              change and the global trading agenda, with the aim of creating a better
              world.

              <p><strong>PM Lee urges APEC members to re-commit to goals of free trade</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has called on
              Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) members to re-commit to their
              goals of sustaining growth, avoiding protectionism and promoting
              regional economic integration. </span></p>
              <p><span>Mr Lee was speaking at the welcome reception for the APEC
              Ministerial Meeting at Suntec Singapore Convention Hall on Tuesday
              evening.
              <br> <br>Besides the foreign ministers, trade ministers, finance deputies
              and other delegates, some special guests were also at the reception.
              <br> <br>"We have some special guests with us, old friends who were involved
              in the formation and early development of APEC," said Prime Minister
              Lee. "For example, Mr Bob Hawke, who was prime minister when Australia
              convened the first APEC meeting in Canberra."
              <br> <br> The special guests are in Singapore for a high-level symposium to commemorate the 20th anniversary of APEC.
              <br> <br>Mr Lee noted that APEC was formed in 1989 amid concerns of rising
              protectionist sentiments. Twelve economies, including Singapore,
              Australia and the US, came together to give free trade a push.
              <br> <br>Today, the grouping has grown to 21 members, and there is added
              resonance to that very same agenda, as economies prepare for a
              post-crisis landscape.
              <br> <br>Prime Minister Lee said that the APEC meeting in Singa­pore takes
              place at a pivotal moment "when the world economy is emerging from the
              global financial crisis, when the situation has stabilised, yet the
              economic outlook remains uncertain, when much still needs to be done to
              sustain the economic recovery".
              <br> <br> And as Mr Lee pointed out, this is a good time for APEC members to re-commit to their goals of free trade.
              <br> <br>He said: "So, this 20th anniversary is a good time to re-energise
              APEC and re-commit ourselves to its work to ensure that APEC continues
              to take the lead in trade liberalisation and business facilitation, and
              continues to be relevant and to adapt as the APEC community in our
              region continues to grow and change."
              <br> <br> There is a slew of challenges governments will have to face as economies deal with different stages of recovery. 
              <br> <br>Observers have said that the immediate issues include how
              governments want to exit from their various stimulus packages as well
              as growing unemployment as economies restructure. <br> <br> These issues and more will form the basis of talks as APEC leaders meet at the end of the week.

              <p>A medical centre and two medical posts have been set up within Suntec
              Singapore to take care of the medical needs of delegates attending the
              APEC meetings. <br> <br> Should anyone require immediate medical attention, the medical team says help will be rendered in just two minutes. <br> <br> In all, three doctors and six nurses are on standby everyday. <br> <br> Since the start of the meetings last Saturday, the medical team says it has been seeing an average of 10 patients daily. <br> <br> Most sought medical attention for minor illnesses such as flu, headache and abdominal pains. <br> <br> There have been no emergency cases like heart attack or stroke. <br> <br> But the team says it's well-equipped to respond to such cases and incidents which may involve many casualties. <br> <br> Dr Suresh Pillai is head of the medical sub-committee. <br> <br> "There will be extra medical team that will be activated from the all
              the hospitals, all hospitals will have a field medical team on standby
              to move in the event of a mass casualty incident.So they have been prep
              to be on standby and move out within five minutes in a mass casualty
              incident and they will response to whichever site the incident may be
              in." <br> <br> On the potential threat of influenza A H1N1, the medical team says its response is similar to any flu-like illness <br> <br> Dr Suresh again. <br> <br> "We have to make sure that we have the anti-viral drugs available and
              we also needed to ensure that we could do h1n1 testing, at the medical
              centre itself, at this point of time, there is probably no need to do
              any of these things, since the situation is well control and
              stabilised." <br> <br> Those who require follow up treatment in hospital, will be sent to
              Singapore General Hospital or the National University Hospital. <br> Important guests who need to be sent to the hospital, will be escorted by police. <br> <br> Media personnel too are well-taken of, with a 24 hour medical centre set up within the media centre.</p>

              <p><strong>Asia-Pacific is more economically integrated </strong></p>
              <p>Singapore is the most economically integrated of the 21 economies which make up the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation or APEC. <br> <br> This according to an index released by the Pacific Economic Cooperation
              Council or PECC, as part of its annual State of the Region report. <br> <br> In fact the Asia Pacific region as a whole has become more integrated since APEC was founded 20 years ago. <br> <br> The PECC index of economic integration tracks the extent to which the
              APEC economies are becoming more alike in their economic
              characteristics. <br> <br> It also takes looks at the relative importance of regional trade,
              investment and human flows compared to economic relations with the rest
              of the world. <br> <br> Woo Yuen Pau is the coordinator of the report. <br> <br> "The path of integration has been rising pretty much through the entire
              two decade period, and we think that APEC can take some credit in
              enhancing the deepening of regional integration which surely is one of
              the fundamental goals of the APEC forum." <br> <br> Mr Woo said the index made use of 2006 data. <br> <br> "In fact integration will continue to have deepened through 2006 to
              2009 period, simply because the share of inter-regional trade and
              investment and human flows would have increased through this period
              because of the downturn in the United States and the EU. So, I’m fully
              expecting that when we produce our index next year, and the year after,
              we will find that integration will continue to be on the rise." <br> <br> PECC believes the findings to be significant as a measure of APEC’s
              success and a factor in assessing its progress towards the 2010 Bogor
              target. <br> <br> The Bogor Goals, adopted at the 1994 APEC summit, calls for
              industrialised members to achieve free trade and investment targets by
              2010. <br> <br> Developing member economies have until 2020.</p>

              <p><strong>Clinton stresses US commitment to APEC cooperation</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: US Secretary of State Hilary Clinton has stressed the
              Obama administration's commitment to substantive cooperation with
              Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) economies. She made this point
              to the media after a day-long meeting with APEC trade and foreign
              ministers. </span></p>
              <p><span>Mrs Clinton's arrival in Singapore caps an almost year long
              engagement process with Southeast Asia under the new Obama
              administration.
              <br> <br>So when the US commander in chief himself arrives in Singapore this
              weekend, APEC leaders will be looking out for President Barack Obama to
              signal his administration's long-term commitment to the region - even
              as he grapples with his country's many internal issues. <br> <br> "When President Obama arrives here later this week, he will underscore
              our view that APEC is an essential forum for engagement and action,"
              said Mrs Clinton.
              <br> <br> Her meetings with APEC ministers saw discussions that covered North Korea and Myanmar.
              <br> <br>The US recently started a new policy of engagement with Myanmar's
              military leaders. But Mrs Clinton stated that US sanctions on Myanmar
              will remain until meaningful progress is seen in the country.
              <br> <br> She added that ASEAN as a group can offer support to ensure the elections due by 2010 in Myanmar are fair and credible.
              <br> <br>"If we can encourage the Burmese leadership to meet in dialogue
              with representatives of various aspects of Burmese society, we hope
              that that can be encouraged by other nations, by ASEAN and maybe
              facilitated by ASEAN, because planning for these elections must be a
              priority," Mrs Clinton said.
              <br> <br>In an unprecedented move, the US will also meet all 10 ASEAN heads
              of state at the inaugural US-ASEAN Leaders meeting this Sunday. <br> <br> According to observers, the fact that the meeting is taking place - with Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos present - is significant.
              <br> <br> Moreover, ahead of the Copenhagen meeting next month on climate change,
              Mrs Clinton also outlined some key deliverables that the US is pushing
              for. These include ensuring any agreements reached are transparent,
              accountable and involve global action.
