              <p><strong>Round up of APEC Ministerial Meetings</strong></p>
              <p>APEC Ministers have called for an ambitious conclusion to the Doha Round next year.<br> <br> The call comes  after two days of discussions at the APEC Ministerial Meetings in Singapore.<br> <br> Claire Huang filed this report from Suntec City where the meetings are being  held.<br> <br> APEC ministers say recent political commitments must translate into tangible progress in  negotiations.<br> <br> Besides agreeing to band together to ensure that global economic
              recovery doesn’t stall, the ministers also pledged  to lay the
              foundation for a balanced, inclusive and sustainable growth.<br> <br> But in doing so, they acknowledged the need to stay vigilant against all forms of protectionism.<br> <br> Singapore’s Foreign Minister George Yeo explains.<br> <br> "From here the discussion will carry on into Canada, then to Korea, and
              back to Japan when it hosts the next APEC meeting. During this period,
              countries reacting to domestic politics can turn protectionistic and
              there is creeping protectionism, which, if we’re not careful, can put
              us on a slippery slope. So all countries are now saying “look, we must
              fight protectionism, resist it, keep the momentum on Doha, keep the
              momentum on regional free trade agreements, which are being worked
              upon”. <br> <br> Another area that gained a lot of interest is how APEC economies can accelerate regional economic integration.<br> <br> One target is to make it easier for business to be done at borders as well as behind and across borders.<br> <br> Minister for Trade and Industry Lim Hng Kiang elaborates.<br> <br> "We were able to come up with very specific targets, 25 per cent
              reduction in the way we measure the ease of doing business and that
              translates into costs, the number of days, the number of steps. It’s
              something that’s very concrete, very clear targets over next few years."<br> <br> APEC  Ministers also say they will explore the building blocks towards a possible Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific.<br> <br> Still, there are some concerns that the Bogor Goals to achieve free and
              open trade by 2010 might be difficult to achieve, if there's no
              breakthrough at the Doha Round. <br> <br> Foreign Minister George Yeo has this to say.<br> <br> "We’ve set the free trade area of the Asia-Pacific as a long-term goal
              for all of us to achieve. How to get there? By what pathways? Various
              possibilities are being explored. FDA, regional FDA, trans-pacific
              FDAs, and I thought we had lively discussions. No decisions of course,
              because APEC is a non-forcing organization, but the dynamics of
              globalization and the competitive liberalization are like water flowing
              to the sea, gradually taking us there. And if we look back in 1994,
              when Bogor goals were first enunciated and where we are today, I would
              say we’ve made considerable achievements." <br> <br> The proposals from the Singapore meeting is expected to be taken further when the ministers meet in Japan next year.</p>

              <p><strong>APEC's role to become more important post-crisis, says PM Lee</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation or APEC's role
              in promoting free trade will become more important post-financial
              crisis as the Asia Pacific is set to drive global growth, said
              Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Friday. </span></p>
              <p><span>Speaking at the APEC CEO Summit in Singapore, Mr Lee said while
              leaders are confident that the worst of the crisis is over, how quickly
              economies recover will depend on government measures in the next few
              months.
              <br> <br>At the opening of the summit, Mr Lee noted that much has been
              achieved over the past 20 years for APEC member economies. There are
              now 40 free trade areas within APEC.
              <br> <br>"In some member economies, there has been an astonishing rise in
              prosperity in 20 years, more than doubling or tripling of their per
              capita GDPs. These are all clear evidence of free trade and
              globalisation," he said.
              <br> <br>Asia, the IMF predicts, will lead the global recovery. It has
              estimated that Asia will grow by 6 per cent and the G3 economies by 1.2
              per cent next year.
              <br> <br> Mr Lee said Asia can expect high growth if members avoid taking protectionist measures and keep their markets open.
              <br> <br>"We worry that high unemployment may weigh down on incomes and
              consumption. We know that economies have to build up their long-term
              capabilities and upgrade the skills of their workforce because that's
              the only sustainable way to keep growing, keep improving standards of
              living, not only for a small elite but for a broad segment of
              population in all our countries," he said.
              <br> <br>One initiative that can help is to build on the idea of a free
              trade area of the Asia Pacific, and Mr Lee believes economies can work
              towards this vision by pushing ahead with the Trans-Pacific
              Partnership, which currently brings together Brunei, Chile, New Zealand
              and Singapore.
              <br> <br> Four more economies – the United States, Australia, Peru and Vietnam – have expressed their interest to join this partnership. 
              <br> <br>As for the health of the global economy, Mr Lee said there is a
              clear but modest recovery, though he cautioned that risks remain,
              particularly in the monetary and financial system. He said economies
              have to gradually unwind stimulus and financial measures.
              <br> <br> <br>He said: "The more difficult part is the monetary part and the
              financial system part. The monetary part because if you withdraw the
              monetary stimulus too late, you risk inflating a bubble... But in Asia,
              we have seen stock markets go up, we have seen property markets go up,
              and it is connected to the global monetary conditions.
              <br> <br>"We have to manage with it now and live with the difficulty, but if
              it becomes a significant and widespread bubble because we defer the
              monetary tightening for too long, you will have a serious problem.
              <br> <br>"One of the things governments did last year was to guarantee bank
              liabilities... given what was happening around the world, if we didn't
              act, we were going to have a problem in Singapore because at a click of
              a mouse, several hundred million dollars can travel from point A to
              point B, and some banking system would find itself under great stress.
              <br> <br>"But how to withdraw that in a coordinated way so that in the
              process of withdrawing it, we don't have deposits and assets slushing
              around from country to country and destabilising the system?"
              <br> <br>Mr Lee told his audience of international leaders that the process
              was going to be a very delicate exercise which governments would have
              to discuss over the next year.
              <br> <br> More than 1,500 corporate chiefs are attending the two-day APEC CEO Summit.

              Economic Cooperation (APEC) leaders will now take place on the final

              Esplanade.
              <br> <br> He will, however, attend the leaders' retreat on Sunday. 
              <br> <br>With this change, the leaders' photo-taking session will now take
              place on Sunday and the leaders will be in their business suits.
              <br> <br>However, as planned earlier, the leaders will be requested to wear
              the customary leaders' attire, which has been specially designed for
              them, during the Singapore Evening.

              <p><strong>APEC economies' leaders and delegates treated to a special evening thats uniquely Singapore</strong></p>
              <p>APEC economies' leaders and delegates took  time off from meetings to see what multi-cultural Singapore has to offer. <br> <br> Our news team takes a look at what they were treated to. <br> <br> It was an evening that showcased Singapore's creative talents and unique culture. <br> <br> Themed "Our World, One World", the Singapore Evening's key highlight was  a half-hour musical and multimedia extravaganza. <br> <br> An important element in the show - water, as it connects the APEC economies. <br> <br> Singapore's vibrant multi-cultural heritage also came to life in a refreshing way. <br> <br> The show's creative director, Dick Lee, elaborates. <br> <br> "I want to show, portray our culture in kind of a true and new way
                  which is to show our diverse culture that our multi-racial nation in a
                  very contemporary setting." <br> <br> Lending their voices to the performance were  homegrown talents like
                  Taufik Batisah, Vanessa Fernandez, Julia Abueva and Hady Mirza. <br> <br> The other singers are Elemay Fernandez and Michaela Therese. Dancers
                  from the People's Association and singers from Kids Performing also
                  took part in the extravaganza.<br> <br> Hady on what he saw unique about the show. <br> <br> "Although the songs are all the same, but they are arranged in such a
                  way that it shows the Malay side of the song and it goes the same for
                  the Chinese which George is doing." <br> <br> Homegrown artist George Chan, who also sang, said the audience were  kept at the edge of their seats. <br> <br> "It is just the pace of the show, it is very well put together,
                  especially the pace of the show, quick pace of the show, it is almost
                  like passing the baton from one to the next." <br> <br> The show built up to a colourful finale led by local songbird Kit Chan. <br>   <br> APEC leaders also enjoyed a fusion of Western and local culinary delights at the waterfront area -- <br> while delegates indulged in a buffet style dinner and learnt more about
                  Singapore's multi-racial culture through activities at the various
                  themed pavillions. <br> <br> Some 350 performers entertained the delegates with ethnic performances throughout the evening.</p>

              <p><strong>US, Vietnam throw support behind Trans-Pacific Partnership</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Two APEC economies - the US and Vietnam - have committed to work towards a Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) goal. </span></p>
              <p><span>This came a day after Singapore Prime
                  Minister Lee Hsien Loong revealed at the APEC CEO Summit on Friday that
                  four more economies have expressed interest to join the TPP - a free
                  trade agreement between Singapore, Brunei, New Zealand and Chile.
                  <br> <br> Besides the US and Vietnam, the other two economies considering signing up are Australia and Peru.
                  <br> <br>Leaders who spoke on Saturday, the final day of the two-day CEO
                  Summit in Singapore, also touched on the various regional architecture
                  in Asia Pacific, with calls not to shut out new ideas like the East
                  Asia or Asia Pacific communities.
                  <br> <br>US President Barack Obama was not around at the APEC CEO Summit to
                  give his keynote address on Saturday. But his message of deepening
                  cooperation with the region was delivered both by him in Japan and Ron
                  Kirk, his trade representative in Singapore.
                  <br> <br>Mr Kirk said: "Our engagement in the Trans-Pacific Partnership
                  gives us the opportunity to address gaps in our current agreements, and
                  to set the standard for 21st-century trade agreements going forward.
                  <br> <br>"To fulfil the full promise of APEC, we must look not only at what
                  we can do for ourselves in the region but also at how we can work
                  together to demonstrate leadership on trade for the entire world."
                  <br> <br> Besides trade and integration, climate change and demographic challenges are also critical issues facing the APEC economies.
                  <br> <br>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, Singapore's Community Development, Youth
                  &amp; Sports Minister, said: "If you look at the Asia Pacific
                  economies, over the next 20 years, the most obvious transition is going
                  to be the fact that we are going to become an aged economy.
                  <br> <br>"So, even as we talk about sustained, balanced economic
                  development, I think it is important to take into account the needs for
                  balance in our economic systems to deal with the demographic
                  imbalances."
                  <br> <br>A key message that has come across from the APEC CEO Summit is the
                  important role that both the private and people sectors can play
                  together with the governments in dealing with the whole range of
                  challenges which the region will face after the financial crisis.
                  <br> <br>Some leaders hope APEC can go beyond just discussions on economic
                  issues. That's why Australia is initiating an Asia Pacific community by
                  2020 - an idea which Thailand supports.
                  <br> <br>Thai Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva said: "We have to be clear,
                  we have to have that common vision of integration. As to how we get
                  there and when we get there, there are so many alternatives."
                  <br> <br> And that task now lies with Japan, the next APEC Chair.
                  <br> <br>APEC must build on the initiatives in the Leaders Declaration on
                  Sunday to ensure member economies stay on course in their goals of
                  integration and recovery.

              <p><strong>Singapore welcomes US's decision to engage TPP</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : Singapore has welcomed the decision by the US to
                  engage the Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership Agreement (TPP)
                  partners. </span></p>
              <p><span>A statement by the Ministry of Trade and Industry Ministry said
                  with this commitment, the TPP now has the potential to expand to an
                  eight-member grouping with Australia, Peru, US and Vietnam joining the
                  original four members of Brunei, Chile, New Zealand and Singapore. <br> <br> It added that the TPP is a potential building block for a larger free trade area of the Asia Pacific.
                  <br> <br> Singapore's Trade and Industry Minister Lim Hng Kiang said that the US
                  announcement sends a strong message of US economic engagement with the
                  Asia Pacific region. <br> <br> The TPP is currently the only regional free trade agreement that spans
                  both sides of the Pacific, linking Asia with the Americas. <br> <br> Earlier Saturday, the US announced that it's committed to engage the TPP partners. 
                  <br> <br> Addressing the APEC CEO summit, US Trade Representative Ron Kirk said
                  continued integration of the economies in this region would benefit
                  workers, consumers, and businesses in other parts of the world. <br> <br> As such President Barrack Obama earlier announced in Tokyo on Saturday that the US will engage with the TPP.   
                  <br> <br> Mr Kirk added that this would be done in close consultation with the US Congress and with stakeholders back in the US.   
                  <br> <br> And he believes that further engagement in the TPP would give
                  participating economies the opportunity to address gaps in its current
                  agreements, and to set the standard for 21st-century trade agreements
                  going forward. <br> <br> A high-standard regional trade agreement under the TPP, said Mr Kirk,
                  could help bring to the American people the jobs and economic
                  prosperity that come with trade. <br> <br> Mr Kirk was speaking in place of President Obama at the CEO Summit on Saturday morning. </span></p>

              looked to the future and focussed on policies to create sustained

              <p><strong>APEC rejects protectionism, pledges new growth model</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE - APEC leaders including the US and Chinese presidents
              Sunday vowed to reject trade protectionism and to pursue a new strategy
              for growth after the world's worst economic crisis in decades. </span></p>
              <p><span> Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum leaders, who together
              steer more than half the global economy, also said they would persist
              with hefty stimulus spending "until a durable economic recovery has
              clearly taken hold". </span></p>
              <p><span> US President Barack Obama pressed Asian leaders at the weekend summit
              in Singapore to retool their export-led economies and rebalance world
              growth, or risk a "drift from crisis to crisis". </span></p>
              <p><span>But Obama was subject to much criticism in Singapore over his
              perceived neglect of free trade, with Congress and powerful Democratic
              barons in the trade union movement clamouring to protect US industry as
              joblessness soars.
              <br> <br>In a concluding declaration, the leaders said: "We firmly reject
              all forms of protectionism and reaffirm our commitment to keep markets
              open and refrain from raising new barriers to investment or to trade in
              goods and services."
              <br> <br>"We cannot go back to 'growth as usual'," they added. "We need a
              new growth paradigm. We need a fresh model of economic integration."
              <br> <br>"We will pursue growth which is balanced, inclusive and
              sustainable, supported by innovation and a knowledge-based economy, to
              ensure a durable recovery that will create jobs and benefit our
              people."
              <br> <br>The summit's chairman, Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong,
              said: "To achieve balanced growth, we will implement structural reforms
              to gradually unwind global imbalances and raise the total output of our
              economies. <br> <br> "To achieve inclusive growth, we will broaden our people's access to
              economic opportunities and build their resilience against economic
              shocks."
              <br> <br> He explained that "sustainable" growth means working for an "ambitious outcome" at Copenhagen climate talks next month.
              <br> <br> But a hastily-convened climate discussion in Singapore among key leaders -- 
              <br> including Obama and Chinese President Hu Jintao, representing the world's two 
              <br> biggest emitters of greenhouse gases -- failed to yield any breakthrough.
              <br> <br>If thin on specifics, the APEC declaration was a nod to Obama's
              demand that US consumers must no longer bear the brunt of stoking world
              demand, and that Asians must start to spend and not hoard their export
              earnings.
              <br> <br>The president noted that voracious US demand had for decades
              fuelled the growth of regional economies. But when crisis struck last
              year, the "demand for Asian goods plummeted" and the global recession
              deepened.
              <br> <br>"We cannot follow the same policies that led to such imbalanced
              growth," Obama said in summit remarks released by the White House,
              highlighting the sky-high deficits run up by the United States during
              the boom years.
              <br> <br>"If we do, we will continue to drift from crisis to crisis, a
              failed path that has already had devastating consequences for our
              citizens, our businesses, and our governments," he said.
              <br> <br>In one development welcomed by APEC allies, Obama said the United
              States was interested in a trade pact that leaders say could become the
              nucleus for a massive trans-Pacific free-trade zone covering 2.6
              billion people.
              <br> <br>The leaders instructed their officials to start exploratory work on
              the so-called Free Trade Area of the Asia Pacific, although analysts
              warn that the giant undertaking is years if not decades from fruition.
              <br> <br>More immediately, the heads of government pledged to try to
              conclude the World Trade Organization's stalled Doha round of
              negotiations next year.
              <br> <br>At the Singapore meetings, President Hu has played up China's role
              in shoring up world growth after the crisis engulfed the United States,
              and vowed to "vigorously expand" its domestic market.
              <br> <br>However, criticism that China keeps an artificial lid on its
              currency to gain an unfair trade edge flared anew at APEC. Obama is
              expected to press Hu on the exchange-rate row when the two leaders meet
              in Beijing next week.

              compared to the International Monetary Fund and World Bank meetings in
              2006. </span></p>
              <p><span>No arrests were made, and delegates whom MediaCorp spoke to gave
              the thumbs-up to the fuss-free security at the meeting sites such as
              Suntec Singapore, Shangri-la Hotel and Istana.
              <br> <br> "Some were even quite helpful in providing directions," said Russia's Elena Glusholana.
              <br> <br>Still, the police issued move-on orders last Saturday against three
              Falungong members clad in yellow Falungong T-shirts for "behaving
              suspiciously and loitering without valid reasons".
              <br> <br>The incidents took place near the Istana where the APEC leaders
              retreat was being held, and next to the dedicated APEC traffic lane
              near to Orchard MRT Station, a police spokesman told MediaCorp.
              <br> <br> "When asked by the police on why they were there, they were evasive and unable to provide satisfactory reasons," he added. 
              <br> <br> "The police issued them with move-on orders which they complied with and no arrests were made."
