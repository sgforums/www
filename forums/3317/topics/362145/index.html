              <p>School girls gossiping, back biting,...giving each other the silent treatment...we all recognise this as unpleasant behavior.</p>
              <p>But is it turning into something more serious?</p>
              <p>Parents and teachers have tended to dismiss it as childish and typical "girly" behaviour.</p>
              <p>Now educators and counselors are urging us to re examine our responses.</p>
              <p><em>Devika Misra</em> tells us why.</p>
              <p>The traditional school bully used to be a scowling overweight boy.</p>
              <p>He would grab somebody else's lunch or trip up a skinny classmate.</p>
              <p>That image no longer holds true.</p>
              <p>Today's school bully is likely to be pretty, popular, skinny , smiling....yes,... she is a girl.</p>
              <p>Educators and counselors say that aggression among girls is on the rise.</p>
              <p>Dr Carol Balhatchet is the Director for Youth services at Singapore's Children's Society.</p>
              <p>"Bullying comes with girls and boys but lately its been more in
              girls. Girls are bolder, girls are now not talking it out, not
              communicating their issues where previously boys can't communicate
              their issues so they used aggression to resolve their problems now it
              appears girls are doing the same thing. With girls it now jealousy,
              they feel that their boyfriend is noticing the other girl and not
              noticing them then they resort to bullying."</p>
              <p>Despite this, the problem among girls is going largely unchecked.</p>
              <p>And that's because its a hard-to-define issue.</p>
              <p>Traditionally gossiping, back biting and smear campaigns are not regarded as bullying.</p>
              <p>A mistake says Rachel Simmons.</p>
              <p>She is the author of Odd Girl Out:The Hidden culture of Aggression in Girls.</p>
              <p>"If you look at bullying as something thats physical then, no you
              aren't going to see what girls are doing as hurtful but thats of course
              part of the problem because what we have done for many years is look at
              what girls do as a rite of passage or a developmental phase because it
              doesn't meet the traditional definition of bullying. Most girls are
              unlikely to push someone against a wall . Most understanding of
              bullying are very male focused and they focus on the physical
              aggression at the hand of someone you don't know very well. Actually
              bullying is much more than being physically hurt or even openly hurt,
              there are many other ways that this happens."</p>
              <p>The ways in which this happens among girls, Ms Simmons says can be far more hurtful and have a longer-term impact.</p>
              <p>It is also less easy to directly punish and control....it involves that tricky grey area...feelings.</p>
              <p>"Girls are going to behave in ways that are inclined to destroy
              relationships, destroy social status and just generally speaking make
              ones social life miserable. The silent treatment is really very
              powerful so if I'm upset with you instead of telling you I'm just not
              going to speak to you anymore. Another example would be using the
              relationship as a weapon. A very common thing that happens between
              girls is lets say you're friends with two people who don't really like
              each other so one of those people says well its either her or me and
              thats a kind of blackmail, emotional blackmail so instead of hitting
              someone you are using your relationship as a weapon."</p>
              <p>But surely this has been an age old problem.</p>
              <p>Why is it being taken so seriously now?</p>
              <p>Dr Balhatchet has the answer.</p>
              <p>"Unlike previously now bullying can take a more sensational stand
              because of the easy access to the Internet and blogging and Facebook
              which has a mass reach so a lot of the bullying comes with saying nasty
              things or intimidation on their blogs or on the Net. The perpetrator is
              able to recruit a whole lot more support by going on the Net."</p>
              <p>Since the impact of bullying is now much wider and can involve
              complete strangers being let into the personal problem of a victim its
              is regarded as more dangerous and far reaching than before.</p>
              <p>Ms Simmons says the Internet is the new school bathroom wall but it's more all pervasive.</p>
              <p>"The biggest different is technology. It used to be that kids went
              to school and then they went home and there was a pretty clear boundary
              between school and home you had your telephone to communicate but that
              was pretty much it. Now kids are on a twenty four hour news and gossip
              cycle that comes through their cell phones and computers, they're re
              hooked into each other in a pretty powerful way which both allows them
              to be connected but also gives them the tools to lash out at some of
              those connections when they are upset. So cyber bullying, the use of
              technology to humiliate or harass someone has really exploded as more
              and more technology has been put into the hands of younger people."</p>
              <p>So what are the solutions?</p>
              <p>Parents and teachers... wake up please says Ms Simmons.</p>
              <p>This is more than just fickle behaviour.</p>
              <p>For one.... put the brakes on technology.</p>
              <p>Moms need to tell their daughters, "If you feel you cant say it to her face do NOT sms it to her or anyone else.</p>
              <p>Parents need to take away the cell phone temporarily and tough out the hysterical tantrum that will inevitably follow.</p>
              <p>Do not always believe that homework can't be done without the computer, it often can.</p>
              <p>But the longer term solution is more difficult to enforce.</p>
              <p>It involves a change of social norms and expectations.</p>
              <p>Girls should not always be expected to be "nice" Ms Simmon says.</p>
              <p>"The first countries to solicit translations of my book were Asian
              countries and I think theres not a coincidence there. I think
              traditional Asian families put a lot of pressure on daughters to behave
              in ways that might not be realistic; to be quieter than boys are
              expected to be, to be nicer than boys are expected to be so the more
              pressure we put on boys not to speak their minds and not to express
              their natural anger and upset in healthy ways the more we're going to
              see them take their feelings underground behind people's back and
              online."</p>
              <p>Ms Simmons says even when women grow up to be more empathetic and
              less hurtful to others they often have problems expressing themselves
              directly in both their personal and professional relationships.</p>
              <p>Dr Balhatchet agrees that the long term solution will not be a quick fix.</p>
              <p>Raising awareness through what she calls emotional education of both
              girls as well as their parents and teachers, is the only thing that
              will work.</p>
              <p>She says that Bullying is now being seen in younger children, it can
              begin as early as Primary two and at least three to four out of every
              ten have been impacted.</p>

              <p>ya, i agree..... nowadays girls are more outspoken and more daring(as they are capable of doing wat guys can do). like æ�ƒæ€¡å‡¤ says in wan bao, she dun mind having a younger bf, and i think she is not the only one. successful women like her ,who have the means and money can get a xiao bai lian easily. actually i respect her.(only those capable women, not those bitches that demend bf or husband to buy this buy that for them and also must treat them like queen)</p>
