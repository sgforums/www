              <p>STOMPer School had repeatedly written to the school but
               nothing was done except for a lecture from the teacher. Her son had 
              been bullied since last year.<br><br>The STOMPer wrote in an email (July 28):<br><br>"My
               Pri 5 son was bullied countless times since Pri 4 by this same 
              classmate and I had written several emails to the school since the 
              bullying first started but I did not get any reply.<br><br>"I had met 
              and called the Vice-Principal several times and I had spelt out clearly 
              during the meeting that should my son be physically abused (bruised) 
              again, I will not hesitate to seek help from the proper authorities.<br><br>"Had
               spoken to the Principal earlier this year in person to request for a 
              meeting with the bully's parents it was to no avail as nothing was 
              arranged.<br><br>"Now an 'incident' has happened again and the teacher only lectured the bully again, which is not solving the root cause.<br><br>"This incident just happened a few hours ago (July 28, 2010) and it is the worst case.<br><br>"Upon
               entering the classroom after another lesson, my son found that the 
              table was quite far from his chair so he pulled the table towards 
              himself.<br><br>"The bully came from behind to pull away his table and then pushed it towards my son, causing the injury.<br><br>"Thereafter the teacher only gave the bully a lecture.<br><br>"In
               fact the bully had tried to lay his hand on my son on 24 Jul night 
              (9pm) after coming back from the National Day Parade but was chased away
               by the form teacher.<br><br>"Prior to this, 2 weeks ago, the bully had used his bag to swing at my son's face.<br><br>"The
               next day I narrated the incident to the Principal and the form teacher 
              was displeased. He claimed that he should be the first to know. But in 
              fact, on that day he was on MC and how to inform him...<br><br>"This bully always picks on my son and of course there are 5 other people involved at times.<br><br>"Had
               told my son to stay away from them (especially during recess time) but 
              since it is the same class it is quite hard to avoid.<br><br>"Is my son going to continue to suffer again?"</p>

              <p>When it comes to bullying, no simple solution can be found.</p>
              <p>Sometimes it's not u r timid or lack assertiveness they pick on u.</p>
              <p>Bully pick on u sometimes like because u gt funny face,nerdy facial appearance,very short,birthmark,funny hairstyle and other things that attract attention.</p>
