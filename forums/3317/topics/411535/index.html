              <p>What are your take on this coming Commonwealth Game?  over reacting or High Risk Game......</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Concerns are growing about the upcoming Commonwealth Games in New Delhi after a footbridge collapsed and at least two athletes pulled out of competition, citing safety and security concerns.</p>
              <p>An Australian discus champion cancelled and a British triple jumper said they would not compete in the games, citing health and security concerns.</p>
              <p>The individual athletes announced that they wouldn't compete after a suspension bridge under construction near the main stadium in New Delhi collapsed Tuesday afternoon, injuring at least 27 people.</p>
              <p>Several nations, including Canada, Scotland, Ireland and New Zealand, have expressed concerns about delays in the completion of the athletes village and last-minute preparations for the games, scheduled to run from Oct. 3 to 14.</p>
              <p>The Scottish team said Wednesday that it would delay its departure to New Delhi, saying it wants to give organizers time to prepare accommodation and solve the growing number of problems.</p>
              <p>Commonwealth Games Scotland chairman Michael Cavanagh said his team's departure would be put off for "a few days."</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, the head of the Commonwealth Games is rushing to New Delhi to meet with Indian officials and deal with growing concerns about the safety and security of the games.</p>
              <p>Commonwealth Games Federation president Mike Fennell is expected to arrive in India Thursday, and has requested a meeting with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, The Associated Press reported.</p>
              <p>"The games may be some 11 days away now, but the athletes — including some of Canada's athletes — are due to start arriving Thursday," CBC's Adrienne Arsenault said from New Delhi.</p>
              <p>Arsennault said there was a minor incident Wednesday in which a ceiling tile fell down right over the weight lifting area.</p>
              <p>"Anywhere else, at any other time, nobody would have noticed it, but the microscope is so acutely focused on what's happening at the games that every little hiccup right now seems to add to people's angst," she said.</p>
              <p>"The anticipation is that it will be sorted, but it's going to be a mad rush."</p>

              <p><strong>India battles deepening C'wealth Games crisis</strong></p>
              <p>NEW DELHI (AFP) - – India struggled to keep its Commonwealth Games on
               track Wednesday, with England warning the event was on a "knife edge" 
              over complaints of filthy housing and growing structural and security 
              fears.</p>
              <p>Officials said Commonwealth Games Federation chief Mike Fennell was 
              flying in Thursday for a meeting with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to 
              discuss the problems overwhelming the October 3-14 event in New Delhi.</p>
              <p>The latest high-profile withdrawals include the English Olympic 400m 
              gold medallist Christine Ohuruogu and world triple jump champion 
              Phillips Idowu, with Australia warning more of its competitors might 
              follow.</p>
              <p>Their decisions came after complaints by some teams about the state 
              of the athletes' village, safety fears due to the collapse of a 
              footbridge near one of the venues and question marks over security after
               a gun attack on tourists.</p>
              <p>Commonwealth Games England chairman Andrew Foster warned that the next 24-48 hours would be "critical".</p>
              <p>"It's a situation that hangs on a knife-edge. We will not be sending
               our team unless we are confident," Foster said, with athletes due to 
              begin arriving this week for an event that was meant to showcase the 
              modern India.</p>
              <p>Adding to the organisers' woes, a section of false ceiling fell down
               on Wednesday at the weightlifting venue, although there were no 
              injuries.</p>
              <p>Indian officials have struggled to keep a positive outlook on the event, despite the mounting concerns at home and abroad.</p>
              <p>"There are some problems. But they are not insurmountable," New Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit told reporters.</p>
              <p>"To make out that the whole thing is collapsing -- I am sorry, we do not agree with that," she said.</p>
              <p>Scotland -- which hosts the next games in 2014 -- announced it was 
              delaying the departure of its athletes by a few days, while Team Wales 
              said it had given the organisers until late Wednesday to confirm the 
              village and venues were "fit for purpose."</p>
              <p>England's Idowu wrote on the micro-blogging site Twitter Tuesday: 
              "Sorry people, but I have children to think about. My safety is more 
              important to them than a medal."</p>
              <p>Indian media described the complaints about "filthy" and 
              "uninhabitable" conditions at the showpiece athlete's village as a 
              national embarrassment, calling for those responsible to be held 
              accountable.</p>
              <p>"India has been shamed globally," the Times of India said in a 
              front-page editorial. "The guilty must be identified and brought to 
              book.</p>
              <p>"It may not restore our reputation, but at least it will show that we, as a nation, value our honour."</p>
              <p>New Delhi is expecting to host some 7,000 athletes and officials 
              from countries and territories mostly from the former British empire for
               the multi-sport event.</p>
              <p>"I can reassure everyone that the athletes will enjoy their stay in 
              New Delhi," organising committee secretary general Lalit Bhanot told 
              AFP.</p>
              <p>"The stadiums are world class and so is the games village. We will be ready by the time they start arriving."</p>
              <p>But Australia warned that more competitors could withdraw, after 
              world discus champion Dani Samuels made a tearful withdrawal over health
               and security worries on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>Minister for Sport Mark Arbib said Australia's Commonwealth Games 
              chief Perry Crosswhite was expecting "a number more" to follow and that 
              he would be imposing tough rules restricting athletes' travel in New 
              Delhi.</p>
              <p>A home-grown Islamist group on Sunday claimed responsibility for a 
              shooting on a tourist bus outside New Delhi's main mosque that wounded 
              two Taiwanese men, prompting a number of Western countries to issue 
              travel warnings.</p>
              <p>The Indian capital has also gripped by an outbreak of dengue fever, 
              caused by mosquitoes breeding in stagnant pools of water that have 
              accumulated on games construction sites.</p>
              <p>The Commonwealth Games Federation on Tuesday blasted the official 
              accommodation as "uninhabitable" with rubble in doorways and 
              malfunctioning toilets, along with electrical and other problems.</p>
              <p>Officials from some teams have even taken to cleaning the facilities themselves to bring them up to scratch.</p>
              <p>The revelations come after a series of delays and missed deadlines 
              for venues, plus a catalogue of claims about corruption, dubious 
              contracts and the use of poor-quality materials -- seven years after 
              India was awarded the games.</p>

              <p>Overreaction? Hardly.</p>
              <p>11 days to the opening, and the facilities are still half-f**k. A bit of dust and the smell of shellac and paint is acceptable, but not exposed wiring, filthy toilets, and so on is not.</p>
              <p>Hell, how can a bridge to the stadium collapse just 11 days before opening? They should be glad that it didn't collapse 11 days later with the bridge full of spectators wanting to go to the stadium.</p>

              <p><strong>Indian PM snubs minister</strong></p>
              <p>NEW DELHI - INDIAN Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, exasperated by the 
              chaos surrounding the Commonwealth Games, has slapped down his sports 
              minister's efforts to explain the mess, reports said on Saturday.</p>
              <p>All major Indian newspapers carried the same front page report based 
              on clearly leaked details of a crisis meeting on Friday between Mr Singh
               and a number of senior ministers.</p>
              <p>During the talks, Sports Minister M.S. Gill had attempted to give a 
              briefing explaining how problems had arisen during preparations for the 
              Oct 3-14 event, which the media has dubbed India's 'Shame Games'.</p>
              <p>But Mr Singh cut him short, saying the time for 
              presentations was long past with barely more than a week remaining until
               the opening ceremony and serious questions remaining over the 
              facilities, especially the athlete's village. The prime minister 
              'literally threw up his arms in exasperation over the inability of those
               in charge to tackle even minor issues related to housekeeping', one 
              government source told the Indian Express.</p>
              <p>''What is the problem?', he asked those present, including 
              Gill,' the source added. Mr Singh has been increasingly involved in 
              sorting out the Games fiasco since Tuesday when the event seemed on the 
              brink of collapse, amid worries about security, a bridge falling down 
              and complaints about the 'filthy' state of the village.</p>
              <p>He has held a series of crisis meetings at the highest level
               in a bid to bring some focus to crucial remedial work that still 
              remains to be done with athletes already arriving in New Delhi. The 
              leaked details of Friday's meeting appeared aimed at publicly 
              underlining the prime minister's resolution to ensure that the Games - 
              meant to showcase India's superpower ambitions - are a success.</p>

              <p><strong>Team Singapore will head to Commonwealth Games as planned</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Team Singapore will head to the 19th Commonwealth Games in Delhi as planned. </span></p>
              <p><span> The contingent is made up of 68 athletes and 34 officials. </span></p>
              <p><span>In a released issued by the Singapore Sports Council, 
              Chef-de-Mission to the Games Annabel Pennefather said, "We have been 
              given the assurance by the organisers that the residential block where 
              Team Singapore athletes and officials will be staying in will be spruced
               up and will be given the necessary cleaning it requires. We have 
              informed them of our expectations and we have been assured that our 
              expectations will be met."
              <br> <br> The organising committee of the 2010 Games had received negative 
              feedback internationally over its lack of hygiene standards in the 
              Athletes' Village.
              <br> <br> Singapore will send an advance party of up to five personnel, led by 
              assistant Chef-de-Mission Antony Lee, to New Delhi on 27 September 2010,
               to ensure that the living areas of Team Singapore athletes and 
              officials will be ready in time for their arrival.
              <br> <br> Most of the Team Singapore officials and contingents are expected to arrive in New Delhi on 29 and 30 September.
              <br> <br> They will occupy four floors in Block 26 at the Athletes Village.
              <br> <br> Chris Chan, Secretary-General of the Singapore National Olympic Council 
              and Commonwealth Games Singapore, was in New Delhi earlier to meet with 
              officials of the organising committee.
              <br> <br> He had been assured by Village Mayor Dalbir Singh that they were working
               round the clock to address all issues raised by the various 
              contingents.
              <br> <br> He also visited the Athletes and Games Village.
              <br> <br> "With the advance party headed up to Delhi on Monday, we will be able to
               ensure that all our requests are met and that any outstanding issues 
              will be sorted out by the organisers before the bulk of the contingent 
              arrive in New Delhi for the games," said Mr Chan.
              <br> <br> Team Singapore will have a full-time medical team throughout the Games, 
              led by Dr Cormac O'Muircheartaigh, Medical Director of the Singapore 
              Sports Institute.
              <br> <br> Together with four medical staff, he will provide round-the-clock support and care for the Team Singapore contingent.
              <br> <br> "Every member of the contingent has been screened medically and has 
              received the necessary vaccinations required before they leave Singapore
               for New Delhi," said Dr. O'Muircheartaigh.
              <br> <br> "We have also provided everyone with a 'Medical Care Pack', which 
              includes vitamins to boost the immune system and to prevent illnesses 
              and hand wash solutions for hygiene and health protection." - CNA/fa</span></p>

              <p>of course, it's too much to ask for every country in the world to have first world standards of hygiene (for now), but you're missing the point .... if they couldn't deliver, then maybe they shouldn't have asked to host it in the first place ! </p>

              <p>People are making comparisions to beijing 08 .... and I think this games is going to prove embarrassing for the indians, as much as they would like to put themselves on the same pedestal as the chinese. They are just not as "there" as they've placed themselves in their minds.</p>
