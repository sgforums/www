              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: A survey by American International Assurance 
              Singapore (AIA) showed that only a little more than one in 10 
              Singaporeans are adequately insured.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>One-fifth of these uninsured Singaporeans also said that they do not see the need for insurance. </span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Nearly one-half of 
              the respondents polled felt it is an acceptable outcome that their 
              spouse / future spouse remarries to make up for the loss of income in 
              the event of their demise.<br><br>The "2011 AIA Singapore Nationwide 
              Protection" survey polled over 1,000 Singaporeans and permanent 
              residents, aged between 20 to 60 years, on their understanding of 
              financial protection and perceptions. <br><br>A common reason for not 
              buying insurance was that many believed life insurance is expensive and 
              are unable to afford the premiums.  <br><br>AIA Singapore's senior vice 
              president and CEO, Tan Hak Leh, said that AIA hope to "bridge the 
              underinsurance gap" in Singapore in accordance with the findings. <br><br>He said: "As a community, it is our shared responsibility to ensure all Singaporeans are financially protected." <br><br>Initiatives
               AIA will undertake include public education, collaborating with 
              government and non-government agencies as well as shaping new products 
              according to the needs of consumers. <br><br>Customers will be able to 
              find out the amount of protection they need according to a calculation 
              which will add up factors such as household income, number of dependent 
              children and parents, age and if both husband and wife are working. <br><br>AIA
               also recently announced its partnership with the National Family 
              Council (NFC) which will see both parties work together over the next 
              year to educate members of the public about financial health and 
              adequate protection coverage. <br><br>"There is a great opportunity for 
              both parents and children to come together, as families, to learn more 
              about financial intelligence," said Lim Soon Hock, chairman of the NFC. <br><br>"Such
               shared experiences will help strengthen family bonds and prepare them 
              to overcome any future financial challenges or crises." <br><br>- CNA/ck</span></span></p>

              <p>Thats why the rich, who can afford to pay for major medical expenses from their pockets, have insurance cover their hefty medical bills.</p>

              <p>The insurance company you mention (name I shall not speak) is bloody conman company. A friend of mine who used to work for that insurance co tells me that they spend a lot of money on training and seminars in expensive hotels. Also the employees there get big big company cars and big big meal and entertainment allowances. Even the normal managers who work in supporting departments get a lot of entertainment allowances. The staff there all on cloud nine. The successful agents all drive big big car and get a lot of fringe benefits. There is where most your premium is going to. Insurance biz is nothing but legal term for regulated pyramid scheme.</p>
              <p>So don't buy insurance. Only the very basic one. They tell you all lies that you need this and that. But the real people who benefit the insurance are those working high up on the hierarchy of insurance company. I mean how often you get to cash out from insurance companies after a lifetime of paying premiums? And when that comes, they hammer all sorts of limitations to you. They are smart too. When you are farking old like 65 and above, they refuse to insure you because thats the time when you need insurance the most. They only want to insure the young nd healthy ones. Real conman biz.</p>
