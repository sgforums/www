               50 FAKED MONKS &amp; NUNS</a></p>
              <p>All holed up in Geylang</p>
              <p>By Ben Nadarajan &amp; Teh Joo Lin</p>
              <p>A FOUR-STOREY motel smack in the red light district of Geylang has 
              been the hideaway for groups of bogus monks and nuns who make their way 
              from northern Thailand in and out of Singapore for quick pickings.</p>
              <p>Numbering as many as 100, they take refuge in Lorong 28 in Geylang, 
              venturing out in the mornings for their ‘alms’ rounds.</p>
              <p>At any one time, there could be 20 or 30 of them. Last week, there 
              were about 50 of them.</p>
              <p>They are Thais on social visit passes who use the guise of religious 
              robes to prey on the sensibilities of HDB heartlanders. The scam has 
              been going on for at least two years.</p>
              <p>The whole group made a quick exit on Friday afternoon, after police 
              came sniffing around their lodgings the night before.</p>
              <p>In twos and threes, they lugged their backpacks and trolley bags onto
               taxis and made their way to Golden Mile Complex in Beach Road.</p>
              <p>After exchanging Singapore currency for Thai baht, they boarded 
              coaches headed for Johor Baru, herded by a Thai man who appeared to be 
              in charge of the logistics.<br> <br> ‘I am scared I’ll get arrested,’ said a 21-year-old who readily admitted
               that he was no monk. ‘If I am thrown in jail, I will have no future,’ 
              he said, adding that he was harbouring hopes of returning as a 
              construction worker.</p>
              <p>Under the Miscellaneous Offences Act, anyone who collects alms or 
              solicits charitable contributions under false pretences can be fined up 
              to $2,000 or jailed up to three months, or both.</p>
              <p>A police spokesman said they had conducted checks at the lodging 
              house in Geylang but ‘did not note any offence’. ‘The occupants were 
              advised that begging for money without a licence is an offence in 
              Singapore.’</p>
              <p>Speaking through an interpreter, the fake monk said he was on his 
              third masquerade in Singapore.</p>
              <p>The objective: To collect as much money as he could on his 
              alms-begging rounds before his social visit pass expired.</p>
              <p>The farmer from Khon Kaen was here for only five days before the 
              police came. His collection: about $30 to $40 a day, far less than what 
              an aggressive monk could get, he said.</p>
              <p>‘Last time, we used to earn more. Now, there are too many of us,’ he 
              lamented.</p>
              <p>The Sunday Times team discovered the presence of the group after 
              tailing a monk who was at a popular hawker centre in Bedok North last 
              Sunday.</p>
              <p>Barefoot and clad in earthy yellow robes, the bald man was moving 
              around the tables silently with a wooden bowl in hand.</p>
              <p>Some patrons parted with coins and small notes, and were rewarded 
              with a reverent bow.</p>
              <p>The tall and gaunt monk ended up at the nameless four-storey building
               in Lorong 28, Geylang, which is shielded from the road by a cardboard 
              wall mounted at the gate.</p>
              <p>Sunday Times checks showed the group had taken 12 rooms in all, 
              occupying the third and fourth floors. The first two floors are rooms 
              for rent by the hour.</p>
              <p>Neighbouring shopkeepers know of their presence, but declined to say 
              more beyond that ‘they are always around’.</p>
              <p>The bogus monks were reticent when approached but from what those who
               spoke let slip, whoever pulled the strings ran a well-oiled operation.</p>
              <p>The men and women head straight for the motel when they arrive in 
              Singapore.</p>
              <p>Armed with their own novice religious robes, they pay the motel $10 a
               night for accommodation.</p>
              <p>On the first few days, a Thai man takes them in hand, showing them 
              how to take a bus to various hawker centres. At the end of three days, 
              they are to pay the ‘guide’ 10,000 baht or $483.</p>
              <p>They are then left on their own to collect what money they can.</p>
              <p>The Venerable Phramaha Rian Manone-Yang, honorary-secretary of the 
              Thai Buddhist Temple in Singapore, said these fake monks operate in 
              syndicates which are based in Johor and Hatyai in southern Thailand.</p>
              <p>The gang leaders work closely with their partners in Singapore, who 
              pocket 30 per cent of their collections, he added.</p>
              <p>The monk, who is based in a temple in Jalan Bukit Merah, said he 
              knows of a fake monk who admitted that he made about $800 in a day.</p>
              <p>‘They do not just ask for money, they also sell fake Buddhist amulets
               for as much as $50.’</p>
              <p>The Venerable Manone-Yang said real monks asked for only food, not 
              money. And they can do this only between 6am and 8am.</p>
              <p>The Geylang ‘monks’ and ‘nuns’ have a ritual, as a Sunday Times 
              stake-out outside the motel showed.</p>
              <p>The lights on their floors come on at about 5am.</p>
              <p>Half an hour later, the men, with shaven heads, barefoot and in 
              saffron robes of varying shades of red, orange or brown, and white-robed
               women with their hair bunned up at the back of the head, start 
              streaming out singly or in pairs.</p>
              <p>They catch a bus along Guillemard Road, Sims Avenue and Geylang Road,
               fanning out to the HDB heartland of Marine Parade, Bedok and Tampines. 
              They pay for their bus fares with coins.</p>
              <p>On their begging rounds, they do not utter a word, merely holding out
               a wooden alms bowl in front of them.</p>
              <p>Retiree Choo Kian Watt, 66, who has breakfast regularly at a coffee 
              shop in Bedok North Road, sees them often.</p>
              <p>‘I used to give a dollar or two, but since I stopped working, I give 
              less frequently now,’ said the former odd-job labourer.</p>
              <p>‘I never doubted if they were real or not. I give when I’m in a good 
              mood.’</p>
              <p>By noon, most of the men are back at the motel. They usually head 
              straight for a woman in the lobby, overturn their alms bowls and 
              exchange their coins for notes.</p>
              <p>Some of the ‘monks’ said the woman takes $1 for every $50 worth of 
              coins.</p>
              <p>Then it is back up to their rooms and into casual wear – T-shirts and
               bermudas.</p>
              <p>Their robes are tossed casually over the staircase railings.</p>
              <p>Clearly worried about being spotted as ‘monks’, they leave the motel 
              singly when they go out for lunch – caps on heads and even wigs for 
              some. They end up at a coffee shop several lanes away.</p>
              <p>The more hardworking ‘monks’ do a second round in the afternoon. As 
              for the ‘nuns’, they return only in the evening, with packets of food – 
              never venturing out again until the next morning.</p>
              <p>One ‘monk’ said: ‘We are told not to go anywhere but back to the 
              room. We’re scared that people who have donated money to us will see 
              us,’ he said.</p>
              <p>Some, though, are more adventurous. The Sunday Times tailed a pair to
               a Thai pub in Geylang and even spotted one ‘monk’ with a woman friend.</p>
              <p>Their masquerade came to an abrupt end when police, tipped off by The
               Sunday Times, decided to check on them to see if their passports were 
              in order.</p>
              <p>By lunchtime the next day, they were packed up and ready to leave. 
              Scuttling out of the building, one ‘monk’ told The Sunday Times that 
              they had been ‘forced to quit’.</p>
              <p>When confronted, the woman who appears to be running the motel denied
               that there were monks staying there. Her male friend said the Thais in 
              the motel were merely looking for their friends.</p>
              <p>Then the duo refused to take further questions and scurried back into
               the building. Soon after, taxis with ‘on call’ signs showed up, to take
               the remaining Thais away.</p>
              <p>Before his coach departed Beach Road, one of the ‘monks’ said: ‘We 
              know people will give to monks. We know it’s wrong but we need the 
              money.’</p>
              <p>With that, he went up the bus, sat down and waved goodbye with a 
              smile.</p>

              <p>u dunno spore police likes to play taiji meh. report cases to them, IO came back to u say if  want to further the case, go apply at tribunal or small claims court lar. or take legal action against him/her by hiring your own lawyer.</p>
              <p>police easy life lar. sit in patrol car in air con, go jalan jalan, drive drive around and then go shopping malls wayang wayang a bit.</p>
