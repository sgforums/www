              <p><strong>Kidnapped US girl walks into police station 18 years on</strong></p>
              <p class="first">SAN FRANCISCO (AFP) - - A woman who had been missing
              since she was kidnapped 18 years ago at age 11 walked into a California
              police station in good health and identified herself, police said
              Thursday.</p>
              <p>Jaycee Lee Dugard, now 29, came into the Concord, California, police
              station on Wednesday and said she was the missing girl, police
              officials said.</p>
              <p>"We are ninety-nine percent sure that it is her, based on
              conversations the mother had with the daughter this morning,"
              Lieutenant Les Lovell of the El Dorado County Sheriff's office said.</p>
              <p>He said a man and a woman had been arrested with the help of the FBI
              and taken into custody by the Concord Police Department, but would not
              identify them.</p>
              <p>"We have not charged anybody at this point in
              time. We are still investigating, but there are two people in custody
              that are suspects in our case," he said.</p>
              <p>The sheriff's office said Dugard was "in good health in the greater Bay Area of California."</p>
              <p>Contra Costa Country Sherrif's Captain Daniel Terry identified the couple in custody to ABC News as Phillip and Nancy Garrido.</p>
              <p>Phillip
              Garrido is a registered sex offender who has served prison time for
              kidnapping and rape, he said. The couple are in police custody charged
              with kidnapping to commit rape, and bail has been set at one million
              dollars.</p>
              <p>Dugard was 11 years old on June 10, 1991 when she was
              last seen by her stepfather Carl Probyn outside her home in South Lake
              Tahoe being kidnapped by two occupants in a car.</p>
              <p>Probyn, who is now 60, gave chase on a bicycle but was too far away to stop the abduction.</p>
              <p>"I had personally given up hope," Probyn told ABC News, adding he was just just hoping to find the people responsible.</p>
              <p>Probyn
              told the news network his wife had spoken to Dugard, who told her she
              now has two children of her own. He did not provide any further details.</p>
              <p>Probyn, his wife Terry and another daughter flew Thursday morning from Riverside, California to San Francisco to meet Dugard.</p>
              <p>Authorities involved with the case are expected to give a press conference later in the day.</p>
              <p>"Since
              the date of occurrence the investigation has been ongoing and today's
              events could bring it to resolution," the El Dorado county sheriff's
              statement said.</p>
