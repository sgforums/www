              <p>Titanic had an identical sister ship, Olympic which was completed earlier than the Titanic and was damaged in a collision with a naval ship. Cunard was unable to get any compensation for the damaged ship.</p>
              <p>Simply switch their name plates and it could have been the Olympic that sank and not the Titanic.</p>
              <p>When the Titanic sank, many of America's richest men perished, many of whom were very against the formation of the Federal Reserve. Among them the heads of the Astor and Guggenheim families.</p>
              <p>JP Morgan, one of the owners of the Federal Reserve, stepped off the Titanic just prior to the ship's maiden voyage.</p>
              <p>Pure coincidence or did he had foreknowledge of what's going to happen ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What's more, World War One would not have been possible if not for the funding provided by United States (Federal Reserve) to Britain and France for a lengthy and profitable conflict for the bankers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span>In 2005, two independent divers, using deep water MIR submarines, found two new
                   parts of the bottom of the hull of Titanic separate from the hull and 
                  stern at the bottom of the Atlantic.  That means that 
                  this great ship, which nudged an iceberg, somehow 
                  broke into four pieces.</span></p>
              <p><span>In 2005, another expedition by two American divers found two never-before-seen large sections. They were nearly a mile away from the forward and rear 
                  pieces of the hull!</span></p>
              <p><span>New 
                  steamships had to be broken first as they 
                  were not able to make good speed during their
                   first two days out.  So the idea that Titanic tried to set a speed 
                  record on her maiden voyage doesn't make sense.  </span></p>
              <p><span>Firsthand
                   reports and testimonies shortly after the disaster indicated that if the ship struck the iceberg at
                   all, it continued to slip on past the iceberg. There certainly was no 
                  jolt.  This was the testimony of the first officer of 
                  Titanic days after the tragedy. 
                   <br><br>It never made sense that a seasoned captain such as Capt.
                   Smith (a Freemason)would have gone
                   storming through an ice field.  All the testimonies given in United States and Great Britain reveal that <em> not one passenger</em> was sure of a collision.</span></p>
              <p><span>The story is that 
                  300 feet of steel suffered a gash 3/4" wide, and that this was caused 
                  by the tearing action
                   of the iceberg.  No tool made of ice is strong enough to cut 300 feet 
                  of 1 inch steel.</span></p>
              <p><span>In earlier versions of the disaster there was no prior 
                  mention of the stern breaking off.  The doomed ship rising out of the 
                  water which sends the stern crashing down as it breaks at the deck is a 
                  recent
                   development. </span></p>
