              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>ON THE evening of Nov 8 last year, my 21-year-old sister
                           was stabbed in the lift of our block in Tampines as she was going home.</p>
              <p>The assailant entered the lift seconds before the door 
                          closed, and plunged the knife in her back before demanding money.</p>
              <p>He threatened to stab her again until she promised she would
                           not tell the police about the attack.</p>
              <p>My sister recovered after an operation. Since her recovery, 
                          we have repeatedly appealed to the town council and the police to 
                          install closed-circuit televisions (CCTVs) at the void deck and lifts.</p>
              <p>We also appealed for posters to be put up to raise public 
                          awareness of the unsolved stabbing.</p>
              <p>We feared that the attack on my sister could happen to other
                           residents.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, the town council told us the police should 
                          take up our suggestions while the police said it was the town council's 
                          job.</p>
              <p>The only response thus far to our appeal was a letter from 
                          the police informing us of increased patrols.</p>
              <p>We wrote back, stating that the measure may not be 
                          sufficient, given the spate of robberies within a 1km radius of our 
                          block in the past six months.</p>
              <p>We understand that several victims had to be treated in 
                          hospital.</p>
              <p>In the same letter, which we copied to the town council, we 
                          appealed for the installation of CCTVs.</p>
              <p>After waiting for three months for a reply, we gave up. We 
                          worry when we walk around our neighbourhood, especially after dark.</p>
              <p>We should not feel this way and hope the authorities will 
                          act effectively to make residents feel safer in their own neighbourhood.</p>

              <p>despite our police's reputation for being cowardly and impotent, all the fault lies with PAP...........</p>
              <p>all sorts of crimes especially murder have gone up with the increased number of foreigners allowed into S'pore........................</p>
              <p>CCTV may be effective in the evenings but during late nights, they're pretty much useless with everyone alseep.......</p>
              <p>increased police patrols ? i highly doubt the cops will do that and even if they did, it changes nothing !</p>
              <p>my advice ? take the stairs...............</p>
              <p>you can escape easily..............robbers don't ambush their victims at stairways.............other residents can hear you if you scream for help....................</p>

              <p>thats common sense to you?</p>
              <p>what ifÂ someone else get stabbed somewhere or anywhere outside the range of the cctvs?</p>
              <p>what are we gonna install next?Â  it never ends.</p>
              <p>the common sense thing to do isÂ increase patrol and be more alert when taking lifts.</p>
              <p>or maybe she shouldnt take lifts alone.Â  call beforehand and arrange for family members to meet her at the void deck.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>good common sense to have cctvs installed in lifts. We already have many of it in the HDBs. Has it been mentioned in my post that it should be anywhere else? Robberies and molest in lifts are very common, hardly the "isolated incident" as you claim.</p></div>
