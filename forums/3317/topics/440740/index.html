              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE : Singapore is seriously considering the option of importing electricity to diversify its source of energy supply.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The government will consult the public on the regulatory framework, to govern such imports from the region.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The idea of 
              importing electricity was brought up recently, in the midst of 
              Singapore's growing demand for natural gas, which currently fuels 80 per
               cent of its electricity needs. Natural gas is imported from Malaysia 
              and Indonesia via pipelines.<br><br>The government foresees this demand to soon exceed supply, so diversifying the country's energy sources is an option.<br><br>S
               Iswaran, Minister in the Prime Minister's Office and Second Minister 
              for Home Affairs and Trade and Industry, said: "What we are now seeking 
              to do is whether, through the importation of electricity, we can achieve
               some sort of fuel diversification as well. Because there may be options
               for electricity to be generated through alternate, renewable means or 
              other sources, which can then feed into our system. So that is one of 
              the considerations we have as part of a larger diversification strategy 
              for Singapore."<br><br>He added that Singapore is a small country in a 
              volatile energy environment, and the challenge is to secure reliable and
               competitively-priced energy supplies to sustain its growth.<br><br>Discussions have been held on the regional level at ASEAN, and Singapore now wants to hear from the private sector.<br><br>By
               year-end, the Energy Market Authority will launch a public consultation
               exercise with industry players and key stakeholders, to shape its 
              regulatory framework.<br><br>"For it to start, you need to look at it 
              from the angle of what makes sense for individual countries working 
              together with their immediate neighbours, (that) would be the way to get
               forward. And I think it is not just about governments, it is also about
               the private sector. Because at the end of the day, even if the 
              governments are all supportive, we will need private sector investments 
              to make this happen," Mr Iswaran said.<br><br>Announcing this at the Singapore International Energy Week, Mr Iswaran also gave an update on innovative energy solutions.<br><br>Two
               more companies - Renault and Nissan - will join the electric vehicle 
              (EV) pilot project, which was launched in June this year.<br><br>Car manufacturer Renault is launching a series of EVs catered to families, young executives and for the first time - businesses.<br><br>George
               Chu, regional after sales manager at Renault Singapore, said: "Renault 
              is also offering commercial vehicles in the respect of a Kangoo van, so 
              businesses can take up the offer and ferry the goods around."<br><br>The test-bed aims to assess the costs, benefits and feasibility of adopting EVs in Singapore.<br><br>A total of 14 EVs have been deployed for the test-bed, up from five since the programme's launch in June 2011.<br><br>Furthermore, 10 normal charging stations, both indoor and outdoor, have been installed - up from the original five.<br><br>- CNA/cc/ms</span></span></p>
