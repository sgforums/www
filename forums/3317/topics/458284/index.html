              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: A former analyst with the Immigration and Checkpoints
               Authority (ICA) was sentenced to two months' imprisonment and fined 
              $9,000 for corruption and unauthorised use of computer data.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Ng Chun Wei, 35, was also made to pay a penalty of $700 for accepting the bribe.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Ng, who was with the
               ICA's Border Watch Unit, had accepted $500 to facilitate citizen 
              applications, as well as for performing unauthorised computer searches 
              on the status of those applications.<br><br>His accomplice, part-time 
              musician Tan Poh Guan, 54, was sentenced to two-and-a-half months' jail 
              for abetting the crime, as well as for giving false information to an 
              investigation officer when questioned about the case.<br><br>The court 
              heard that Tan had linked Ng up with a Mr Mohamed Saif Mohamed Salleh 
              who needed help with the citizenship applications for his two children.<br><br>Mr
               Mohamed Saif was married to a Filipino national, and had already failed
               in getting the citizenship applications approved on his first attempt.<br><br>Tan told Ng that Mr Mohamed Saif would be willing to pay a fee in return for the latter's help.<br><br>The
               trio then met at a coffeeshop in Chinatown Point sometime in November 
              2010, where Ng told Mr Mohamed Saif that he would facilitate the 
              applications for a $1,500 fee.<br><br>Ng added that there was a 70 to 80
               per cent chance that the applications would be successful and that he 
              would return the money if they were not.<br><br>Mr Mohamed Saif then 
              handed over $500 as an initial payment, and agreed to pay the remaining 
              $1,000 once the applications had been approved.<br><br>Ng then accompanied Mr Mohamed Saif to the ICA building on two occasions to make the applications.<br><br>Investigations
               revealed that Ng later accessed the ICA's computer system three times 
              in December 2010 to check on the status of the applications, even though
               he did not have the authority to do so.<br><br>Before his posting to 
              the Border Watch Unit, Ng had been attached to the Citizen Service 
              Centre - the department which processes applications for Singapore 
              citizenship.<br><br>In meting out Ng's sentence, District Judge Eugene 
              Teo said that while Ng was a first-time offender, he had abused his 
              position. He urged Ng to make good on his promise not to re-offend after
               serving his sentence.<br><br>- CNA/de</span></span></p>
