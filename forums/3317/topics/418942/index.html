              As we come up to the final year of the Enabling Masterplan 
              2007-2011,  this might be a good time to point out an interesting, 
              little-known fact: Singapore, Myanmar and North Korea are the only three
               countries in all of South, South-east and North-east Asia to not have 
              signed the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
              Disabilities (CPRD). <br><br> Presumably, the Government here has 
              its reasons for not signing the convention - perhaps it is waiting for 
              the Enabling Masterplan to be renewed or its next iteration introduced, 
              before committing to this new international standard. This would be my 
              guess, since the masterplan's criteria for classifying disability 
              appears to lag international standards. The fact that Singapore also 
              seems to be lagging in terms of disability policy is likely not 
              coincidental. <br><br> The way disability is viewed internationally
               has changed quite dramatically in the last few decades. Earlier views -
               first codified by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1980 - 
              portrayed disability as essentially a medical condition. <br><br> But by 2002, the WHO had recognised in a report that a "decrement in 
              health" (say, illness or ageing) that results in some form of disability
               is a "universal human experience". The report moved from defining 
              disability as basket of medical conditions, to a description of 
              limitations on daily life. <br><br> And now, the Convention on the 
              Rights of Persons with Disabilities has gone further - it includes among
               its general principles respect for the inherent dignity, autonomy and 
              independence of persons; non-discrimination; full and effective 
              participation in society; equality of opportunity; and the right of 
              children with disabilities to preserve their identities, among other 
              things.<br><br> The point to note is that this recognises 
              implicitly that an individual's medical condition need not determine his
               or her ability to function in society, nor is it grounds for his or her
               exclusion. <br><br> The 2007 Enabling Masterplan, however, seems 
              premised on a different understanding of disability, which it defines 
              as: "Those whose prospects of securing, retaining places and advancing 
              in education and training institutions, employment and recreation as 
              equal members of the community, are substantially reduced as a result of
               physical, sensory, intellectual and developmental impairments."<br><br> The masterplan's definition bears a striking resemblance to the 
              2002 WHO report in attributing limitations to an individual's ability to
               function in society to medically-determined "impairments", rather than 
              the way the built-up environment is designed or organised. <br><br> The question is what impact this outmoded understanding would have.<br><br> <br><br> SEGREGATION VS INCLUSION<br><br> From as far back as the 1980s, the medical-based understanding of 
              disability has been criticised as deterministic and creating the 
              tendency for persons with disabilities (PWDs) to be classed by how 
              severe their medical condition is and their reduced ability to make key 
              decisions. <br><br> This view of disability tends to focus policies
               and resources not on providing access and the means to integrate into 
              mainstream society - but on creating an segregated environment where it 
              is perceived PWDs will be more "comfortable". The masterplan's 
              definition therefore ossifies the perception that PWDs can never be full
               members of society because biological reasons set us permanently apart.
               <br><br> This is a key problem, for it infuses the policy goals 
              that in turn determine how effective policies can be in integrating PWDs
               into society. This is why the failure to sign the Convention is so 
              frustrating, even galling - it seems to reflects a lack of ambition on 
              the part of policy-makers to have PWDs live as full a life as possible. <br><br> One might wonder if an overly demanding implementation schedule 
              might account for the Government's reluctance to sign the Convention. 
              This isn't a likely explanation, given that the Convention doesn't lay 
              out a fixed timetable for the implementation of policy goals. Besides, 
              most of our Asian neighbours who have signed up clearly do not appear to
               feel the requirements are overly onerous - why shouldn't Singapore, 
              with considerably more resources and bureaucratic capability at its 
              disposal, be able to keep up in terms of being inclusive? <br><br> The next time a key policy-maker is asked how the Government is working 
              towards giving young Singaporeans a greater sense of belonging, it would
               benefit him or her to be able to cite policy that - at least in its 
              vision - is more ambitiously inclusive. Young Singaporeans would be 
              encouraged to hear the Government is striving to ensure no one on the 
              fringes of society and the economy is left behind. <br><br> As a 
              disabled person, I can identify with the nebulous disenchantment that 
              sometimes pervades everyday conversations about Government policy. For 
              PWDs, the sense of alienation - from society and Singapore as a whole - 
              is crystallised in a plethora of poorly thought-out, poorly implemented,
               or just plain absent, accessibility features. <br><br> In a Dec 4 
              feature in Weekend Today, Mr Chin Chi Leong, the Building and 
              Construction Authority's Commissioner of Buildings, was quoted  as 
              saying that 98 per cent of key Government buildings now have "at least 
              basic barrier-free features".<br><br> The reality is that "basic 
              barrier-free features" in some cases literally means a ramp at the side 
              of the building - and nothing else.  Such rudimentary access features 
              often mean that PWDs can enter a building, but not really use it 
              regularly or work in it.<br><br> If the Government were to commit 
              to the goals of the CPRD, it would, among other things, have to stop 
              citing such features as examples of material progress. Accepting the 
              right of PWDs to participate fully in Singapore's economy and society 
              means ensuring that our built-up environment doesn't just appear to be 
              accessible - a Potemkin infrastructure - but is truly so. <br><br> One might also add that the aim should be for PWDs to be able to access 
              almost all of our built-up areas as independently as possible. <br><br> We may have come very far as a society, but we can be even better, 
              in terms of how we treat each other. And it should start with a 
              statement of lofty purpose, something we seem in dire need of as a 
              society. Following through thereafter, by bringing one of the most 
              marginalised sections of society into the fold, will give those who have
               become disenchanted an example of what we can achieve.  <br><br> <br><br><em> The writer is an economist and has been a person with disabilities since childhood.</em></div>
