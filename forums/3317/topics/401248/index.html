              <p><span> SINGAPORE : Regional financial centres Singapore and Hong Kong have the 
              most efficient bureaucracies, according to the survey of expatriate 
              business executives by the Political and Economic Risk Consultancy 
              (PERC) on Wednesday. </span></p>
              <p><span>India, Indonesia and the Philippines have Asia's most inefficient 
              bureaucracies, with red tape a constant blight to citizens and deterrent
               to foreign investment, the survey said.
              <br> <br> Government bureaucracies in some Asian countries have become "power 
              centres" in their own right, allowing them to effectively resist efforts
               toward reforms by politicians and appointed officials, the Hong 
              Kong-based firm said.
              <br> <br> Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono's failure to carry out 
              reforms contributed to the resignation last month of respected finance 
              minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati, who accepted a senior position at the 
              World Bank, PERC said.
              <br> <br> "Despite President Susilo's strong election mandate, he lacks the power 
              to really shake up Indonesia's bureaucracy," the consultancy said.
              <br> <br> Ranking 12 key countries and territories on a scale from one to 10, with
               10 as the worst possible score, the business executives in the survey 
              rated India as having the region's most inefficient bureaucracy.
              <br> <br> India had a score of 9.41, followed by Indonesia (8.59), the Philippines
               (8.37), Vietnam (8.13) and China (7.93).
              <br> <br> Malaysia was in sixth place from the bottom with a score of 6.97, 
              followed by Taiwan (6.60), Japan (6.57), South Korea (6.13) and Thailand
               (5.53).
              <br> <br> Singapore was ranked has having the most efficient bureaucracy, with a 
              score of 2.53, followed by Hong Kong with 3.49.
              <br> <br> PERC said 1,373 middle and senior expatriate executives took part in the
               survey carried out earlier this year.
              <br> <br> Singapore was also number one and Hong Kong was in third place globally 
              in the World Bank's latest survey on the ease of doing business, which 
              covered 183 economies.
              <br> <br> In India, "politicians frequently promise to reform and revitalise the 
              Indian bureaucracy, but they have been ineffective in doing so -- mainly
               because the civil service is a power centre in its own right," PERC 
              said.
              <br> <br> Dealing with India's bureaucracy "can be one of the most frustrating 
              experiences for any Indian, let alone a foreign investor," it added.
              <br> <br> Bureaucratic red tape is both a "serious problem" in China and India, 
              "but the differences in the political systems of these two countries 
              have made inertia much worse in India than in China," it said.
              <br> <br> In the Philippines, the government "goes through the motion" of 
              addressing problems of bureaucratic red tape "but nothing has really 
              made a dent in the problem," PERC said.
              <br> <br> "Illegal fixing is well-entrenched in the Philippine bureaucracy," it 
              said, referring to people called "fixers" who offer to facilitate 
              transactions with government offices for a fee and often in 
              collaboration with corrupt employees.
