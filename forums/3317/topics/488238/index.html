              <p>SINGAPORE: The Republic needs to be more manpower-lean and productive, said outgoing Manpower Minister Tan Chuan-Jin on Sunday (May 3).</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Marking his last day with the Ministry of Manpower, he stressed that keeping manpower growth tight is "the correct way to go even if companies aren't always happy". </span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Mr Tan said while some may not always agree with how policies have been designed and implemented, the benefit of Singaporeans and Singapore must continue to be at "centre of everything".</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Mr Tan, who's been appointed as the new Social and Family Development Minister, shared these views as he blogged on his reflections on his last day of work with the Manpower Ministry.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">"A most meaningful four years."</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">That's how Mr Tan Chuan-Jin described his stint with the Manpower Ministry. Mr Tan said when he first joined the Ministry in 2011, he thought the Ministry was an important driver in the economic landscape.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">However, he soon realised that the responsibilities were also social in nature - affecting the lives of many. Uplifting low wage workers and helping Singaporeans achieve retirement adequacy are some critical issues to tackle so Singaporeans can enjoy a more comfortable future.</span></p>
              <p><strong>MANAGING DIFFERENT INTERESTS</strong></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">In his reflections, Mr Tan said being in the Manpower Ministry meant having to manage differing interests. For example, employers would like easier access to more manpower. </span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Some also felt changes to the Employment Act and the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act were being overly protective of workers. But some still feel Singaporeans workers are not protected adequately.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Mr Tan said at the end of the day, Singaporeans must benefit from all that is being done. He said manpower growth must be kept tight.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Strengthening the Singaporean core is also more important than "taking the seemingly more popular Singaporeans first or only approach". He said the latter will hurt Singapore's competitiveness and the ability to provide good opportunities and jobs for Singaporeans.</span></p>
              <p><strong style="line-height: 1.231;">TRIPARTISM</strong></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Mr Tan also highlighted the importance of tripartism in Singapore. He said it enabled the Government to put in place initiatives which have benefited low wage workers. He said there is underlying trust between the parties.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">The willingness to look at longer-term common interests has also prevented gridlocks or divisions.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">From 2011 to 2014, the Workfare Income Supplement Scheme has also seen S$2.1 billion being disbursed to 400,000 low-wage Singaporeans in cash as well as CPF contributions. Singaporeans can also benefit from higher CPF interest rate for low balances and similarly for CPF members aged 55 and above</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Mr Tan said tripartism support and collaboration had been at the heart of all these efforts, even if it didn't seem obvious.</span></p>
              <p><strong style="line-height: 1.231;">WORKPLACE SAFETY</strong></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Turning to workplace safety, Mr Tan said important regulations and programmes have been introduced to reduce the number of injuries. The fatality rate has fallen to an all-time low of 1.8 deaths per 100,000 workers last year - a goal that was supposed to be achieved by 2018.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Still, he said more should be done to lower it further. Apart from safety, he said the Ministry has also come down hard on egregious employment practices.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">For example, the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act has been enhanced to ensure that errant employers are brought to justice swiftly. Penalties have been increased for effective deterrence.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Mr Tan said enabling Singaporeans to retire more comfortably in their golden years has always been one of the foremost concerns. Thus, CPF contribution rates and salary ceilings have been increased. There's also the flexibility for lump sum withdrawal at the payout eligibility age. Low-income retired elderly will also benefit from the Silver Support Scheme, which will be rolled out next year.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Still, Mr Tan said all the measures would not translate to a comfortable retirement unless one carefully looks at how they save and prepare for their retirement. Self-discipline he said is also important.</span></p>
              <p><strong style="line-height: 1.231;">IN GOOD HANDS</strong></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Mr Tan said he is leaving the Manpower Ministry in the good hands of Mr Lim Swee Say - a man he deeply respects and admire.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">He said he is certain that Minister in the Prime Minister's Office Chan Chun Sing, who takes over Mr Lim's post as Secretary-General of NTUC, will continue his good work and will ensure there is strong partnership with unions.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Mr Tan also thanked Stephen Lee, ex-president of SNEF, as well as current president Robert Yap. He said under their leadership, Singapore has a strong and unique tripartite partnership to safeguard the welfare of workers.</span></p>
