              <p><strong>Time to go on the offensive in 2010: Labour Chief Lim</strong></p>
              <p>NTUC Secretary-General Lim Swee Say says the Labour movement is ready to go on the offensive next year on the jobs front.</p>
              <p>Speaking to reporters after a two-and-a-half hour long news conference
              to round up the year for the NTUC, Mr Lim says 2009 has been all about
              saving jobs and preventing retrenchments. <br> <br> So in 2010, he says the focus should shift towards getting back to full
              employment and continuing to build an inclusive workforce. <br> <br> <em>Jeremy Koh</em> tells us more :<strong><br> <br> </strong>It's been a year marked by more lows than highs on the economic front. <br> <br> Still, as the year draws to a close, Mr Lim says he's pleased with what's been achieved so far. <br> <br> Although Singapore had faced its worst economic slump since
              independence, job loss figures were below those recorded during the
              Asian Financial Crisis and the Sars outbreak. <br> <br> And Mr Lim says that's because Singapore had focused on cutting costs
              to save jobs while other countries were cutting jobs to save costs :<br> <br> "Basically in the year 2009, we were playing a defensive game, trying
              to minimize the pain in the downturn. So basically the whole idea is to
              inflict less pain in the downturn. 2010 will be very different
              strategy, 2010, the strategy would be one of how do we achieve more
              gain in an upturn."<br> <br> And that means going on the offensive. <br> <br> Mr Lim says Singapore will now look at ways to upgrade the capabilities of businesses and the employability of workers. <br> <br> This is so that the economy can continue to grow and employment rates can continue to rise :<br> <br> "In the year 2010, from the labour movement’s perspective, there are
              two areas we look forward to working very closely with our tripartite
              partners. Firstly is how do we pursue a CBF economy - a cheaper,
              better, faster economy through higher productivity, better capability
              and higher level of flexibility. Secondly is how to ensure that the
              workforce of Singapore will remain an inclusive workforce."<br> <br> Mr Lim adds that his main concern for next year is not about creating
              enough jobs for Singaporeans but ensuring that Singaporeans are matched
              to suitable jobs. <br>   <br> As for companies, he says the Economic Strategies Committee or ESC
              could unveil a more targeted approach to helping them when it releases
              its list of recommendations next month. <br> <br> But such a scheme, he adds, would only benefit companies that are
              committed to expanding their capacities and upgrading their
              capabilities.</p>
