              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Nearly one in five workers in Singapore admit that 
              they have feigned an illness in order to go on medical leave, according 
              to findings from an online survey by JobsCentral.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>And about half of these respondents revealed they would do so three or more times a year.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>A total of 3,299 employees and 256 hiring managers took part in the survey conducted from August to October this year.<br><br>77.7
               per cent of employers said they would perform checks when their staff 
              is absent due to illness. But most of these employers said they would 
              rely on medical certificates to verify sickness claims. <br><br>Only 
              12.3 per cent said they would call the employee to check, while 5 per 
              cent would go to the extent of asking a co-worker to check on the 
              employee.<br><br>As to the reasons why workers faked illnesses, most 
              said they did so because they did not feel like working. Another 30 per 
              cent cited plans outside work. <br><br>When asked to describe their 
              current job satisfaction, only a marginally larger proportion of workers
               who took bogus sick leave voiced discontentment with their jobs. <br><br>JobsCentral said this suggests that employees who feign illness to skip work may not necessarily be unhappy with their jobs.<br><br>Chief
               Operating Officer of JobsCentral Group, Michelle Lim said: "The survey 
              results show that there is mutual responsibility and trust between 
              employers and employees. A large majority of employees are honest when 
              it comes to taking sick leave and few employers are so mistrusting of 
              their employees to resort to invasion checks."<br><br>Ms Lim added: "As 
              for the healthy 20 per cent who used illnesses to dodge work, they risk 
              jeopardising their jobs and careers. On the other hand, an overly 
              suspicious employer or manager that constantly checks on employees is 
              also detrimental to work relationships; few employees would tolerate 
              working for managers that do not trust them." <br><br>The survey also revealed that senior staff were less likely to take bogus medical leave. <br><br>Workers with gross salaries of over S$5,000 were least likely to fake an illness to go on medical leave.<br><br>- CNA/ck</span></span></p>
