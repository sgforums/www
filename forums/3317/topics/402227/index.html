              <p>For the first time in seven months, Chinese national Chen Yanfei, 31,
              came face-to-face with her missing husband - in front of a court judge
              last Monday.<br><br>The Shenzhen resident asked him to cough up some
              money for their four-year-old son. Singaporean Tan Jiak Hee, 59, is
              alleged to have abandoned both Ms. Chen and their son last year.<br><br>Not
              only are banks and finance companies feeling the credit crunch, the
              troubled economy is also claiming another group of victims - foreign
              brides.<br><br>Various organisations report a rising number of
              foreign-born women who say the same men who spent thousands of dollars
              to bring them here are now withholding cash, threatening divorce, and
              in some extreme cases, dumping them at the airport with a one-way
              ticket home.<br><br>The Hainan Hwee Kuan, a clan association, said the
              number of Hainanese brides it assists has more than doubled - from 25
              to 56 - since September last year.<br><br>Lawyer Cheng Kim Kuan, who
              handles legal disputes between foreign brides and their husbands at the
              clan association for free, said he receives one new case every week on
              average.<br><br>Many foreign brides say they are being abused at home -
              locked up and not given money to spend. Others say they are treated
              like maids.<br><br>Mr. Cheng said he expects this number to rise even
              further as more jobs are lost. ‘These men think of their wives as
              expendable objects, like furniture,’ he said.<br><br>Most of these men
              are mature blue-collar workers who cannot afford new wives when their
              jobs are axed and belts have to be tightened.<br><br>Ms. Fu Xi Bin of
              Heng Mei Matchmaking Services, which specialises in recruiting
              Hainanese brides, called the men’s actions a ‘cost-cutting measure’.<br><br>‘Yes, it’s extreme, but not surprising if the man is not in love with his wife.’<br><br>Ms.
              Susie Wong, chairman of women’s shelter, Star Shelter, said the number
              of foreign brides it houses has doubled from four to eight this month.
              ‘Under normal circumstances, there are already family abuses cases.
              What more in a recession?’<br><br>Most of the women she helps are from the Philippines.<br><br>Brides from Vietnam, another popular locale for bachelors here to source for partners, have felt the pinch too.<br><br>An
              embassy official estimates that the number of Vietnamese brides who
              approach them for help has gone up from three to five a month since
              last year.<br><br>‘Many people have lost their jobs,’ said one abandoned bride, who asked not to be named. ‘We’re not so different.’<br><br>The
              cost of a foreign bride, including agency fees and airfares, ranges
              from $5,000 to $10,000. In the last six months, at least 15 businesses
              here dealing in foreign brides have closed shop.<br><br>Without many friends and with no family here, foreign brides in Singapore have little recourse when marriages turn sour.<br><br>Their
              plight is compounded by the fact that many hold only long-term social
              visit passes which have to be renewed by their husbands every 90 days -
              a rule that some use to coerce their wives into keeping mum about being
              bullied.<br><br>Few can afford to hire lawyers and, unlike Singaporean
              wives, are turned away from free or subsidised legal advice at centres
              whose services are for citizens and permanent residents only.<br><br>In
              one extraordinary case reported to the Hainan Hwee Kuan last December,
              a young Hainanese woman alleged that her husband forced her to sign
              divorce papers before packing her off to the airport the next day.<br><br>They had been married for less than a year and she was six months’ pregnant.<br><br>In
              the divorce papers, the man is said to have stated that he was not
              financially responsible for his wife, nor their child once they were
              back in China.<br><br>Ms. Chen is trying to avoid the same fate. In
              sworn affidavits filed in court in January, she alleged that Mr. Tan
              had ‘neglected and refused to provide any reasonable maintenance for
              our child’.<br><br>Mr. Tan, a part-time project supervisor, has asked
              the judge to consider his ‘financial plight and heavy financial
              obligations’ amid the economic downturn.<br><br>‘I don’t know how much
              longer I can work. I have exhausted my very limited resources and my
              CPF savings and so I cannot continue to provide for my child,’ he
              claimed. ‘As the cost of living is fairly low in Shenzhen, my
              contribution of $50 per month should be more than enough to see to the
              child’s needs.’</p>
