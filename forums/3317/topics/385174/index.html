              <p>KATO, Japan (AFP) – 
              Seeking to turn an <span id="lw_1261030354_0" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc; background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; cursor: pointer;   -moz-background-inline-policy: continuous;">environmental problem</span> into an economic opportunity, high-tech companies in resource-poor <span id="lw_1261030354_1" class="yshortcuts" style="background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; cursor: pointer;   -moz-background-inline-policy: continuous;">Japan</span> are mining mountains of toxic e-waste for precious materials.</p>
              <p>One model project, the sprawling Panasonic Eco Technology Centre, sits
              in lush rice fields an hour's drive outside of Osaka city.</p>
              <p>Inside, workers and humming machines disassemble flat-panel televisions, refrigerators and <span id="lw_1261030354_2" class="yshortcuts" style="background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; cursor: pointer;   -moz-background-inline-policy: continuous;">air conditioners</span>, sorting their metal and plastic components into boxes for recycling.</p>
              <p>About 90 percent of dismantled parts are reused in one way or another, says Yutaka Maehara, a manager at the plant.</p>
              <p>Among the most precious parts are metals such as copper that are
              becoming more expensive on the world market, while the plant also
              isolates toxic components such as heavy metals and dangerous gases.</p>
              <p>The plant aims to leave a minimal environmental footprint and to be a good neighbour in its quaint rural setting.</p>
              <p>"In the beginning residents here had some concerns," said Panasonic
              spokeswoman Kyoko Ishii. "But as you see, we've been operating the
              plant without polluting the water and the rice is growing without
              problems."</p>
              <p>Japan has come a long way since the 1950s, 60s and 70s when it emerged at breakneck speed as <span id="lw_1261030354_3" class="yshortcuts">Asia</span>'s economic engine room, boosting living standards but often at a devastating environmental cost.</p>
              <p>The skies over Tokyo, Yokohama and other industrial centres then were
              often choked with pollution, in the way those over parts of <span id="lw_1261030354_4" class="yshortcuts">China</span> are today, while waterways darkened with <span id="lw_1261030354_5" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc; cursor: pointer;">industrial effluent</span>.</p>
              <p>Since then Japan has tightened many <span id="lw_1261030354_6" class="yshortcuts">emission standards</span> and other safeguards and launched in 2001 a recycling system that
              separates paper, glass and aluminium cans from household rubbish that
              can be incinerated.</p>
              <p>Today people who want to dispose of <span id="lw_1261030354_7" class="yshortcuts">electronic appliances</span> have to pay an average of 28 dollars for a <span id="lw_1261030354_8" class="yshortcuts">washing machine</span>, 32 dollars for a TV set and 54 dollars for a fridge, according to the industry ministry.</p>
              <p>The volume of garbage dumped in landfills every year has shrunk to roughly one third of 1990 levels.</p>
              <p>Used <span id="lw_1261030354_9" class="yshortcuts">mobile phone handsets</span> and digital cameras are now often called 'city mines' for the <span id="lw_1261030354_10" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc; background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; cursor: pointer;   -moz-background-inline-policy: continuous;">precious metals</span> they contain, such as gold, silver and copper.</p>
              <p>The government recently launched a campaign to encourage cellphone
              users to return their old handsets to mobile phone companies for
              recycling.</p>
              <p>One pioneer in Japan has been camera maker Canon, which started
              recycling toner cartridges from its printers about 20 years ago and now
              reuses 90 percent of the components of its photocopiers.</p>
              <p>"Our system is closed loop recycling, which means used parts from our
              products are used again in our products," said Tomonori Iwashita, the
              executive officer in charge of Canon's <span id="lw_1261030354_11" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc; cursor: pointer;">environmental policy</span>.</p>
              <p>"Because we are a corporate entity, we don't make recycling efforts
              unless it is useful for our business. If you can recycle cheaply and
              reduce the burden on the environment then that's good for your business
              too."</p>
              <p>But despite manufacturers' efforts to go green, some disposal companies
              still dump dangerous materials, said Tetsuya Sekiguchi, an activist who
              has joined several residents' lawsuits against waste landfills.</p>
              <p>"I've been working on the problems of garbage pollution for
              decades, but the situation of illegal dumping has not improved a bit as
              there are few conscientious recycling companies," he said.</p>
              <p>Another challenge is "the impact of economic globalisation on
              the recycling industry," said Yuichi Moriguchi, head of the waste and
              recycling research centre at the National Institute for Environmental
              Studies.</p>
              <p>"Asian countries, led by <span id="lw_1261030354_12" class="yshortcuts">China</span>,
              are absorbing Japanese waste materials and thereby causing a shortage
              of materials for the Japanese recycling industry" which has the most
              sophisticated technologies, Moriguchi said.</p>
              <p>Because of very basic and dangerous extraction methods -- for
              example by burning the plastic off metal parts in the open -- waste
              from Japan often causes health and <span id="lw_1261030354_13" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc; cursor: pointer;">environmental problems</span> in other Asian countries, he said.</p>
              <p>"We need to build an international system of recycling" so that Japan's technologies can be fully utilised, Moriguchi said.</p>
              <p>In the long term, he said, "it's important to seek materials made from <span id="lw_1261030354_14" class="yshortcuts" style="background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; cursor: pointer;   -moz-background-inline-policy: continuous;">sustainable resources</span>,
              such as plants, with less energy and less pollution ... because relying
              on limited resources such as petroleum will bring trouble in the
              future".</p>
              <p>Canon and synthetic fibre maker Toray Industries Inc. have
              jointly developed a high quality plastic made from corn, which has been
              used in keyboards and components of its office machines.</p>
              <p>"Even though it is made from corn, its fire resistance is about the same as that of conventional plastic," Iwashita said.</p>
              <p>To expand research into sustainable materials, he said, Canon
              needs other companies, including major materials manufacturers, to come
              on board.</p>
              <p>"We can't do it alone," he said. "We have to work as a wider group."</p>
