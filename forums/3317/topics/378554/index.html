              <p>MUMBAI (AFP) - â€“ India's Parsis, the
              modern-day descendants of migrants who fled persecution in Iran more
              than 1,000 years ago, are turning to new technology to keep their
              ancient Zoroastrian religion alive.</p>
              <p>Websites, blogs, on-line
              directories and matchmaking portals are being used by the close-knit
              but scattered and shrinking community to stay in touch and true to the
              3,500-year-old faith.</p>
              <p>"The Parsis are a community without
              borders. We're almost all over the world," said Yazdi Tantra, who runs
              a computer consultancy firm in Mumbai, where 70 percent of the world's
              Parsis live.</p>
              <p>"We have this technology so that we can keep in
              contact because our numbers are very small. If there was no technology,
              we wouldn't communicate with one another... it keeps the community
              together," he told AFP.</p>
              <p>Tantra runs several websites, including
              the www.zoroastrians.net portal, which includes everything from
              suggestions for Parsi baby names to traditional Parsi food, adding to a
              global network of sites on the community and religion.</p>
              <p>What
              started out as being "just for fun" and a way to catalogue Parsi
              contacts for his own use three years ago unearthed an enthusiastic
              online community in India and across the world, he said.</p>
              <p>"Our website does a lot of connecting people," he added.</p>
              <p>Such
              connections are more important than ever as the largely prosperous,
              urbanised minority that produced the likes of Indian industrialist
              Ratan Tata, conductor Zubin Mehta and Queen singer Freddie Mercury gets
              smaller every year.</p>
              <p>The editor of "Parsiana" magazine, Jehangir
              Patel, told AFP that there were now only about 90,000 Parsis around the
              world "at most", as a low birth rate, marriage outside the community
              and emigration takes its toll.</p>
              <p>In India, the last national
              census in 2001 recorded just under 70,000 Parsis -- Zoroastrians who
              follow the prophet Zarathustra and worship one god, the creator of the
              universe, Ahura Mazda.</p>
              <p>They believe that good thoughts, good
              words and good deeds will triumph over evil and chaos, and the ancient
              religion is said to have influenced Christianity, Judaism and Islam.</p>
              <p>But demographers predict that there could be as few as 32,000 Parsis left by 2051, based on studies of fertility rates.</p>
              <p>In
              Mumbai, the influential Bombay Parsi Punchayat governing council is
              looking to young people to save the community by launching what has
              been called a "Facebook for Parsis" website and a youth wing.</p>
              <p>"Interaction
              among youngsters will be encouraged so that they find partners through
              the social events and networking sites, and eventually marry within the
              community," trustee Khojestee Mistry told the Hindustan Times recently.</p>
              <p>Zpeakerbox,
              an online youth magazine for the Zoroastrian community, and the social
              networking site www.ushtatebook.com already exist.</p>
              <p>Elsewhere,
              Tantra's theparsidirectory.com and the Parsi Yellow Pages on the
              "Parsiana" website aim to log as many Parsis as possible plus listings
              for everything from Parsi accountants to Parsi yoga institutes.</p>
              <p>"As
              a minority, we tend to stick together," said Patel. "Almost 33 percent
              marry out of the community, so we're getting a situation about how long
              people will see themselves as Parsis and how long we exist as a
              community."</p>
              <p>A debate is raging about whether Parsi women who
              marry non-Parsis should still be considered part of the community.
              Traditionalists say they shouldn't while reformists say they should if
              the community is to survive.</p>
              <p>"We are always under a cloud. That
              reflects the need for organisations and associations in the
              community... It's a way of sticking together," Patel added.</p>
              <p>Mumbai
              architect Arzan Sam Wadia runs parsikhabar.net, one of a number of
              blogs on Parsi matters. Half of his readers are from outside India, he
              told AFP from his base in New York.</p>
              <p>Online news portals give an
              immediacy to community news and allow for a range of views that cannot
              be duplicated by existing print publications, he added.</p>
              <p>"Within
              Bombay (Mumbai) and outside, just the fact that people are spread out
              so far and wide geographically, there's no mainstream publication in
              the traditional sense that can really do justice to it," he said.</p>
              <p>Journalist
              Shernaaz Engineer said her blog, parsi-link.blogspot.com, and others
              like it were the latest sign of how one of the world's oldest living
              faiths was adapting, she told AFP.</p>
              <p>It was also a way of
              avoiding the "factionalism" that has crept in to the Parsi media over
              issues like marriage outside the community, she said.</p>
