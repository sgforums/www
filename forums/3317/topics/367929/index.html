              <p><strong>Singaporean dies in Malacca hospital after bus crash</strong></p>
              <p class="first">SINGAPORE: A Singaporean woman has died after the tour bus she was travelling in crashed into a lorry in Malaysia.</p>
              <p>According to wire reports, she died on Sunday, a day after the
              accident which happened early Saturday morning along the North—South
              Highway near Tangkak, Johor.</p>
              <p>She was among six seriously injured
              passengers who were taken to the Malacca General Hospital. Some of them
              have since been transferred to Alexandra Hospital in Singapore.</p>
              <p>The 26 Singaporeans on board the coach were en route to a weekend getaway in Cameron Highlands.</p>

              <p>These tour bus drivers really floor their pedals when their driving along the highway in Malaysia so fatalities usually result when an accident occurs.</p>
              <p>There was once I was driving my family along the highway at a speed of around 120 and it was not uncommon to see huge tour buses zooming pass us at speeds of 160 or more. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/confused.png" alt="confused.png"></p>

              <p><strong><span class="newsTitle">Flying to Malaysia, a safer option?</span></strong></p>
              <p>The recent fatal accident along Malaysia's North-South highway
              involving a tour bus and a lorry has again raised concerns about the
              safety of express coaches.</p>
              <p>The tragic incident killed a 48 year-old Singaporean and seriously injured six others.</p>
              <p>With budget airlines now bringing passengers to more destinations in Malaysia at a competitive price, <em>Saifulbahri Ismail</em> finds out if this is a safer option to travel.</p>
              <p>Increasing numbers of Singaporeans are travelling to Malaysia.</p>
              <p>The Malaysian Tourism Ministry recorded some 4.9 million arrivals
              from January to May this year, a 36 per cent increase in the same
              period last year.</p>
              <p>The spike is partly attributed to the open skies agreement between
              the two countries which allows budget airlines to mount flights to
              various parts of Malaysia.</p>
              <p>The emergence of these new players has affected express bus
              companies which traditionally services many destinations within the
              Peninsula.</p>
              <p>The competition is stiff given the comparable rates offered by these budget carriers.</p>
              <p>Then, there's the savings in time.</p>
              <p>But that's not all.</p>
              <p>38 year-old administrator Mohamed Fawzi Ali is flying to Penang this weekend.</p>
              <p>He says safety is also a factor in deciding which mode of transport to choose :</p>
              <p>"Comparing safety on the road and flight, I think the risk taking a
              flight is lower than taking a bus along the highway. In terms of
              safety, I think taking a flight is a better option."</p>
              <p>The safety standards imposed by the civil aviation authority also
              makes flying from Singapore more assuring, according to another
              frequent traveller to Malaysia, Al Badahler :</p>
              <p>"As far as I know that Changi airport have a very strict rules about
              safety standards for the airplane like the maintenance and everything.
              So, for me travelling from Singapore taking any airplane is quite
              assuring in terms of safety."</p>
              <p>Coach operators admit that safety is certainly a concern especially with the bus industry facing the threat from the airlines.</p>
              <p>Some have acted to ensure the safety of passengers in a bid to retain customers.</p>
              <p>Transtar Travel for example uses a Web-based tracking device on all its buses.</p>
              <p>The driver gets a call immediately if he's detected to be driving dangerously.</p>
              <p>Ismail Abdul Rahman, Director of Hasry Express is mulling if he should fit speed limiters on his buses.</p>
              <p>He's confident that accidents involving express buses would not have a long term effect on demand :</p>
              <p>"In terms of the fatal accident, maybe it will affect a few days,
              after that when things get normal, you'll see people travelling again
              up and down."</p>
              <p>As proof, he says his coaches to Kuala Lumpur are fully booked for the National Day long weekend.</p>

              <p><strong><span>Flying to Malaysia, a safer
              option?</span></strong></p>
              <p>The recent fatal accident along Malaysia's North-South highway
              involving a tour bus and a lorry has again raised concerns about
              the safety of express coaches.</p>
              <p>The tragic incident killed a 48 year-old Singaporean and
              seriously injured six others.</p>
              <p>With budget airlines now bringing passengers to more
              destinations in Malaysia at a competitive price, <em>Saifulbahri
              Ismail</em> finds out if this is a safer option to travel.</p>
              <p>Increasing numbers of Singaporeans are travelling to
              Malaysia.</p>
              <p>The Malaysian Tourism Ministry recorded some 4.9 million
              arrivals from January to May this year, a 36 per cent increase in
              the same period last year.</p>
              <p>The spike is partly attributed to the open skies agreement
              between the two countries which allows budget airlines to mount
              flights to various parts of Malaysia.</p>
              <p>The emergence of these new players has affected express bus
              companies which traditionally services many destinations within the
              Peninsula.</p>
              <p>The competition is stiff given the comparable rates offered by
              these budget carriers.</p>
              <p>Then, there's the savings in time.</p>
              <p>But that's not all.</p>
              <p>38 year-old administrator Mohamed Fawzi Ali is flying to Penang
              this weekend.</p>
              <p>He says safety is also a factor in deciding which mode of
              transport to choose :</p>
              <p>"Comparing safety on the road and flight, I think the risk
              taking a flight is lower than taking a bus along the highway. In
              terms of safety, I think taking a flight is a better option."</p>
              <p>The safety standards imposed by the civil aviation authority
              also makes flying from Singapore more assuring, according to
              another frequent traveller to Malaysia, Al Badahler :</p>

              about safety standards for the airplane like the maintenance and
              everything. So, for me travelling from Singapore taking any
              airplane is quite assuring in terms of safety."</p>
