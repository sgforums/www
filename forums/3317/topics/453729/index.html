              <p>Several STOMPers have expressed anger over this 
              insensitive comment made on Twitter by a nurse. She had called a family 
              'orang kaya baru' or 'newly rich' after they asked for donations to fund
               their baby's overseas operation, only to have her pass away this 
              morning.<br><br>Baby Nur had been born with a rare heart condition, and 
              her family had requested for donations for her to undergo a heart 
              transplant overseas. She died suddenly this morning however, prompting 
              the woman's remark about the family becoming 'orang kaya baru', a Malay 
              term meaning 'newly rich people'. <br><br>STOMPers TwitterBoy, Zarabella, Dolly, Fiqa, Lydia, Atika, Shahaza and Lela all sent in comments regarding her tweet.<br><br>TwitterBoy wrote:<br><br>"This girl has been trending on Twitter because of her heartless comment about the Lil Nur death. <br><br>"She
               says, 'congrats to her parents for being the new org kaya baru'. That 
              means she is talking at Lil Nur's parents becoming a new wealthy couple 
              because many people donated to them for Lil Nur's heart transplant. <br><br>"Lil
               Nur parents must be devastated at the news of their daughter's death 
              and this girl can still say these kinds of things about her."<br><br>Zarabella wrote:<br><br>"Shame on you girl. <br><br>"For posting this on your tweet. You have no brain."<br><br>Dolly commented:<br><br>"Online, many have commented on her post about how rude she is. <br><br>"We heard about little Nur has passed away.<br><br>"The sad part is that someone would have the guts to say something like this online. <br><br>"I heard she worked as a nurse. We shall make a report to the authorities for this post."<br><br>Fiqa wrote:<br><br>"Little Nur passed away this morning and this lady here this is what she tweeted."</p>
              <p>Lydia wrote:<br><br>"Look at what she said about little Nur. <br><br>"She
               mentioned about how Nur's parents are going to be the new rich people, 
              but come on, I'm sure Nur's parents will donate it back to charity.<br><br>"I'm just so angry that she can say 'i told you so.' <br><br>"What! Ahh I'm just so angry i don't know what else to say. I just want her to apologise!"<br><br>Atika also commented:<br><br>"Little Nur just left this world and here's a girl posting this on Twitter. <br><br>"Why is she so heartless?! <br><br>"How would she feel if this had happened to her family member? <br><br>"Come on , that strong little girl just passed away."<br><br>Shahaza wrote:<br><br>"This comment was tagged by a lot of people in facebook with regards to this inhuman creature.<br><br>"Her comments about the parents of Lil Nur, who passed away this morning, were embarrassing and uncivilised.<br><br>"This uncivilised woman is known to be working at SGH (Singapore General Hospital) as a nurse.<br><br>"A lot of people from facebook tried to trace her account in Twitter but it seems that her account is no longer active.<br><br>"She
               has brought disgrace to our Malay community. We demand that she comes 
              forward &amp; apologise publicly, especially to Lil Nur's parents for 
              saying things like that about their loss.<br><br>"We really do hope this matter won't be taken lightly."<br><br>Lastly, Lela wrote:<br><br>"Hi! I am Lela. <br><br>"Nur passed away this morning and I find this twitter post very disturbing. <br><br>"Nur
               had a rare heart condition and needed funds to get a heart transplant. 
              There were a lot of organizations helping out to help her to get the 
              money to have the operation done overseas.<br><br>"I believe everyone is entitled to their own opinion but I find this post unacceptable. <br><br>"She deleted it but I managed to get hold of it before she deleted it.<br><br>"I heard this girl is working as a nurse and she should be mindful of what she says. <br><br>"Please have some RESPECT for other people."</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>Perhaps some voluntary organisation should co-ordinate with the various hospitals in Singapore and its social welfare and counseling unit to IDENTIFY  needy cases and give them the necessary support and publicity to get the required  funds either from charitable insitutions /or individuals via immediate media coverage , after clearly verifying the needs of each case. In this way, there will be less time delay to collect the  much needed funds, for those  critically ill and needy, to help them out.</div>

              <p>That $$ could be used to save other kids like Nur before it is too late. Even if Nur could not be saved, others like her should not suffer the same tragic fate.</p>
