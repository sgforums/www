              <p><strong>Review of Casino Control Act to mitigate risks, ensure economic value: S Iswaran</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Minister in the Prime Minister's Office, S Iswaran, 
              said the review of the Casino Control Act will help mitigate the risks 
              posed by the casinos, while ensuring that the Integrated Resorts (IRs) 
              continue to deliver economic value to Singapore.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Mr Iswaran said this in response to questions from reporters, on the sidelines of a community event on Sunday morning.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Among the changes 
              being considered - a 'visit limit' to better protect vulnerable locals 
              who visit the casinos frequently, a stronger licensing regime, and 
              higher penalties against errant casino operators.<br><br>Mr Iswaran said the proposed changes will act as proactive social safeguards and anticipate issues that may crop up.<br><br>He
               said: "One aspect is the social safeguards, which have always been an 
              important part of our efforts with the integrated resorts. And if you 
              look at the social safeguards, they are trying to introduce new 
              measures, some in a pro-active way, so that we are prepared, and in an 
              anticipatory manner for issues that may crop up.<br><br>"Equally, we are
               looking at the issues pertaining to enhancing our enforcement and other
               sorts of enforcement on the ground and legislative capabilities, 
              penalty regimes and so on. And that's again to ensure that we keep crime
               out of the casinos. And then, from an economic perspective, our 
              objective has been really to ensure that the Irs -- not just in the 
              first two or three years, but on an ongoing basis -- continue to deliver
               the total economic value proposition that we've been always expecting 
              of them.<br><br>"I think it's also in the interest of the IRs to 
              accomplish that. So there's a range of things that we are looking at - 
              the legislation of amendments that have been proposed are part of that 
              process and I think that we should work on an ongoing basis. Are there 
              risks? There are. And all the measures we take are to mitigate the risks
               while enhancing the value proposition for Singapore."<br><br>-CNA/ac</span></span></p>

              <p>Look at how many companies from China were allowed to list on the stock exchange so that it can grow more prominent. And look at how many locals invested in them. Companies that can't raise money in China raised it here.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">CASINO LAWS TO BE AMENDED</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"> </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>THE Government intends to tighten the laws governing casinos here. This is to guard against potential social ills while ensuring that the intergrated resorts (IRs) remain attractive tourist destinations.</p>
              <p>  Among new provisions to be introduced is one that will give the National Council on Problem Gambling the power to limit the number of times a financially vulnerable patron can visit a casino.</p>
              <p>  The aim is to have them curb their gambling behaviour before they become financially distressed.</p>
              <p>  In a comprehensive public consultation paper, the Government explained that as an extension of the existing casino exclusion measures, families and individuals will also be empowered to apply for a visit limit.</p>
              <p>  The council will also be given additional powers to deal with problem gamblers.</p>
              <p>  Another amendment could see the casino operators being slapped with penalties of up to 10 per cent of their total gross gaming revenue, instead of the current maximum of $1 million, should they be censured by the Casino Regulatory Authority.</p>
              <p>  There are also amendments that address casino crimes, casino operations and the sustainability of the integrated resorts as full-fledged tourism destinations, not just casinos with frills.</p>
              <p>  The two integrated resorts here have been operating their casinos for more than two years.</p>
              <p>  Resorts World Sentosa opened in early 2010 and Marina Bay Sands opened a few months later.</p>
              <p>  Minister in the Prime Minister's Office S.Iswaran, who is also Second Minister for Home Affairs and Second Minister for Trade and Industry, said yesterday that the amendments had come after a comprehensive review and were aimed at enhancing the current legislation.</p>
              <p>  "The primary intent we have on the advent of the IRs in Singapore is to ensure that we have a sustained economic benefit to Singapore...We want to make sure that going forward , we have a systematic process to ensure that continues to be the case," he said.</p>
              <p>  The government is asking for comments and feedback on its proposed amendments. Public consultation will start on Monday, July 9 and end on Aug 6.</p>
              <p>  Members of the public can assess the public consultation document and draft bill at the Reach portal.</p>
