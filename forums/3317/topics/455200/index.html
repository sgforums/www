              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Singapore's laws governing the two casinos, the 
              Casino Control Act, may soon have a "visit limit" to protect financially
               vulnerable local patrons who visit the casinos frequently. </span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The aim is to have them curb their gambling behaviour before they become financially distressed.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>This is one of 
              several amendments the government is proposing to the Casino Control Act
               in respect of five areas - Crime, Gaming, Social, Economic and Tax, and
               which are up for public views and feedback for one month from 6 July 
              2012.<br><br>The government, however, adds that it does not intend to make changes to the entry level for now. <br><br>In
               a comprehensive public consultation paper, the government explained 
              that as an extension of the existing casino exclusion measures, it is 
              proposing that the National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG) be 
              empowered to issue visit limits for local, financially vulnerable 
              patrons who frequent the casinos.<br><br>Families and individuals will 
              also be empowered to apply for a visit limit in addition to the current 
              family and voluntary self-exclusion.<br><br>Turning to the overall aim 
              of the amendments, the public consultation paper explains that they aim 
              to better align the legislative framework with the original policy 
              intention of introducing the Integrated Resorts in Singapore.<br><br>The
               government has explained that the concept of an IR with its variety of 
              leisure offerings is meant to provide visitors with a quality and 
              distinctive destination experience. <br><br>Within the larger IR 
              developments, the casinos are a small but essential component and these 
              help to make the entire developments financially sustainable.<br><br>The
               amendments also strive to enhance the law enforcement levers, 
              streamline regulatory requirements and operational processes so that 
              they keep pace with international best practices and industry 
              developments, strengthen social safeguards and improve the tax 
              administration.<br><br>It adds that the IRs have brought about economic 
              benefits and the negative impact of the casinos on the law and order, 
              and social aspects are under control. <br><br>Nonetheless, with the 
              benefit of two years of practical experience, a review of the regulatory
               regime and the Casino Control Act (CCA) is timely.<br><br>Giving more 
              details of the proposed changes, the government explained that in the 
              area of crime, it wants to enhance the law enforcement levers to address
               crime associated with the casinos.<br><br>Among the proposed amendments
               include appropriate steps taken by the casino operators to ensure that 
              those within the casino premises do not conduct illegal betting or 
              gaming.<br><br>Also being considered as casino crimes - past posting, 
              which is the act of making a bet after the results of the game are 
              known, and cheating at table games carrying chips worth $10,000 or more 
              outside the boundaries of the designated site.<br><br>The possession of 
              counterfeit chips and the materials to make counterfeit chips, and the 
              unlawful interference with gaming equipment within the casino premises 
              and in any part of Singapore, will also be deemed a crime.<br><br>To continue to protect vulnerable groups from the potential harm of casino gambling, social safeguards will be strengthened.<br><br>Besides
               the proposed "visit limit", the government will also enhance the powers
               of the National Council on Problem Gambling to issue casino exclusion 
              orders with regard to Family Exclusion Orders.<br><br>This is where the 
              family member with the gambling problem cannot be located or is 
              uncooperative, or where there is a need to act urgently to protect the 
              family from further severe harm. <br><br>And when an application to 
              revoke a family exclusion or self exclusion order is made, the NCPG 
              would be given powers to require excluded persons to undergo a clinical 
              assessment to determine the application.<br><br>It will also be an 
              offence for daily entry levy holders to stay in the casino beyond 24 
              hours without paying the additional entry levy and for attempting to 
              evade the entry levy.<br><br>The National Council on Problem Gambling 
              (NCPG)'s 2011 gambling prevalence survey found that probable 
              pathological and problem gambling (PPG) rates among Singapore Residents 
              have remained stable between 1 percent and 2 percent.<br><br>However, the proportion of low-income gamblers who bet large amounts has increased. <br><br>Probable pathological gamblers are found to have higher gambling frequency and poorer self-control in gambling. <br><br>Poorer self-control in gambling was detected among those who participated in horse racing, online and casino gambling.<br><br>Casino
               operators will also be required to provide the Ministry of Community 
              Development, Youth and Sports with more details on their Responsible 
              Gambling policies and practices covering topics like patron education 
              and employee training on problem gambling and responsible gambling. <br><br>The public can send their comments and feedback on the proposed amendments to the Casino Control Act by August 6.<br><br>- CNA/de</span></span></p>

              <p>
              </p><p> </p>
              <p>THE Government intends to tighten the laws governing casinos here. This is to guard against potential social ills while ensuring that the intergrated resorts (IRs) remain attractive tourist destinations.</p>
              <p>  Among new provisions to be introduced is one that will give the National Council on Problem Gambling the power to limit the number of times a financially vulnerable patron can visit a casino.</p>
              <p>  The aim is to have them curb their gambling behaviour before they become financially distressed.</p>
              <p>  In a comprehensive public consultation paper, the Government explained that as an extension of the existing casino exclusion measures, families and individuals will also be empowered to apply for a visit limit.</p>
              <p>  The council will also be given additional powers to deal with problem gamblers.</p>
              <p>  Another amendment could see the casino operators being slapped with penalties of up to 10 per cent of their total gross gaming revenue, instead of the current maximum of $1 million, should they be censured by the Casino Regulatory Authority.</p>
              <p>  There are also amendments that address casino crimes, casino operations and the sustainability of the integrated resorts as full-fledged tourism destinations, not just casinos with frills.</p>
              <p>  The two integrated resorts here have been operating their casinos for more than two years.</p>
              <p>  Resorts World Sentosa opened in early 2010 and Marina Bay Sands opened a few months later.</p>
              <p>  Minister in the Prime Minister's Office S.Iswaran, who is also Second Minister for Home Affairs and Second Minister for Trade and Industry, said yesterday that the amendments had come after a comprehensive review and were aimed at enhancing the current legislation.</p>
              <p>  "The primary intent we have on the advent of the IRs in Singapore is to ensure that we have a sustained economic benefit to Singapore...We want to make sure that going forward , we have a systematic process to ensure that continues to be the case," he said.</p>
              <p>  The government is asking for comments and feedback on its proposed amendments. Public consultation will start on Monday, July 9 and end on Aug 6.</p>
              <p>  Members of the public can assess the public consultation document and draft bill at the Reach portal.</p>
              <p>  Feedback can be submitted to <a href="mailto:mha_cca_consultation@mha.gov.sg">mha_cca_consultation@mha.gov.sg</a></p>
