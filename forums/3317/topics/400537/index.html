              <p><strong>S'pore ranked 17th most expensive retail location globally</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : Singapore has moved up one spot to become the 17th 
              most expensive retail location in the world. </span></p>
              <p><span>According to the latest CB Richard Ellis (CBRE) Global MarketView 
              report on the retail sector, prime retail rents in Singapore stood at 
              US$436 per square foot (psf) per annum in the first quarter of this 
              year.  
              <br> <br> It said prime retail rents in the world's leading shopping destinations 
              have stabilised in most markets in the first quarter.
              <br> <br> The report said as the global economic recovery begins to gather 
              momentum, consumer and retailer confidence have started to improve. 
              <br> <br> While this has still not translated into retail sales growth in most 
              markets, demand for prime retail space remains healthy and vacancy in 
              the best locations is low, it added.
              <br> <br> As a result, there are a number of major cities where prime rents are 
              rising, and many more where the rate of decline has slowed or rents are 
              now stable.
              <br> <br> New York City remained the world's most expensive retail destination, 
              with prime rents at US$1,725 psf/annum. Sydney was in second place 
              globally at US$1,155 psf/annum, while Hong Kong ranked third at US$974 
              psf/annum.
              <br> <br> London remained in fourth place, after recording a 20 per cent annual 
              increase in rents since the first quarter of 2009 to US$861 psf/annum. 
              Paris rounded out the top five locations with rents of US$791 psf/annum.
              <br> <br> Tokyo stayed in seventh position globally, with rents of US$711 
              psf/annum, while Brisbane moved up one place from the fourth quarter of 
              2009 to rank eighth at US$668 psf/annum, and Melbourne remained in 10th 
              place at US$568 psf/annum.
              <br> <br> CBRE said the Australian economy is growing strongly, with an expanding 
              workforce and falling unemployment. However, higher interest rates have 
              fuelled consumer caution and prevented any significant increase in 
              retail sales.
              <br> <br> The report said the Asian region is helping to lead the recovery, with 
              retail markets generally stabilising or strengthening in the first 
              quarter. 
              <br> <br> It added that with the exception of Japan, retail leasing activity in 
              major Asian cities continued to pick up and a number of international 
              retailers are looking to expand their footprint across the region, 
              particularly in Singapore, Hong Kong, Beijing and Shanghai. 
              <br> <br> Letty Lee, director, Retail Services in Singapore, CBRE, said: "The 
              retail landscape changed dramatically over the past year. Singapore has 
              been successful in attracting a sizeable number of global brands and 
              new-to-market concepts due to an abundant choice of prime pipeline 
              supply in the Orchard Road and the Marina Bay area. That in turn has put
               some pressure on prime retail rents."
              <br> <br> However, CBRE said there is a risk of supply imbalance in markets like 
              China and India, where a large amount of shopping centre construction 
              will be delivered over the next nine months.
              <br> <br> As for Latin American markets, some cities like Mexico City and Santiago
               have seen the strongest growth in rents, showing 12 to 13 per cent 
              on-year growth in rentals.
