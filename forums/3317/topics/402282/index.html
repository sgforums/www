              <p><span>SINGAPORE : A 57-year-old driver has been arrested for attempting 
              to bribe a traffic police officer. </span></p>
              <p><span>The driver, who was caught for driving with a mobile phone and 
              other traffic offences on Saturday, told the police officer that he was 
              willing to give cash in return for the officer to look the other way. 
              <br> <br> Police said the driver even wrote down his mobile phone number on a 
              piece of paper and handed it over to Sgt Mohammad Sufyan, offering to 
              meet the officer to pass him the money. 
              <br> <br> Immediately, Sgt Sufyan warned the driver that it was an offence to 
              bribe a public servant.  
              <br> <br> Undeterred, the driver made the offer again and Sgt Sufyan placed the 
              driver under arrest for attempting to bribe him. 
              <br> <br> The case has since been referred to the Corrupt Practices Investigation 
              Bureau.

              <p><em>another case of driver attempting to bribe a police officer..</em></p>
              <p><br><strong>Lorry driver nabbed for trying to bribe police officer</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: A 45-year-old lorry driver has been arrested for 
              attempting to bribe a police officer. </span></p>
              <p><span>The man, who was caught for drink-driving and drug offences, 
              offered cash to the officer to let him off. But Station Inspector David 
              Tan Boon Leong refused the bribe. 
              <br> <br> Police said that at about 12.30am on 13 June, they received a call about
               a lorry driver who seemed to have fainted in his vehicle along Pasir 
              Ris Drive 1.  
              <br> <br> The station inspector and his team mate were sent to attend to the 
              incident. 
              <br> <br> The officers found three packets of contraband cigarettes on the lorry 
              driver. 
              <br> <br> A subsequent check of the lorry revealed that the driver was in a 
              semi-conscious state and smelling strongly of alcohol. 
              <br> <br> A plastic bag containing a white powdery substance, believed to be a 
              controlled drug, was also found. 
              <br> <br> The driver was placed under arrest for drink-driving and possession and 
              consumption of controlled drugs. 
              <br> <br> His passenger was also arrested for possession of contraband cigarettes 
              and consumption of controlled drugs.
              <br> <br> The driver told Station Inspector Tan that he was carrying a large 
              amount of cash and offered it to him in return for letting him off. 
              <br> <br> Station Inspector Tan arrested the driver for attempting to bribe a 
              public servant. 
              <br> <br> The case has since been referred to the Corrupt Practices Investigation 
              Bureau (CPIB).

              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Police have arrested a 61-year-old man for suspected 
              drink-driving and attempting to bribe a police officer. </span></p>
              <p><span>The man was the driver of a car that was involved in an accident 
              with a motorcycle along Aljunied Road on Wednesday evening.
              <br> <br> He failed a breathalyzer test, and was informed by a police officer that
               he would be arrested for drink driving. 
              <br> <br> The driver pleaded with the officer to let him off.
              <br> <br> He also told the officer to contact him in future for a good opportunity
               in return for the favour. 
              <br> <br> However, the officer rejected the offer and arrested him for drink 
              driving and attempted bribery.
              <br> <br> A subsequent breath test showed that the driver's breath was almost 
              twice the alcohol legal limit.
              <br> <br> Police are investigating the driver for drink driving.
              <br> <br> The Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) is following up on the
               attempted bribery charge. - CNA/jy</span></p>
