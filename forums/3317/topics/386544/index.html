              <p><strong>Educators say new teacher academies will open up opportunities, raise standards</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Education (MOE) announced on Tuesday the setting up of academies for arts and physical education. </span></p>
              <p><span>And educators have said that the new teacher academies will open
              up opportunities and raise standards in Singapore's teaching
              profession.
              <br> <br>Mrs Lock Wee Lee has been a music teacher for over 20 years, and
              often, she cannot find time for professional development courses.
              Another difficulty is finding enough courses.
              <br> <br>Mrs Lock said: "Sometimes I actually have to look overseas to
              attend conferences. I'm very happy they are setting up an academy here,
              because it would mean that they can attract. It would be a magnet for
              music professionals from abroad.
              <br> <br> "Not only do local music teachers benefit, we can also invite teachers from overseas to come over."
              <br> <br>There are currently over 1,000 art and music teachers here and some
              1,300 physical education (PE) teachers. And they hope the new academies
              could swell their ranks over time.
              <br> <br>The two new academies are part of ongoing efforts by MOE to add
              emphasis on music and art, as well as physical education. PE, for
              instance, is already an O-level subject, and more curriculum time will
              soon be given to primary schools for students to engage in music and
              sports.
              <br> <br> Other initiatives include building of indoor sports halls for schools, in order to improve access to facilities.
              <br> <br> The aim is to further develop the students' soft skills.
              <br> <br>However, some teachers feel many parents and even schools do not
              pay enough attention to subjects like PE, precisely because they are
              not core academic subjects.
              <br> <br>Quek Swee Nee, head of department, PE, CCA &amp; Aesthetics, Bukit
              View Primary School said: "I think that PE has been given, in a sense
              that it has always been play-play, and more playing. And basically
              there is no learning involved.
              <br> <br>"But that is not true, because in physical education you can
              actually see character development, teaching of character development
              in the process, and we can also see teaching of values."
              <br> <br>Teachers said that instead of focusing on these aims, some primary
              schools are too focused on having students do well for the national
              physical fitness assessment (NAPFA) tests.
              <br> <br>And they hope that through research and interaction with overseas
              experts, more effective teaching methods and outcomes can be developed.
