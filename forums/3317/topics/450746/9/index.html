              <h1 class="news_title">Businessman denies having sex with underage prostitute</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE: A businessman in court 
              Tuesday maintained that he did not have paid sex with an underage 
              prostitute, saying that his police statement was made under duress and 
              thus not admissible in court.</p>
              <p>The 50-year-old businessman Edward 
              Whistler Goh is implicated in an online vice ring case and is accused of
               having commercial sex with an underage prostitute.</p>
              <p>Goh is 
              contesting allegations that he had paid sex with the underage prostitute
               in September 2010 and October 2011. Court documents stated he paid the 
              girl, who was then under the age of 18, a total of S$950 for her 
              services.</p>
              <p>A hearing known as "a trial within a trial" is underway.
               The court will decide at the end of the “trial within a trial” whether 
              Goh’s police statement was made voluntary, and thus admissible. The main
               trial will then start after that.</p>
              <p>Goh is one of 51 men to be 
              charged with having commercial sex with the minor. He is the second man 
              to contest the charges, following Swiss national Juerg Buergin. </p>
              <p>Goh can be fined and jailed up to seven years if found guilty.</p>

              <h1 class="news_title">Business consultant says he only had sex with prostitute after she turned 18</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE: A business consultant 
              accused of having commercial sex with an underage prostitute said 
              Thursday that he had sex with her in 2011 but not in 2010, when she was 
              still under 18 years of age.</p>
              <p>Edward Whistler Goh faces two counts of having paid sex with a minor - once in September 2010 and another in October 2010.</p>
              <p>Goh
               said in court Thursday that he told the officer recording his police 
              statement that he met the girl several times. Goh added that he also 
              told the recording officer he did not have sex with her on the two 
              occasions in 2010 that he has been accused of.</p>
              <p>The 50-year-old 
              said the investigation officer was only interested in the two charges, 
              and that he told the officer he also had sex with the girl in 2011.</p>
              <p>The prosecution, in an attempt to poke holes in Goh's testimony and discredit him, took issue with Goh’s revelation in court.</p>
              <p>The prosecutor said Goh did not mention any of the above during Wednesday's questioning, for which Goh apologised.</p>
              <p>Goh
               is currently contesting the admissibility of his police statement, 
              maintaining that the statement was made under threats and inducement.</p>
              <p>The
               court will decide at the end of a “trial within a trial” whether Goh’s 
              police statement was made voluntarily, and thus admissible. The main 
              trial will then start after that.</p>
              <p>The business consultant has 
              accused his recording officer of threatening to charge him with various 
              crimes if he did not cooperate during the investigation.</p>
              <p>The 
              threats include charging him for being a runner and helping out with the
               prostitution ring, as well as having commercial sex with a minor, said 
              Goh.</p>
              <p>The prosecution however questioned the rationale of Goh 
              admitting to having commercial sex with the girl, as opposed to being 
              charged for not cooperating with the police.</p>
              <p>Goh then explained that the officer promised twice that he would not be charged.</p>
              <p>The district judge then asked what happened to the threats.</p>
              <p>Goh
               said the threats persisted and that there were untruths in his 
              statement. "All I know was I wanted to get out of the place," said Goh.</p>
              <p>The prosecution then asked why Goh signed the statement even though there were so many untruths in it.</p>
              <p>Goh
               replied saying that he was anxious to get out of the police station, 
              and that the officer told him he had to sign the statement before he 
              could go.</p>
              <p>Goh is one of 51 men to be charged with having 
              commercial sex with the minor. He is the second man to contest the 
              charges, following Swiss national Juerg Buergin.</p>
              <p>Goh can be fined and jailed up to seven years if found guilty.</p>
              <p>The trial continues.</p>

              <div class="news_detail">
              <div>
              <p>SINGAPORE: A business consultant fighting allegations 
              he had commercial sex with an underage girl in an online vice ring 
              scandal has been described as "prim and proper" by a prosecution 
              witness.</p>
              <p>Edward Whistler Goh, 50, is accused of having paid sex with a minor under 18 years of age in September and October 2010.</p>
              <p>Tang Boon Thiew, who had hired the minor to provide escort services, testified in court as a prosecution witness on Friday.</p>
              <p>Tang, 39, was sentenced earlier in January 2013 for vice-related charges.</p>
              <p>The
               pimp told the court that Goh fell into the rare category of "prim and 
              proper", which was why he allowed his escort to go to the accused's 
              home.</p>
              <p>He said for safety reasons, he usually does not accept home bookings.</p>
              <p>On
               the events that transpired on the day Goh and the girl had an 
              appointment in September 2010, Tang testified that he did not think the 
              two could have had sex in the 40 minutes, given that many things 
              happened.</p>
              <p>The court had previously heard the appointment that 
              day was at 5pm but the minor was about 10 minutes late and at about 
              5.45pm a police raid started at the hotel the duo were checked into.</p>
              <p>Goh and the girl were said to have checked out of their room shortly after 6pm.</p>
              <p>During
               the time when the Goh and the girl were in the room, Tang said he was 
              conversing with the two via phone messages, so he believes that they 
              could not have had time to have sex.</p>
              <p>The prosecution's re-examination begins after lunch.</p>

              <div class="news_detail">
              <div>
              <p>SINGAPORE: A Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) Lieutenant 
              Colonel accused of having paid sex with an underage prostitute in 2011 
              has claimed trial.</p>
              <p>Emlyn Thomas Thariyan, 37, is one of 51 men to 
              be charged with having commercial sex with the minor. He is the third 
              man to contest the charges, following Swiss national Juerg Buergin and 
              business consultant Edward Whistler Goh.</p>
              <p>District Judge Eugene Teo ordered that part of the trial on Wednesday be held in camera or in chambers.</p>
              <p>This follows the prosecution's application that the girl, a vulnerable witness, should give evidence in closed court.</p>
              <p>They said that online forums have published information pertaining to her identity despite gag orders issued by the court.</p>
              <p>They argued that she is "susceptible to emotional injury", adding that she is a victim of a sexual crime.</p>
              <p>The prosecution pointed out while it was a fact that the girl was a "social escort", she was only 17 at the time of the events.</p>
              <p>Thariyan's
               defence lawyer however strongly objected to the in camera application, 
              arguing that under the Women's Charter, this applies to those under 16.</p>
              <p>The girl is now 20.</p>
              <p>However the judge, who has discretion in granting such applications, agreed with the prosecution.</p>
              <p>The
               court on Tuesday heard evidence from witnesses including 
              representatives from SingTel, Hotel 81, as well as an officer from the 
              Technology Crime Forensic Branch.</p>
              <p>The trial continues.</p>

              <div>
              <p>SINGAPORE: The case of the third man claiming trial in the online sex vice ring will continue at a later date.</p>
              <p>This
               comes after a pre-trial conference was called on Thursday for lawyers 
              involved in 37-year-old Emlyn Thomas Thariyan's trial to decide on 
              administrative matters.</p>
              <p>This includes coming up with a list of witnesses for the trial.</p>
              <p>The Singapore Armed Forces Lieutenant Colonel is accused of having paid sex with an underage girl in 2011.</p>
              <p>A large part of the trial on Wednesday was heard in-camera or in closed chambers.</p>
              <p>This was after the court granted the prosecution's request to protect the woman's identity.</p>
              <p>Earlier
               on Thursday, Thariyan's lawyer, S Skandarajah, asked the court to allow
               Thariyan's brother and bailor to sit in during the in-camera hearings.</p>
              <p>Mr Skandarajah cited that the two were "concerned parties" in the case.</p>
              <p>Deputy Public Prosecutor Kavitha Uthrapathy objected to the application, saying that was not a valid reason.</p>
              <p>The court did not grant Mr Skanarajah's application.</p>
              <p>The trial dates will be finalised after the pre-trial conference.</p>
