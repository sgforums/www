              prostitute in the online vice ring case are expected to plead guilty.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>They are Louis Lee Lip Kian, 33; Chiang Meng Chuan, 31; Pyi Kyaw Han, 31, and Wilson Oei, 25.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>They allegedly paid the under-aged girl between S$450 and S$650 for sex at various hotels in 2010.<br><br>Chiang,
               who is represented by Mr Shankar Alan allegedly paid the under-aged 
              girl between S$500 and S$600 for sex on two occasions at Hotel 81 
              Bencoolen in September 2010.<br><br>Oei, who is represented by Mr Chen 
              Chee Yen is also accused of paying the girl between S$450 and S$500 for 
              sex at the same hotel.<br><br>Chiang and Oei will plead guilty on June 27.<br><br>The
               other two men, Lee, represented by Mr Amolat Singh, and Pyi, 
              represented by Mr James Sebastian will plead guilty on July 9 and 12 
              respectively.<br><br>The men were part of the 45 cases heard in court behind closed doors on Monday.<br><br>Thirteen out of the 48 charged are claiming trial while 27 are still undecided.<br><br>More than 25 lawyers, including criminal lawyer Mr Subhas Anandan, turned up to represent their clients.<br><br>One of them said all 10 of his clients will claim trial.<br><br>"All
               are taking a uniform, united stand. They will all come on the same day.
               If there will be a trial, there will be different dates and the girl 
              will have to come on many occasions to testify," said Mr Anandan.<br><br>The girl cannot be named because of a court gag order and some lawyers representing the men have criticised this.<br><br>But the court upheld its decision.<br><br>Mr
               Anandan said: "The prosecution applied for a gag order. We objected to 
              it on the basis that the provisions of the law do not protect people 
              like her, because she is not a victim of rape or molest. But the judge 
              has already given a gag order before so he said he will stick to it. I 
              told him that I will respect his decision though I may not agree with 
              him."<br><br>The first to plead guilty in the high profile case is 
              former principal Lee Lip Hong, who was sentenced in April and was given 
              nine weeks' jail.<br><br>He was released on June 8 for good behaviour after serving six weeks behind bars.<br><br>A total of 48 men were charged in April for having paid sex with a minor.<br><br>Two more cases will be heard next week.<br><br>- CNA/fa</span></span></p>

              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>In the prosecution's
               submissions, it stated that the offence warrants a custodial sentence 
              and urged the court to mete out a three-month jail term to Shaw.<br><br>The prosecution said the minor involved is "worthy" of protection as stated under the law.<br><br>Adding
               that the extent of the culpability depends on whether Shaw tried to 
              verify the minor's age, the prosecution pointed out the accused took 
              absolutely no steps to ascertain the girl's age. <br> <br>The 
              prosecution said having done nothing to ascertain the girl's age yet the
               defence asked for a non-custodial sentence is something that "cannot be
               done".<br><br>If the minor refuses to show documents to confirm her age, the prosecution said a patron should walk away "as due diligence".<br><br>However
               one may view the minor's actions, the prosecution also said the focus 
              should be on Shaw's actions and a deterrent sentence is called for.<br><br>But
               defence lawyer Harpeet Singh Nehal pointed out the girl was about 17 
              years and seven months old at the time of the offence, five months short
               of the legal age of 18.<br><br>With no criminal intent and pre-meditation, he said Shaw made an "honest and reasonable mistake".<br><br>The reasonable mistake was that the minor showed no signs of her age, either in appearance or behaviour.<br><br>Mr
               Nehal added "there was fraudulent misrepresentation in this case", as 
              the minor "colluded" with the pimp to hide her real age.<br><br>He added that the minor was neither coerced into having sex nor was she a victim of human trafficking.<br><br>Given the circumstances, Mr Nehal asked for a conditional discharge or a fine.<br><br>But
               this cut no ice with the district judge See Kee Oon, who laid out two 
              key areas in his consideration of the sentence - the relevance of due 
              diligence of Shaw in ascertaining the girl's age and whether he 
              committed an honest and reasonable mistake as claimed by the defence.<br><br>On
               Shaw's claims that he was convinced from the website profile of the 
              girl and from her behaviour and demeanour that he believed her to be of 
              age, the judge said "perception is subjective and prone to error and 
              bias".<br><br>While the district judge said Shaw was looking for 
              services from an 18 year-old and that he was honestly mistaken, he 
              pointed out that Shaw never asked about the girl's age.<br><br>The judge also said Shaw should not have been guided by his "subjective belief".<br><br>"He chose not to ask. He had allowed himself to be deceived."<br><br>He added that the girl's conduct, even if fraudulent, should not be used to assess Shaw's.<br><br>Mr Harpeet Singh has indicated in court that his client intends to appeal against the decision.<br><br>Shaw will be out on bail of S$10,000 pending appeal.<br><br>He is the second of the 51 men to be dealt with in the online vice ring crackdown.<br><br>In
               April, former principal of Pei Chun Public School, Lee Lip Hong was 
              sentenced to nine weeks' jail for a similar offence with the same 
              underage girl.<br><br>The 39-year-old was released from Changi Prison in June after serving six weeks' jail.<br><br>The early remission was because of his good behaviour.<br><br>-CNA/ac/ck</span></span></p>

               in response, Deputy Public Prosecutor Peggy Pao argued that Chiang only
               "relied on the bare representation of her age and did not verify her

              claim that the girl's supposed "immoral" actions were relevant and 
              should be taken into account during mitigation.<br> <br>He added that 
              this would "wrongly shift the sentencing court's focus to the character
