              <p> </p>
              <p>I think the higher age for commercial sex is probably a buffer against abuse and sex trafficking cases. Sex workers, teenagers in particular, are vulnerable to those in a position of authority over them. Also, age of consent for non-commercial sex at 16 is fine considering majority of sexual encounters occur between peers so this circumvents the issue of power. </p>

              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>35-year-old Tan Kok 
              Wee, a former Singapore Armed Forces personnel, was sentenced to 12 
              weeks' jail for having paid sex with the girl, who was 17 years old at 
              the time.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The court heard that
               Tan had come across her services online and contacted her pimp Tan Boon
               Thiew on October 22, 2010. Tan then met the girl at Hotel 81 Bencoolen

               is one of 54 men implicated in the online vice ring case. He is a 
              first-time offender and will start serving his sentence on Friday.<br><br>The
               prosecution called for Tan's sentence to be in line with three other 
              men who have already received similar sentences for the same offence, as
               the facts of the case are similar.<br><br>Ex-police officer Tan Wee

              <p><strong>Two jailed for paid sex with underage girl</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Two more men have been sentenced to jail for having paid sex with an underage girl.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Louis Lee Lip Kian, 
              33, and Pyi Kyaw Han, 31, each received 12 weeks' jail on Monday, 
              bringing to 10 the total number of people sentenced so far in an online 
              vice ring saga involving 51 men.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>In his mitigation 
              plea, Lee's lawyer, Mr Amolat Singh, said Lee was misled by the 
              representations on the website about the girl's age. <br><br>He said Lee did not ask about her age as he "honestly and reasonably" thought she was above 18 years old. <br><br>The
               former relationship manager with a bank also thought she had shown an 
              intellectual, mental and physical age well beyond her years. <br><br>He 
              was thus "shell-shocked" to discover that she was 17 at the time when he
               paid her S$500 for sex in a hotel at Bencoolen Street on November 20, 
              2010. <br><br>Pyi's lawyer, Mr James Sebastian, said that while his 
              client had asked about the girl's age, she claimed that she was a 
              final-year student in a tertiary school. <br><br>Her physical appearance also supported his impression.<br><br>Mr Sebastian said that Pyi had absolutely no intention to break the law and was shocked to learn of his inadvertent breach. <br><br>Pyi,
               who was then a director of a company dealing in security, had felt 
              "cheated" and "victimised" by the representations on the website about 
              her age. <br><br>He paid the girl S$650 for sex on December 21, 2010 in a hotel at Bencoolen Street.<br><br>In sentencing, Senior District Judge See Kee Oon said deterrence remains the primary consideration. <br><br>He
               noted that both men did not set out knowingly or deliberately to 
              exploit a minor and that they had pleaded guilty at an early stage, 
              expressed remorse and accepted responsibility for their conduct. <br><br>- CNA/cc</span></span></p>

              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Lee Vin Sen has been sentenced to ten weeks jail.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The 36-year-old pleaded guilty to paying the girl S$450 for sex at Marina Bay Sands Hotel on 23 September 2010.   <br><br>He is the 13th man to be sentenced for having paid sex with an underage girl in a high-profile online vice ring case. <br><br>District Judge Chay Yuen Fatt called Lee an "accidental client".   <br><br>Lee's
               lawyer, Ms Lim Kim Hong, said her client did not "actively go online 
              looking for sexual services," nor was he involved in the booking of the 
              girl and the hotel.   <br><br>She highlighted that it was Lee's friend instead, who had contacted the girl's pimp and arranged a tryst with her.  <br><br>Lee came into the picture after his friend lost money at a casino and was unable to pay for the girl's services.  <br><br>The father-of-two agreed and proceeded to have sex with the girl, who was 17 years old at that time.   <br><br>Ms Lim added that Lee had acted in a moment of folly and was "very remorseful".  <br><br>The
               court also heard that Lee has been "mentally unstable" since he was 
              charged and has been "receiving treatment for the past six months." <br><br>Noting
               that Lee was not actively involved in the booking of the girl, the 
              judge said that Lee's culpability was "a shade lesser."  <br><br>A second man was also sentenced for a similar offence.  <br><br>37-year-old
               businessman Lee Ching Hsuin, was jailed 12 weeks for paying the same 
              girl S$500 for sex at a hotel at Lavender Street on 6 November 2010. <br><br>Under Singapore law, it is an offence to have paid sex with a girl below 18 years of age.  <br><br>- CNA/xq</span></span></p>

              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: An accounts executive was sentenced to 11 weeks' jail
               on Tuesday for having paid sex with an underage girl in the 
              high-profile online vice ring case. </span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Choong Sin Jian, 28,
               a Singapore Permanent Resident, faced two charges but the prosecution 
              proceeded with one charge, and took the other into consideration. </span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The court heard that
               Choong paid $650 on two occasions in January last year, for the sexual 
              services of the girl, who was then 17 years old.  <br><br>The offences took place at the Strand Hotel in Bencoolen Street.<br><br>Choong
               is one of 51 men brought to court for having paid sex with the girl, 
              who was described as an 18-year-old on a website run by a pimp, Tang 
              Boon Thiew.<br><br>Choong had sent a text message to Tang requesting the girl's services.<br><br>He is the 15th man implicated in this case to be jailed. <br><br>Sentences meted out so far have ranged between nine and 13 weeks.<br><br>Choong's
               lawyer Mr Peter Fernando asked the court for either a fine or a 
              pre-sentence report, as his client was extremely remorseful, and was a 
              first-time offender.<br><br>He added that Choong had been deceived into 
              believing the girl was 18 years old, and that his client had already 
              lost his job as a result of his involvement in the case.<br><br>Mr Fernando also noted that the girl was only two months shy of her 18th birthday at the time the offences were committed.<br><br>But
               Senior District Judge See Kee Oon said this did not absolve Choong from
               liability, as he chose not to exercise due diligence.<br><br>Deputy Public Prosecutor Ramesh Ethan Ananda earlier told the court that Choong did not ask the girl for her age.<br><br>Senior
               District Judge See then noted that Choong had been the one to initiate 
              the transactions, and had not chosen to plead guilty at an early stage.<br><br>Still,
               he accepted that Choong had not deliberately or actively sought out an 
              underage prostitute, and was unlikely to re-offend.<br><br>"General deterrence remains the primary consideration on the facts of this case," he said.<br><br>Choong could have been jailed up to seven years and fined.<br><br>- CNA/de</span></span></p>

              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: The pimp behind the online vice ring scandal involving an underage girl appeared in court on Thursday.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Tang Boon Thiew, 39,
               pleaded guilty to 20 charges, including living in part on the earnings 
              of prostitutes, as well as abetting men in obtaining the sexual services
               of the girl, who was then 17 years old. </span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>He had 82 other charges taken into consideration.<br><br>A total of 51 men have been charged for having paid sex with the girl, and 16 of them have been dealt with.<br><br>The
               court heard that Tang ran a social escort agency where some of the 
              women, including the 17-year-old girl, provided sexual services to the 
              clients.<br><br>He would take a 50-per cent cut of what the women earned. <br><br>According
               to court documents, Tang secured about 698 bookings for 17 escorts 
              between September 2010 and November 2011. He received over $185,700 in 
              prostitution earnings from them.<br><br>The then underage girl worked for Tang between September 2010 and February 2011. <br><br>Sometime
               in September 2010, Tang obtained the girl's mobile phone number from 
              her previous modelling agency and asked if she wanted to "earn good 
              money". <br><br>She agreed to take on the job, and on a separate 
              occasion, met him at Hotel 81 in Chinatown, where he booked a room and 
              proceeded to take photographs of her in her lingerie, as well as in the 
              nude. <br><br>After he photographed her, he asked her to give him oral sex and then paid her $50.<br><br>During
               that time, Tang secured 82 bookings for the girl, and received about 
              $21,700 from her earnings. She provided sexual services for between $450
               and $850 per session.<br><br>Tang knew she wasn't 18 but told her not to disclose her real age to her clients.  <br><br>He also did not come clean to clients who asked about the girl's age.<br><br>Tang will be sentenced on January 11.<br><br>Shashi
               Nathan, lawyer of Tang Boon Thiew, said: "Obviously, the whole 
              prosecution, the trial, the sentencing has taken a lot out of him. I 
              think to some extent, he wants to get this over and done with. I think 
              he's willing to face his responsibilities, he wants to serve sentence, 
              so he's hoping to resolve this as soon as possible."<br><br>- CNA/ac/de</span></span></p>

              <p><strong>Pimp for underage prostitute gets jail term &amp; fine</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: The pimp of an underage girl at the centre of an 
              online vice ring, Tang Boon Thiew, has been sentenced to four years and 
              10 months in jail and fined S$90,000.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Tang, 39, appealed against the sentence immediately after he was sentenced on Friday afternoon.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>He had pleaded 
              guilty to 20 charges, which included living in part on the earnings of 
              prostitutes and abetting men in obtaining the sexual services of the 
              girl, who was then 17 years old.<br><br>Eighty-two other charges were taken into consideration.<br><br>Senior
               District Judge See Kee Oon said Tang had no mitigating factors, other 
              than his plea of guilt. He said Tang had no qualms manipulating and 
              deceiving potential clients and went to great lengths to ensure that the
               clients of the underage girl won't know what her real age was.<br><br>Tang
               was offered bail but the amount was doubled - from S$80,000 to 
              S$160,000. Channel NewsAsia understands he's able to raise the bail 
              amount.<br><br>Tang ran a social escort agency where some of the women, 
              including the 17-year-old girl, provided sexual services to the clients.<br><br>He pocketed 50 per cent of their earnings.<br><br>Between September 2010 and November 2011, he secured nearly 700 bookings for 17 escorts.<br><br>During that period, he earned more than S$185,700 from them.<br><br>From the 17-year-old girl alone, Tang received about S$21,700 of her earnings.  <br><br>He
               obtained the underage girl's mobile phone number from her previous 
              modelling agency and asked if she wanted to "earn good money".<br><br>He reportedly told her not to disclose to clients that she was 17 years old. <br><br>The
               court had also heard that Tang moved from being the Southeast Asia head
               of the marketing team in Internet giant Yahoo! to becoming an online 
              pimp.<br><br>His clients included the 51 men who were charged with paying the underage girl for sex.<br><br>Sixteen
               of them have been dealt with, including former Pei Chun Public School 
              principal Lee Lip Hong and green activist Howard Shaw.<br><br>- CNA/ck</span></span></p>
