              <p><strong>MOE releases guidelines on how external vendors conduct sex education programmes</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Education (MOE) has released
              guidelines which external vendors conducting sexuality education
              programmes in schools will have to adhere to.
              <br> <br> The vendors are also required to submit their policy statement on sexuality education.
              <br> <br> The statement must cover five areas, including homosexuality, abortion and pre-marital sex.
              <br> <br> The guidelines were listed on the government's electronic procurement system.
              <br> <br>All current providers of such programmes will also have to submit
              their applications by October 19. If not, they'll not be allowed to
              continue providing such programmes.
              <br> <br>The move follows the ministry's decision to tighten its processes
              to vet and approve external agencies allowed to provide sexuality
              education in schools, in the wake of the AWARE controversy.
              <br> <br> Prior to the AWARE saga, schools had the autonomy to hire external vendors for their sexuality education programmes. 
              <br> <br> But now, they will have to choose from a list that's vetted and approved by the ministry.
              <br> <br> There were concerns that AWARE's sexuality education programme had promoted homosexuality. 
              <br> <br>Interested vendors will also have to demonstrate their track record
              and relevant experience in working with children and youths in
              sexuality-related areas.
              <br> <br>The bid specifications state that the programmes are meant to
              augment school resources for sexuality education and not to replace
              sexuality educations programmes in schools.
              <br> <br> Bidders must also ensure that the teaching of facts is integrated with the teaching of mainstream values.
              <br> <br>In addition, MOE wants students to understand and respect the
              attitudes, values and beliefs regarding sexuality in the context of
              Singapore's multi-religious and multi-racial society.
              <br> <br>Once the submission of bids closes later this month, MOE will
              undertake a vetting process which is expected to take up to two months.
              Successful bidders could start providing their sexuality education
              programmes as early as next January.
              <br> <br> AWARE has yet to comment on whether it plans to submit an application or if it has already done so. </span></p>
