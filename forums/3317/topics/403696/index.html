              <p>A PRIMARY school janitor was making his rounds when he found that he could not open the door of a classroom.</p>
              <p>When he forced the door open, he was greeted by a shocking sight.</p>
              <p>In front of him, sprawled on the teacher's desk, were two teenagers - stark naked.</p>
              <p>Mr Siew Teng Cheok, 72, ended up being punched in the eye when he tried to stop the boy from escaping.</p>
              <p>The janitor at Tao Nan School in Marine Crescent told The New Paper yesterday that he chanced upon the teenage couple during a routine check of the classrooms at about 5.30pm on Monday.</p>
              <p>He said they looked no more than 19 years old.</p>
              <p>Mr Siew would usually open the door to each classroom and look inside to make sure that no student had been left behind.</p>
              <p>When he reached a second-floor classroom in a quieter corner of the block, he found that its door was stuck.</p>
              <p>After forcing it open, he realised that a chair had been used to prevent it from opening.</p>
              <p>That's when he saw the naked couple.</p>
              <p>When they saw him, the youth darted off the table while the girl hid behind it.</p>
              <p>Said Mr Siew in Mandarin: "I got a shock when I saw a naked man jump down from the table. He looked like an apeman. I could have had a heart attack.</p>
              <p>"I told them, 'This is a school, you can't do such things.' The boy said to me, 'Uncle, don't interfere.'"</p>
              <p>The youth told the girl to get dressed and then ran to the classroom door still naked.</p>
              <p>Mr Siew wanted to lock the intruders in the room but before he could find the key, the boy had reached the door.</p>
              <p>The two of them got into a tussle at the door with Mr Siew trying to close it and the boy preventing him from doing so.</p>
              <p>The girl, who had got dressed, slipped out of the room while her friend held on to the door.</p>
              <p>"I just stood back and let the girl go," said Mr Siew.</p>
              <p>The boy then went back in and got dressed.</p>
              <p>Dress quickly</p>
              <p>Mr Siew said the teenagers wore plain white T-shirts and black sports shorts.</p>
              <p>He saw a logo on the bottom left corner of their shorts but could not make out the English words.</p>
              <p>Mr Siew then took out his mobile phone to call the school's operation manager.</p>
              <p>"The boy probably thought I was trying to take his photo and he snatched my phone,"he said.</p>
              <p>The youth then fled from the classroom.</p>
              <p>"He ran downstairs but he could not get out as the door (on that side of the building) was locked, so he came back up,"Mr Siew said.</p>
              <p>"He was carrying a backpack so I held on to it as he ran past me. I told him, 'Give me back my phone.'"</p>
              <p>The boy, who was holding Mr Siew's phone in his right hand, threw it on the floor, turned around and punched MrSiew with his left fist.</p>
              <p>The punch landed on Mr Siew's left eye.</p>
              <p>"I fell after he hit me. My left eye was in pain and when I felt it, I realised it was bleeding.</p>
              <p>"I then shouted, 'Someone hit me. Someone hit me.'"</p>
              <p>A female teacher who was conducting an enrichment class in a second-floor classroom heard his shouts and went to his aid.</p>
              <p>He was taken to the school office and the police were called.</p>
              <p>A police spokesman confirmed the incident.</p>
              <p>Said the spokesman: "A man in his early 70s was conveyed to Changi General Hospital with injuries. Police investigations are ongoing."</p>
              <p>Mr Siew received outpatient treatment and has been resting at home since Monday.</p>
              <p>Aside from his bruised eye, he suffered abrasions on his right elbow and a slight bruise to his right knee when he fell.</p>
              <p>When contacted, a spokesman for the school said it was not in a position to disclose any information.</p>
