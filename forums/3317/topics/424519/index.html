              <p>Kuala Lumpur (The Star/ANN) - Singapore and Hong Kong have been 
              ranked among the most popular global destination to relocate to, with 
              100 percent of professional women surveyed saying they would recommend 
              working there to others.</p>
              <p>Women are increasingly considering these locations because of the low
               crime rate, tax incentives, excellent lifestyle, and opportunities for 
              personal development in the region.</p>
              <p>In the global survey, respondents placed Singapore joint fifth with 
              Canada in ranking the most popular destinations (after the US, UK, 
              Australia and Switzerland) and Hong Kong was joint sixth with France and
               the UAE.</p>
              <p>The Global Professionals on the Move Report 2011, commissioned by 
              the Hydrogen Group and conducted by a consultancy project team from ESCP
               Europe, analyses responses from 2,637 professionals from 85 different 
              countries with qualifications of a bachelor degree or above.</p>
              <p>With the majority of respondents - 91 percent - already working 
              abroad or looking to do so, the survey offers unique insights into the 
              experiences, attitudes, motivations and priorities of highly qualified, 
              high earning, professionals from around the world on working overseas.</p>
              <p>Simon Walker, Hydrogen Asia Regional Managing Director, said, "94 
              percent of the overall survey respondents who'd moved to Asia said their
               living conditions had improved with the move and 86 percent had 
              improved their salary as a result of moving here.</p>
              <p>The report confirms working overseas to be an extremely positive 
              experience and offers fresh insight into factors affecting the number of
               women progressing in business.</p>
              <p>The report highlights that they are not getting as much 
              international experience as men, which hinders their career progression,
               despite international companies actively seeking out their talents.</p>
              <p>"We've noticed an increase in the number of women from overseas taking advantage of the career opportunities offered here.</p>
              <p>"Banking sectors in particular are looking to source experienced female professionals from a global talent pool."</p>
              <p>Simon explained that many global firms were setting up headquarters 
              in Singapore, or expanding their operations to include branch offices in
               South-East Asia.</p>
              <p>With 42% of Singapore's population made up of expats and overseas 
              students, it's not surprising that 80 percent of the professionals 
              surveyed found it easy to settle in and make new friends.</p>
              <p>"The culture of inclusion is strong here, and new global recruits 
              are warmly welcomed. Our female candidates tell us that lifestyle and 
              settling in quickly is just as important to them as improving their 
              salary. South-East Asia ticks all the boxes," said Abigail Waudby, 
              Hydrogen Asia Director.</p>
              <p>Tim Smeaton, Chief Executive Officer of Hydrogen Group, said, "We 
              are seeing companies in South-East Asia planning their workforces 
              strategically to incorporate the new global culture of working.</p>
              <p>They recognise the need for gender diversity and equality, and also 
              realise that by employing professional women from a global talent pool, 
              they are future-proofing their business.</p>
              <p>"We envisage global mobility will play a greater role in people's 
              career decisions moving forward and produce the report to determine 
              shifts in candidate perceptions of overseas working.</p>
              <p>"We've moved 40 of our own employees around our global offices in 
              the last 18 months, so we understand the issues faced by both our 
              candidates and clients when advising them about relocation," he said.</p>
