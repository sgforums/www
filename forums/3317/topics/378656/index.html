              <div class="content">
              <p>WASHINGTON (AFP) - – The
              White House has gone on the offensive against its critics in the press,
              singling out Fox News and going so far as to accuse the News
              Corp.-owned network of waging a "war against Barack Obama."</p>
              <p>White
              House Communications Director Anita Dunn has led the charge, appearing
              on CNN television and conducting interviews with Time magazine and The
              New York Times in recent days to make her case.</p>
              <p>The unusual
              White House campaign comes as President Obama faces mounting opposition
              to his health care reforms, growing concern over the situation in
              Afghanistan and a continuing general economic malaise.</p>
              <p>The
              president also suffered a setback recently when his personal effort to
              win approval for Chicago to host the 2016 Olympics was rejected and his
              Nobel Peace Prize has met with more barbs than bouquets.</p>
              <p>Speaking
              of media magnate Rupert Murdoch's Fox, Dunn told the Times in an
              interview published Monday: "Were going to treat them the way we would
              treat an opponent.</p>
              <p>"As they are undertaking a war against
              Barack Obama and the White House, we dont need to pretend that this is
              the way that legitimate news organizations behave," she said.</p>
              <p>In
              comments just days earlier to Time magazine, Dunn, a veteran Democratic
              Party communications strategist who joined the White House in May,
              denounced Fox as "opinion journalism masquerading as news."</p>
              <p>"They are boosting their audience. But that doesn't mean we are going to sit back," she said.</p>
              <p>Appearing
              on CNN on Sunday, Dunn said "the reality of it is that Fox News often
              operates almost as either the research arm or the communications arm of
              the Republican Party."</p>
              <p>Dunn said the White House would not be a "passive bystander" as opponents try to "tear down the president and his presidency."</p>
              <p>"We will push back," she said.</p>
              <p>The
              push back has included a blog post on WhiteHouse.gov in which the White
              House denounced what it called "Fox lies" and "an attempt to smear the
              administration's efforts to win the Olympics for the United States."</p>
              <p>The
              White House blog singled out Glenn Beck, a conservative talk show host
              on Fox, for criticism, saying his program "has shown that nothing is
              worthy of respect if it can be used as part of a partisan attack to
              boost ratings."</p>
              <p>Beck has been a relentless critic of the Obama
              administration and labelled the president a "racist" in a July
              appearance on another Fox program.</p>
              <p>"This guy is, I believe, a
              racist," Beck said, adding that Obama, America's first black president,
              has a "deep-seated hatred for white people."</p>
              <p>Larry Sabato,
              director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia, said
              the White House may be lashing out at Fox "because the Democratic base
              is starting to be more critical of Obama.</p>
              <p>"The world was
              expected to be transformed in approximately a month and it just didn't
              quite happen that way," Sabato said. "So if you're in that position and
              you need to rally your base, you need to find a common enemy.</p>
              <p>"They're
              going on the offensive to rally the base and the base will rally to
              them because they hate the 'right-wing noise machine' too," he said.
              "Everyone needs an enemy in politics. Everyone needs a devil figure."</p>
              <p>The
              White House offensive against Fox comes despite a reported meeting last
              month between senior Obama adviser David Axelrod and Fox News chairman
              and chief executive officer Roger Ailes.</p>
              <p>Political news website
              Politico said Axelrod and Ailes met to discuss news coverage and the
              relationship between the White House and the network.</p>
              <p>Fox,
              asked by AFP for a reaction to the White House criticisms, pointed to
              statements made by senior Fox executives to the Times and CNN.</p>
              <p>"Instead
              of governing, the White House continues to be in campaign mode, and Fox
              News is the target of their attack mentality," said Michael Clemente,
              senior vice president for news at the Fox News Channel.</p>
              <p>"Perhaps the energy would be better spent on the critical issues that voters are worried about," he said.</p>
              <p>Clemente also noted that Fox programming is a mixture of news and opinion.</p>
              <p>"So,
              with all due respect to anyone who still might be confused about the
              difference between news reporting and vibrant opinion, my suggestion
              would be to talk about the stories and the facts rather than attack the
              messenger ... which over time, has never worked," he said.</p>
