              <p><strong>Are Singapore teachers overworked?</strong></p>
              <p>Many people call it one of the most under-appreciated career choices 
              in Singapore today.</p>
              <p>In a forum letter in <em>The Straits Times</em> on 15 May 2010, a 
              teacher’s wife, Ms Aishah Quek chronicles her husband’s typical work 
              day. She bemoans her husband’s punishing workload and questions the 
              seeming non-existence of a work-life balance.</p>
              <p>A teacher in a local primary school, Ms Quek’s husband wakes up at 
              5am every weekday, and leaves home by 6am, to reach school in time for 
              morning ‘guard duty’ at 7am. After remedial lessons, co-curricular 
              activities and administrative duties, her husband reaches home at 8pm 
              for dinner, before, surprise, surprise, he starts to work from home.</p>
              <p>If these normal working hours are representative of a typical day in 
              the life of a teacher, do teachers; the people who play an integral role
               in shaping young, impressionable minds, have sufficient time to relax 
              and recharge, before the next day comes around?</p>
              <p>A student in the morning session has about 6 hours of lessons per day
               (from 7.30am to 1pm). But that’s just about the time a teacher’s 
              after-teaching hours begin.</p>
              <p>“On a typical day, we mark assignments, conduct remedial lessons and 
              complete many administrative tasks, which often extend long beyond our 
              official working hours,” said John*, 35, a married primary school 
              teacher with a one-year-old son.</p>
              <p>Another educator, Seline*, 27, who called it quits after three years,
               said, “When my husband and I were both teaching, we hardly had any 
              quality time in the evenings because we’d both be busy marking 
              assignments, preparing for the next day’s lessons or just be too tired.”</p>
              <p>Added another teacher, Lionel*, “I already feel drained by the time I
               start marking my students’ work after 5pm. This increases the 
              likelihood of making errors.”</p>
              <p>KJ*, 23, a fresh graduate from the National Institute of Education, knows that the 
              teaching road ahead may not be an easy one.</p>
              <p>“I believe we just need to find a balance, set our priorities and 
              hope our senior colleagues will share tips with us on how best to handle
               different situations,” she said.</p>
              <p>My informal survey revealed that most teachers joined the profession 
              to pursue their passion to equip the young with knowledge, and 
              invaluable life skills. However, teachers today are feeling the strain.</p>
              <p>Are our teachers overworked? How do you think the Ministry of Education can help teachers have a 
              better work-life balance?<br></p>

              <p>this has been going on for years..</p>
              <p>my folks who were teachers, also worked like that.. but at that time, they had things like school holidays to recover although they were called back occasionally during the school holidays..</p>
              <p>these days, it's much worse for the teachers as they are made to go back during the school holidays for a lot of stuff...</p>
              <p>i remember because mom used to come home with shitloads of worksheets and test papers which my sister and i sometimes helped by marking the multiple choice questions..</p>
