              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Foreign worker levies were raised in last year's Budget. All the changes would have been implemented next July.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Depending on the 
              sector companies are in and how reliant they are on foreign workers, 
              companies will pay between 250 and 750 dollars more in levies per 
              worker.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>To reduce dependency on foreign workers, companies are being urged to raise productivity.<br><br>In addition, they are encouraged to tap on older workers, back-to-work women, part timers and the disabled.<br><br>The Employment Act is also being reviewed in response to the needs of a changing workforce.<br><br>Phase
               one of the review is expected to be completed in 2013, and the second 
              phase will likely commence in the last quarter of next year.<br><br>The labour movement wants the Act to be extended to cover the growing numbers of professionals, managers and executives (PMEs). <br><br>Some have urged the government to be more flexible and adjust foreign worker numbers according to business conditions. <br><br>Analysts
               warn there could be more companies that will shift elsewhere, downsize 
              or even close down with the tightening measures. <br><br>Mech-Power is 
              one of many local companies that has endured the labour crunch. It moved
               a large part of it operations to Johor to cope.<br><br>Cliff Loke, 
              managing director of Mech-Power said: "Whenever we have an overload of 
              work, we just put out a (recruitment) banner outside the factory and we 
              get a lot of workers coming after us for the job. Also, the labour cost 
              is much cheaper than in Singapore."<br><br>Acting Manpower Minister Tan Chuan-Jin indicated the pace of labour restructuring will also be a factor in tightening measures.<br><br>"We
               will work with companies to transit and we will look at the various 
              measures in place and to see whether we will continue to tighten 
              (foreign labour). So, a lot depends on demand," said Mr Tan. <br><br>"Will
               demand ease off? Will restructuring take place? So this is something we
               will continue to track and we will continue to effect these levers (in 
              tightening labour) over time."<br><br>Policies are also being changed to improve the welfare and well-being of foreign workers.<br><br>Starting 1 January 2013, foreign domestic workers will get a mandatory day off.<br><br>Employment agencies said this can attract more foreign maids to work in Singapore.<br><br>"Singapore
               employers are very fearful of what the domestic workers are going to be
               doing on their (rest days). I think there's a fear factor they seem to 
              have, but  we need to trust the person who's working in our homes," said
               K Jayaprema, president of Association of Employment Agencies Singapore.<br><br>"What
               an employer can do is to guide these domestic workers. They can also 
              look at skills upgrading. There're so many courses available for these 
              domestic workers."<br><br>In November, 171 bus drivers from China went on strike. It was the first strike in 26 years in Singapore. <br><br>The drivers were unhappy about pay and living conditions.<br><br>The
               government considered the strike as an illegal one as public transport 
              is an essential service and sufficient notice of the intent to go on 
              strike is needed.<br><br>Observers believe Singapore's international reputation has not been dented.<br><br>"I
               think the long-term repercussion (of the strike) is quite minimum but 
              should another episode happen, then I'm not very sure," said Assoc Prof 
              Tan Khee Giap, co-director at Asia Competitiveness Institute.<br><br>To prevent such an episode from happening again, employers have been urged to review their grievance-handling procedures.<br><br>- CNA/xq</span></span></p>

              <p>we know we cannot fight other countries on labor cheapness.</p>
              <p>but we cannot afford to have too many cheap ones here, it will overpopulation and erode our social cohesion. we know tehre are other areas gahmen can do like adjust rental. we have limited space why cant we reclaim more space and land? we can do for jurong island and Tuas, why cant we do more?</p>
