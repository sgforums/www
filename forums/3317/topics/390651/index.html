              <p><span>SINGAPORE: The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) will lift
              the ban on the sale of structured notes for three financial
              institutions with effect from Friday. </span></p>
              <p><span>They are DBS Bank, Maybank and the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS),
              which were banned from selling structured notes for six months from
              last July in the wake of the Lehman Brothers Minibond scandal.
              <br> <br>They, along with several other financial institutions (FIs), were
              rapped for lapses in the sale of the structured products linked to
              failed investment bank Lehman Brothers.
              <br> <br> Some had misclassified the notes as low to medium risk when they were products carrying high risk.
              <br> <br>MAS had directed the FIs to rectify all the weaknesses uncovered by
              their investigations. They were also required to appoint an external
              party approved by the MAS to review their action plan and report on its
              implementation.
              <br> <br>"The three financial institutions (DBS Bank, Maybank, RBS) have
              publicly pledged their commitment to effectively implement various
              measures on an ongoing basis in order to deliver fair dealing outcomes
              to their customers," MAS said in a statement on Thursday.
              <br> <br>These include a review of their remuneration framework and
              enhancements to the sales and advisory process. The Board and senior
              management of the FIs will be held accountable for meeting this
              commitment.
              <br> <br>Tan Kin Lian, president of the Financial Services Consumers
              Association, said this concept is good as it means that FIs should be
              responsible for ensuring fair dealing outcomes.
              <br> <br>"But we need to have some clarity what would constitute fair, and
              what would constitute unfair. I would prefer that this should be made
              clearer, for example, very risky products should not be allowed to be
              sold," he said.
              <br> <br> But it seems like it's a case of once bitten, twice shy for some who got their fingers burnt by the Minibonds fiasco.
              <br> <br>"It's not easy. We don't understand (the product), unless you
              bother to read the whole book (prospectus). Unless MAS guarantees that
              if anything goes wrong, they pay, because it's a product they
              approved," said a former investor.
              <br> <br>As for the other FIs affected by the ban, MAS said DMG and Partners
              as well as UOB-Kay Hian have asked for additional time to work with
              their external parties to ensure that the enhanced measures put in
              place are sufficiently robust and in line with MAS requirements.
              <br> <br>Four other FIs - CIMB-GK Securities, Kim Eng Securities, OCBC
              Securities and Phillip Securities - are still serving out their ban
              period of one year.
              <br> <br> MAS said it will only lift the ban when it is satisfied with the measures they have put in place.
              <br> <br>Hong Leong Finance, which was slapped with a two-year ban, has
              since voluntarily stopped providing new financial advisory services
              including the sale of structured notes.
