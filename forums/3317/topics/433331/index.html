              <h1 class="storyheadline">Dad strayed 'due to wife's mental illness'</h1>
              <p>HIS wife's schizophrenia was a factor that led once-prominent 
              psychiatrist Wong Yip Chong to start a relationship with his then clinic
               assistant, who went on to become his long-time mistress, the High Court
               heard yesterday.</p>
              <p>Despite his relationship with Madam Patricia Ling Ai Wah, Dr Wong 
              promised his wife that he would not divorce her and that he would take 
              care of her.</p>
              <p>This emerged when the lawyer for Madam Ling's son with Dr Wong sought
               to show that because she had no legal rights, being 'the other woman', 
              the psychiatrist had reassured her that he would give her the house that
               is now at the centre of the suit.</p>
              <p>Dr Wong's sons from his wife - neurologist Meng Cheong, 54, 
              and locum general practitioner Meng Leong, 49 - have sued Madam Ling.</p>
              <p>They contend that Dr Wong, now 82 and suffering from 
              Alzheimer's disease, was mentally incapable of understanding a transfer 
              document he signed in 2004 making her joint owner of the Chancery Hill 
              Road house now valued at $7 million.</p>
              <p>They want the document declared null and void. 
              Alternatively, if the transfer was held to be valid, they want the 
              ownership of the house to be converted from a joint tenancy to a 
              tenancy-in-common.</p>

              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: The two sons of a psychiatrist disagree on how 
              seriously their father had been affected by Alzheimer's disease, the 
              High Court heard on Friday morning. They are testifying in a suit 
              involving a S$7 million Chancery Hill Road house, which belongs to their
               father, psychiatrist Dr Wong Yip Cheong, 81.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Proceedings entered its fifth day on Friday with his third son, psychiatrist Wong Meng Kong, 47, returning to the stand.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The court heard that
               in September 2000, he had sent an email to his father to tell him to 
              prepare himself for being unable to drive in three to four years' time 
              due to this condition. In the email, Meng Kong had also told his father 
              to find an alternative to being dependent on his long-time mistress, Mdm
               Ling Ai Wah.<br><br>When presented with the email in the High Court by 
              Senior Counsel Cavinder Bull on Friday morning, Meng Kong said he wrote 
              the email because of his father's memory impairment. Mr Bull is 
              representing Mr Wong Meng Weng, the son of Dr Wong and Mdm Ling.<br><br>Mr
               Bull then told Meng Kong that his elder brother, Dr Wong Meng Leong, 
              49, had certified their father fit to drive in 2001. When asked by Mr 
              Bull if Meng Leong got the diagnosis wrong, Meng Kong said that his 
              brother was "rather lenient in his assessment."<br><br>Meng Leong and 
              his elder brother, Dr Wong Meng Cheong, 54, are suing Mdm Ling and Meng 
              Weng over a 2004 document which their father signed to make Mdm Ling the
               joint owner of the house. The brothers want the transfer to be declared
               void and claim that Dr Wong had made the transfer under undue 
              influence.<br><br>-CNA/ac</span></span></p>

              <p><strong>Suit involving S$7m Chancery Hill Road house enters
              fifth day</strong></p>
              <p><span><span>SINGAPORE: The two sons of a psychiatrist disagree
              on how seriously their father had been affected by Alzheimer's
              disease, the High Court heard on Friday morning. They are
              testifying in a suit involving a S$7 million Chancery Hill Road
              house, which belongs to their father, psychiatrist Dr Wong Yip
              Cheong, 81.</span></span></p>
              <p><span><span>Proceedings entered its fifth day on Friday with his
              third son, psychiatrist Wong Meng Kong, 47, returning to the
              stand.</span></span></p>
              <p><span><span>The court heard that in September 2000, he had sent
              an email to his father to tell him to prepare himself for being
              unable to drive in three to four years' time due to this condition.
              In the email, Meng Kong had also told his father to find an
              alternative to being dependent on his long-time mistress, Mdm Ling
              Ai Wah.<br> <br> When presented with the email in the High Court by Senior Counsel
              Cavinder Bull on Friday morning, Meng Kong said he wrote the email
              because of his father's memory impairment. Mr Bull is representing
              Mr Wong Meng Weng, the son of Dr Wong and Mdm Ling.<br> <br> Mr Bull then told Meng Kong that his elder brother, Dr Wong Meng
              Leong, 49, had certified their father fit to drive in 2001. When
              asked by Mr Bull if Meng Leong got the diagnosis wrong, Meng Kong
              said that his brother was "rather lenient in his assessment."<br> <br> Meng Leong and his elder brother, Dr Wong Meng Cheong, 54, are
              suing Mdm Ling and Meng Weng over a 2004 document which their
              father signed to make Mdm Ling the joint owner of the house. The
              brothers want the transfer to be declared void and claim that Dr
              Wong had made the transfer under undue influence.<br> <br> -CNA/ac</span></span></p>

              <p><strong>Bid to void transfer of S$7 million Chancery Hill house dismissed</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: If he knew his two sons were taking his long-time 
              mistress to court in a tussle for his property, once-prominent 
              psychiatrist Wong Yip Cheong would be "heartbroken", a High Court judge 
              said on Monday.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>In dismissing a bid 
              by the plaintiffs to declare void their father's move to make Madam 
              Patricia Ling Ai Wah joint owner of a S$7 million property along 
              Chancery Hill Road, Justice Lai Siu Chiu noted that Dr Wong, 82, who now
               suffers from Alzheimer's disease, had lived there with her "as man and 
              wife" for almost 30 years.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Except in name, the 
              plaintiffs' mother, Madam Tan Kim Yam, has not been considered by Dr 
              Wong as his wife for the better part of 50 years, pointed out Justice 
              Lai at the conclusion of a 23-day hearing, during which the court heard 
              details of the relationship between Dr Wong and his two families.<br><br>The
               two plaintiffs, neurologist Meng Cheong, 54, and locum general 
              practitioner Meng Leong, 49, had contended that their father was already
               stricken with Alzheimer's disease and had been unduly influenced by Mdm
               Ling, 60, when he signed the transfer deed in December 2004. <br><br>They asked that the transfer be declared void or, failing which, for the joint ownership to be converted into a shared tenancy.<br><br>But
               Justice Lai noted that the evidence presented in court painted a 
              different picture. For instance, Dr Wong was still treating patients and
               generated some S$3 million in income for Adam Road Hospital, which he 
              had founded, that year.<br><br>The judge also criticised the plaintiffs for using Dr Wong's incapacity to "wrest as much of his assets as they could".<br><br>She
               removed Meng Cheong and Meng Leong from being members of the Committee 
              of Persons of the Person and Estate of Dr Wong, leaving the second 
              defendant, their half-brother Meng Weng, 35, as the only member.<br><br>But
               Justice Lai also made an unusual order: Mdm Ling's decisions concerning
               how Dr Wong would be cared for - whether to bring him home or send him 
              to hospital - would prevail, saying it was "only right" given their 
              relationship.<br><br>Meng Cheong, who had in 2006 obtained some 
              S$1million of his father's money as repayment of loans he had made to 
              him for his medical upkeep, was also ordered to refund the money to his 
              estate. <br><br>The two plaintiffs also have to pay all of Mdm Ling's legal costs out of their own pockets.</span></span></p>
