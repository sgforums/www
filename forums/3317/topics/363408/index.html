              <p><strong><span class="newsTitle">Apple announces new model and operating system for iPhone</span></strong></p>
              <p>Apple aims to make hot-selling iPhones even more appealing,
              premiering a speedier new model complete with a video camera and
              slashing the price of its predecessor to 99 US dollars.</p>
              <p>Apple vice president of marketing Phil Schiller made the
              announcements at an annual Worldwide Developers Conference in San
              Francisco bereft of any sign of the firm's renowned chief executive,
              Steve Jobs.<br> <br> Mr Schiller said the new iPhone 3-G-S, the first model to capture video, will be available on June 19th.</p>
              <p>He said a 16-gigabyte iPhone 3GS would cost 199 US dollars while the 32-gigabyte model would cost 299 dollars.</p>
              <p>Mr Schiller also said a next-generation iPhone 3.0 operating system
              will be released worldwide on June 17th as a free upgrade to owners of
              the smartphones.</p>
              <p>Enhancements include voice command, downloading rented videos, and
              customization to additional languages including Arabic, Hebrew, and
              Korean.</p>
              <p>The new operating system also lets iPhones connect to one another
              wirelessly for communal activities such as playing games, making them a
              bigger threat to Sony's PSP handheld gaming devices.</p>

              <p>The telco says it will announce pricing plans for the smartphone early next week.<br> The firm began offering the device in Australia through its unit, Optus, last week.</p>
              <p>The iPhone 3GS, which went on sale June 19th in eight countries

              <p><strong><span class="newsTitle">SingTel lowers price of Apple iPhone 3G S</span></strong></p>
              <div>
              <p>Telecommunications giant Singtel says its new
              Apple iPhone 3G S, which goes on sale this Friday, will cost less than
              its predecessor.</p>
              <p>In fact, it will be given free to those who sign up for a high-end plan costing 205 dollars a month.</p>
              <p>But for customers who opt for a lower priced plan, costing 39 dollars a month, the phone will be priced at 678 dollars.</p>
              <p>Last August, Singtel sold the iPhone 3G for up to 848 dollars.</p>
              <p>However, the telco says those who bought the previous model could
              trade it in for the new handset without having their contracts extended.</p>
              <p>Their existing handsets will have a trade-in value of up to $400.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, Singtel says it’s also cutting the price of the 8GB
              iPhone 3G to 398 dollars, making it the one of the lowest entry prices
              for touchscreen smartphones.</p>

              <p><strong><span class="newsTitle">New iPhone 3GS has landed in Singapore</span></strong></p>
              <p>The wait is over for fans of the Apple iPhone.</p>
              <p>The new and improved iPhone 3GS has been released in Singapore.</p>
              <p>And some fans were so eager to get their hands on the new handset, they queued eleven hours for it.</p>
              <p><strong><em>Jeremy Koh</em></strong> tells us more.</p>
              <p>No, it's not Hello Kitty.</p>
              <p>And no, it's not Singapore Idol.</p>
              <p>The hundreds of people outside the SingTel Comcentre were queueing to get their hands on the new iPhone 3GS.</p>
              <p>And among them is 29-year-old Jackson Low, who started queueing at 9am.</p>
              <p>That's a full eleven hours before he finally got his hands on the handset.</p>
              <p>"I took a day leave to come down today. I feel that i want to
                  upgrade my phone and i want to get the best first, so i get up earlier
                  this year."</p>
              <p>Second in line was 20-year-old Kenberlyn Chen.</p>
              <p>To pass the time, she chatted with the others in line.</p>
              <p>And they got on so well that they've made plans to stay in touch.</p>
              <p>"We in fact took turns to go for lunch and took breaks. We're
                  actually forming a group on facebook so we can stay connected and
                  discuss the features of the phone."</p>
              <p>Others were in the queue for, well, more romantic reasons.</p>
              <p>"I'm queuing for my fiance, i'm being a good person for her, helping
                  her. I know she'll appreciate it, she might even buy me dinner."</p>
              <p>Singtel, which is the handset's exclusive local distributor, said
                  that despite the downbeat economy, it expects the new iPhone 3GS to be
                  a hot seller.</p>
              <p>Yuen Kuan Moon is the telco's Executive Vice President of Consumer Group.</p>
              <p>"The initial response during the pre-ordering stage has given us
                  very encouraging results so we expect sales to be very good - similar
                  to last year if not better."</p>
              <p>The telco was coy about its sales for the iPhone 3G, however, only saying that it sold tens of thousands of units.</p>
              <p>So why are Singaporeans so fascinated, even obsessed, with getting the new iPhone?</p>
              <p>Associate Professor Tan Soo Jiuan from the National University of Singapore's Department of Marketing explains.</p>
              <p>"I think in the Singapore context, especially in the context of
                  mobile phone, such as iPhones, not being a mere communication tool, but
                  more like a status symbol and also some form of personal gadget kind of
                  thing. And i think it's more to show off, like being the first one to
                  be able to hold on to something that's new, that really helps to boost
                  the personal ego."</p>
