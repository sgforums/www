              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has urged Singaporeans
               to work together and be ready to respond to problems when they surface.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>One way to make a 
              real difference is to stay in the loop of world developments, such as 
              the problems the US, Europe and Japan are grappling with.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>He said: "If they 
              are in trouble, we will be in difficulty too. So we've got to watch 
              what's happening around us and keep an eye on the horizon and steer a 
              course forward which will keep Singapore competitive for the long term. <br><br>"And
               most important of all, we have to work together as one country, so that
               our little ship can be stable even when there are storms and waves and 
              we can move forward as one united people and reach our destination 
              together."<br><br>Mr Lee was speaking at a National Day Carnival in his constituency on Sunday.<br><br>He said Singapore's economy could have crashed in the last economic crisis but the country still came through.<br><br>Mr
               Lee said the challenges - such as providing more housing, expanding the
               train and bus system and adjusting government policies to put 
              Singaporeans first - are being addressed.<br><br>He added that as Singaporeans deal with the challenges, they must also remember and appreciate the successes.<br><br>- CNA/ir</span></span></p>

              <p>Extracted from Stomp : Foreigners shoo family away from Botanic Gardens landmarks because they "booked it"</p>
              <p>Comments by one person I found require attention.</p>
              <p>By SophiaRosieHart</p>
              <p>1. if Foreigners weren't in singapore singapore would have heaps of poor people or heaps of people in jail</p>
              <p>2. if we werent here singapore would of been run to the ground singapore cant live without Foreigners because they the ones who are bringing all the money in and they the ones who are building all your malls like if i wasn't here also mbs wouldn't be up and running like it is now</p>
              <p>3. singaporeans race is mostly chinese and malay mixed</p>
              <p>4.everyone is a Foreigner to singapore because singapore doesnt even have its own real race</p>
              <p>5.my own real race is maori and english<br>and mbs is the only good looking building in singapore but crap inside sadly hahahaha i got here to late when it started flooding because these dumb *****s dont know anything about building</p>
              <p>6.@Darn walk out on a job i get paid 30 grand a month for mate you must be joking,found a job like that in new zealand nope because they all taken and i would rather travel the world i've been to most of asia i must say singapore was the worse place i ever landed in and i cant wait in till i get to move</p>
              <p>7.and u see i already have another job lined up thats mine if i want it and most of the new zealanders here get moved around by the same company they dont keep them here because they know they dont like it just like my boss knows i hate singapore thats why next is Bangkok or Dubai or Aussie.<br>he probably worked his ass of an lied to get the job thats why he cant move anywhere because he sucks and no one wants him ouch that must hurt hahahahahahahahahaa like no one wants you</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>I guess our Governement is not aware of all these. Keep talking about about "talent". The Government need to have a system to weed out such Foreigner.</p>
