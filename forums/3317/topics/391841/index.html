              <p>SINGAPORE'S second casino and integrated resort at Marina Bay Sands
              (MBS) will open its doors on April 27, announced its parent company Las
              Vegas Sands on Wednesday. This will be followed by the second phase
              opening on June 2</p>
              <p>The announcement comes barely
              less than a week after its rival Genting Singapore opened its Resorts
              World Sentosa casino to the Chinese New Year crowds on Feb 14.</p>
              <p>In
              Phase One, some 963 hotel rooms, part of the shopping mall and
              convention centre, celebrity chef restaurants and other dining outlets,
              as well as the casino, will open on April 27, said MBS chief executive
              officer Thomas Arasi. But the opening schedule is subjected to
              'construction proceeding as scheduled and being able to attain the
              necessary regulatory approvals,' he added.</p>
              <p>Phase
              Two will be ready on June 23, which includes the Sands SkyPark, the
              Event Plaza along Marina Bay, the rest of the shops in the retail mall,
              and more dining options and nightlife. Mr Arasi said the IR will be
              marking Phase Two as part of its grand opening celebration.</p>
              <p>Las
              Vegas Sands (LVS) chairman and chief executive officer Sheldon Adelson
              said in a statement: "Nearly four years ago, we embarked on a journey
              we believed would define the future of our company and at the same time
              change the face of tourism in Singapore and the South Asian region for
              decades to come. Now, as we approach the opening of Marina Bay Sands -
              one of the most remarkable leisure and business destinations ever
              created - it seems both of those ambitions are about to come true."</p>
              <p>He
              added: 'Despite the challenging, and at times unprecedented economic
              conditions companies like ours recently faced, our dedication to
              completing this development never wavered, not even for a second. That
              determination defines this company as much as our ability to create and
              develop masterpieces such as Marina Bay Sands. We have no doubt the
              property will be a tremendous success, but how we got to this point
              will be every bit as important to the future prospects of our company.'</p>

              <p><strong>Marina Bay Sands in final burst of hirings</strong></p>
              <p>Marina Bay Sands has launched its final burst of hiring before it opens on April 27.Â <br> <br> Singapore's second Integrated Resort aims to bring in some 5,000 people in various positions over the next 60 days.Â <br> <br> Already, there are 3,600 casino staff on board.Â <br> <br> More from Imelda Saad.Â <br> <br> In just the last 48 hours alone, Sands said recruitment doubled with croupiers coming in for training.Â <br> <br> It was unable to give an exact figure, but said most of the people it has recruited across the entire IR are locals.Â <br> <br> All casino staff have to undergo a training stint that could take up to 7 weeks.Â <br> <br> Some 1,800 dealers are currently being trained at the newly formed Marina Bay Sands recruitment centre at Mountbatten Road.Â <br> <br> Training started 6 weeks ago.Â <br> <br> With some complaints over inexperienced dealers at the recently-opened
              Resorts World Sentosa, Marina Bay Sands is not taking any chances.Â <br> <br> Thomas Arasi is the CEO of Marina Bay Sands.<strong>Â <br> <br> </strong>"We're going to strive to open as close to perfection as we
              possibly can. So while there are no guarantees in there, there are
              assurances and we are just incredibly focusedWe're giving it our 100%
              and we hope to get as close as we can to 100% in terms of execution."Â <br> <br> The centre also acts as a one-stop hub for applicants to walk in and apply for jobs at the upcoming IR.Â <br> <br> There are various positions available in areas such as hotel operations, security and F &amp; B.Â <br> <br> Sands has said it will open the 7.7-billion-dollar Marina Bay project, in phases.Â <br> <br> The announcement comes after 3 years of work - including several delays
              and even concerns over the business viability of its parent company,
              Las Vegas Sands, which took a battering during the global financial
              crisis.Â <br> <br> But things seem to be on the mend -Â Las Vegas Sands Corporation has
              said that it will seek to refinance about 5 billion US-dollars in bank
              debt.Â <br> <br> Mr Arasi again. <br> <br> "This is definitely a marathon and not a sprint. The reality, it is
              it's about the kind of experience and reputation and the type of market
              reach that you have over a period of time."Â <br> <br> Unlike Resorts World Sentosa which targets leisure travellers, Marina
              Bay Sands has said its focus is on high-end business travellers as well
              as the meetings and convention sectors.Â <br> <br> As for social safeguards, Sands said it's working closely with the relevant authorities.Â <br> <br> Mr Arasi did not give details but said Sands is "considering everything that needs to be considered".</p>

              <p>I am more bullish on Marina Bay Sands than Resorts World Sentosa. Itâs
              strategic location, life-style design concept of a business, leisure.
              entertainment and recreation district, and target market (the Meetings,
              Incentives, Convention and Exhibition and a local captive clientele)do
              provide this Integrated Resort many inherent advantages i.e.
              agglomeration economies of location, a consistent and a sustaining
              visitors traffic have the capacity to increase top-line and bottom-line
              profits. If they are able to put a dynamic and creative management
              team, I think a spin off from its parent company, the Las Vegas Sands,
              and a public flotation of Marina Bay Sands is possible 30 -36 months
              down the road. This should help both MBS and its parent company, Las
              Vegas Sands, pared down their debts.</p>

              <p>casino is small component of IR ? who are you kidding ? the casino IS THE component.............</p>

              <p>don't forget, i foresaw all this trouble in 2004 when everything looks so rosy...............the contracts were signed back then, if the casinos know what's gonna happen in 2007-2008............they'll never build the casinos in the 1st place.</p>
              <p>when Las Vegas business is also now dropping, that's a real killer blow..............</p>

              <p>Yes, this is a possibility and LV Sands know this very well with the debt that it is carrying.</p>
              <p>In fact they admitted that success of their Singapore's operation is critical to their future.</p>
              <p>LVS has to be able to meet the USD 400 Million EBITDA which is a part of their debt covenant with the bankers. With the weak market condition in Las Vegas, LVS is hoping that Sands Macau and MBS Singapore will contribute significantly to meeting the target EBITDA. Recent news out of Macau indicate that their last Quarter earnings were slightly below their forecast! So additional pressure is now place on MBS.</p>
