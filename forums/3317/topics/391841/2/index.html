              <p><strong>Marina Bay casino opens</strong></p>
              <p>SINGAPORE'S second casino - the US$5.5 billion (S$7.5 billion) Marina
               Bay Sands - opened its doors to the public at the auspicious time of 
              3.18pm on Wednesday, giving a fresh boost to the city's tourism sector.</p>
              <p>Built by US gaming giant Las Vegas Sands, it is the group's first 
              casino in Asia outside Macau. Las Vegas Sands chairman Sheldon Adelson, 
              who flew here for the opening, said he expects to recoup his Singapore 
              investment in five years.</p>
              <p>'Most of the high-end players are reputable business people.
               They have to travel anyway so they typically would travel to the major 
              cities, like Hong Kong and Singapore, wherein they do business,' he told
               reporters.</p>
              <p>Hours before the official opening, earlybirds started 
              streaming into the integrated resort, hoping to be among the first to 
              catch a glimpse of the new tourist attraction. Those waiting to enter 
              the casino were ushered into the Sands Expo and Convention Center to 
              take a queue number and wait in comfort. They were later allowed to 
              enter the casino in the order that they have arrived. This was a measure
               taken by MBS to prevent a repeat of the overcrowding and crush at the 
              Resorts World Sentosa opening on Feb 14.</p>
              <p>Marina Bay Sands was originally set to open at the end of 
              2009 but faced repeated delays caused by a number of factors, including 
              material and labour shortages and financial problems due to the 
              downturn. It managed to clinch the casino licence only on Monday.</p>
              <p>Tuesday's opening includes the casino and 963 out of 2,560 
              hotel rooms, a portion of the shopping mall, some restaurants, an 
              exhibition and convention centre and the events plaza. The remaining 
              hotel rooms and suites, a skypark and more shops will open on June 23, 
              while a museum, theatres and other stores will start operations later in
               the year, the management said.</p>

              <p><strong>80,000 visitors a day</strong></p>
              <p>SINGAPORE'S second integrated resort (IR) opened on the dot at 3.18pm
               yesterday, and almost immediately, its Singapore chief made the bold 
              prediction that it would attract 70,000 to 80,000 visitors daily.</p>
              <p>The US$5.5 billion (S$7.5 billion) Marina Bay Sands (MBS) opened for 
              business after a simple ribbon-cutting ceremony at the hotel lobby by 
              top executives from its parent company Las Vegas Sands (LVS), and the 
              traditional lion dance for good luck.</p>
              <p>The waiting punters, some of whom had been there since early
               morning, were quickly and efficiently ushered into the casino in small 
              groups.</p>
              <p>There was none of the confusion seen at Resorts World 
              Sentosa's (RWS) casino opening in February when queues stretched around 
              the block and frustrated punters complained about shortages of food, 
              drinks and toilets.</p>
              <p>Mr Thomas Arasi, president and chief executive officer of 
              MBS, made the bullish prediction that the IR would attract 70,000 to 
              80,000 visitors daily once it is fully open in June - outstripping RWS' 
              estimation of 13 million visitors in its first year, or 35,000 people 
              daily.</p>
              <p>LVS chairman and chief executive officer Sheldon Adelson, 
              describing the Singapore casino as the company's most valuable property 
              with earnings forecast for US$1 billion in 12 months, predicted 
              yesterday: 'This is the future of gaming... This is a new model of 
              entertainment.'</p>

              <p><span>SINGAPORE: More than 36,000 people visited Marina Bay Sands in the
               24 hours after its auspicious opening at 3.18pm on Tuesday. </span></p>
              <p><span>The integrated resort saw 4,000 visitors in the first hour alone, 
              and it has been a steady flow of visitors since then.
              <br> <br> Cabbies said that going to the integrated resort simply to pick up 
              passengers is not lucrative due to ERP charges and not being able to 
              collect the city area surcharge.
              <br> <br> Food wise, two high-end Chinese restaurants - Imperial Treasure and Jin 
              Shan - are enjoying good business.
              <br> <br> One was even patronised by Las Vegas Sands CEO, Sheldon Adelson.

              <p><span>SINGAPORE: It's the first weekend for Singapore's second 
              integrated resort Marina Bay Sands. </span></p>
              <p><span>As it gears up for the crowds, it's also getting ready to play 
              host to former US Vice President Al Gore and delegates attending the 
              Inter-Pacific Bar Association 20th annual conference.
              <br> <br> The organisers said they wanted to bid for the event to be held in 
              Singapore last year.
              <br> <br> But due to construction delays at Marina Bay Sands, they decided to wait
               till this year to host the conference.
              <br> <br> They said there were some issues at the start of the this year's 
              conference.
              <br> <br> They include taking some time registering the some 1,000 delegates but 
              these issues have been ironed out.
              <br> <br> Yap Wai Ming, chairman, IPBA 2010 Organising Committee, said: 
              “Everybody's getting the hang of what's happening in this place. I think
               the MBS has stood by their people to help address a lot of these 
              issues, to the extent that I think we can all manage it carefully for 
              the benefit of our delegates and give them a good experience."
              <br> <br> Meanwhile, thousands of people took time out to check the new 
              attraction.
              <br> <br> Many curious to find out what's the buzz all about.
              <br> <br> And although certain parts of the resort are rather crowded, most people
               said it doesn't feel congested or uncomfortable.
              <br> <br> The rest of Marina Bay Sands will open in phases with the grand opening 
              on June 23. </span></p>

              <p><strong>Marina Bay Sands experiences blackout among other teething problems</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: The recently opened Marina Bay Sands integrated resort 
              experienced an embarrassing hiccup Tuesday. </span></p>
              <p><span>While the Chief Justice of New South Wales was speaking at a legal
               conference, stage lights went out and the sound system went dead.
              <br> <br> It was a blackout which did not amuse the audience.
              <br> <br> MediaCorp learnt several members left while those who stayed were moved 
              to a smaller conference hall.
              <br> <br> Tuesday's fiasco is not the first to plague the integrated resort.
              <br> <br> A number of delegates who'd checked into the hotel last week complained 
              of air conditioners not working, luggage delivered to rooms two hours 
              after check-in, and toilets that did not flush.
              <br> <br> Some delegates were even trapped in lifts for up to 20 minutes.
              <br> <br> An organiser of the legal conference said the facilities have not been 
              up to expectations.
              <br> <br> A spokesperson said they've been working with the organisers to ensure 
              the success of the legal conference.

              <p>But on the flip side, I don't think the casino had any major issues.</p>

              <p>Maybe the casino business was the main target and the focus of all the management attention instead of some pfftt lawyer conference. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p><strong>MBS says it has sealed at least 180 contracts for events</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : Marina Bay Sands (MBS) said it has sealed at least 180
               contracts for events at its Expo and Convention Centre over the next 
              three years. </span></p>
              <p><span>At least 270,000 delegates and participants will make use of the 
              conference facilities. 
              <br> <br> This comes amid a spate of teething problems since it opened late last 
              month.
              <br> <br> The integrated resort opened with a bang, but it was not long before 
              negative publicity hit - starting with complaints from the delegates of 
              its first conference.   
              <br> <br> MBS faced several problems when it hosted its first conference with the 
              Inter Pacific Bar Association. There were complaints of a power failure 
              and a lack of air conditioning, amongst other problems. 
              <br> <br> Other event organisers who have events lined up in MBS were concerned if
               the same would happen to them, but those MediaCorp spoke to said MBS 
              has since taken measures to ensure that such problems do not happen 
              again, such as having their heads of department come down to the 
              conference venue to oversee the preparation process. 
              <br> <br> In a statement, MBS described these as "operational issues" typical of 
              new property openings. 
              <br> <br> It said it has received positive feedback on its services, food and 
              facilities. 
              <br> <br> It recently hosted its first trade show - the Hospital Build Asia 
              Exhibition and Congress - with about 4,000 delegates and visitors over 
              three days. The event was held from May 11 to 13.
              <br> <br> Andrew Keable, divisional director, IIR Exhibitions Pte Ltd, said: "The 
              first thing I did was to pick up the phone to speak to the guys whom I 
              have been dealing with at MBS and talked to them about what the issues 
              were, come in to do some site inspections and to check that there were 
              no issues with the space that I was using. 
              <br> <br> "We had no issues to what had gone on the week before and we had a very 
              open dialogue on my expectations and that was what was delivered. We had
               very positive feedback. 
              <br> <br> "We just spent three days running the exhibition and we have run several
               conferences at the venue here as well...The international customers 
              were really impressed with the new venue, and I think the feeling from 
              them is that they are all very positive about coming back here next 
              year."
              <br> <br> MBS said it is working on more than 500 additional prospective 
              exhibitions, meetings, incentives and conventions over the next four 
              years. - CNA/ms </span></p>

              <p><strong>MBS goes to court</strong></p>
              <p>IN A twist to the saga in which system breakdowns at Marina Bay Sands
               (MBS) marred a law group's conference, the integrated resort (IR) is 
              now suing the organisers of the meeting for payments owed.</p>
              <p>It is asking for $300,000 from IPBA 2010 Pte Ltd, which organised the
               annual conference of the Inter-Pacific Bar Association (IPBA) at its 
              premises from May 2 to May 5.</p>
              <p>An MBS spokesman confirmed that a writ of summons was served
               on Tuesday evening.</p>
              <p>The Straits Times understands that the amount MBS is 
              pursuing is part of the $660,000 deposit IPBA was to have put down for 
              the conference, but which it did not pay.</p>
              <p>Yesterday, the IPBA reacted with indignation to MBS' move.</p>
              <p>In a statement, it said: 'The failures and breaches of MBS 
              with respect to our conference are now well-known and undeniable. It 
              adds to our indignation that the party in breach should choose to sue in
               such a hurry.'</p>
