              <p>3) I don't think that harsher punishment is the way. Some even

              people and they just got misguided by a highly trained professional
              and furthermore a family kin.  I still think they should be
              given rehabiliation so the "anger" that they may have are not
              turned into something worse or used as an example.</p>

              <p>I think the male should get rotan of at least 3 times, just like the clown who vandal the MRT. The female ones, not asking to be subjected to rape, but must tio jail for like 3 years, for not having the need to tio sugar cane.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why? Because this is Mas Selamat, one who had almost giving many families sad whatever when he succeed. Imagine if he blows up Changi Airport or another MRT station successfully? How many sinkies is going to be killed / disabled / injured for life? Remember, he is not some murderer outside just pull a parang and stab someone to death / into plant etc. due to heated arguments or such, neither he is a trivial case like serial shoplifters who managed to escaped from the jail / detention centre. He is real threat to the society and neither is he a hero, what you think he wanted due to "revolution plot" like October revolution? This is the basis for harsher punishment.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And dun tell me the crap of they shield Ah Mat due to kinship. Terrorist are trained not to have any kinship or whatever ship. They are a bunch of morons. F them all the way, do a research on how Tamil Tigers (Not so related to religious extremist like this mat), Al Qaeda etc nonsense train those kids. Come on la, if the terror organization trained you to be loving, got relationship / kinship etc, on the moment to do a suicide bombing, then the suicide bomber gonna to say "Oh! I love my family?" and dare not go explode him / herself? WTF, entire planning from terror organization gonna to fail thanks to this moron with ships? Common sense tells you that terrorists / extremist are heartless, not me six kin dun recognize. (å…­äº²ä¸�è®¤)</p>

              <p>They did not punish the kins enough cos it is their fault that they did not track down and also due to the coming x-marking exercise.</p>
              <p>How are they so sure that the kins have no connection with terrorist training ?</p>
              <p>No normal adult can tahan the interrogation without giving up ?</p>
              <p>So, did they trace further as regard to the kin for terrorist link ?</p>
              <p>The worse part is they have to drag the un-related link with religion. (I believe the local are too wise to stereotype the case with religion)</p>
              <p>What if Mr Mas manage to perform some terrorist act after the escape, would the kins be part of the accomplice also ?</p>
              <p>Is the person in charge being lenient as they themselves are incompetent and complacent in the first place ?</p>
              <p>Who are they asking the public for forgiveness ? themselves ?</p>
              <p>Why should the kins be forgiven for harbouring a terrorist who can create more death ?</p>

              <p>yes, a harsh punishment would have served its purpose to tell everyone that anyone supporting them would be harshly deal with it.</p>
              <p>Just a few questions -&gt;</p>
              <p>-&gt; but what about the aftershocks and ripple effect?</p>
              <p>-&gt; what going to happen to these people after their imprisonment and punishment?</p>
              <p>Blame me, but I am still under the illusion that our land is not 100% free of these terrorists.</p>
              <p>I think u are viewing from a different angle. U keep hammering terrorists having no kinship, but the focus is on the family members who helped them la. Are they terrorists?It is never easy for those who turn in their family members when they break the law like drugs or etc.</p>
              <p>and lastly, yes, we are giving out harsh punishments to his kins who helped him, but what about those whose neligence has led to his escape &amp; this circus? rotan/jail also?</p>

              </div>
              <p>KUALA
              LUMPUR, Sept 24 — Jemaah Islamiah’s Singapore leader Mas Selamat
              Kastari, who was captured in Malaysia last year after escaping a
              Singapore jail, has been handed back to Singaporean authorities, an
              official said today.</p>
              <p>“We can say that Mas Selamat has been handed over to Singapore authorities,” said Jamilah Taib, a home ministry spokesman.</p>
              <p>“We don’t know when the handover took place and will release details as we have them,” she added.</p>
              <p>It was reported earlier that Mas Selamat had been freed from the
              Kamunting detention camp and would be handed over to the Immigration
              Department for deportation to the island republic today.</p>
              <p>Mas Selamat escaped from Singapore’s Whitley Road detention centre
              on February 27, 2008 and was captured by Malaysian police in Kampung
              Tawakal near Skudai, Johor on April 1, 2009.</p>
              <p>He was then detained under the Internal Security Act (ISA) for two years.</p>
              <p>In a statement on Friday, Police Special Task Force Director
              (Operations/Counter Terrorism) Datuk Mohamad Fuzi Harun said the home
              minister had cancelled the detention order against Mas Selamat. The
              order was cancelled at 10.30am the same day.</p>
              <p>It is not known if Mas Selamat’s sudden release and deportation was
              discussed at Monday’s meeting between Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib
              Razak and his Singapore counterpart, Lee Hsien Loong.</p>
              <p>Malaysian authorities, with intelligence from Singapore, had tracked him down last year to Kampung Tawakal in Skudai, Johor.</p>
              <p>He had been living in the village of about 100 people for almost
              half a year before police ambushed him in a dawn raid last April.</p>
              <p>A Singapore Internal Security Department assessment is that “he remains defiant”.</p>
              <p>Mas Selamat was understood to have been undergoing a rehabilitation
              programme that includes debating with religious experts on Islam.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Mas Selamat was born January 23, 1961 in Kendal, Central Java,
              Indonesia. He is linked with JI and is a suspect for a plot to bomb the
              Singapore Changi Airport in 2002.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Previously, Mas Selamat was detained by the Indonesian police in
              February 2003 to aid their investigation of several bombings in 2001
              and 2002. He was then using the identity of Edi Heriyanto with fake
              passport, and was subsequently jailed for 18 months in 2003 for
              immigration offences. It was during this time he acquired his permanent
              limp, as result of a botched escape attempt from a high floor.</p>
              <p>His claim of infamy started with an escape from Whitley Road
              Detention Centre of Singapore’s Internal Security Department on
              February 27, 2008. He was deported to Singapore after an arrest was
              made in Java, Indonesia on January 20, 2006 for using fake identity
              card while visiting his son there. It then spurred what is considered
              the biggest manhunt ever in Singapore — involving several units
              including the Singapore Police Force, Gurkha Contingent, Police
              Tactical Unit, Singapore Guards and Armed Forces Military Police
              Command.</p>
              <p>The manhunt was called off 17 hours later without success, and it
              wasn’t until April 1, 2009 that Mas Selamat was arrested by Malaysian
              forces. His arrest was undisclosed under the Internal Security Act
              (ISA) in order to root out his network in Malaysia, and was only
              reported by Singaporean media on May 8, 2009.</p>
              <p>JI’s activities are centred around the establishment of an Islamic
              State in Southeast Asia, including Indonesia, Malaysia, the southern
              Philippines, Singapore and Brunei. It was founded on January 1, 1993 by
              Indonesian leaders Abu Bakar Bashir and Abdullah Sungkar in Malaysia,
              while escaping the Suharto Government’s persecution. Since then, JI has
              initiated contact with al-Qaeda, Taliban, the Abu Sayyaf Group and Moro
              Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) among others.</p>
              <p>The militant organisation has been involved in dozens of attacks and
              bombings, the deadliest being the Bali car bombings on October 12,
              2002. Its suicide bombers killed 202 people and injured 240 more in two
              attacks in the tourist district of Kuta. Several members of JI were
              arrested afterwards, and Imam Samudra, Amrozi Nurhasyim and Mukhlas
              Ghufron were executed by firing squad on 9 November 2008.</p>
              <p>Other attacks suspected or claimed to be carried out by JI include
              the 2003 JW Marriott hotel bombing in Kuningan, Jakarta, the 2004
              Australian embassy bombing in Jakarta, the 2005 Bali terrorist bombing
              and the 2009 JW Marriott and Ritz-Carlton hotel bombings. Many other JI
              important figures such as Noordin Top, Azahari Husin, Hambali, Abu
              Dujana, and Dulmatin, have since been killed or captured, mostly by
              Indonesian anti-terrorist squad.</p>

              <p>yes, a harsh punishment would have served its purpose to tell
              everyone that anyone supporting them would be harshly deal with

              <p>Just a few questions -&gt;</p>

              <p>-&gt; what going to happen to these people after their

              <p>Blame me, but I am still under the illusion that our land is not
              100% free of these terrorists.</p>
              <p>I think u are viewing from a different angle. U keep hammering
              terrorists having no kinship, but the focus is on the family
              members who helped them la. Are they terrorists?It is never easy
              for those who turn in their family members when they break the law
              like drugs or etc.</p>
              <p>and lastly, yes, we are giving out harsh punishments to his kins
              who helped him, but what about those whose neligence has led to his
              escape &amp; this circus? rotan/jail also?</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>Aftershocks and ripple effect? Why are you so concerned on it? I believe without family support, Ah mat cant do much. I believe they (Mat's family members) at first dislike SG govern. [Not about PAP VS Opp.] and Western culture. I bet they are the ones who hoped SG / S.E.A can implement muslim law like Middle East.</p>
              <p>Why are you also concern their life when their punishment. Like I say, even if the punishmnet is as is, they still tio imprisonment. And in every day, people are convicted worldwide. Why you dont concern on their future as well? Well, forgive me for being heartless, but out of those convicted, the ones least deserved any <strong>ANY</strong> sympathy are those religious farkers extremist. They should be taunted and tortured like mad, by my definition because generally religion are bad afterall [Learn India and Middle East's outcome for such statement].</p>
              <p>The focus is not only simply the family who helped them. It is also concern if any people helped and punishment must treated fairly. So next time, if another terrorist or even Ah Mat escaped again, but not going to seek help from their family members, because they know that the Police will not repeat the same thing again, but instead seek help from people from same religion [Ah Mat would seek help from other fellow Muslim brothers / Mosque], then they also sentence a light sentence, like this and say: "The focus is brothers helping each other?" / "Avoid mass anger from a particular religion" (Ah Mat's case would be Islam)? Then why they ask for public's help to hunt them down? WTF, it is disgustingly unfair.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Regarding those incompetent / neligent staffs, come on, it is an honest mistake, they tio demote, tio sack liao what more you want. They are UNINTENTIONALLY leaking Mat but these damn family memebers is INTENTIONALLY helped Mat. So these family members should have longer jail and / or rotan but these careless staff must tio demote / warning or even fired should do suffice.</p>
