              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Mas Selamat Kastari, the leader of the Singapore arm 
              of terror group Jemaah Islamiyah, had help after his escape from the 
              Whitley Road Detention Centre (WRDC) on 27 February, 2008. </span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>He was harboured by 
              four family members before escaping to Malaysia, revealed Home Affairs 
              Minister K Shanmugam in a Ministerial Statement in Parliament on Monday.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Three family members have since been convicted in court and jailed. The fourth was left off with a stern warning.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Mas Selamat had made
               his way to his brother Asmom's home in Tampines, a busy neighbourhood 
              in the eastern part of Singapore, two days after the escape.<br><br>He 
              was greeted by his 25-year-old niece Nur Aini Asmom, who then persuaded 
              her mother Aisah to allow Mas Selamat into their flat.<br><br>Mas Selamat subsequently stayed one night at his brother's home.<br><br>The JI fugitive remained elusive until May 2009 when it surfaced that he'd been detained by Malaysia authorities. <br><br>It was revealed then that Mas Selamat had been hiding in a small village in Johor Bahru.<br><br>He was finally handed back to Singapore authorities on September 24,  2010. <br><br>Authorities found out about his family's involvement in his escape about a month later, in October.<br><br>For
               harbouring the terrorist after his escape, Mas Selamat's brother, the 
              brother's wife and their daughter, have been jailed between three and 18
               months.<br><br>Nur Aini, who was a Malay language teacher, was sentenced to 18 months' jail.<br><br>His brother, Asmom, was given 12 months while his sister-in-law Aisah, three months' jail.<br><br>The three were arrested and charged on November 10. They were convicted of the charge and sentenced on November 18.<br><br>Mas Selamat's nephew Mahadir, who had a lesser role in the matter, has been served a stern warning in lieu of prosecution.<br><br>Mr Shanmugam said Mas Selamat had wanted to seek shelter and help from Nur Aini, thinking that his niece was living alone.<br><br>The Minister added that Nur Aini persuaded her mother to allow Mas Selamat to enter the flat.<br><br>She
               gave him use of her bedroom, provided him food and water, and also 
              assisted him by destroying the clothing he wore to the flat, which 
              included his WRDC-issued attire.<br><br>The next day, Nur Aini applied 
              make-up on Mas Selamat and secured a tudung -- or headscarf -- over his 
              head to disguise him as a woman.<br><br>She also gave him several items,
               including more clothing, snacks, an illumination light stick and a map 
              of Singapore that showed part of Malaysia.<br><br>Early that morning, 
              Mas Selamat's 58-year-old brother returned home from work. He knew it 
              was wrong to harbour Mas Selamat, but decided to let him stay anyway.<br><br>Before his brother left the flat, Asmom gave him S$100 and RM100 to facilitate his escape from Singapore to Malaysia.<br><br>Asmom's
               58-year-old wife Aisah gave Mas Selamat an EZ-link card and hair-net 
              which he wore as part of his disguise, and some paracetamol.<br><br>There was also Mas Selamat's nephew Mahadir, who had come home on 29 February night and discovered his uncle at home.<br><br>Authorities said 29-year-old Mahadir did not render specific help, and was not in the flat much. <br><br>However, he did not report the matter to the authorities.<br><br>Mr Shanmugam said the independent accounts on what took place in the Asmom home are consistent.<br><br>But Mas Selamat's own account of how he then made his way to Malaysia is still unverified.<br><br>Mr
               Shanmugam said the three had knowingly harboured Mas Selamat, an 
              escaped prisoner of the State, who they knew was the subject of a 
              massive manhunt.<br><br>They deliberately withheld information when they were interviewed by the authorities on March 3, 2008.<br><br>It was only in October this year, after being confronted with the facts, that they admitted to what had happened.<br><br>Mr
               Shanmugam said Asmom and his family's decision to harbour Mas Selamat 
              and provide him with material support that enabled him to escape to 
              Malaysia was very wrong, illegal, and had grave security implications.<br><br>That's because Mas Selamat could then resume his terrorist activities as well as plans to attack Singapore.<br><br>Mr
               Shanmugam said Singaporeans will be understandably disappointed that 
              Asmom and his family had helped Mas Selamat in his escape.<br><br>But he
               added that their actions are not a reflection on the wider Malay-Muslim
               community who had disapproved of Mas Selamat's deeds, and participated 
              in the manhunt for him in 2008.<br><br>Mr Shanmugam said Singaporeans 
              should not allow this episode to affect the trust and goodwill that has 
              been built up over the years between the different communities.<br><br>Instead,
               he said this should reinforce how important it is for every Singaporean
               to unite and assist the security agencies to overcome the threat of 
              terrorism.<br><br>As to how Mas Selamat made his way to his brother's 
              flat and how he subsequently made his way to Malaysia, Mr Shanmugam said
               the account given by Mas Selamat is still subject to verification. <br><br></span><strong>Read the full text of the Ministerial Statement </strong><a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/annex/Ministerial%20statement%20MHA.pdf">here</a><span><br><br>-CNA/wk/fa</span></span></p>

              <p>I find it hard to believe that he actually seek refuge in his brother's house without the Singapore Police Force (SPF) ever finding out prior to his confession. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Didn't the SPF put surveillance outside his immediate family's house or tap their phones?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ooops!!!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I forgot the clown Minister WKS was in charge of the SPF apart from the Internal Security Department (ISD) in which Mas Selamat Kastari escaped from a toilet. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But then following in PAP's reasoning, it's probably not WKS's fault, it's the fault of the police that didn't put surveillance teams on his immediate family. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>I wish I had a job like his, multi million dollar salary but with no responsibility whatsoever.</strong> It's the world's most sought after job, even more sought after than the island caretaker in Australia. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>just IMHO, no offense.</p>
              <p>1) if he can escape all the way to tampines, why he need sgp map? to go mys?</p>
              <p>2) these terrorists are playing on the knife edge of religion sensitivity. by using a tudung, he escapes most if not all survelliances. Going forward, this tudung thing may be a potential "concern/issue".</p>
              <p>3) I don't think that harsher punishment is the way. Some even ask for repossessing of their flat, absurb la. These are still people and they just got misguided by a highly trained professional and furthermore a family kin.  I still think they should be given rehabiliation so the "anger" that they may have are not turned into something worse or used as an example.</p>

              <p><strong>Hundreds probed after Mas Selamat's escape </strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: A few hundred people including Mas Selamat Kastari's 
              own extended family - numbering nearly a hundred - were investigated 
              following the escape of the Jemaah Islamiah leader from detention on 27 
              February, 2008.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The others included 
              the fugitive's friends and ex-JI associates, said Home Affairs Minister 
              K. Shanmugam in Parliament on Monday.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>He was responding to
               questions from MPs following his statement to the House that Mas 
              Selamat had sought shelter at his brother Asmom's flat in Tampines from 
              February 29 to March 1 and had help also from his sister-in-law and 
              niece, to facilitate his escape out of Singapore to Malaysia. <br><br>Uppermost on the minds of Malay-Muslim MPs were concerns of a backlash against the community.<br><br>"Given
               the fact that Mas Selamat did escape in a tudung, will the Ministry 
              assure the Malay community that there won't be unnecessary scrutiny on 
              Malay women wearing tudung in security areas and when they seek 
              appointments for jobs," asked Zaqy Mohamed, MP for Hong Kah GRC.<br><br>In
               reply, Mr Shanmugam said: "Whether someone is picked up for scrutiny, 
              whether he or she is wearing a tudung, really depends on security 
              assessments. It's really difficult to answer these questions in a 
              vacuum. If there is an intelligence assessment and if there is a 
              necessity to check, there will be a check. If there is no reason to 
              check, there will be none. <br><br>"As to the broader question, the 
              government has consistently stated over the years that the actions of a 
              few are not a reflection of the Malay-Muslim community as a whole.<br><br>"Our
               position remains unchanged. Over the years, the actions of the 
              Malay-Muslim community have borne that out. They have been very 
              supportive of our efforts to build a tolerant, united community. They 
              have consistently spoken out against violence in the name of any 
              religion. <br><br>"There is no reason for employers or anyone else to 
              shy away from employing members of the Malay-Muslim community or for 
              anyone to use this incident as an excuse to target members of the 
              Malay-Muslim community. <br><br>"In the civil service, the recruitment 
              policy is based on a system of meritocracy. I can state categorically 
              that this incident will not affect the government's recruitment 
              policies. Employers in the private sector, (too), should hire based on 
              the individual's suitability for the job."<br><br>Mr Shanmugam also stressed that the threat Mas Selamat posed was to Singapore as a whole.<br><br>"His
               actions put all Singaporeans at risk. As such, all Singaporeans across 
              the communities will feel disappointed with the actions of Asmom and his
               family. Their actions should not be projected on the Malay community at
               large."<br><br>Also raised in Parliament was the gravity of the sentences meted out to those who had harboured Mas Selamat. <br><br>MP
               Maliki Osman wanted to know, given the seriousness of the offence, if 
              the sentences to Asmom and his family members were too lenient.<br><br>Under
               the law, a person who knowingly harbours or conceals any such fugitive 
              is liable to life imprisonment or a jail term of up to 15 years, and be 
              fined as well.<br><br>Mr Shanmugam said the sentences were based on submissions from both the prosecution and defence.<br><br>He
               said: "The sentences in our view reflect the different degrees of 
              involvement of the family in harbouring and aiding Mas Selamat. Nur Aini
               was obviously the most culpable, (so) she has been given the longest 
              jail sentence. The other two were given shorter sentences because of 
              their lesser involvement. The court is likely to have given weight to 
              the fact that the assistance was not pre-meditated, rather the three 
              persons appear to have acted on misguided instinct on family ties, on 
              the spur of the moment."</span></span></p>
