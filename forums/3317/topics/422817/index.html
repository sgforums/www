              <p>A MAN accused of raping a young woman he met at a club told a 
              district court on Monday that he had sex with her with her consent.</p>
              <p>Ong Mingwee, 28, who helps run a family minimart business in Toa 
              Payoh North, denied raping the 22-year-old woman in the flat in the 
              early hours of Feb 12, 2009.</p>
              <p>He said he neither forced her to have sex with him nor did he tell her that she could not go home unless she had sex with him.</p>
              <p>Ong had met the woman for the first time at Zouk earlier 
              when he went clubbing with his elder brother. He was introduced to the 
              woman, who danced with him that night. When the club closed, he offered 
              to take her home. He claimed that while they were in the taxi, they 
              started kissing and she agreed to go his place.</p>
              <p>In the flat, he took her to his room while he went to ease 
              himself and have a smoke. When he returned, he heard her cry, saying she
               was scared and wanted to go home. Shocked, he tried to calm her down 
              and assured her that he would not harm or hurt her in any way.</p>
              <p>The court heard earlier that the woman called her mother and
               her girlfriend, who had been with her earlier at Zouk, telling them she
               was scared and wanted to go home. But she had no idea where she was. If
               convicted Ong faces a jail term of up to 20 years and a fine or to 
              caning.</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">I didn't treat her like sex slave: Alleged rapist</h1>
              <p>A SELF-EMPLOYED man accused of raping a young woman he met in a club 
              two years ago on Tuesday denied that he had treated the 22-year-old like
               a sex slave.</p>
              <p>Deputy Public Prosecutor Leong Wing Tuck had said to Ong Mingwee on 
              the stand during cross-examination that the man's actions clearly showed
               this. The 28-year-old accused disagreed.</p>
              <p>He had taken the woman home after meeting her at Zouk in Jiak Kim Street, where they had danced together.</p>
              <p>He had testified that the woman had danced so sexily that he became embarrassed because a lot of people were looking at them.</p>
              <p>He was to have taken her home after the club closed at about
               4am. Instead, he told the taxi driver to go to his home in Toa Payoh 
              North, above his family's provision shop, which he manages.</p>
              <p>He told the court in his defence that they had kissed in the cab and she had agreed to go to his place.</p>
