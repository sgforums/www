              <p><strong>Australian dinosaur that lived 98M years ago found</strong></p>
              <p class="first">CANBERRA, Australia - Scientists have confirmed for
              the first time that Australia was once home to a dinosaur that was big,
              fast and terrifying, and they've named it like something from an Arnold
              Schwarzenegger movie. Meet the Australovenator.</p>
              <p>The beast was a 1,100 pound (500 kilogram) meat-eating predator with
              three slashing claws on each of its powerful forelimbs that stalked the
              Outback 98 million years ago, researchers said in a report published
              Friday.</p>
              <p>Fossilized remnants of its limb bones, ribs, jaw and
              fangs were found _ along with bones of two other new species of
              gigantic, long-necked herbivores weighing up to 22 tons (20 metric
              tons) _ in Queensland state over the past three years.</p>
              <p>The
              discovery, analyzed in a 51-page report published in the peer-reviewed
              online science journal PLoS ONE, was the first substantial find of
              large dinosaurs in Australia to be revealed in 28 years.</p>
              <p>Paleontologists
              have described Australia as new frontier in vertebrate paleontology and
              an untapped resource in the world's understanding of the dinosaur age
              because so few fossils have been found there. This is largely because
              the relatively flat continent has long been geologically stable. The
              movement of tectonic plates in other continents has forced layers of
              rock bearing fossils tens of millions of years old to the surface
              making them easier to find.</p>
              <p>In the latest Queensland find,
              paleontologists bulldozed top soil more than three feet (a meter) deep
              to expose the sandy clay that held the fossils.</p>
              <p>The finders
              nicknamed the 16-foot (5-meter) long carnivore, Australovenator
              wintonensis (pronounced oss-tra-low-VEN'-ah-tor win-TON'-en-sis),
              "Banjo," after the poet A.B. "Banjo" Paterson who in 1885 penned
              Australia's unofficial anthem "Waltzing Matilda" on a sheep ranch near
              Winton _ a cattle town that lies closest to where the dinosaur bones
              were found. Banjo's Latin name means "Winton's Southern Hunter."</p>
              <p>"The
              cheetah of his time, Banjo was light and agile," the report's lead
              author, Scott Hocknull, a Queensland Museum paleontologist, said in a
              statement.</p>
              <p>"He's Australia's answer to Velociraptor, but many
              times bigger and more terrifying," Hocknull added, referring to the
              turkey-sized prehistoric predators recreated with artistic license in
              the "Jurassic Park" movies.</p>
              <p>The other two finds _ 52-foot-
              (16-meter-) long herbivores _ were previously unknown types of
              titanosaur, the largest dinosaurs that ever lived. The giraffe-like
              Wintonotitan wattsi (pronounced win-ton-oh-TIE-tan wot-SIGH) and
              nicknamed Clancy translates from Latin as "Watts' Winton Giant." The
              Diamantinasaurus matildae (pronounced dye-man-TEEN'-ah-sor-us
              mah-TIL'-day) resembled a hippopotamus and has been nicknamed Matilda;
              the Latin name translates as "Matilda's Diamantina River Lizard."</p>
              <p>All three lived in the mid-Cretaceous period which extended from 145 million years to 65 million years ago.</p>
              <p>Matilda's
              and Banjo's bones were mingled; Hocknull suspects Matilda became stuck
              in river mud and that Banjo fell into the same fatal trap while moving
              in for the kill.</p>
              <p>"The jewel in the crown for us is Banjo because
              it's the most complete meat-eating dinosaur ever found in Australia,"
              Hocknull said.</p>
              <p>"All of the carnivorous dinosaurs that we've had in the past were only known from a single bone or tooth," he added.</p>
              <p>John Long, a Museum Victoria paleontologist who was not connected with the find, said it was "very exciting stuff."</p>
              <p>Long
              said the last "truly big" dinosaur found in Australia was the partial
              skeleton of a 30-foot- (9-meter-) long herbivore named Muttaburrasaurus
              which was found near the Queensland town of Muttaburra in 1981.</p>
              <p>Long said only single large dinosaur bones had been found since then.</p>
              <p>"This
              is the first time we've got partially articulated skeletons," Long
              said. "There is enough of the bones to reconstruct them quite
              confidently."</p>
              <p>"We know so little about the Australian dinosaur
              fauna that any major paper like this is a massive advance on our
              previous knowledge," he said.</p>
              <p>Hocknull said his team would
              continue unearthing more bones of the three dinosaurs as well as other
              sites in the Winton area, where fossil bones have been found scattered
              on the surface since the 1930s.</p>

              <p>The beast was a 1,100 pound (500 kilogram) meat-eating predator with three slashing claws on each of its powerful forelimbs that stalked the Outback 98 million years ago, researchers said in a report published Friday.</p>
              <p>Fossilized remnants of its limb bones, ribs, jaw and fangs were found _ along with bones of two other new species of gigantic, long-necked herbivores weighing up to 22 tons (20 metric tons) _ in Queensland state over the past three years.</p>
              <p>The discovery, analyzed in a 51-page report published in the peer-reviewed online science journal PLoS ONE, was the first substantial find of large dinosaurs in Australia to be revealed in 28 years.</p>
