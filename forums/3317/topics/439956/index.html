              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>WASHINGTON: Singapore's former Minister Mentor, Lee Kuan Yew, 
              urged the United States and China to find a way of working together on 
              the global stage.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>He was speaking 
              after being awarded the Lincoln Medal in Washington DC - an honor that 
              is reserved for people who have exemplified the legacy and character 
              embodied by former US President Abraham Lincoln.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The Lincoln Medal is
               awarded annually at Ford's Theater in Washington DC, a site of the 
              assassination in 1865 of President Abraham Lincoln and is one of the 
              city's major tourist attractions.<br><br>Lincoln is revered in the 
              United States as he's held by many to be the nation's greatest former 
              President for leading the country through the Civil War, ending slavery 
              and promoting economic modernisation.<br><br>Former Minister Mentor challenged the United States to be forward-thinking about one of its modern relationships.<br><br>China's rise, he argued, will be the most dramatic global event of this century.<br><br>Mr Lee said: "To grow, China needs American markets, American investments, and with it American technology.<br><br>"China
               also wants to send thousands of her students to American universities 
              and research institutions, to work and learn the kind of intellectual 
              milieu that enables Americans to be so innovative and creative."<br><br>China's development, said the former Minister Mentor, should not scare the United States.<br><br>The
               Chinese, he argued, are in no hurry to displace the US as the world's 
              dominant power, and prefer instead of operate within larger groups like 
              the G20 and the UN Security Council.<br><br>The relationship between 
              Washington and Beijing has been marked by tensions of late, over issues 
              like the value of the Chinese currency, the Obama administration's 
              decision to modernise Taiwan's stockpile of F16s and China's massive 
              holding of US debt."<br><br>But the former Minister Mentor said there's a
               chance for both sides to manage the relationship in the interests not 
              just of themselves but of the wider world.<br><br>Mr Lee said: "Although
               America is currently facing tremendously difficult economic times, I am
               confident that America's innate creativity, resilience and innovative 
              spirit will allow it to confront its core problems, overcome them, and 
              regain competitiveness.<br><br>"Beyond that, the US should not see 
              China's ascent as a zero-sum game, but should find a way to work 
              together, which will call for a combination of regular dialogues, hard 
              negotiation and mutual reassurances".<br><br>Equable relations between 
              the two countries, he said, are the most important for peace and 
              stability in the Asia Pacific region, and the whole world.<br><br>- CNA/ck</span></span></p>

Filmmaker Glen Goei as well as actors Lim Kay Siu and Neo Swee Lin will make an appearance at the public screening of the hit movie <a style="color: #8b7f65; text-decoration: underline;" href="http://www.thebluemansion.com/"><em>The Blue Mansion</em></a>.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 10px;">The movie, directed by Mr Goei, was released in 2009.<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> It revolves around a wealthy patriach who dies suddenly. </span></span></strong>His ghost returns to discover the cause of his death only to find his three grown-up children squabbling over his estate, among other quirky developments.

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 10px;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Written by former <em>Straits Times</em> political reporter Mr Ken Kwek, <em>The Blue Mansion</em>is described as "classy" and its production "top-notch". It won Best Film in Singapore's Entertianment awards in 2010 and Mr Goei was Best Director. </span></span></strong><br><br>The movie was the Opening Film at the prestigious Berlin Film Festival. It was also chosen for screening at film festivals from Tokyo to Shanghai to Hawaii.    <br><br>This event will help raise funds for the Democrats as we continue our push for political change in Singapore. Work for the next elections has already started in earnest and we need funds to spread our message of change. <br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><br>Fans will be able to get up close and personal with Mr Goei as he will be taking questions following the screening of the movie. </span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 10px;">Mr Lim and Ms Neo will also be on hand for a discussion about the movie - and beyond. </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 10px;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Is there an underlying message that the movie tries to convey? </span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 10px;">Did the Media Development Authority insist on cuts to the original script?</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 10px;">Will the movie industry in Singapore produce films that are political in nature in the future? <br><br>It's your chance to ask Mr Goei and the cast their views on these and other matters. <br><br>Tickets are available from $50 and will include a reception with the celebrities, photo-ops, and the Q&amp;A session. <br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">When was the last you attended an event like this, organised by an opposition party and graced by our homegrown movie stars? </span></span></strong></p>

              <p>wonders maybe the americans have a point there.normally when the americans give out a lincoln or great honour medals they check very thoroughly.</p>
              <p>i think they checked like how a person can direct singapore which still has majority of not very smart people or  who can use modern ways like the japanese .</p>
              <p>after checking the level of skill in spore,i do noticed that spore majority people might not be up to the job to make a modern spore as lky spore.that is rather a sad fact.</p>
              <p>i do notice that 85%  asking for pap to go away tend to have not much skills in life   and making $$$$ using modern methods,which is shocking.had the pap lost,spore would be filled with shopkeeper types from looks of it and probably would end up backwards.the americans must have done a feasibility and a no-nonsense thorough report in order to award him with a lincoln medal!</p>
              <p>after what i have seen in spore over the decades on the type of sporeans at workplaces,the americans are quite right!spore would go into the direction of pol pots cambodia with the majority type of sporeans presently.so him getting a lincoln medal was done in an accurate data gathering manner by very the americans with a century of strict decision making.</p>
