              <p>SEOUL (AFP) - â€“ South Korea's
              opposition party Wednesday beat the ruling party in parliamentary
              by-elections which tested a recent rebound in the popularity of
              President Lee Myung-Bak's conservative government.</p>
              <p>The main
              opposition Democratic Party (DP) took three of the five contested
              seats, including two in Suweon and Ansan around the capital. The ruling
              Grand National Party (GNP) took the other two seats.</p>
              <p>The five
              seats were previously held by four GNP lawmakers and one from the DP.
              All were forced to quit after being convicted of election law
              violations.</p>
              <p>The by-elections were seen as a vote of confidence
              in Lee's government, which is seeking public support for policies to
              shore up a nascent economic recovery.</p>
              <p>Lee and his party won crushing victories in the 2007 presidential poll and the 2008 general election.</p>
              <p>But
              his popularity waned in summer 2008 amid mass street protests over a
              decision to resume US beef imports, and the onset of the global
              economic crisis.</p>
              <p>In April his party suffered a crushing defeat
              in by-elections, losing all five parliamentary seats up for grabs at
              that time to independent or opposition candidates.</p>
              <p>The economy
              is now showing strong signs of recovery thanks partly to government
              stimulus measures and aggressive interest rate cuts.</p>
              <p>The
              central bank Monday reported 2.9 percent growth in the third quarter
              compared with April-June, the biggest quarter-on-quarter growth for
              over seven years.</p>
              <p>One opinion poll released on October 12
              showed Lee's approval rating at 54 percent compared with less than 20
              percent at the height of the beef controversy.</p>
              <p>The by-elections
              will not sway the balance of power. With two additional seats, the GNP
              now controls 169 seats in the 299-seat parliament, while the DP has 86.</p>
              <p>Analysts said Lee needed victory, especially in the area around the capital, to push ahead with his free-market reforms.</p>
              <p>"The
              outcome of today's elections, however, will not seriously affect Lee's
              popularity, which runs high due to economic recovery," Sungkyunkwan
              University politics professor Kim Il-Young told AFP.</p>
              <p>The GNP had called on voters to support it to secure stable administrative management.</p>
              <p>"The election is a fight against unilateralism and for checks and balance," DP leader Chung Sye-Kyun said in a statement.</p>
