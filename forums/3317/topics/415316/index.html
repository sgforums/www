              <p>Senior lawyer and former Nominated Member of Parliament Shriniwas Rai, 65, sued Air India after discovering its staff had eaten some sweets he had unintentionally left behind after a flight.</p>
              <p>Mr Rai took Air India to court on November 1, and obtained a default 
              judgment for damages and costs after Air India failed to show up for the
               hearing.</p>
              <p>However, last Wednesday, the airline decided upon an out-of-court settlement with Mr Rai.</p>
              <p>When contacted, Mr Rai told <em>The Sunday Times (ST) </em>that he would donate the sum from the settlement to the Singapore Indian Development Association (Sinda).</p>
              <p>He revealed that he decided to sue the airline because he felt 
              frustrated and upset with how they handled the situation on March 21 
              when he and his wife, after landing at Changi Airport, discovered that 
              they had left three boxes of sweets on the plane.</p>
              <p>The sweets were purchased from New Delhi and were gifts for relatives here in Singapore, he said.</p>
              <p>After several phone calls went unanswered, Mr Rai contacted a 
              Singapore Airport Terminal Services (Sats) officer at the baggage claims
               section and was advised to go to Air India’s office at the terminal.</p>
              <p>At the Air India office, he was told no such bag was found on the 
              plane. However, he noticed a half-empty box of sweets just before he 
              left, according to court papers filed.</p>
              <p>An airline official whom he subsequently spoke to apologised and 
              admitted that the box of sweets had been consumed, with the other two 
              boxes given to the flight crew.</p>
              <p>The boxes of sweets were then promptly recovered from the staff and delivered to Mr Rai’s home within two hours.</p>
              <p>An Air India spokesman told the same paper<em> </em>that the cabin 
              crew usually makes a standard announcement for passengers to check for 
              their personal belongings before they leave the plane.</p>
              <p>“Baggage and belongings left behind by passengers in the aircraft are
               handed over to the security department of the local station,” he added.</p>
              <p>It is also understood that when security staff found the bag of 
              sweets, there was no identification tag, and seeing that it contained 
              perishables, it was kept aside.</p>
              <p>The spokesman also explained that Air India’s counsel did not show up
               in court as “there was some miscommunication between the Air 
              India-appointed lawyer and the local manager in Singapore”.</p>
              <p>A spokesman from Sats also told <em>ST</em> that each airline has their own guidelines on how they handle lost and found items.</p>
              <p>“Sats, being the ground handler, will follow the guidelines provided 
              by each of our airline customers. Lost and found items will first be 
              surrendered to Sats Auxiliary Police for record and acknowledgement. 
              Sats Auxiliary Police will then hand over the items to the Lost and 
              Found Unit which, in turn, will register and hold the items for five to 
              seven days, depending on airlines’ guidelines. If the items remain 
              unclaimed, they will be returned to the airlines.”</p>
