              <p><strong>Organic food not healthier, says British study</strong></p>
              <p class="first">LONDON (AFP) - - Organic food supporters defended the
              benefits of naturally-grown produce on Friday, after a report suggested
              there are no significant health advantages from it.</p>
              <p>In a study published in a US journal this week, researchers at the
              London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) found there were
              no major differences between organic and conventionally-produced food.</p>
              <p>"A small number of differences in nutrient content were found to
              exist between organically and conventionally-produced crops and
              livestock, said Dr. Alan Dangour, principal author of the study.</p>
              <p>"But these are unlikely to be of any public health relevance."</p>
              <p>And he added: "Our review indicates that there is currently no
              evidence to support the selection of organically over
              conventionally-produced foods on the basis of nutritional superiority."</p>
              <p>Organic food, devoid of additives and produced without chemicals
              such as fertilisers and pesticides, has become an increasingly popular
              choice on supermarket shelves in recent years.</p>
              <p>But it is
              typically more expensive than regular foodstuffs, and as such has
              already been hit by the global recession, making shoppers think twice
              about paying more for organically-grown vegetables and such like.</p>
              <p>The
              study, commissioned by Britain's Food Standards Agency (FSA) and
              published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, threatens to
              deal a new blow to the organic food lobby.</p>
              <p>But its supporters underlined other benefits of organic produce, notably for the environment.</p>
              <p>"Organic
              farming is a holistic, integrated approach which conserves soils,
              encourages biodiversity, eliminates greenhouse gas-intensive nitrogen
              inputs, conserves genetic diversity, and brings more income to the
              grower," said Andrew Lee of the Sustainable Development Commission.</p>
              <p>"And is very probably healthier to boot," he wrote in a letter to the Guardian newspaper.</p>
              <p>Molly
              Connisbee of the Soil Association said that organic farms have on
              average 30 percent more species and 50 percent more wildlife like
              birds, butterflies and bees.</p>
              <p>"Other environmental benefits are
              self-evident -- there's less dangerous waste on organic farms and
              almost no pesticide use. Artificial nitrogen fertiliser is banned in
              organic farming, so there's less runoff of nutrients that cause algae
              blooms in coastal waters," she said.</p>
              <p>The British study was based
              on a review of all studies published over the last 50 years relating to
              nutritional content and health differences between the two kinds of
              produce.</p>
