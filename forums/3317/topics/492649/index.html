              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">City Harvest Church leaders to return to court for appeal</span></strong></p>
              <div>
              <div>SINGAPORE: Ten months after they were found guilty of misappropriating S$50 million of church funds, six City Harvest Church (CHC) leaders are seeking to have their convictions overturned by the High Court, where their appeals will be heard over five days from Thursday (Sep 15) before the panel of three judges.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>The saga involves the largest amount of charity funds ever misappropriated in Singapore. After a 144-day trial, the six were sentenced to between 21 months and eight years’ jail for using S$24 million of church funds to bankroll the music career of CHC founder Kong Hee’s wife, Ho Yeow Sun.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Then, the leaders misused another S$26 million to cover up the first amount.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Kong, 51, was sentenced to eight years’ jail and branded “the most culpable” of the six, followed by his deputy Tan Ye Peng, 42, who was sentenced to five years and six months’ jail.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Former board member Chew Eng Han, 55, was sentenced to six years’ jail, while former secretary of the church’s management board, John Lam Leng Hung, 47, was sentenced to three years in prison.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Former finance managers Sharon Tan Shao Yuen, 40, and Serina Wee Gek Yin, 38, were sentenced to 21 months and five years’ jail, respectively. </div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>The five argued at trial they were following Kong’s orders and acting in the interests of the church.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>However, the prosecution argued that each person had a part to play in the “conspiracy”. “They did not merely wait passively for Kong to instruct them … they took their own initiative to deceive and mislead the trusting members of CHC … and cannot escape responsibility for those acts,” prosecutors said.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Lawyers for the six have called the case unprecedented and incomparable. Wee’s lawyer Andre Maniam had said: “Neither the prosecution nor the defence has been able to turn up a precedent when criminal breach of trust was committed by using a charity's funds for its own purposes. We are in uncharted waters."</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Executive members of CHC had pleaded with Judge See Kee Oon to spare the six from jail. “It pains us to know that they face jail terms,” a letter stated. “We believe they wanted to fulfil the Crossover mission, and in their zeal, they overstepped certain boundaries,” the letter, signed by 173 members, read.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>In sentencing the six, the judge acknowledged the incomparable nature of the case, particularly “the lack of any personal wrongful gain, any motive of self-interest or enrichment, and the absence of an intent to cause permanent loss and return of the monies to CHC”, he said.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Still, their actions were unlawful as they were “effectively putting CHC’s funds into their own hands to use as they needed”, despite them being “plainly not authorised” to do so, Judge See had said.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>The judges will also hear an appeal from the prosecution, who had sought stiffer jail terms for the six – about five to 12 years’ jail each – to reflect the gravity of their offences. Prosecutors had said the jail terms imposed were “manifestly inadequate, in all the circumstances of the case”.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Kong and Lam's appeals will be heard on Thursday by Judge of Appeal Chao Hick Tin and Justices Woo Bih Li and Chan Seng Onn. The appeals of Chew and Sharon Tan will be heard on Friday, and the appeals of Tan Ye Peng and Wee will be heard next week.</div>

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Kong Hee's use of City Harvest Church funds in 'good faith': Defence</span></strong></p>
              <div>
              <div>SINGAPORE: City Harvest Church (CHC) founder and Senior Pastor Kong Hee’s appeal was heard on Thursday (Sep 15) afternoon at the High Court before a packed courtroom, in which his wife Sun Ho was also present.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Kong is one of six church leaders convicted and sentenced to between 21 months and eight years’ jail last November  for misappropriating S$50 million of church funds. The pastor received the heaviest sentence of eight years’ jail after he was convicted of three charges for conspiracy to commit criminal breach of trust. </div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Judge See Kee Oon had found in sentencing that Kong played a major role in channeling millions of dollars of church funds – set aside for investments and building-related expenses – into sham bonds, which were then used to fund the secular music career of his wife, who is also a pastor.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>In court on Thursday, Kong's lawyer Edwin Tong said all three of the pastor’s convictions for criminal breach of trust should be overturned.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Kong had never intended to cause wrongful loss to the church, and had put the monies toward the church’s mission which was supported by virtually the entire congregation, the senior counsel said. </div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Mr Tong argued that Kong had not pocketed any of the S$50 million he has been convicted of misappropriating and that the church had not suffered any financial loss as a result of his actions. The prosecution is not disputing these facts.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>In channeling millions of dollars of church funds toward his wife’s secular music career, Kong believed he was acting in the best interests of the church because Ms Ho’s career as a singer was synonymous with what is known as the Crossover Project – the church’s mission to reach out to non-Christians through pop music, the lawyer said.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>He argued that even if the church’s monies had been “wrongfully used” to bankroll Ms Ho’s career, it did not mean that Kong had been dishonest. </div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>"It is beyond question that the accused believed wholeheartedly that they were using church funds for an approved church purpose," Mr Tong said. </div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>The lawyer also rubbished the allegation that Kong had intended to act dishonestly by using church monies to “secretly fund his wife’s career”, as prosecutors have alleged, saying Kong had consistently consulted auditors and lawyers on two bond investments, which Judge See had found to be sham investments.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Even if the investments were a sham, “every cent was used entirely for the church’s mission”, Mr Tong said. “Even if (the church’s funds – meant for investments or building-related expenses) were put to “wrongful use”, they were “applied in good faith” and caused no loss to the church, he added. </div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Thursday was the first of five days of appeals by the six church leaders before a three-judge panel consisting of Judge of Appeal Chao Hick Tin and Justices Woo Bih Li and Chan Seng Onn. </div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Former CHC board member John Lam was the first party to present his appeal, followed by Kong.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Chew Eng Han, CHC’s former investment manager who was sentenced to six years’ jail for his part in the conspiracy, will have his appeal heard next on Friday morning.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>The prosecution, which has lodged its own appeal against the “manifestly inadequate” jail terms of the six accused, is expected to present its case next Tuesday.</div>

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">'He is not guilty': City Harvest appeal begins at the High Court</span></strong></p>
              <div>
              <div>SINGAPORE: City Harvest Church (CHC) is back in the limelight as six of its leaders arrived at the High Court on Thursday (Sep 15) to fight their convictions for misappropriating S$50 million of church funds.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>All six have appealed against their convictions and jail terms ranging from 21 months to eight years. The prosecution has also lodged appeals against the six, and are seeking stiffer jail terms in the unprecedented case, which involves the largest amount of charity funds ever misappropriated in Singapore.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>It is an unusual case because the six leaders did not pocket the money and did not cause any financial loss to the church.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Prosecutors contended the six leaders had "cultivated and abused the exceptional trust and faith which CHC's members placed in them" by misappropriating millions via "complex and sophisticated transactions ... covered up with numerous cunning deceptions to avoid detection".</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>John Lam, who was found guilty of three charges for conspiring to commit criminal breach of trust and sentenced to three years' jail, kick-started the appeal on Thursday morning.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>His lawyer, Senior Counsel Kenneth Tan, argued Lam had not been in the "core group" which controlled the church's funds, millions of which were channelled into sham investment bonds that were later used to bankroll the secular music career of CHC founder and senior pastor Kong Hee's wife Ho Yeow Sun, popularly known as Sun Ho.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>"Mr Lam is not guilty," Mr Tan told the court. A panel of three judges - Judge of Appeal Chao Hick Tin and Justices Woo Bih Li and Chan Seng Onn - are presiding over the appeal, scheduled to be heard over five days.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Mr Tan pointed to the fact that Lam was found not to have been "intimately involved" in the sham bond investments in two CHC-linked companies, music production firm Xtron and glass manufacturer Firna.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>In finding Lam guilty, the judge had made "inferences" that Lam must have known that Kong and their four co-accused controlled the sham investments, Mr Tan said.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>He argued this "inference" was not "inevitable and inexorable", and is not enough to hold Lam liable, especially since the judge had conceded that Lam was not intimately involved in the operation. "This is the linchpin of our argument," said Mr Tan, adding that Lam knew as much as his fellow board members, and nothing more.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Given his lack of "operational knowledge" of the conspiracy to misappropriate church funds via sham bond investments, "Lam honestly believed that the bonds were genuine investments", Mr Tan said, and that is why he supported them.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>"John Lam had no role in the conspiracy," he added. </div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Kong's appeal will be heard in the afternoon. Kong was found guilty of three charges for conspiracy to commit criminal breach of trust and sentenced to eight years' jail, the stiffest jail term handed down to any of the six leaders.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>His wife, Sun Ho, arrived with him on Thursday morning and was present in court.</div>

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">'I thought Sun Ho was a megastar': Chew Eng Han says of church's Crossover Project</span></strong></p>
              <div>
              <div>SINGAPORE: The High Court on Friday morning (Sep 16) heard the appeal of Chew Eng Han, who was sentenced to six years' jail last November for his part in misappropriating S$50 million of City Harvest Church funds.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Chew, who served as the church's investment manager, argued he should be acquitted because "there was no misappropriation". He said the sentencing judge had "gravely erred" in his ruling, and used a flawed definition of misappropriation.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Though Chew conceded that the S$50 million - set aside for the church’s investments and building-related expenses - had instead been channelled towards the secular music career of Sun Ho, who is the wife of CHC founder and senior pastor Kong Hee, Chew argued the sentencing judge had "automatically" assumed this had been done with dishonest intent.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Chew said this cannot be the case, because "the church had not been deprived", but rather benefitted, from the channelling of funds toward "a church purpose" - Ms Ho's music career, known as the Crossover Project.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>"The logic is Sun becomes a megastar, (holds more) concerts ... then she can evangelise,” Chew said, adding that he had attended two concerts himself and believed "100 per cent" in the Crossover Project, even donating S$1 million towards it.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Having done so, it is "illogical for me to want to cause loss to the church," he said.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div><strong>CHURCH’S FUNDING OF CROSSOVER PROJECT A ‘SECRET’: CHEW</strong></div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Chew also told the court the funding of the Crossover Project had been a "secret". This was not because the six conspirators knew or thought that it was illegal to use church funds in this way, but because "Kong Hee was afraid of being exposed for rigging Sun Ho's success".</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>"Kong's guilt should not be automatically imputed to others,” Chew said. Pointing to an e-mail Kong wrote to co-accused John Lam in January 2005, Chew said he had been "brainwashed" into supporting the Crossover Project as Kong regularly played up Ho's success.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Chew said Kong had explicitly told board members that no church monies were used, in a bid to “avoid public controversy”. Justice Chan Seng Onn said such a lie “gives me a sense he was trying to deceive (the members)”.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>"Kong's guilt should not be automatically imputed to others,” Chew said. He added that Kong regularly played up his wife’s success, pointing to several e-mails “typical of the news that we received (about Sun)”.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>“I need our members to be super proud of her and realise that we do have a singing diva in our midst”, Kong wrote in an e-mail in January 2005. </div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>"I thought she was a megastar,” Chew said. In reality, the church had bought up unsold copies of Ms Ho’s albums, the court heard. "If this was a conspiracy, it is the worst thought-out conspiracy ever,” Chew said.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>"It looks that way to me too,” Judge of Appeal Chao Hick Tin responded, prompting laughter from the public gallery.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div><strong>DON’T TAR SHARON WITH THE SAME BRUSH: LAWYER</strong></div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>The High Court heard the appeal of CHC finance manager Sharon Tan on Friday afternoon. Tan was found guilty of seven charges and sentenced to 21 months in prison, the lightest jail term among the six.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Her lawyer Paul Seah pointed out Tan had never held a key leadership role in the church, and that prosecutors had “never made a case that she was tied up in the conspiracy to use the sham bonds to fund the Crossover Project”.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Mr Seah said Tan was “kept out of the loop in key discussions”, and whenever she was pulled in to help with financial planning, her role was simple –  “to provide facts and figures”.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>“The trial judge erred in tarring Sharon with the same brush as the other co-accused”, Mr Seah said, adding that Tan had no motive or intent to cause harm to the church, and was acting on the instructions of the church’s leaders.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>The appeal continues on Monday. </div>

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Secrecy surrounding Sun Ho's career did not amount to dishonesty: Lawyer</span></strong></p>
              <p>SINGAPORE: Secrecy surrounding the inner workings of City Harvest Church's Crossover Project was to ensure its success and did not amount to dishonesty, the defence lawyer for one of the six church leaders appealing their convictions and sentences said on Monday (Sep 19).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Senior Counsel Andre Maniam, representing former finance manager Serina Wee, said the Crossover Project  –  the church's attempt to reach out to non-Christians by propelling senior pastor Kong Hee's wife, pastor Sun Ho, to pop stardom – said there was secrecy around the project because Kong wanted to distance the church from his wife’s secular singing career.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>“That is fundamentally the basis of the Crossover Project. If (Ms Ho) was seen as a gospel singer, she was just another gospel singer”, Mr Maniam said. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>“The idea ... is if she makes it big in the entertainment industry, people who would normally not step into a church will go to her concerts and we can pitch (an evangelical) message to them. It’s unconventional, some would say controversial. But for it to succeed, she could not be seen as a church-funded gospel singer”, the lawyer argued. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Wee, who was also the administrator of the Crossover Project, was convicted of 10 charges and sentenced to five years’ jail last November for her role in misappropriating S$50 million in church funds towards Ms Ho's career. She dealt with the project’s finances and cash flow, the High Court heard. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Like the other five church leaders appealing their sentences, Wee claimed she acted in the best interests of the church and was never dishonest in handling the church’s funds.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Mr Maniam said Wee believed monies transferred to two church-linked companies – monies which ultimately went towards Sun Ho’s career – were genuine investments authorised by church leaders. “If she couldn’t convince herself that what she was doing was right, then she wouldn’t have done it”, Mr Maniam said.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The lawyer added Wee expected that others – including her co-defendants deputy senior pastor Tan Ye Peng and former investment manager Chew Eng Han – had checked with the church’s auditors and lawyers before investing in the bonds. “She was one-removed, but equally comforted” by the understanding that her superiors had checked with the experts, Mr Maniam said. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Tan also had his appeal heard earlier on Monday. Tan's lawyer, Senior Counsel N Sreenivasan, argued that the pastor held an honest belief that “the (church) funds were used for a purpose that is not just permitted but positively mandated, and would be … returned in full with interest to CHC”.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Mr Sreenivasan said the investments were “dual-purpose” transactions, which aimed to achieve both the church’s evangelical objectives while resulting in financial gain for the church.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Monday marked the end of three days of appeals by the six of the church leaders convicted in relation to the case. The prosecution, which has launched its own appeal to press for stiffer sentences to be handed down, will make its case on Tuesday.  </p>

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">'Noble ends cannot justify criminal means', prosecutors tell City Harvest leaders</span></strong></p>
              <div>
              <div>SINGAPORE: Six City Harvest Church (CHC) leaders have argued they did not misuse S$50 million of church funds with sinister intent, but prosecutors on Tuesday (Sep 20) said that this cannot justify "telling lies and misappropriating money".</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Deputy Public Prosecutor Christopher Ong said that even if the offenders, including pastors Kong Hee and Tan Ye Peng, did so "in good faith", "what essentially they ended up convincing themselves of is that the ends justify the means".</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>In that "dangerous climate ... crimes ended up being committed. No matter what the means, the sentence meted out cannot send the message that if you think your ends were noble then the means you choose are going to be mitigated by your ends ... no matter what your ends may be, crime is not the means you should choose", added DPP Ong.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>The six were convicted last year of misappropriating S$50 million of church funds to secretly bankroll the secular career of Kong's wife, Sun Ho.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>To keep the church's hand in her career under wraps, millions were channelled through two companies - one of them being music production firm Xtron.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Prosecutors allege Kong controlled Xtron, and the millions passing through it. At trial, Kong had denied this, saying he was involved only as a "liaison". This "seems to reduce him to the role of a postman", prosecutors said, but the evidence shows Kong was in full control of ... the millions", DPP Ong said.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>He pointed out that Kong "can't seem to decide how much control (he had)" and has routinely changed his evidence surrounding this point to his convenience. "(Kong) has no credibility whatsoever," the prosecutor said.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Kong's influence over Xtron was so great that he sometimes single-handedly made decisions regarding millions of dollars of church funds, bypassing the company's directors, the High Court heard.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>His co-accused, former CHC board member John Lam, had admitted during the 143-day trial that if Kong disagreed with Xtron's directors, "Kong's view would prevail", DPP Ong said.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Turning to Kong's co-accused, prosecutors refused to accept they had been "brainwashed" and said they should be held responsible for their roles in the conspiracy.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>"They are clearly intelligent people ... it's too simplistic to view this as them submitting to Kong's vision. This is not a case of these people being just everyday church members and Kong being the pastor right at the top. These are all leaders", DPP Ong argued.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Kong's right-hand man, pastor Tan, had "peddled untruths" to the church's auditors, telling them Xtron's directors made decisions independently. Former investment manager Chew Eng Han also "planned for lies to be told" to auditors, and had a major hand in designing round-tripping transactions to disguise the origin of monies channelled into Ms Ho's career, prosecutors said.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>They said former finance managers Serina Wee and Sharon Tan knew the transactions were not genuine, yet "misrepresented" them as legitimate transactions to the church's board members and in the church's accounts.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Lam - who prosecutors said "was at the apex of CHC's leadership" - together with pastors Kong and Tan, was complicit in hiding the truth from his fellow board members. The former treasurer of the board had also had a hand in drafting the church's investment policy. However, his concern in doing this was "not to ensure CHC's investments were safe, but to ensure the sham Xtron bonds" would not be discovered, DPP Ong said.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>The deceptive and manipulative actions of the six allowed the conspiracy to continue "in a climate of unquestioning acceptance", prosecutors told the court.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>The appeal continues on Wednesday morning, when prosecutors will make their case for stiffer sentences to be meted out to the six offenders.  </div>
