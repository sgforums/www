              reducing negative tension seen in the media between locals and new 
              immigrants were some challenges raised by the People's Association 
              Integration Council at its first work-plan session on Saturday.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The Council was formed in July, to give greater focus and strategic direction in integrating Singapore's new immigrants.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Having a buddy 
              system for neighbours comprising new immigrants and local Singaporeans 
              was among suggestions raised by the Integration Council to reduce 
              cliques in the community.<br><br>Associate Professor Fatimah Lateef, 
              advisor, People's Association Integration Council, said: "Humans, by 
              nature, actually want to clique together according to their 
              similarities. So you'll find sometimes the Chinese may clique together, 
              the Indians may clique together because it gives them comfort and 
              security. To break that clique, you have to make them comfortable."<br><br>Other
               ideas include highlighting good examples of new immigrants and locals 
              in the media, recruiting new citizens as volunteers, and having heritage
               activities.<br><br>Over the next six months, the Integration Council 
              will hold a series of meetings to discuss how to develop the suggestions
               raised at this work plan seminar into more concrete plans. <br><br>Once
               this is decided, the Council will recommend a series of action plans to
               the Integration and Naturalisation Champions in all 87 constituencies.<br><br>Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong had, in his National Day Rally speech, expressed concern over anti-foreigner sentiments.<br><br>The Council said tackling this is a two-way process.<br><br>David
               Tay, chairman, People's Association Integration Council, said: "For 
              example, certain races speak quite loudly in their home. And when they 
              came here they didn't know it's a different society. We have got to 
              slowly integrate and get these norms over to them... I believe that can 
              be overcome and we can integrate them... We Singaporeans can be a bit 
              more gracious, show our kindness."<br><br>The Council feels this will go a long way in integrating new citizens to Singapore.<br><br>Separately,
               on Law Minister K Shanmugam's recent Facebook post suggesting a legal 
              framework to deal with social nuisance, Associate Professor Fatimah said
               where minor matters are concerned, it's best to deal with it on a 
              personal level.<br><br>"What I believe is that if we have these minor 
              ones, some very personal ones we can approach them personally, talk to 
              them, try to understand what is it they have as a bias," said Associate 
              Professor Fatimah.<br><br>"But to actually enact a law officially and 
              formally against social nuisances, it depends. I think because there is a
               whole spectrum we have to deal with. I think we should think about this
               carefully," she added.<br><br>- CNA/cc</span></span></p>
