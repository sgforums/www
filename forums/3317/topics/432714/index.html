              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Company director Ian McArthur could hardly believe 
              his eyes when he saw the bill for lunch with his friend on Wednesday: It
               came up to $1,107.32, including S$348.80 for a 1.6kg lobster and $564 
              for a 3kg crab. </span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The Scot, who has been working here since last October, told TODAY: "I thought, 'It must be wrong. I can't believe this.'" </span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Mr McArthur then 
              approached the staff of Forum Seafood Village - a restaurant at Boat 
              Quay - seeking an explanation. He was told that those were the market 
              prices.<br><br>But Mr McArthur told TODAY that the staff did not inform 
              them how much the crustaceans weighed or the total cost before cooking 
              the food. "It wasn't just the price. We feel that we were misled that's 
              why we were upset about it," he added.<br><br>Apart from the king crab and lobster, Mr McArthur and his friend had a plate of fried rice and four glasses of beer.<br><br>Alleging
               that he was "grossly overcharged", Mr McArthur filed a complaint with 
              the Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE) on Wednesday against the 
              restaurant, seeking a S$900 refund.<br><br>But Mr Vincent Hoh, a 
              restaurant employee who served Mr McArthur, said he told the diners the 
              crustaceans' weight. When asked if he told the diners the total cost of 
              the crustaceans, Mr Hoh replied he did not.<br><br>Forum Seafood Village
               manager Jo Chia said the restaurant does not usually inform diners of 
              the total price of their seafood, unless diners ask for it.<br><br>Said 
              Ms Chia: "We tried to tell customers (the total price) but some guests 
              say it's too troublesome and tell us not to bother them."<br><br>Some 
              patrons have also commented that, by informing them of the total price, 
              the staff would be suggesting that they could not afford it, Mr Hoh 
              said.<br><br>Ms Chia pointed out the restaurant's seafood prices are 
              listed clearly - according to cost per 100g - at the restaurant's 
              entrance and on the menu. "Our prices are market prices. We won't 
              overcharge our customers," she said. <br><br>Ms Chia said the restaurant's owner is overseas and has not decided on its course of action with regard to the complaint.<br><br>Forum
               Seafood Village, which operates two outlets along Boat Quay, charges 
              S$21.80 per 100g for the Australian lobster and S$18.80 per 100g for the
               king crab, after discounts. The usual prices were S$32 and S$25 per 
              100g for the lobster and king crab, respectively. <br><br>A check with 
              neighbouring restaurants found one restaurant charging S$18.80 per 100g 
              for the Australian lobster and another charging S$10 per 100g for 
              Alaskan King Crab.<br><br>Responding to TODAY's queries, CASE said it 
              has received 12 complaints for overcharging by food and beverage outlets
               in the first five months of this year. There were 27 complaints last 
              year, up from 15 in 2009.</span></span></p>

              <p>isnt it a bit too late to complain?</p>
              <p>there is no way now to determine the weight of the lobster and crabs. </p>
              <p>this is not the first time someone complain of overcharging.  if you dont want to risk getting overcharged ask for the price first.  no point complaining after eating. </p>
              <p>btw if he wants reasonable prices he should have eaten at one of our friendly neighbourhood coffeeshops.</p>

              <h1 class="headline">Would you pay $130 for a plate of crab bee hoon?</h1>
              <p>The chef of a popular seafood restaurant at Geylang has defended 
              charging his customers high prices, including $130 for a plate of <em>crab bee hoon</em>.</p>
              <p>The restaurant in question, Sin Huat Seafood Restaurant, is under the spotlight after a <em>Yahoo!</em> reader said she was charged $421 for a dinner for four adults and two 
              children when she visited the eatery for dinner earlier this month.</p>
              <p>Salesperson Gelene Ong, who went there with her family of six, received a rude shock when she saw the final bill.</p>
              <p>Her dinner consisted of crab bee hoon ($130), <span id="lw_1308305306_9" class="yshortcuts">scallops</span> ($50), conch or <em>gong gong</em> ($50), <span id="lw_1308305306_3" class="yshortcuts">prawns</span> ($77), frog legs ($78) and vegetables ($12). Other items on the bill were peanuts and drinks ($20.40) and wet towels ($3.60).</p>
              <p>However, chef Danny Lee said in response, "It's all a one-man show. Every dish we have, I make sure I take the
              orders and cook it myself. I also make sure that my ingredients are
              clean and fresh."</p>
              <p>When <em>Yahoo! Singapore</em> visited his restaurant this week, he also explained the steps he takes to ensure that his dishes are fresh.</p>
              <p>"For my <em>gong gong </em>(<span id="lw_1308305306_4" class="yshortcuts">conch</span>), I always tell people 'if you don't take my <em>gong gong</em> here, try not to take it elsewhere. I keep my <em>gong gong</em> in the tanks for a week for it to clear out the mud and dirt."</p>
              <p>He also voiced his doubts that other <span id="lw_1308305306_0" class="yshortcuts">seafood restaurants</span> actually serve live seafood.</p>
              <p>"They are serving such a big crowd everyday and they always only
              have a few fishes in the tanks. At the end of the day, you still see
              the fish swimming in the tank," said the chef.</p>
              <p>At the time, customer Ong said she had visited the restaurant
              because the place was recommended by her friend who said she should try
              the crab bee hoon.</p>
              <p>But she said she "didn't expect it to be so
              expensive" and was also put off by the lack of communication between her and the restaurant. She
              was not informed of the prices when her orders were taken.</p>
              <p>"The
              restaurant had no menu. The service crew was also pushy about getting
              us to order an extra fish when we already had so much food," Ong added.</p>
              <p>The extra fish she was asked to order was <em>Cheng yu</em>, otherwise known as Parrot Fish, and it comes at $120 per kilogram.</p>
              <p>Chef Lee clarified that his restaurant does not provide menus.</p>
              <p>"We don't have a menu. People who come here know me and, most of the 
              time, they will ask me how much the dishes are. It just happened that on
               the day she visited the restaurant, she did not ask for the prices. 
              Even if she asked, I would not have charged her differently," Lee said.</p>
              <p>Chef Lee took out a stack of receipts to show the amount paid by 
              other customers. It was exactly as he said: the prices were 
              standardised.</p>
              <p>It's not the first time the seafood restaurant has hit the headlines.</p>
              <p>Chef Lee, who is known to be the "food nazi of Geylang", can be quite obnoxious, according to reviews posted on popular <span id="lw_1308305306_1" class="yshortcuts">food</span> site HungryGoWhere.</p>
              <p>Potential
               customers visiting Sin Huat are also warned to be prepared for long 
              waits and should avoid ordering from food stalls beside the restaurant.</p>
              <p>"Sometimes people complain I serve too slow. I only have two hands 
              and I'm the only cook. People may see me looking like I'm angry or 
              impatient because I have no time to entertain them," Chef Lee explained.</p>
              <p>His favourite customers are those who know how to appreciate good food.</p>
              <p>"No
               point buying cheap food and it doesn't taste good. There's nothing 
              special about that," said the owner of the restaurant who's hosted the 
              likes of celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain.</p>
              <p>Expensive meals have been in the limelight recently. Last month, <em>Yahoo! Singapore </em>ran a story about nasi lemak going for $8.30 along Upper Serangoon Road.</p>
              <p>An expatriate diner was also charged $1,107.32 for a seafood lunch for two at Boat Quay's  Forum Seafood Village Restaurant earlier this week, reported Today newspaper.</p>
              <p>CASE has received 12 complaints for alleged overcharging by food and beverage outlets from January to May this year.</p>

              <p>Salesperson Gelene Ong, who went there with her family of six,
              received a rude shock when she saw the final bill.</p>
              <p>Her dinner consisted of crab bee hoon ($130), <span>scallops</span> ($50), conch or <em>gong gong</em> ($50),
              <span>prawns</span> ($77), frog legs ($78) and vegetables

              about getting us to order an extra fish when we already had so much
              food," Ong added.</p>
              <p>The extra fish she was asked to order was <em>Cheng yu</em>,
              otherwise known as Parrot Fish, and it comes at $120 per
              kilogram.</p>
              <p>Chef Lee clarified that his restaurant does not provide
              menus.</p>
              <p>"We don't have a menu. People who come here know me and, most of
              the time, they will ask me how much the dishes are. It just
              happened that on the day she visited the restaurant, she did not
              ask for the prices. Even if she asked, I would not have charged her
              differently," Lee said.</p>
              <p>Chef Lee took out a stack of receipts to show the amount paid by
              other customers. It was exactly as he said: the prices were
              standardised.</p>
              <p>It's not the first time the seafood restaurant has hit the
              headlines.</p>
              <p>Chef Lee, who is known to be the "food nazi of Geylang", can be
              quite obnoxious, according to reviews posted on popular
              <span>food</span> site HungryGoWhere.</p>
              <p>Potential customers visiting Sin Huat are also warned to be
              prepared for long waits and should avoid ordering from food stalls
              beside the restaurant.</p>
              <p>"Sometimes people complain I serve too slow. I only have two
              hands and I'm the only cook. People may see me looking like I'm
              angry or impatient because I have no time to entertain them," Chef
              Lee explained.</p>
              <p>His favourite customers are those who know how to appreciate
              good food.</p>
              <p>"No point buying cheap food and it doesn't taste good. There's
              nothing special about that," said the owner of the restaurant who's
              hosted the likes of celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain.</p>
              <p>Expensive meals have been in the limelight recently. Last month,
              <em>Yahoo! Singapore</em> ran a story about nasi lemak going for
              $8.30 along Upper Serangoon Road.</p>
              <p>An expatriate diner was also charged $1,107.32 for a seafood
              lunch for two at Boat Quay's  Forum Seafood Village Restaurant
              earlier this week, reported Today newspaper.</p>
              <p>CASE has received 12 complaints for alleged overcharging by food
              and beverage outlets from January to May this year.</p>

              <p>she should blame the one who recommended her the restaurant for not telling her its expensive.  not the restaurant/</p>
              <p>btw the moment she knew there would be no menu she should have asked for the prices or leave immediately.  not complain after that.</p>
              <p>anyway dont patronise them anymore since its ex to her point of view. </p>
              <p>for me i definitely wont eat at places that doesnt with no menu. </p>
