              <p><span>SINGAPORE: The Singapore government recognises the concerns of
              its citizens over the rapid increase of foreigners in the country in
              recent years. As a result, it has reviewed its process of granting
              permanent residency and citizenship.
              <br> <br>Deputy Prime Minister Wong Kan Seng said as Singaporeans are not
              replacing themselves, the country also needs to tap on immigration to
              augment its population.
              <br> <br>Speaking in Parliament during the Committee of Supply debate for
              the Prime Minister's Office, Mr Wong explained that tackling population
              challenges are about finding the right dynamic balance and trade-offs.
              <br> <br>36-year-old researcher Dr Xue Bo came from China five years ago. He
              started life here like any other expatriate living in a condominium
              with his family.
              <br> <br> But in 2007, Dr Xue moved to the heartlands into public housing.
              <br> <br> That's where he met Alan Lim who opened his eyes to all things Singaporean.
              <br> <br>Not ony did Mr Lim help Dr Xue's family orientate themselves in the
              new neighbourhood, he also included them in his social circles and
              introduced them to his friends.
              <br> <br>Mr Lim said: "Most of the time we bring him to church on weekends
              and we bring him to visit places like Sentosa and also to educate him
              about the Peranakan culture. I think most Singaporeans should go out of
              their way more to help the immigrants.
              <br> <br>“Put yourself in his condition. You come to a place where you don't
              know anybody. So I think it's good if you can help the person to settle
              down. You don't gain anything but you will find that the person is more
              receptive to you and as the days go by you will find that the person
              will be a good friend to you."
              <br> <br>Dr Xue Bo said: "Without their help, we won't have the feeling of
              being at home. Now we treat them really as family members. Now we
              consider Singapore as second hometown."
              <br> <br> Today, Dr Xue and his family are all PRs and his story is a familiar one.
              <br> <br> Last year, the government granted 59,500 permanent residency and 19,900 citizenships.
              <br> <br> That's about 20,000 fewer PRs and some 600 fewer citizenships granted in 2008.
              <br> <br>Mr Wong said the number of permanent residency granted will be
              reduced although there will be no absolute cap to this and there will
              be up to 20,000 new citizens a year.
              <br> <br> The number is derived from Singapore's low fertility rate of 1.23 - among the lowest in the world.
              <br> <br>Mr Wong said: "Immigration is a key source of population
              augmentation which we cannot afford to do without. In a nutshell, we
              need 60,000 babies just to replace our resident population. But we only
              have about 37,000 babies per year. This is why we need about 20,000 new
              citizens in order to keep our citizen core.
              <br> <br> But still, as MPs point out, there are concerns on the ground.
              <br> <br>MP for Tanjong Pagar GRC Indranee Rajah said: "If you think of
              Singapore as a family, the Singapore citizen is the biological child
              asking why do you care for my foster brother and sister more than me?
              <br> <br>MP for MacPherson Mathias Yao, said: "Singaporeans began to feel
              that the Singaporean way of life was being encroached on or even slowly
              changed. Some do not like it. While they have no problem living in a
              multiracial, multi cultural society, and indeed that is what Singapore
              is, they nevertheless feel that it has to be a Singaporean society and
              not a new imported society that is alien to those born and bred here,"
              said <br> <br> Mr Wong added the government will ensure that those who sink their
              roots here contribute to Singapore economically and integrate well into
              society. <br> The National Integration Council is already spearheading efforts for that. 
              <br> <br> There was also an assurance that the government will stand by the
              principle that Singaporeans come first in their own country. But not at
              the expense of meritocracy and turning away suitable foreign talents.
              <br> <br>Mr Wong said: "We need to be sensible and balanced about how we go
              about this. For instance, we should never undermine the principle of
              meritocracy which makes us competitive and which ensures communal
              harmony and social cohesion. <br> <br> “We must also avoid making ourselves so unattractive that suitable
              foreigners are deterred from sinking roots and becoming a part of
              Singapore. There is a global competition for good people with talent
              and if we make Singapore an inhospitable place, we will lose out.
              <br> <br>“We will do ourselves great harm if others outside Singapore have
              the wrong impression that we are xenophobic. This will be against our
              national interest".
              <br> <br> So Mr Wong said finding the right balance is crucial.
              <br> <br>He added: "Singapore grew and prospered since its founding because
              of our great-grandparents, grandparents and parents were allowed to
              come and settle to make a better life and in the process contribute to
              Singapore's growth. Had they been denied the opportunity to do so at
              that time, we would not be born here and Singapore would not be what it
              is today. <br> <br> "In future, the children and grandchildren of today's immigrants who
              take root here will grow up with our children and grandchildren.
              Together they will be the next generation of Singaporeans and Singapore
              will be their home as much as it is our home today."
              <br> <br> Most foreigners in Singapore are transient workers. They number 1.25 million out of a total population of about five million. 
              <br> <br>Mr Wong said such workers make up an important part of the
              workforce and their economic contributions to Singapore's growth are
              real and significant.
              <br> <br>He explained: "Transient foreign workers are here to work and will
              eventually return to their home countries. Most of them do not sink
              roots. We should appreciate their contributions to Singapore as they
              have helped us to grow our GDP. <br> <br> “In turn, with economic growth, we have the resources to develop
              infrastructure and support programmes which have raised the quality of
              life of Singaporeans. <br> <br> “Economic growth has also enabled us to accumulate reserves in good
              times which we have been able to rely on to sustain and support
              Singaporeans during lean and tough times.”</span></p>
