              <p>The Health Sciences Authority, HSA, is strongly advising consumers who
              have purchased a product called "Huo Luo Jing Dan" not to consume it. <br> <br> If they have done so, they should seek medical advice if they feel unwell or are concerned about their health. <br> <br> The product was brought to the attention of HSA’s Vigilance Branch
              following an adverse reaction report submitted by a doctor who <br> suspected that his patient suffered an adverse effect from the product. <br> <br> The adverse reaction report involved a 50 year-old female patient. <br> <br> She developed swelling of the throat following an infection which did not heal readily and was hospitalised. <br> <br> The patient was also reported to have developed facial features (moon face). <br> <br> She was found to have taken the product for several years which likely
              is the cause of her reduced immunity and altered facial features. <br> <br> She has since recovered and was discharged from the hospital after discontinuing the product. <br> <br> HSA says its tests showed that the product contains three potent
              undeclared western medicinal ingredients, namely indomethacin,
              dexamethasone and prednisolone. <br> <br> Their prolonged use can cause harmful effects such as weak bones
              leading to osteoporosis, increased risk of contracting severe infection
              and increased blood pressure, stomach bleeding and ulceration and
              kidney failure. <br> <br> "Huo Luo Jing Dan" has been promoted as a Chinese medicine to improve
              blood circulation, to relieve pain, rheumatism, arthritis, limbs
              numbness and body ache. <br> <br> The product is packaged in a dark plastic bottle with gold-coloured label and contains red capsules. <br> <br> HSA's investigations revealed that the manufacturer of the product as
              stated on the product insert "China Tian Jin Ren Ji" is fraudulent and
              does not exist. <br> <br> The patient had bought the product through a friend who could not be contacted. <br> <br> HSA strongly urges members of the public who are aware of the product
              being sold illegally, to provide information to assist investigation by
              contacting its Enforcement Branch at Tel: 6866 3485 (24-hour line) or
              Email: hsa_is@hsa.gov.sg. <br> <br> It also reminds consumers are reminded of the risks of purchasing
              health products from dubious sources. In addition, consumers are
              advised to be wary of products that promise quick cures of serious
              conditions with claims that sound too good to be true.</p>
