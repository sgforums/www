                                      </div>
                                      <p>The young mother-of-two, whose drug addiction ruined her liver transplant, arrived in Singapore yesterday hoping for a "live liver'' transplant operation that could save her life.</p>
                                      <p>The trip comes thanks to a $258,000 loan from the WA Government.<br><br>Miss Murray,  24, told Channel Nine before boarding the flight in Perth that she was "n<span class="260540010-05032010"><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial;">ervous and scared and a bit excited as well''.<br><br>Asked why she was scared, she said: "I<span class="260540010-05032010"><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial;">'m scared I'll die in the operating theatre.''</span></span></span></span></p>
                                      <p>There were chaotic scenes at Perth Airport as Miss Murray - surrounded by security guards - boarded the plane just after midday.</p>
                                      <div id="sidebar-start" class="assistive sidebar-jump"><br>Her unclue, Adam Curtis, told the media: "Her health is fading fast."</div>
                                      <p> </p>
                                      <p>Miss Murray has been told by doctors that she only has months to live if she does not receive a liver transplant.</p>
                                      <p>She has admitted to taking drugs after her first liver transplant last year - but has pledged to make the most of her second chance at life after being told she could not be considered for a second transplant in WA.</p>
                                      <p>There are seven other people in WA who were waiting for their first liver transplant.</p>
                                      <p>Doctors say it would be unfair for Ms Murray to jump the queue for a second liver.</p>
                                      <p>But, Health Minister Kim Hames said the WA Government was prepared to pay for her and her father to travel to Singapore so she could be considered for a "live" liver transplant.</p>
                                      <p>The loan will be interest free.</p>
                                      <p>Ms Murray and members of her family will fly to Singapore today.</p>
                                      <p>Family members of Ms Murray have agreed to act as guarantors to the loan.</p>
                                      <p>The procedure would use a piece of a liver from a living family member, but it is understood that Ms Murray's father is not a compatible donor.</p>
                                      <p>It is understood that doctors at the Asian Centre for Liver Diseases and Transplantation in Singapore have carried out more than 100 successful live donor liver transplants.</p>

              <p><strong>  THE Perth mother of two whose taxpayer-assisted liver transplant has
              divided WA has opened up on her fears and regrets, declaring "I don't
              deserve a second chance". </strong></p>
              </div>
               
              <p>Claire
              Murray, who will undergo a life or death ``live'' liver transplant on
              Wednesday, said: `` I'd rather die than be an addict and now I've put
              my family in the predicament where one of them can die trying to save
              me for a second time.''</p>
              <p>The recovering heroin addict, who celebrates her 25th birthday on Sunday, has prepared herself for the worst.</p>
              <p>``I've already accepted the death part of it,'' she said from her Singapore hospital bed.</p>
              <p>``I've
              put a lot of people through a lot of pain and just to wake up every
              day, wake up knowing what I've done, how many times I've done it, how
              many people I've hurt. It's just a really hard thing.''</p>
              <p>If her
              transplant fails, Ms Murray has written emotionally-charged letters of
              explanation to her two children -- Chloe, 6, and Taj, 4 -- her parents,
              brother and sister and uncles and aunties.</p>
              
              <p>She has also sealed birthday cards for Chloe and Taj to let them know mum is still looking over them.<br> It can also be revealed:</p>
              <p>*
              WA Health Minister Kim Hames has signalled he would be reluctant to
              chase down the $250,000 interest-free loan provided to the Murray
              family to enable the life-saving operation in the event of Ms Murray
              failing to survive the risky medical procedure.</p>
              <p>* Dr Hames has
              admitted the State Government has begun to field requests from severely
              ill West Australians and their family members for financial help
              similar to that given to Ms Murray.</p>
              <p>* Ms Murray said she has
              tried to talk her mother, Val, and aunt, Carolynn, out of donating part
              of their liver for the operation. The two women have endured a week of
              medical tests at Singapore's Mt Elizabeth Hospital to work out which
              one is the best fit to give Ms Murray part of their liver. They face a
              one-in-100 chance they could die on the operating table, compared with
              Ms Murray's 80 per cent odds of survival.</p>
              <p>* Ms Murray has
              already made plans for her funeral, saying she wants to be buried in
              her new black-and-gold Adidas tracksuit because she can't bear the
              thought of going to her grave in a dress.</p>
              <p>Dr Hames agreed he had
              set a precedent that could open the floodgates for other desperate
              cases. ``It is possible that that's what I've done,'' he acknowledged.</p>
              <p>``That does expose our State Government to some risk and as a minister I have to wear that.''<br> He admitted the decision may mean further payouts for State Treasury.</p>
              <p>``It is true,'' he said. ``I will have to consider other people who come forward with similar cases.</p>
              <p>``There have been some requests come through.''</p>
              <p>Ms
              Murray's plight has polarised West Australians since Nationals MP Vince
              Catania and Labor MP Martin Whitely brought her case to the public's
              attention last month.</p>
              <p>She received her first donor liver last
              year because she had acute liver failure caused by 12 years of
              addiction to heroin and amphetamines. But the donor liver failed,
              giving her only months to live without another transplant.</p>
              <p>Ms
              Murray admitted taking drugs after the first transplant and was
              prevented from returning to the transplant waiting list by national
              protocols that forbid persistent substance abusers from being eligible
              for donor organs.</p>
              <p>Dr Hames this week said the decision taken by doctors at Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital's transplant unit was the right one.</p>
              <p>``They
              discussed her case three times and then formed the view that giving her
              another chance just wasn't appropriate in the view of the ones that
              were still waiting, and I agreed with them,'' he said.</p>
              <p>In a controversial move, the State Government gave the Murray family a $250,000 interest-free loan over two years.</p>
              <p>Doctors in Singapore agreed to carry out a live liver transplant and Ms Murray and her family flew out of Perth on March 5.</p>
              <p>Dr Hames was not keen to commit the State Government to recovering the debt from the Murray family if the operation failed.</p>
              <p>``Would
              I take them to court and seize the house to get it back? I think I'd
              need to make (that) decision at the time -- obviously it would be a
              very hard thing to do,'' he said.</p>

              <div><br>Ms Murray flew from Perth to Singapore last week, hoping to have the life-saving surgery.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>The 25-year-old former heroin addict has already had one liver transplant which failed after she returned to drugs.</div>
              <p>The WA government refused her family's request for a second liver, but controversially agreed to an interest-free $258,000 loan to allow her and her family to travel to Singapore to undergo a live liver donation, where part of a donor's liver is cut away and transplanted into Ms Murray.</p>
              <p>At first it was thought her mother Val would be suitable to donate part of her liver, but on Channel Nine's<em> Sixty Minutes</em> on Sunday it was revealed that her Aunty Carolynn was the more suitable donor.</p>
              <p>Both Ms Murray and her aunty went into surgery early today in Singapore. The operation will take several hours.</p>
              <p>Ms Murray's plight has polarised West Australians since Nationals MP Vince Catania and Labor MP Martin Whitely brought her case to the public's attention last month.</p>
              <p>She received her first donor liver last year because she had acute liver failure caused by 12 years of addiction to heroin and amphetamines. But the donor liver failed, giving her only months to live without another transplant.</p>
              <p>Ms Murray admitted taking drugs after the first transplant and was prevented from returning to the transplant waiting list by national protocols that forbid persistent substance abusers from being eligible for donor organs.</p>
              <p>WA Health Minister Dr Kim Hames said the decision taken by doctors at Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital's liver transplant unit to refuse a second organ was the right one.</p>

It has to be better than India or China if not people from these countries would not have left their hometowns and tried to take up Australian residency.</p>

              <p>So you don't pay taxes.  You've got no fucking business telling me what I should say abolut how MY money is being spent, idiot.</p>
              <p>And of course your friend doesn't understand jack-shit - he's Sri Lankan for fuck's sake.  They're colonial leftovers who are only good for being pathetically grateful for the office-boy jobs their masters left them, and have absolutely no capacity for independent thought.</p>

Blood tests appear to show Ms Murray's body is starting to reject the second liver.<br> <br>Her first liver transplant failed after she returned to using drugs. A piece of her aunty's liver was transplanted into her body last month as part of a "live" liver transplant.</p>

              <p>What are you talking about?  As far as the Australian public is concerned, it's great because it sets a precedent for not wasting taxpayers' money on useless cases.</p>
