              <p>On one hand, I don't agree with my tax money being spent on her, but I feel sorry for her two kids.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I pay taxes, so do my Lankan friends and all the PRCs and Punjabis who are working with me. The main difference is that the latter groups are more vocal and criticise the system openly while benefiting from it. One Indian chef I knew (who is in Australia on a 457 visa) said the WA education system was too "shallow" but insisted on his son finishing Year 12 here in Perth. Obviously he is trying to milk the system for his family's benefit.</p>

              <p>You're not here to check on anything - deal with it.  I know that you're having a hard time living with the the fact that yo momma sucked the dog off and shat you out, but even so, you really have to get your delusions in check.  No, really.</p>
              <p>Yeah, yeah, make up all kinds of cock-and-bull stories about how government, non-government, religious and fairy-godmother associations tell you that you're gold-plated, but the fact is that you're still jobless, and you can't drive and you don't know how to do something as fucking simple as a resume, and you crawl around on an internet forum pathetically begging stangers to help you out of your pitiful state.  Shameful, just shameful.</p>
              <p>The facts bear out that you're not just a loser - you're a fucking vegetable.  The bullshit stories don't make you a winner, so do stop humiliating yourself by being the only person who believes your shit.</p>
              <p>Ewwww - you have fantasies about my penis?!  You're more desperate 
                      than I dared imagine.  Okay, you've now officially made my skin crawl - your obsession with me is just not healthy.  You're going to have to let go, and I'll do you the favour by ignoring you.  At the very least you'll have to find someone else to jerk off to.</p>

              <p>ged,</p>
              <p>no she didnt.....but i bet yo moma did that nasty deed and thus we get ged who talks and acts like of of those 'things".</p>
              <p>im not really living  a hard time....i go shopping...take driving lessons...........surf the internet all day...................</p>
              <p>as they say..............a good day at work is a bad day at fishing.:)</p>
              <p>go seek help from one of those pyschiatric clinics....................in oz.u need it from way yer job has been treating you.</p>
              <p>it speaks volumes by observing every single word and thoughts comin outa ya.</p>
              <p>well,,,,for the penis part .................i would love to do something to yer face but i think its much uglier and stink more than yer penis.so i would skip yer face.no point doin yer leg or backside!however my dedication to work is remarkable as im able to warn you off by doing something hands on to a kuckle head like you!!u should thank me!!most people would have placed 3 bullets into that numb skull of yours!:)i assure u that would be the most easiet thing to do to u if people hated u in oz.bullets are really easy to get in oz.i bet to u thats a tall story too.oh well...its yer funeral!:)</p>

              <p>as i told u.....................im here in the middle of a town with no industries.dont blame me if i cant get my job of my  high tech expertise.its rather primitive in this part of town.why do i need to keep on repeating to ged all the time......looks like he doesnt read and understand simple stuff.</p>
              <p>i dont think theres anything wrong with the resume or me able to write a resume as most global companies accepted my resumes.and if i didnt know how to make a resume....just pay someone to write one.but theres nothing wrong with my resume from start.its just that folks like u think i dunno this and dat.kinda sad that im stuck here in this town unwillingly.there are more better $$$$ making jobs in other places that is a fit for my expertise.</p>
              <p>it is not normal for immigrants to vegetate as the process of immigration paperwork is already not meant for vegetables.everyday when not working i would do my own robotics projects along with material science experiments.....with some amount process design.there is no such thing as anything less.....and there always is progress every week........so u see i never stop but keep goin on and on even without any industries here and can survive in an otherwise boring diet. most people who havent got the material in them would have cracked long b4 they even stepped foot into oz.appears im not the usual lot of sporeans who hiss and scream at the slightest reason or problem.even the aussie government gave me my PR in less than 20 days after i applied  for it .</p>
              <p>actually i only need a good paying job to buy  an acre of land to build my economically viable projects which would be profitable....and to purchase materials.yup...that pretty much sums it.</p>
              <p> and why would i make tall stories??to impress u or the people here?i have other better things to do than make tall stories n impress.</p>
              <p>that job iof impressing is only meant for GED...i dont need to impress people and i get my accolades from people i werk wiv without even thinkin about it.</p>
              <p>look ged,....u got into australia not cuz u were good.......but rather their immigration policy at that time was lenient.people in yer position would only end up as security guard in oz today.:)as was the case for most masters degree holders in oz currently.</p>
              <p>u are there in that position in oz because they gave it to u.and not because u were good.dont matter if u are a useless turd and good fer nuthin in that job.</p>
              <p>but then when they do tire of u they would turn u insane as whats seen here from u in sgforum over the many months.</p>

              <p>iveco,</p>
              <p>its me t3000</p>
              <p>what u mean strict??it depends on how frendly u are to them or if they like u.i asuure u i have more luck getting a job via agents with production engineer position in this small town which is quite rare.i didnt even look at any of his requirementsso i got the inbterview.however it all sounds very shady and i didnt want it as i had no full control if i were to accept his terms or whatever.it was the same job as advertised a few weeks back.</p>
              <p>t3000 dont talk crap at all...he studies,,,,perceives and brings everything with some amount of success.if the australian recruiters are very strict then he fully satisfies most of  their requirements in big city regions.t3000 is one  the very few in spore who knows what to do and perhaps the world.he is perhaps the only one who is able to build an entire production system composed of robots.....he is not very common in spore and perhaps oz.</p>
              <p>you dont think oz would just let anyone waltz in nowadays as compared to yer time!!!if they are strict...so am i.</p>
              <p>perhaps i should relocate everyone and everything to my future job as i dont see anyone staying in some primitive town.</p>
              <p>iveco...stop assuming and underestimating everything.otherwise u will screw yerself in oz as yer situation in spore under PAP.</p>
