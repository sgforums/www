              <p><strong>Aussie liver patient dies</strong></p>
              <p>AN AUSTRALIAN liver transplant recipient, who sparked a storm of 
              debate over her organ donation in her country, died at the Mount 
              Elizabeth Hospital at noon on Thursday, after doctors battled for eight 
              hours on Wednesday to remove blood clots that had formed around her 
              heart.</p>
              <p>Doctors said they had done all they could to save Ms Claire Murray, 
              25, from West Australia.</p>
              <p>Her supporter and Perth doctor, George O'Neil, earlier told 
              The West Australian news site that Ms Murray had been taken off life 
              support on Thursday morning. 'This morning it looked as though they were
               taking her off the ventilator and she was in renal failure by 9am,' Dr 
              O'Neill told the news portal. He said he expected doctors to 'declare 
              she will be dead before lunchtime'.</p>
              <p>According to a source close to the Murray family, the mother
               of two had too many blood clots. The operation had been expected to 
              take four hours, but complications extended it to eight, The West 
              Australian reported.</p>
              <p>Ms Murray's organ donation sparked a storm of debate in 
              Australia. Dr O'Neill commended her public fight. He said: 'I think a 
              lot of people in the community have been interested but not really 
              understood it could mean the death of a young, 25-year-old woman.' 'I 
              have talked to (Ms Murray's family) and they are definitely in grieving 
              mode.'</p>
              <p>Her father, Michael, flew to Singapore to be with her on 
              Wednesday. Her parents, brother, uncle and step-father are with her, 
              although her two children remained in Perth.</p>
              <p>Ms Murray, a recovering heroin addict, was refused a donor 
              transplant by doctors in Perth because she relapsed soon after her first
               transplant in 2009. Ms Murray's aunt had donated part of her liver.</p>

              <p>poigant,</p>
              <p>look from page 1 and 2 onwards.......there are singaporeans who think what that poor gal should and shouldnt get...and these are singaporeans complaining where aussie gov $$$ should goto.REAL UGLY,,,,,,,I NEVER HAD LOCAL singaporeans telling spore gov about life making decisions..............and how and who should live or die.and yet these people have no shame telling the aussie gov what they should do with their money and who should live or die.what kinda humans are these???were they brought up from sewer pipes back in spore??</p>
              <p>i know i am noble and kind as a singaporean.....but these singaporeans who immigrated earlier than me sound rather uneducated and act like butchers and murderers.</p>
              <p>perhaps it is their enviroment or lack of one in the past and the present.</p>
              <p>this is a sad day for australia indeed.and i suppose a happy day for singaporeans living in singapore.....one or 2 less of the sorta people who are merely PAP wannabes or worse.</p>

              <p>Many would and have argued that by going back to drugs after the first transplant, she waived her entitlement.</p>
              <p>As for the money, consider it gone.  I can just see the Herald Sun headline now: "Our daughter's dead and the government is chasing us for money!".  They were fools to provide the loan in the first place, and now the only thing they can do is cut their losses.</p>

              <p><strong>Australian liver transplant patient's death stems from genetic disorder:
               surgeon</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: An Australian woman died of infections from her second 
              liver transplant in Singapore on Thursday. </span></p>
              <p><span>She was operated on at Mouth Elizabeth Hospital by local surgeons 
              who concluded that the death was caused by a genetic disorder.
              <br> <br> These go against the claims made by previous doctors who said her first 
              liver transplant failed due to her drug addiction.
              <br> <br> Claire Murray, a 24-year-old Australian was ready to start life anew 
              after battling years of drug abuse.
              <br> <br> She was also the target of negative media coverage in her country after 
              her family appealed for government support to fund her operation.
              <br> <br> Dr Prema Raj, general surgeon, Mt Elizabeth Hospital, said: “When Claire
               came to us, she was portrayed as a drug junkie, a drug addict who 
              abused her liver and was no good. But honestly, after getting to know 
              her, what we saw was not a junkie, but a young lovely woman, a mother of
               two, who really wanted another chance at life.
              <br> <br> After a successful organ transplant, Ms Murray had been recovering well 
              until blood clots started forming in her arteries. This caused her 
              death.
              <br> <br> Surgeons discovered that she had a dysfunctional gene - a different 
              conclusion drawn from her previous doctors.
              <br> <br> Some are blaming it on her heroin addiction.
              <br> <br> So what caused her death - was it a genetic disorder or drug abuse?
              <br> <br> Dr Lui Hock Foong, liver transplant physician, Mt Elizabeth Hospital, 
              said: “There was speculation that her drug use was responsible for the 
              demise of this graft which caused her to go into liver failure again - 
              hence the need for a second transplant.
              <br> <br> “When she came to us, we ran a series of blood tests to find out if she 
              has any inherent genetic disorder that would make her more likely to 
              have blood clots. And as it turned out, she has a rare mutation of a 
              gene that makes her to have blood clots more easily than others.”
              <br> <br> The donor was Miss Murray's aunt, who's clearly worn out from the saga. </span></p>

              <p>if thats so...then why are there some people who think every cent was wasted on her...especially those people who were from singapore!are they that poor both financially and ethically?is $$$$ that hard to come by in melb that they regard $250k as something to make noise about even if their families loaned that amount and would pay it up???i dont see much aussies in yahoo message board making noise about that type of $$$ even if it ws wasted.</p>
              <p>somehow most of the people complaining seem to be from melbourne and used to be from singapore.</p>
              <p>is it that badly screwed up in melbourne?it cant be that bad as melbourne was regarded as one of the best states to live in the world!but how do u explain GED and some ex singapore from melb who agreed with his thoughts? apparently melbourne is just another cesspit in another different form.</p>
              <p>it is indeed interesting ......enlightening  in fact....i though melb was supposed to be better than that...but appears its not.perhaps they only have better conmen there where the whole show would be exposed by the people living there and how they think.</p>

              <p><strong>THE father of Claire Murray yesterday revealed his family will sell their home to pay off the WA Government loan that bankrolled his daughter's liver transplant surgery. </strong></p>
              </div>
              
              <p>Ms Murray, a 25-year-old mother of two, travelled to Singapore for a live liver transplant operation paid for by a $258,000 interest-free government loan.</p>
              <p>The loan sparked public criticism from many who believed the former drug addict did not deserve a second chance. Ms Murray had used illicit drugs following her first transplant surgery in WA.</p>
              <p>Though her second transplant surgery in Singapore was initially a success, Ms Murray died from complications 15 days later.</p>
              <p>Yesterday her father, Michael Murray, said the family were more than $500,000 in debt.</p>
              <p>This included the interest-free loan from the WA Government. They have been given two years to pay it back.</p>
              <p>Asked if he would have to sell his house to repay the loan money, Mr Murray said: "That would be the case. Yes. I wouldn't like to have to do that but, if we have to do it, then we have to do it."</p>
              <p>Mr Murray said he was yet to make contact with the Government about the loan.</p>
              <p>"Nobody has been in touch with me and I haven't been in touch with them," he said.</p>
              <p>The family had also borrowed from banks and friends to pay for his daughter's surgery. "There is a lot more money to be paid back than what the Government lent us," he said.</p>
              <p>"The Government probably covered half the expenses.</p>
              <p>"We still owe a lot of money at the moment."</p>
              <p>Mr Murray said his family was cutting back in a bid to save money. Their savings had gone.</p>
              <p>A foundation called "Claire We Care" is being set up to raise money to support drug education in schools. The foundation will also support families in crisis and raise awareness of organ donation.</p>
              <p>Mr Murray said his family was still dealing with Claire's death.</p>
              <p>"You get your good and bad days," he said. "I don't think we'll ever fully recover. But it gets easier with the good support you have around you."</p>
              <p>He said there were no regrets about the attempt to save Ms Murray's life.</p>
              <p>"We gave it our all and Claire gave it her all," he said. "It just wasn't meant to be."</p>

              <p><strong>GRAPHIC pictures of drug addict Claire Murray's diseased liver should be used to shock high-school students into staying clean and sober, her father says. </strong></p>

              <p>Michael Murray wants to use the last days of his daughter's life as part of a drug-education program in WA schools.</p>
              <p>A heartbroken Mr Murray, whose daughter died after a controversial organ-transplant debate that divided WA, said he had letters written by his daughter and pictures of her liver that should be used to discourage children from exper2imenting with drugs.</p>
              <p>There was also a video of her warning children off drugs that was filmed only days before her death.</p>
              <p>"It's super important to educate children about drugs at a school age," Mr Murray said.</p>
              <p>"Claire used to say that the minute you put a needle in your arm, it's too late. Once you have started injecting it's very hard to stop."</p>
              <div id="sidebar-start" class="assistive sidebar-jump">Ms Murray, a 25-year-old mother of two, went to Singapore for a liver-transplant operation covered by a $258,000 interest-free government loan.</div>
              <p>The loan sparked public criticism from many who believed the former addict did not deserve a second chance because Ms Murray had used illicit drugs following her first transplant surgery in WA.</p>
              <p>Though her surgery in Singapore was initially a success, Ms Murray died from complications 15 days later.</p>
              <p>Her father told The Sunday Times that shortly before her death, his daughter spoke about her desire to raise awareness about the dangers of drugs.</p>
              <p>Mr Murray and an official from the Education Department have discussed how his daughter's death could be used to teach students about drug abuse.</p>
              <p>The acting president of the WA Council of State School Organisations, Kylie Catto, said Mr Murray's plan could be incorporated into the government-funded School Drug Education and Road Awareness program.</p>
              <p>About 80 per cent of government schools run the classes, which are organised by the Drug and Alcohol Office.</p>
              <p>"If Claire's story can help one kid, then that's a positive," Ms Catto said.</p>
              <p>Mr Murray said a foundation, Claire We Care, was being set up to raise money to support drug education in schools. It will also support families in crisis and raise awareness of organ donation.</p>
              <p>Mr Murray said part of the drug education campaign should be paid for by Proceeds of Crime funding.</p>
