              renovation on HDB BTO. but bear in mind you need to fork out
              cash for the 100k renovation. there is no installment payment
              for that 100k unlike DBSS - i doubt any contractor will accept
              installment basis. If you are judging from time value money, that
              100k is better off use as investment for shares than
              renovation. </p>

              <p>I stay in a DBSS. In Tampines. In fact, it is the one right opp the new Centrale 8.</p>
              <p>Ridiculous, isn't it? When my one (5-room) went for just under 400k. So now where are all who talk about it being in a good location when mine is just OPP IT?! And now Centrale 8's 5-rooomers are 800+k?! WTF TTM!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I should actually be very happy. My flat price will def go up. But I feel damn sad. You know why?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Because it is things like that which will definitely result in a property bubble!!! HDB is left its core principles of a governing body for public housing to become one that dishes out carrots to SGX-listed companies (which have their shareholders interests in mind) to screw the smallest stakeholder in this massive pie — the home owner!</p>

              <p>It is EXACTLY same to The Premiere@Tampines. No diff. Only small diff would be having a minimart and foodcourt (which bloody hell we at The Premiere@Tampines would just cross 100m to get to)...</p>

              <p>And it is double the price we paid. Sheer madness. KBW if you are listening and watching... Your property bubble is lying RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU!!!</p>

              <p>Even Pinnacle@Duxton is better than DBSS actually, and P@D has a lower price than 5-room Centrale 8. What bollocks!</p>

              <p>Previous records for priciest HDB flats had belonged to other DBSS 
              projects such as The Peak@Toa Payoh and City View@Boon Keng. Five-room 
              flats at the two projects were sold at around $720,000.</p>
              <p>Despite the hefty price tag, market watchers noted that Sim Lian did 
              not pay a record-busting price for the land - $261 psf per plot ratio 
              (ppr) was paid for the 21,132 sq ft site, reported The Straits Times.</p>
              <p>A Sim Lian spokesman explained the rationale for the high pricing and
               told the newspaper: "The premium is due to its locale in Tampines 
              Regional Centre with mature amenities such as banks, three shopping 
              malls and the upcoming Integrated Lifestyle Hub.</p>
              <p>"It is also within walking distance to the existing Tampines MRT Station and the future downtown line 3 MRT interchange."</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Previous records for priciest HDB flats had belonged to other
              DBSS projects such as The Peak@Toa Payoh and City View@Boon Keng.
              Five-room flats at the two projects were sold at around
              $720,000.</p>
              <p>Despite the hefty price tag, market watchers noted that Sim Lian
              did not pay a record-busting price for the land - $261 psf per plot
              ratio (ppr) was paid for the 21,132 sq ft site, reported The
              Straits Times.</p>
              <p>A Sim Lian spokesman explained the rationale for the high
              pricing and told the newspaper: "The premium is due to its locale
              in Tampines Regional Centre with mature amenities such as banks,
              three shopping malls and the upcoming Integrated Lifestyle Hub.</p>
              <p>"It is also within walking distance to the existing Tampines MRT
              Station and the future downtown line 3 MRT interchange."</p>
