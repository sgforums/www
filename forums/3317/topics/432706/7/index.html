              <p>DEVELOPER Sim Lian Group has slashed the prices of its Design, Build 
              and Sell Scheme (DBSS) flats at Centrale 8 in Tampines by up to 
              $102,000.</p>
              <p>The move follows the public outcry at the record prices of the 
              designer Housing Board (HDB) units launched last Thursday, when the 
              developer asked $880,000 for the biggest five-room flats.</p>

              <p><strong>DBSS flats to remain relevant: analysts</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: There will still be demand for more expensive public housing such as the Design, Build and Sell Scheme (DBSS) flats.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>That's the view of 
              property analysts, following the recent debate over the pricing of such 
              flats and the relevance of the scheme.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>A five-room flat at the new DBSS Centrale 8 near the Tampines Regional Centre costs up to S$778,000.<br><br>A previous indicative price had been set at S$880,000, causing market watchers to question the pricing band of such flats.<br><br>Analysts
               said that at the moment, due to an overwhelming demand for more 
              affordable housing, DBSS flats should take a backseat to allow for 
              cheaper <br>build-to-order (BTO) flats.<br><br>Ku Swee Yong, CEO of 
              International Property Advisor, said: "In our current context, where we 
              are short of affordable homes to the tune of 15,000 to 20,000 more a 
              year, and the minister is also trying to ramp up more and faster 
              construction of HDB flats, perhaps the DBSS scheme is not valid for a 
              while. When the market supply and demand situation is a bit more 
              balanced, we can then put up the DBSS scheme for consideration again."<br><br>The
               Ministry of National Development said the DBSS flats were introduced 
              with better design and finishes desired by higher-income flat buyers. 
              The ministry added that while the DBSS flats account for a small 
              proportion of public housing, they are well appreciated by buyers.<br><br>Adora
               Green, the first DBSS development in Yishun launched in November last 
              year, was 96 percent sold. Flats there were priced between S$330,000 and
               S$650,000.<br><br>Analysts note that DBSS flats will continue to attract buyers, if they are priced "sensibly". <br><br>Nicholas
               Mak, executive director for research &amp; consultancy at SLP 
              International, said: "There is still a place in the present market for 
              the DBSS flats, provided they are priced quite sensibly. Because some 
              buyers may want to have a new flat that is designed by private 
              developers. Private developers, in a competitive market, may engage some
               creative designers or architects that are a bit different or can give 
              certain value that consumers may be willing to accept."<br><br>- CNA/ir</span></span></p>

              <p>THEY may have paid high prices, but residents of Design, Build and 
              Sell Scheme (DBSS) flats said they are confident that the better 
              location of their estates will land them good resale prices in future.</p>
              <p>Industry observers and academics agree that it is the location - and 
              not so much the touted better fittings and design - that could help the 
              owners command a premium in the resale market.</p>
              <p>DBSS flats have been in the news after the developer of the Centrale 8
               project in Tampines drew flak for pricing units at high prices.</p>
              <p>PropNex chief Mohamed Ismail said: 'Today, it is a DBSS 
              flat, but five years from today, it will be another ordinary HDB flat. 
              The valuation then will focus on the good location of the flats and the 
              market sentiment.'</p>
              <p>Agreeing, SLP International head of research Nicholas Mak 
              said: 'No one knows what the market will look like in five years' time.'</p>
              <p>Associate Professor Yu Shi Ming, who heads the department of
               real estate at the National University of Singapore, said the 
              distinction between a DBSS flat and a Build-To-Order (BTO) one will 
              narrow when both enter the resale market in years to come.</p>

              help the owners command a premium in the resale market.</p>
              <p>DBSS flats have been in the news after the developer of the
              Centrale 8 project in Tampines drew flak for pricing units at high
              prices.</p>
              <p>PropNex chief Mohamed Ismail said: 'Today, it is a DBSS flat,
              but five years from today, it will be another ordinary HDB flat.
              The valuation then will focus on the good location of the flats and
              the market sentiment.'</p>
              <p>Agreeing, SLP International head of research Nicholas Mak said:
              'No one knows what the market will look like in five years'
              time.'</p>
              <p>Associate Professor Yu Shi Ming, who heads the department of
              real estate at the National University of Singapore, said the
              distinction between a DBSS flat and a Build-To-Order (BTO) one will
              narrow when both enter the resale market in years to come.</p>

              <p>MEMBER of Parliament for Marine Parade Tin Pei Ling shared her 
              thoughts on Facebook on Friday morning about the recent news regarding 
              the Design, Build and Sell Scheme (DBSS) project in Tampines.</p>
              <p>The flats at the 708-unit Centrale 8 raised an uproar last week over 
              the $880,000 price tag for its largest units, as the price was nearly 
              that of executive condominiums.</p>
              <p>Project developer Sim Lian later said quoted price ranges were only 
              'indicative', before releasing a 'confirmed price range' for the flats, 
              which showed a $100,000 price drop to $778,000 for the top-end units. Ms
               Tin posted this note on her Facebook account at 9.50am on Friday, 
              titled 'Short note on housing 3: HDB land - a matter of principle'.</p>
              <p>She wrote (as is carried here): 'The recent high profile 
              sale of DBSS flats at Centrale 8 stunned many Singaporeans, including 
              myself. Questions were raised by many members of the public. Some asked 
              why HDB flats built on HDB lands and eventually to be managed by the 
              Town Councils (i.e. like normal HDB flats) should be priced by private 
              developers. I understand and sympathise with these views.</p>
              <p>'Allowing private developers who had successfully acquired 
              HDB lands to independently price DBSS units may be in line with 'free 
              market' principles, but it also means HDB losing control over precious 
              lands that could be better utilized for BTO flats or community 
              facilities.</p>
              <p>'DBSS was meant to offer an additional housing option to 
              Singaporeans - premium but less expensive than private condominiums. It 
              is right to offer tiered options to address the different aspirations of
               Singaporeans. But the 'devil is in the details', and what might have 
              been a useful housing option in 2005 may no longer be as suitable 
              today.'</p>
              <p>'Some have pointed out that Singaporeans can choose not to 
              purchase over-priced DBSS flats. But I think the issue is one of 
              principle - given the land scarcity in Singapore, HDB land should be 
              reserved for building affordable public housing, and not apartments that
               HDB has little influence over. As part of MND's overall review of 
              housing policies, perhaps it should either let HDB take back the right 
              to price DBSS units, or include a clause to compel price negotiations 
              between HDB and the private developers.'</p>
