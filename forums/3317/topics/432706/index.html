              <p>THE priciest-ever new HDB flats went up for sale yesterday under a 
              Design, Build and Sell Scheme (DBSS) development launched in Tampines.</p>
              <p>The most expensive five-room flats at Centrale 8 by developer Sim Lian will set buyers back a cool $880,000.</p>
              <p>That works out to a whopping $750 per square foot - a price tag more often seen on suburban condominiums.</p>
              <p>PropNex chief executive Mohamed Ismail said he did a double take when he first heard about the prices.</p>
              <p>'No doubt it's in Tampines, which is a mature estate with 
              many good things going for it, but it is still extremely high for a 
              public housing flat,' he said.</p>
              <p>DBSS flats are public housing units designed and built by 
              private-sector developers and they typically come with more luxurious 
              fittings.</p>

               year, there is bound to be a lot of the feel good factor going around. 
              And Singapore's housing market is cashing in on this big time -- prices 
              have rebounded 50 percent in just two years, according to the Urban 
              Redevelopment Authority, and cooling measures by the government have 
              done little to calm them.<br> <br> At a recent real estate conference organized by National University of 
              Singapore, which explored the theme "Will the boom never end," Chua Chor
               Hoon, Head of South East Asia Research at property consultancy DTZ, 
              said the Singapore residential market is not likely to decline much 
              because of strong economic growth, but she also outlined a worst-case 
              scenario, which could <span style="color: blue;">unfold as early as 2013-2014. "If all the ingredients come together it will make a perfect storm."</span><br> <br> <span style="color: blue;">These ingredients include falling demand, more supply and higher interest rates all kicking in together.</span><br> <br> Interest rates in Singapore are currently at record lows because lending
               rates in the city-state track U.S. monetary policy. That's allowed some
               homebuyers to pay less than one percent in the first year of their 
              loans, says Chua. Most analysts, however, expect interest rates to begin
               moving higher later this year.<br> <br> Second, in 2014 an unprecedented number of housing units are expected to
               enter the market. According to the URA's latest quarterly report, 
              32,359 units will be completed over 2013 and 2014 that is 85 percent 
              more than the 17,501 units expected over 2011 and 2012.<br> <br> Add to this the fact that Singapore's price-to-rent ratio has increased 
              from 20 in 2009, during the financial crisis, to 25 currently, according
               to URA and DTZ research. That means it will take 25 years for a 
              homebuyer to recover, through rents, what he paid for the house. As a 
              result, Chua says, people investing in this market often have a 
              short-term view looking to "flip" the property for capital gains.<br> <br> Foreign buyers are also helping boost Singapore's property market, 
              especially at the high end. According to DTZ's latest report, foreign 
              buyers of private homes in the first quarter of 2011 touched a record 
              high of 16 percent. But Chua points out that this could drop, if the 
              government further tightens immigration rules.<br> <br> "Local concerns about high housing prices and the influx of foreigners 
              that were magnified during the recent General Election will be a 
              catalyst for the review of immigration and housing policies, which could
               dampen demand in the residential market in the coming months, " Chua 
              wrote in a report.<br> <br> While growth forecasts for Singapore over the next five years at 4-6 percent will support the property market says Chua, <span style="color: blue;">one cannot rule out another unforeseen external crisis like the financial meltdown, which could also lead to a market crash.</span> While the bulls might find it hard to believe that something like that 
              can happen again, another speaker at the same conference had this to 
              say: "We always think this time it will be different, but it never is."<br> <br> This article first appeared on CNBC.com on 29 May 2011. </blockquote></div>
