              <p><strong>By Seah Chiang Nee</strong></p>
              <p>A luxurious 7,072 sq ft penthouse at a prime district has just 
              changed hands for S$30 million in one of the most expensive deals on a 
              per square foot basis.</p>
              <p>The buyer was a permanent resident from Hong Kong and, the seller, an
               Indian tycoon who had bought it in 2006 for S$17.3 mil (RM41.21mil).</p>
              <p>The cost of the triplex with five bedrooms and an 11m swimming pool 
              worked out to S$4,242 per sq ft, a record in land-scarce Singapore.</p>
              <p>Last June, an unknown Chinese national snapped up a bungalow on 
              Sentosa Island for S$36 million, the highest paid for a residence here.</p>
              <p>The PR holder from China had considered the price a “bargain”, according to the agent who handled the sale.</p>
              <p>These are among a rising number of wealthy foreigners – especially 
              Chi­nese, Indians and Indonesians – who have made this city their family
               residence while doing business outside.</p>
              <p>Asia’s growing wealth, particularly from China and India, is slowly 
              making its way into Singapore. More Europeans, too, are parking their 
              money here.</p>
              <p>For a glimpse of a Singapore in, say, another 10 or 15 years just 
              take a picture of Monaco or Zurich and superimpose it on this island.</p>
              <p>What will emerge is a city of wealth – transient and abiding, a land 
              of personal banking, celebrity-chef dinners, where Bentleys, 
              Lamborghinis and Ferraris ply the street and branded goods will become 
              daily items.</p>
              <p>An example of the foreign presence can be gauged at Sentosa Cove, one
               of Singapore’s most posh and expensive waterfront projects.</p>
              <p>More than 3,000 people now live there. They have come from 22 
              countries, the top five nationalities being Singaporeans (who make up 
              40%), Australians, Britons, Germans and Chinese.</p>
              <p>“Singapore has opened up a lot in recent years and we’re drawing 
              foreigners keen to park their money as well as live here,” a developer 
              said.</p>
              <p>The arrival of the nouveau riche has created new fortunes for 
              Sing­apore’s upper middle class, but it has also widened the economic 
              gap between the rich and the poor as few of the lower class derives much
               benefit from the phenomenon.</p>
              <p>For the upper class, the story is clear. Last year the number of millionaires jumped by 26%.</p>
              <p>Currently, 11.8% of Singaporean households have at least US$1 mil in investible assets (excluding property) each.</p>
              <p>Some recent headlines gave an indication of the change, good and bad.</p>
              <p>A Singaporean billionaire, Peter Lim, has just made a US$507 mil bid (since aborted) to buy England’s Liverpool football team.</p>
              <p>And two Singaporeans displayed their wealth less gloriously at the casino tables.</p>
              <p>One, a company managing director of a seafood business, lost S$26 mil
               in just three days, while the second, who was in the latest Forbes list
               of Singapore’s 40 richest people, dropped S$100 mil.</p>
              <p>Easy come, easy go!</p>
              <p>Cashing in on it, Citibank last week launched an exclusive Ultima 
              credit card for the super rich in Singapore where members must have S$5 
              mil and admitted only by invitation.</p>
              <p>Some of the nouveau riche came because of their children’s education.</p>
              <p>Among them is action star Jet Li, who bought a bungalow for S$19.8 
              mil last year. He took up citizenship and sent daughter, Jane to study 
              here.</p>
              <p>Another new settler, US investment guru Jim Rogers, with a net worth 
              of US$1.8 bil, also came to send his daughter to the reputable 
              Nanyang Primary School two years ago. To ensure she got a better chance,
               Rogers and his wife had performed 40 hours of volunteer work, something
               the locals do.</p>
              <p>Who are the richest foreigners living here?</p>
              <p>The Forbes’ list of top 40 ranks China-born Zhong Sheng Jian, 48, as 
              the fourth richest man in Singapore with a net worth of US$2.5 bil.</p>
              <p>And 47 year-old Indian-born Sudhir Gupta, now a naturalised citizen 
              is ranked 13th richest. He has a personal fortune estimated at US$320 
              mil.</p>
              <p>Seventeen percent of foreign buyers of high-end property in the first quarter are Chinese, and the number is rising.</p>
              <p>One out of five bought houses in prestigious multi-million dollar 
              districts of 9 to 11, the Central Business District (CBD) and Sentosa.</p>
              <p>Some salesmen have reported cases of Chinese buyers paying the down 
              payment with a bag of cash, leading to suspicion they may be keen to 
              cover the money trail.</p>
              <p>Recently a growing number of foreigners have turned to buying landed properties.</p>
              <p>Under the law foreigners, including PRs, cannot buy any property on 
              land or any apartment with fewer than five storeys – except with special
               approval.</p>
              <p>Under its strategy of attracting the wealthy and talented to settle here, the government appears to be loosening the screw.</p>
              <p>In the first half of this year, 150 such sales were allowed, most in the prime, rich areas.</p>
              <p>Local critics are protesting against such sale of precious landed 
              properties. “It is like selling the country’s Crown Jewels to 
              outsiders,” one blogger wrote.</p>
              <p>The influx of foreign wealth is not welcomed by all Singaporeans. Some see their cake becoming smaller and more expensive.</p>
              <p>Many of working class citizens living in the heartland do not see 
              much benefit from having so many rich people around – but they feel the 
              pain of rising costs.</p>
              <p>A polytechnic student asked: “And what happens to us when they suddenly take their money and go home?”<br><strong><br>Source:</strong><a href="http://sg.yfittopostblog.com/2010/11/11/arrival-of-the-super-rich-in-singapore/"><br>http://sg.yfittopostblog.com/2010/11/11/arrival-of-the-super-rich-in-singapore/</a></p>
