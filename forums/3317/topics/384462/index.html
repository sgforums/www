              <p>Northeast China's Liaoning province has
                  become the first province in the country to make lethal injection the
                  standard practice for all its death penalty convicts.</p>
              <p><span style="width: 630px;">
              </span></p><p>The Higher People's Court of Liaoning announced on Wednesday
                  that all cities in the province have adopted the method, which means
                  execution by gunshot will no longer be used.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img id="2040601" style="width: 140px; height: 450px;" src="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/images/attachement/jpg/site1/20091211/00221917f7600c8bcc1b3f.jpg" border="0" alt="Execution by gunshot discontinued in Liaoning" align="right"></p>
              <p>"Lethal injection can reduce the fear and suffering experienced by criminals," the court said in a statement on its website.</p>
              <p>"It can also help preserve the body of the convicts after death.</p>
              <p>"It is a symbol of the progress of civilization, and it also serves to punish criminals."</p>
              <p>A number of cities in Liaoning have already set up lethal
                  injection rooms, while others have acquired execution vehicles -- buses
                  that can be sent, when required, to areas with fewer death penalty
                  cases.</p>
              <p>"At present, many countries still have the death penalty, and
                  most of them adopt execution by shooting," said Zuo Lianbi, deputy
                  president of the higher court of Liaoning.</p>
              <p>"China and the United States are the only two countries that specify lethal injection as a legal execution method," he said.</p>
              <p>Meng Xianfeng, an official from the higher court, said the blood
                  of convicts will stop flowing 45 seconds after lethal injection, and
                  the heart will stop beating.</p>
              <p>"Criminals have no pain, no convulsion and no obvious change of facial expression during the whole process," he said.</p>
              <p>The court also said it will formulate a strict system to ensure the procedure for practicing lethal injection is proper.</p>
              <p>In 1997, China added lethal injection as an alternative method
                  of execution, yet with no specific explanation on what kind of
                  criminals should be executed by either of the methods.</p>
              <p>I<span style="width: 630px;">n March that year, the Kunming Intermediate
                  People's Court in Yunnan province carried out the first execution
                  through lethal injection in the country.
              </span></p><p>A survey by the Supreme People's Court, China's top court, shows
                  that all criminals chose lethal injection over shooting when asked
                  which method of execution they prefer.</p>
              <p>In 2001, the top court required wider use of lethal injection
                  and a dozen cities across the country are now moving in Liaoning's
                  direction.</p>
              <p><span style="width: 630px;">
              </span></p><p>The Beijing and Chongqing municipal governments have announced that they will fully practice lethal injection by next year.</p>
              <p>Wang Dawei, a professor with the Chinese People's Public
                  Security University, is one of those who believes lethal injection will
                  replace execution by gunshot.</p>
              <p>"The faster the method and the less pain it brings to criminals, the more chance the method will be adopted," Wang said.</p>
              <p>"The wider adoption of lethal injection is a symbol of democracy and civilization as it is the last form of respect for life."</p>
