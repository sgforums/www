              <p><span>SINGAPORE : NTUC's Secretary General Lim Swee Say has said he is 
              confident that Singapore will be able to replenish the S$4.5 billion 
              drawn from the reserves over two to three years. </span></p>
              <p><span> Singapore had drawn on past reserves to help fund the Jobs Credit scheme, which was designed to help firms save jobs. </span></p>
              <p><span> In his National Day message to workers and management, Mr Lim said that 
              is because Singapore makes sure that every dollar is put to good use and
               every extra dollar is put back into the reserves. </span></p>
              <p><span> Mr Lim shared the sentiments of trade union leaders from other countries
               whom he had met two months ago in Geneva at the annual International 
              Labour Conference. </span></p>
              <p><span> He said countries were impressed by Singapore's strategy of "cutting 
              costs to save jobs" against "cutting jobs to save costs", a move adopted
               by many other countries. </span></p>
              <p><span>Mr Lim said: "They were impressed by the 'V-shaped recovery' of 
              the Singapore economy, up from minus 9.4 per cent in the first quarter 
              of 2009 to +15.5 per cent in the first quarter of 2010, one of the 
              strongest rebounds for any economy. 
              <br> <br> "They were even more impressed by our ability to regain full employment 
              so quickly, with our unemployment rate dropping from 3.3 per cent in the
               third quarter of 2009 to 2.2 per cent by the first quarter of 2010, one
               of the lowest in the world."
              <br> <br> Union leaders from other countries also wondered how Singapore managed 
              to keep the trust and preserve unity during a severe downturn.
              <br> <br> Mr Lim noted that Singapore believed in building trust during good times so as to stay united during bad times.
              <br> <br> He said: "They wondered how tripartism could be so uniquely effective in
               Singapore at a time when it is either breaking down or not functioning 
              in many other countries. 
              <br> <br> "We explained that when times are good, we work hard together to build 
              up two types of capital - financial capital, by being one of the most 
              pro-business economies in the world; and social capital, by being one of
               the most pro-worker nations in the world. 
              <br> <br> "So, by the time we are hit by a global downturn, we already have in 
              place the necessary resources and a high level of trust among labour, 
              management and government to rally us to respond in unity.
              <br> <br> "Singapore's approach to tripartism is good for our workers. We avoided 
              massive retrenchments and prevented a rapid rise in unemployment. 
              <br> <br> "It is also good for our businesses. We preserved our economic capacity 
              and upgraded our economic capability to grow again in a global 
              recovery."
              <br> <br> Looking ahead, the NTUC chief said the tripartite partners would strive 
              to do even better as Singapore rides the global recovery in 2010 and 
              beyond.
              <br> <br> So, he has called on everyone to live the dreams as One Singapore, lift 
              the nation's productivity as One Workforce, and fly the flag as One 
              People. </span></p>
