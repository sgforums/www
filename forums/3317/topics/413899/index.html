              SINGAPORE: A Singapore Armed Forces corporal was jailed six weeks for giving false information to the police.
              
              Mohd Alfia Misnan, 29, made the 999 call on December 26 last year at the Pasir Ris Food Court. 
              
              He did so after a friend, former police Staff Sergeant Shah Rizal Samsir, also 29, instigated him to do so.
              
              For his role, Shah Rizal was last Friday jailed for three months.
              
              The ex-policeman phoned Alfia on December 25 last year, asking him to make the false report as he wanted to teach another policeman a lesson for supposedly being rude to him.
              
              The SAF regular agreed to help him.
              
              He followed Shah Rizal's instructions and made a call at around 1am, telling an officer on duty that he had spotted a policeman arresting a Bangladeshi at Lembu Road in Little India at around 9pm on December 25.
              
              Alfia claimed that his wife saw the policeman taking out the Bangladeshi's wallet before helping himself to the items inside.
              
              Because of this false accusation, 28-year-old Staff Sergeant (SSG) Ng Keng Lin was investigated for theft.
              
              The court heard that SSG Ng and his colleagues had indeed arrested three Bangladeshi nationals at Lembu Road on the night the so-called theft.
              
              While at a lock-up however, one of foreigners reported that money was missing from his wallet.
              
              Shah Rizal exploited this piece of information to seek revenge against SSG Ng.
              
              For agreeing to help his friend make the false report, Alfia could have been jailed up to a year and fined a maximum of S$5,000.

              <p>anyway i feel as much asi support the police to use force when there is a need, having an officer misusing his power and authorithyis very bad. punishment should be doubled. supiig NSF also.</p>

              <p>stupid. report so manythings in detail must be inside job. the bangla only report missing money in the lockup, but the wife saw the policeman take money and help himself to them items at the spot. then why bangla never report the policeman take his things on the spot. all item taken at any scene of crime shall be put in ziplog bag and handed to the CID later for investigation. if tis just regular routine check the police will only request the ID, passport or identity card of the person he checking only.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i think when recruiting police the personality and bacckground stats should be reviewed.</p>

              <p>The police SSG was dumb for wanting to frame his colleague.</p>
              <p>The army CPL was dumber for helping that SSG. Seriously, what's in it for him?</p>
              <p>Dumb and dumber. If dumbassery was a crime, they'd be looking at a life sentence.</p>

              <p>Wow can't believe he thought he could get away with it. S'pore law system almost always catch everything one. Plus, he himself is civil service so he would know the laws right? I think it was a moment where he just snapped and lost reason that's why he did it.</p>
              <p>But to be jailed for 3 months for making a false report/ accusation about seeing a policeman take money from a Blangadeshi in Little India, to me sounds a little harsh&gt;&lt;? I think being fined and maybe send him to do community service or group therapy or smthing can alr?.. But S'pore probably wanted to deter future people who are thinking of doing this kind of thing. Prevention better than cure:P</p>
