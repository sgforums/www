              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Pregnancy is rare among women with end stage renal
              disease, with one in 200 women of childbearing age getting pregnant
              every year while on dialysis. </span></p>
              <p><span>But a 40-year-old Singaporean patient has overcome the odds.
              <br> <br> Madam Nenamah Woosin suffers from end-stage renal disease and has been
              undergoing dialysis for three years. She is believed to be the first
              kidney patient at the National Kidney Foundation (NKF) to give birth to
              twins.
              <br> <br>The homemaker, who already has four kids aged 11 to 15 years old
              before being diagnosed with kidney failure, was pleasantly surprised to
              find out about her pregnancy.
              <br> <br> "I thought there was a tumour, I did not think I was pregnant," said Madam Nenamah.
              <br> <br>Experts said a pregnant woman on dialysis has a 50 per cent chance
              of losing the baby. So in order to boost the babies' survival rates,
              Madam Nenamah had to undergo dialysis six times a week, up from three
              times previously.
              <br> <br> "No matter how painful it was, I pushed myself to go (for) dialysis," said Madam Nenamah.
              <br> <br>The baby girls were born premature at home in the wee hours of
              September 30; both weighed less than one kilogramme at birth. As Madam
              Nenamah's husband was out at work, her 14-year-old son stepped in to
              help.
              <br> <br>"(I was) scared, worried and nervous, because the baby was already
              out. So I held the head and pulled the baby further out so it's safer.
              The ambulance came about 10 minutes (later). The ambulance cut the
              cord, then the second one came out," said Madam Nenamah's son.
              <br> <br>The babies are still receiving treatment and intensive care at the
              Singapore General Hospital. They are expected to be discharged next
              month.
              <br> <br> The NKF has described the twins' birth as a miracle. 
              <br> <br>Madam Nenamah's husband Mr Asmawi is the sole bread winner and
              makes S$1,500 a month as a bus driver. The family is receiving
              financial help from NKF and other agencies such as the Majlis Ugama
              Islam Singapura (MUIS).
              <br> <br>Gerard Ee, Chairman, NKF said: "The (Thong Teck Sian Tong Lian Sin
              Sia) temple has come forward to help with milk powder, pampers and
              needs of the baby. The Barker road Church has also come forward to
              provide assistance. MUIS is now re-instating on the allowance scheme
              and of course, NKF is providing the dialysis for free.
              <br> <br>"We will monitor the family how they progress, now with the
              additional burden of caring for a pair of twins, and this will not put
              undue stress on the family and especially the patient itself."
