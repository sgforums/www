              <p>WASHINGTON: Countries need to do more to improve their
               finances than just stabilize their deficits and debt, the IMF warned 
              on Tuesday, saying one-third of leading economies face major fiscal 
              problems.</p>
              <p>In a new assessment of global fiscal challenges, the 
              International Monetary Fund warned countries that are just closing 
              deficits to stabilize debt loads courted more trouble down the road.</p>
              <p>"Thanks
               to steady consolidation following the peak of the crisis in 2009, many 
              advanced economies are now close to achieving primary surpluses that 
              will allow them to stabilize their debt ratios," the IMF said in its 
              Fiscal Monitor report.</p>
              <p>However, "high debt -- even if stable -- 
              retards potential growth, constrains the scope for future discretionary 
              policy, and leaves economies exposed to further market shocks," it said.</p>
              <p>"Merely stabilizing advanced economy debt at current levels would be detrimental to medium- and longer-term economic prospects."</p>
              <p>The
               IMF said one-third of advanced economies, which represent 40 percent of
               global gross domestic product (GDP), "still face major challenges."</p>
              <p>The
               Fund warned against a country trying to inflate its way out of its debt
               problems, using rising prices to reduce the value of its debt.</p>
              <p>Nor, in most cases, can privatization of government assets contribute enough to the effort.</p>
              <p>As hard as it is for many countries to get their budgets into the black, "there are no alternative quick fixes."</p>
              <p>It
               warned that current low interest rates were unlikely to be maintained 
              in the medium term, and that markets might not always look favourably on
               the most powerful economies, like Japan and the United States, if their
               debt levels remain high.</p>
              <p>The global debt problem is mainly 
              located in developed economies. The world ratio of gross debt to GDP is 
              79.3 percent and for advanced economies it is 109.3 percent.</p>
              <p><strong>Japan
               faces the largest burden among advanced economies, with debt at 245 
              percent of GDP projected this year. Behind Japan are Greece, 180 
              percent; Italy, 131 percent; Ireland and Portugal both around 122 
              percent; and the world's largest economy, the United States, at 108 
              percent.</strong></p>
              <p>Despite efforts in many countries to crunch their budgets
               to reduce deficits, the Fund foresees continued deterioration in debt 
              ratios through 2014, before they head lower.</p>
              <p>"Many advanced economies face a lengthy, difficult, and uncertain path to fiscal sustainability."</p>
              <p>The
               Fund stressed the need for "clear and credible" medium-term debt 
              reduction programs rather than harsh short-term austerity drives, to 
              avoid setting back growth while the economies remain weak.</p>
              <p>"The 
              continued absence of such plans in Japan and the United States remains a
               significant concern, particularly given the introduction of new 
              short-term stimulus in Japan (even though temporary) and insufficient 
              progress on measures to restore medium-term fiscal sustainability, 
              including entitlement reform, in the United States."</p>
              <p>In the United
               States, a coherent medium-term plan could substitute for the current 
              "sequester" program to slash spending over the next 10 years, which the 
              IMF said was already reducing the country's growth potential.</p>

And the supplementary goods for human like clothing unless all can go naked. Natural "recyclement" process without harming living beings is crop related products. Other needed to look into is recyclement of goods and services as the earth will resource exhausted without cautionary awareness. One world and many countries and if all countries go into same product for instance car manufacturing, the supplementary goods may be affected and thus cooperation in this area is needed for long term goal. Another alternative is self sustaining like for transportation and export to be fairly moderate in price and quantity. After all these have been fairly in place, the next most essential issue is to look at how to recycle your own body :p</p></div>
