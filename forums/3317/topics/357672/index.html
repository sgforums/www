              <p><strong>Employers can claim part of govt-paid maternity leave earlier</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: The government has taken another step to help
              companies and self-employed women with cashflow problems. From May,
              they can claim the government's part of paid maternity leave earlier.
              <br> <br>Presently, under the Paid Maternity Leave scheme, employers can
              seek reimbursement only after all the maternity leave has been
              consumed. This means if an employee maximises the 12-month flexibility
              to consume the maternity leave, employers will have to wait till the
              end to seek reimbursement.
              <br> <br>"In the current circumstances, that's not fair to the companies,"
              said Community Development, Youth and Sports Minister Vivian
              Balakrishnan during a visit to the Nee Soon South on Sunday.
              <br> <br>"I also want to encourage companies to support women who wish to
              have children. Remember that in both good and tough times we must
              continue to be a family-friendly society and employers also have to do
              their part. On the government side, we will also do our part to help
              the employers. It's a win-win situation," he added.
              <br> <br>So from May, employers and self-employed women can make one interim
              claim any time after the mother has taken eight weeks of maternity
              leave. The final claim will be after the remaining leave has been
              taken.
              <br> <br>Another win-win situation for Singapore will be greater integration
              among Singaporeans with new citizens and permanent residents.
              <br> <br> That's going to be a key priority of the National Integration Council which Dr Balakrishnan will be chairing.
              <br> <br> The council will tap ideas from schools, workplaces, the community and media on ways to enhance social integration.
              <br> <br>Dr Balakrishnan said: "The key thing, in the end, is we need to
              build trust. We need to build a sense of understanding. You may not be
              born in Singapore but you have chosen out of your free will to commit
              to Singapore and be a citizen. <br> <br> "And once you have made that decision, it's like marriage, you are now
              part of the family and because you have decided Singapore is your home
              and your children's future is here, we are in the same boat building a
              brighter future. <br> <br> "If we don't spend time doing this, I worry that with the rates of
              immigration which we currently have, people will start feeling anxious
              that perhaps Singapore is changing and is changing too rapidly."
              <br> <br> And he stressed Singaporeans will always continue to come first, while the nation continues to welcome newcomers.
