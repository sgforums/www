              <p><strong><span class="newsTitle">As Halal market grows, greater regulation needed: Consultant</span></strong></p>
              <p>With the growing demand for halal certified food and products, at
              least one halal business consultant feels there may be a need for
              greater regulation too.</p>
              <p>Currently, such consultants are unaccredited and it's unclear how
              many of them exist and are well-equipped to advise the laymen on the
              criteria for obtaining halal certification.</p>
              <p>With a halal certificate, a company can travel to majority Muslim
              countries worldwide, where the halal market is estimated to be worth
              some 2.1 trillion US dollars.</p>
              <p>This explains why more companies here are getting themselves halal
              certified, from only 500 in the year 2000, to 2,300 last year.</p>
              <p>As retail companies go halal, suppliers down the value chain will
              also see the need to do so, representing another growth market for
              halal business consultants like Ustaz Azmi bin Abdul Samad.</p>
              <p>He's the CEO of four-year-old Halal Hub Business management - the consultancy arm of Al-Qiblah International Consultants.</p>
              <p>He's also a former halal inspection officer with MUIS or the Religious Islamic Council of Singapore.</p>
              <p>"To obtain halal certification, establishments don't need any
              consultant. However, being laymen they may not understand certain halal
              criteria and Islamic requirements. It's not only no pork no lard, all
              food an drinks, their sources, everything must not contain elements
              that's nonhalal in Islam. Apart from that, MUIS also have certain other
              criteria in ascertaining the halal status throughout the halal
              certification period."</p>
              <p>Newspaper reports of NTUC FairPrice's recent engagement of halal
              consultant Pergas Halbiz to audit their products caused some confusion
              for people like Western food chain Pastamania's CEO Rashid Hassan.</p>
              <p>"We've always acknowledged MUIS to be the authorizing body for all
              halal certification so news about Pergas doing certification comes as
              bit of surprise to us. I think this is a new avenue they're trying to
              penetrate I'm not sure what's the overall objective is maybe both
              bodies would like to clarify."</p>
              <p>At a recent halal seminar, President of MUIS or the Religious
              Islamic Council of Singapore, Alami Musa, clarified that MUIS is the
              sole authorizing body for halal certificates.</p>
              <p>Yesterday, Pergas Halbiz issued a one-page news release saying it's
              fully aware of MUIS' role and that Pergas' services extend only as far
              as helping FairPrice attain halal certification and complying with the
              criteria.</p>
              <p>Going forward, Ustaz Azmi thinks MUIS should accredit and make
              public a list of such consultants and even meet with them regularly.</p>
              <p>"That should be the way so that we can ensure that certain standards
              are being met because we do have cases where individuals do it on a
              freelance basis which may compromise certain standards."</p>
              <p>Accreditation could provide greater assurance for companies like the iEcon chain of minimarts which sell halal products.</p>
              <p>Mr Richard Seah, who oversees the marketing and distribution
              aspects, say they currently rely on their manufacturers to satisfy the
              halal requirements.</p>
              <p>MUIS President Alami Musa says they're studying the feasibility of an accreditation scheme for consultants.</p>
