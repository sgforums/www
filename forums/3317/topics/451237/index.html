              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: The National Population and Talent Division has said 
              that Singapore will continue to take in immigrants "who are of good 
              quality and able to integrate well into society".</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Analysts Channel NewsAsia spoke with have stressed that Singapore needs to be mindful of the kind of immigrants it attracts.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Immigrants have to be young, can contribute economically and can adapt to Singapore culture, say analysts.<br><br>Associate
               Professor Paulin Tay Straughan, a sociologist at the National 
              University of Singapore, said: "If we're talking about trying to attract
               25,000 new citizens, then an important consideration would be, we want 
              to make sure we attract good quality applicants. <br><br>"So how do we 
              do that? Do we invite more to grow the pool of non-residents so that the
               probability of finding a segment with the desired attributes will be 
              higher or do we look at immigration concerns with a more targeted 
              approach? <br><br>"In short, don't just open doors but be very careful with outreach efforts. We must know who we want to target.<br><br>"We
               want to target younger new citizens because...they would have a younger
               lifespan in terms of their productivity years and with younger 
              citizens, they grow families. <br><br>"So the outreach must be a very 
              targeted one and in order to make Singapore an attractive place for 
              these talents, we also have to be careful that we do not send out 
              signals that foreigners are not welcomed."<br><br>The National Population and Talent Division said Singapore assesses citizenship applications holistically.<br><br>The assessment includes looking at the person's family ties to Singaporeans, qualifications and length of stay in the country.<br><br>A
               spokesperson from the National Population and Talent Division said: "We
               will continue to ensure that we take in immigrants who are of good 
              quality and able to integrate well into our society.<br><br>"We assess 
              applications holistically on a set of criteria that includes the 
              applicants' family ties to Singaporeans, economic contributions, 
              qualifications, age, family profile, length of stay in Singapore, and 
              their commitment to sinking roots in Singapore."<br><br>The National 
              Population and Talent Division added that most new citizens come from 
              Asian countries and between 2005 and 2010, more than half of them were 
              aged 30 or below.<br><br>It also explained why its report does not account for the number of permanent residents.<br><br>It said citizens are its starting point when looking at the population because they form the core of the population.<br><br>"Hence,
               the objective of this Occasional Paper is to lay out the demographic 
              characteristics of our citizen population under various population 
              scenarios, so as to provide a picture of our demographic challenges," 
              said the spokesperson.<br><br>- CNA/ir</span></span></p>

              <p><strong>Immigration crucial in baby-scarce Singapore: government paper</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Singapore needs to continue attracting immigrants to 
              slow down the decline and ageing of its citizen population, according to
               a paper released by the National Population and Talent Division.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>By 2030, the number of elderly citizens will triple to 900,000, representing about 30 per cent of the population.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Compounding this is Singapore's low Total Fertility Rate (TFR) of 1.2, well below the replacement rate of 2.1.<br><br>In
               its latest report, the National Population and Talent Division sets out
               five scenarios: one, if the TFR goes up to the replacement rate of 2.1;
               two, if the TFR is at the current 1.2 and with no immigration; and the 
              rest, with the current fertility rate but with an inflow of 15,000, 
              20,000 or 25,000 new citizens each year.<br><br>The scenarios are not 
              predictions or forecasts, but illustrations of the growth and change in 
              population that will occur if certain assumptions about future 
              demographics trends prevail over a projected period.<br><br>Without 
              immigration, the paper shows that citizen deaths will exceed births in 
              13 years. By 2025, the population will also start to age and shrink, 
              with the median age being 45 - up from the current 39 years.<br><br>The citizen workforce will also start to shrink, with fewer working-age citizens supporting each elderly citizens.<br><br>Currently, there are 6.3 working-age citizens supporting each elderly citizen. <br><br>By 2030, this ratio will drop to 2.1 is to 1.<br><br>With more exiting the workforce, economists say the burden of taxes will fall on the smaller pool of working adult citizens.<br><br>Associate
               Professor Tan Khee Giap, co-director of Asia Competitiveness Institute 
              at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, said: "There is a trade-off
               here, that all Singapore citizens...must accept that if they want to be
               helped, to be subsidised when they are old...as less Singaporeans are 
              now paying tax in support of the ageing population...then you must grow 
              the economic cake. And if you want to grow the economic cake with less 
              Singaporeans, you must accept foreign workers."<br><br>The paper points 
              out that immigration will help slow down the decline in the pool of 
              working-age citizens. With no immigration and at the current fertility 
              rate, this pool will hit about 1.3 million in 2060. With 20,000 or 
              25,000 new citizens each year, this figure will be bumped up to about 2 
              million.<br><br>Immigration will also help to slow down the rate of 
              ageing among the population. With no immigration and at the current 
              fertility rate, the median age of citizens will be 47 in 2030. But if 
              20,000 or 25,000 citizenships are granted each year, the median age will
               go down to about 44 years of age, the same year.<br><br>Taking in 
              20,000 to 25,000 new citizens each year will also bump up the citizen 
              old-age support ratio slightly from 2.1 to 2.4 working citizens for 
              every elderly citizen, in 2030.<br><br>Singapore has been granting between 18,000 and 20,000 citizenships to foreigners over the past three to four years.<br><br>Analysts
               say that while new citizens need to be integrated, the bigger issue is 
              with permanent residents (PRs), which they say may have more issues with
               assimilation.<br><br>Research fellow at the Institute of Policy 
              Studies, Leong Chan-Hoong, said that the data does not provide any 
              information regarding PRs.<br><br>He said: "The data does not provide 
              any information regarding the influx or projected intake of permanent 
              residents. The number of new citizens is actually quite small vis a vis 
              the number of new PRs. So the PRs actually take up a significant 
              component of the new migrants so it would be more helpful if we have 
              information about what kind of projection we are looking at."<br><br>Dr Leong, though, added that the paper would be helpful as a guide for the national discourse on population policies.<br><br>"It's
               actually a very valuable platform for the ministry to engage 
              Singaporeans to think about what kind of future, what kind of population
               landscape they want for Singapore.<br><br>"I think the other possible 
              objective is also to make Singaporeans think harder, that if we do not 
              have immigration, then there might be the possibility that Singaporeans 
              will have to work longer and you will have to pay more taxes in light of
               the rapidly ageing population.<br><br>"So with all these different 
              scenarios that the National Population and Talent Division has rolled 
              out, then Singaporeans would have a more informed decision or platform 
              to think about what sort of issues that they are more likely to 
              encounter in the years to come."   <br><br>The paper will form the basis
               of discussions among focus groups and the public for a White Paper to 
              be released by the National Population and Talent Division by the end of
               the year. <br><br>The White Paper will set out issues important to 
              Singaporeans and strategies for a sustainable population. This will 
              cover areas such as housing, transport and land use. The public 
              consultation for this is expected to start in the middle of the year.<br><br>- CNA/cc/ir</span></span></p>

              again this is an issue of balancing....
              
              we cannot aggresively pursue policies without first consideration to local citizens. If we keep increasing the import of foreigns more than we should consider to improve and uplift the living standards of locals, this would become unsustainable in the long run....
              
              Though targeted approach may contain "overflow effect" of mass foreigns recruitment...it cannot resolve the growing imbalance and dissent of the locals. It is important for the system to reflect whether they have really found the root problems...there are certain areas the system are not willing to review and improve....marriages remain a socio-psychological issue which a balanced gender policy is one of the key components tand must be in place to remove the fear of marriages and commitment...
              
              too much is focussed on the outcome, than understanding the fundamentals

                  True indeed. Just like the MRT  conceptually  a great idea- practical implementation a bloody cock up resulting it to function like a slow boat to China! 
                  Interestingly they look at the shortage of people and say they need 25,000 new citizens- how else to get  the numbers unless we again give away  this time citizenship( not  merely PRs) like funfair coupons!  And can theygaurantee that  the economy will be on a continually super growth path to support such a growing / young population size  for all times? What if suddenly there is  massive natural disaster or unforseen e conomic disaster  this part of the world-everyone would be suffering badly!  Furthermore getting in the numbers - what about the PRs and foreign workers who are here  - they don't account at all?
