              <p>A highly decomposed body was discovered in a flat at block 148 Woodlands Street 13.</p>
              <p>Police were alerted about the find at about ten this morning.</p>
              <p><em>Saifulbahri Ismail</em> who was at the scene with this report :</p>
              <p>Even though police described the body as 'highly decomposed', there wasn't any acute smell of death.</p>
              <p>Neighbours 938LIVE spoke to didn't sense that something was amiss.</p>
              <p>Mr Mazlan Mohd Noor lives next to the unit in which the body was found.</p>
              <p>The 43 year old despatch rider said he didn't hear or see anything out of the ordinary.</p>
              <p>He said the person who lived in the unit was a Chinese man in his late 40s.</p>
              <p>But he last saw him in October.</p>
              <p>They've been neighbours for some five years, but Mr Mazlan never knew his name.</p>
              <p>He describes him as a friendly person :</p>
              <p>"I always call my neighbour uncle. I think this uncle is very good,
              never give us problem. (He) takes care of the neighbours here also.
              (He) looks out for us when we go out to work, or (when) our family goes
              out, to take care of our house. I think he's a nice guy."</p>
              <p>He recalled some of the things they had conversations about.</p>
              <p>"Always talk about job, living expenses like job, money very hard
              now. About that only. So far, he never tell me about (his)
              difficulties, only tells me about the PUB bills, they (HDB) cut off
              already. He say 'cannot pay', 'can't afford to pay'."</p>
              <p>According to Mr Mazlan, the Housing and Development Board has been trying to find his neighbour due to his mortgage arrears.</p>
              <p>Officers from the Board had also previously asked Mr Mazlan about his neighbour's whereabouts.</p>
              <p>A few days ago, the HDB told Mr Mazlan they were going to break open and repossess his neighbour's flat.</p>
              <p>Mr Mazlan was informed so as not to cause any alarm to his family.</p>
              <p>This morning, HBD officers came to the flat and entered the unit which was shrouded in darkness.</p>
              <p>The officers then knocked on Mr Mazlan's home to ask if they could borrow a torch light.</p>
              <p>That's when Mr Mazlan believed they found the decomposed body.</p>
              <p>Police have classified the case as unnatural death and is currently investigating.</p>

              Yes, all these show that HDB has indirectly killed a man!
              
              These hard-handling people, and the government.......
              HDB should have given him an alternative rather than force him to his death.....like providing him with alternate solutions getting him on government subsidy or what.....
              
              HDB.........really brings bad light on them.

              Yah...and with the recent news on the MP refusing apologies from the mentally challenged boy...then its harder for the common people to receive help in this ever increasing economic crisis.
              
              The mother and son went for MTP session also to talk about the HDB loans.....they could very possibly end up like this man who died in his flat.
              
              
              Think about it.

              most probably did not die in october, except that life is getting harder and harder. The man was probably keeping to himself, stranded in his HDB flat, and may be at so low self-esteem that he does not want to meet other people like his neighbour.
              
              Scringing on his last bit of food, with hardly any light of hope at the end of the tunnel, he contemplated suicide. But not sure how he died, may be due to malnutritioned, or emotionally dejected, sense of hopelessness, he could have fell and become unconscious in the middle of the night, since there is already no electricity in the flat due to no money to pay maintenance bills.
              
              
              Poor thing.
