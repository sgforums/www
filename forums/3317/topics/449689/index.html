              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: From this year, Singaporeans will get absolute 
              priority over permanent residents when it comes to balloting for primary
               school places.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The Education 
              Ministry said where balloting is required during Primary One 
              registration, Singaporeans will be admitted first ahead of permanent 
              residents, before home-school distance is considered.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>For example, when 
              the number of applications exceed the number of school places, 
              Singaporeans who live closer to the school of choice will get higher 
              priority compared to Singaporeans who live further away.<br><br>Citizens
               living within one kilometre will be admitted first, followed by those 
              who live between one kilometre and two kilometres from school.<br><br>Singaporeans who live outside two kilometres of the school of choice will then be given a place.<br><br>If
               there are still vacancies in the school after all eligible Singaporean 
              children have been admitted after balloting, places will be given to 
              permanent residents, with priority given to those who live closer to 
              school.<br><br>MOE said by giving Singaporeans priority over PRs only 
              when balloting is required, it retains the underlying principles of the 
              Primary One registration framework, which reflect a careful balance of 
              considerations, and provide for diversity in Singapore schools, while 
              according citizens a further privilege.<br><br>This is on top of a 
              measure introduced in 2010, where Singaporeans are given two ballot 
              slips for each child for Primary One registration, while PRs get one 
              ballot slip per child.<br><br>MOE also announced that there will be 
              seven new primary schools next year - five in the new towns of Sengkang 
              and Punggol, and one each in Jurong West and Woodlands.<br><br>- CNA/cc</span></span></p>

              Last time, only 2 opp MP that why no  priority, now more opp MP that why got priority.  If after 2016 G.E  more opp MP = more priority.  Of cos if less opp MP then = less priority again.

Finally the Gods have spoken: Sinaporeans first for Primary One registration....what a great concession! BUT  wait a minute!....isn't this Singapura? If so, shouldn't it be only logical and natural that our Singaporean kids' rights and welfare, always take priority in education registration whether it be Primary 1 or Doctoral degree in local insitutions?...OH! and Singapore tax payer's scholarships as well? SO What's the big deal?</div>

                                      Appreciation of course  when it is due! When it  is merely a correction of "WRONGS" in the  past, of their own mistakes, what is there to appreciate? Many have already become victims of policies of the past! Some of these past polices e.g the "stop at two" policy have deprived some of us  of a family of  4 more siblings!  What is the compensation for that? They can't afford to pay us for such bad policies! Any government in power, whether PAP or APP or WP or SAP orPPA, must be kept on its toes  to think "carefully" all the consequences of their policies which affect human lives! Such is the nature of all politicians-unless you keep them on their toes, they will  be  pompous,callous arrogant and careless!

              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>They said this is one possible outcome, following the government's move to tighten the Primary One (P1) registration exercise.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Under the change 
              announced on Sunday, PRs will remain eligible for the same phases of the
               P1 registration exercise as citizens. However, when balloting is 
              necessary in a specific phase of the registration exercise, citizens 
              will be given absolute priority over PRs, even before home-to-school 
              distance is considered.<br><br>The change will take place from the P1 registration exercise this July.<br><br>Last year, nearly half of all primary schools held ballots for the P1 registration exercise.<br><br>With the latest change, some popular schools told Channel NewsAsia they are expecting a much smaller intake of PR children.<br><br>Competition
               for the popular schools is already fierce, even among Singaporeans, and
               one MP said it would make sense for PRs to avoid "brand name schools" -
               where balloting will most likely take place.<br><br>Mr Lim Biow Chuan, 
              chairman of Government Parliamentary Committee (GPC) for Education, 
              said: "If they think that they want their child to go to a certain 
              school, they have to consider whether that school would require 
              balloting or not. If it does, quite honestly, they should put their 
              efforts in volunteering in a school where balloting may not take place."<br><br>Property analysts also expect a slowdown in PRs going after HDB resale flats near popular schools.<br><br>Mr
               Eugene Lim, ERA Realty Network's key executive officer, said: "The 
              premium that buyers have been known to pay for being located near good 
              schools is as much as 10, sometimes even 15 per cent. <br><br>"So, if 
              there are less buyers competing for these units near these good schools,
               technically the premium would go down. But it's still early days. It's 
              very hard to say at this point if the prices will be affected, because 
              for the gap that is vacated by the PRs, the locals will come in and fill
               it, as locals still have to compete for the 1km rule if there are more 
              locals applying for the limited places available in each school."<br><br>Mr
               Lim added that buying a residential property with the intention of 
              being near "good schools" is more prevalent among Singaporeans than PRs.
               He said HDB flats near "good schools" would likely be in greater demand
               than private properties.<br><br>According to Mr Lim, PRs currently make
               up about 20 percent of the HDB resale market and 13 percent of the 
              private property resale market.<br><br>- CNA/ir</span></span></p>
