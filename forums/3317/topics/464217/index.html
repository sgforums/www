              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: The Singapore government on Friday announced a 
              comprehensive package of measures to cool the residential property 
              market.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The measures, which 
              will take effect from January 12, include higher buyer's stamp duty, 
              tighter loan-to-value limits, and higher minimum cash down payment for 
              second and subsequent housing loans. </span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The measures are 
              calibrated to be tighter on property ownership for investment, as well 
              as on foreign buyers, the Ministry of National Development said.<br><br>To discourage over-borrowing, financing conditions for housing have also been tightened. <br><br>In
               addition, structural measures have been implemented to strengthen the 
              policy intent of public housing and executive condominiums.<br><br>To further moderate the demand for HDB flats, the government has introduced several new measures. <br><br>It will tighten eligibility for loans to buy HDB flats. <br><br>Permanent residents who own a HDB flat will also not be allowed to sublet their entire flat. <br><br>Permanent
               residents who own a HDB flat must sell their flat within six months or 
              purchasing a private residential property in Singapore. <br><br>Deputy 
              Prime Minister and Minister for Finance Tharman Shanmugaratnam said in a
               statement: "The reality we face is that interest rates are 
              extraordinarily low, globally and in Singapore, and continue to add fuel
               to our property market.<br><br>"We have to take this further round of 
              measures now, to check recent market trends and avoid a more serious 
              correction in prices further down the road."<br><br>- CNA/al</span></span></p>

              I think this do help though it might not bring down the price but it stop this from shooting up the roof.  But if you view it this way, this might be another way to collect taxes for some of our "Long Term Investment".
              
              I like the part that PR must sell their HDB half year half getting a private property.  But I think this should extend to those PR currently holding both HDB and private property, perhaps they can be given 1-2 yrs to sell off.  And in the long term I think this should even extend to citizens.  As if I recall the objective of HDB is to ensure people have a roof and not for making money.  On top of that, I think those PR after leaving SG for more than 3 yrs and not coming should be ask to sell off their HDB as many is not staying in SG but just rent out the HDB to make money.

              <p><strong>Private property prices may fall by 5 to 7%: analyst</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Private property prices could go down by five to 
              seven per cent, predicted property analyst Mohamed Ismail of PropNex, as
               new property cooling measures took effect on Saturday. </span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The measures, aimed at ensuring a sustainable and stable property market, include tightening property ownership for investment.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>At La Fiesta 
              condominium's sales site in Sengkang on Saturday, there was a steady 
              stream of potential buyers. It was unlike the massive crowds that 
              thronged the site after the announcement of the cooling measures on 
              Friday night.<br><br>Saturday's visitors ranges from those who are not 
              affected by the measures, such as first-time buyers, to serious 
              upgraders willing to fork out more.<br><br>"Just bringing my parents 
              here for sightseeing," said Tay Yeng Hwee, a visitor at the sales site. 
              "Definitely won't have the money to buy with the additional measures."<br><br>With
               the new rules in place, Singaporeans buying their second property will 
              have to pay seven per cent of the additional buyer's stamp duty. <br><br>Some buyers whom Channel NewsAsia spoke to are not deterred by the measures.<br><br>"We
               are keen to have another property because we are staying with our 
              parents so (we are) thinking of getting another space," said Ray Chua, a
               potential buyer.<br><br>Originally slated to be launched next week, the developer had scrambled to get things ready for would-be buyers.<br><br>"Buyers
               are rushing down to get their choice units, which is good because you 
              don't have to go through luck," said Aprene Loh, marketing associate at 
              PropNex.<br><br>Channel NewsAsia understands that about 80 per cent of the launched units were snapped up in about four hours on Friday night.<br><br>There are about 800 units at La Fiesta, ranging from one- to five-bedroom units.<br><br>Tan
               Zhiyong, managing director at MCC Land (Singapore) said: "The measures 
              this time round are mainly aimed at investors and foreign buyers, and it
               may have a bigger impact on the more high-end condominium units, 
              because their buyers are mainly the investors and foreign buyers."<br><br>Mr
               Ismail said sales volume of private property is expected to fall by 
              over 50 per cent, as buyers and investors choose to wait out and see the
               effects of the cooling measures. <br><br>- CNA/xq</span></span></p>

              Actually for me, I view HDB and private property as 2 different thing.  The function for HDB is ensure every Singaporean (to some this can extend to PR) to have a roof over their head.  Thus this more control, as you can see that I disagree with PR and even Singaporean to own both HDB and private property, that is why I think those current own both should be ask to sell one (within a timeframe).  Those PR that leave Singapore for perhaps 3 yrs and rent out the HDB should be ask to sell off.
              
              There might be some using private property for investment, for this I am more open mind for the price to move (though I believe they will still be impact when there is a control for HDB)
