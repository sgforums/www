              SINGAPORE: A man is filing for divorce on the grounds that his wife, a teacher, has been having an affair with her former student.
                  In addition, he claims she started an "improper relationship" some 23 years ago with the former student, when he was 16 and she was then his teacher.
                  The woman is now 54, and the court has ordered that the identities of the couple not to be released by the media.
                  In court on Tuesday, the husband said the alleged relationship between his wife and the former student resulted in his wife treating the family poorly.
                  The case has been adjourned for hearing at a later date.

              <p><strong>After her 20-year affair, now hubby wants divorce</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: She was a teacher in his secondary school and he was a 16-year-old student when the alleged affair began.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Two decades later, 
              after teacher and student married separately and had their own families,
               the husband of the woman is now filing for divorce.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>In a Family Court on
               Tuesday, the man accused his wife of "unreasonable behaviour" and of 
              engaging in an "improper association" that has allegedly continued since
               1988.<br><br>His court papers stated that his wife, now in her 50s and 
              teaching in an all-girls school, has been carrying on an "inappropriate 
              romantic and intimate relationship" with her former student, now 38.<br><br>The divorcing couple cannot be named, as it could lead to the identification of their two adolescent children.<br><br>But
               the claims and counterclaims of the couple were laid bare as the 
              hearing began on Tuesday for a divorce that was filed in August 2009. <br><br>According to the court documents, the husband had met his wife when the latter was his private tutor. <br><br>The
               husband, a businessman in his 40s, said he found credit card statements
               in 1997, seven years into their marriage, showing shopping and dining 
              expenses. He added that his wife later admitted to meeting her former 
              student.<br><br>But she allegedly did not cease contact with her former 
              student as promised, even after a year, which was when her husband hit 
              her. She filed a police report.<br><br>The couple tried to save their 
              marriage but in 2008, the husband discovered emails between his wife and
               her former student, which allegedly showed "much flirting and sexual 
              innuendo being tossed back and forth between the two".<br><br>This, 
              after the couple had not been having sex for 10 odd years due to the 
              husband's impotence, caused by chronic health problems, according to 
              court papers.<br><br>In her defence, the wife denied the claims, 
              including the alleged affair. She said she had actively cared for her 
              family and that her husband had constantly placed a tight rein on her.<br><br>Represented
               by lawyer Koh Tien Hua of Harry Elias Partnership, she counterclaimed 
              that she was often scolded and beaten due to her husband's violent 
              temper and accused him of having an affair, instead, with their former 
              maid.<br><br>In subsequent papers filed with the court, she said she had a "purely platonic" relationship with her former student.<br><br>The
               husband, who is represented by lawyer Kevin Lim of Wee Swee Teoh &amp; 
              Co, is denying her claims and is rebutting that his probes were 
              justified due to the ongoing alleged relationship between her and her 
              former student. The man also denied any abuse and said his relationship 
              with their former maid was "entirely platonic".<br><br>The court hearing started after about two hours of closed-door hearings, as the couple could not come to a financial agreement.<br><br>The
               husband later told the court of an email correspondence of an alleged 
              "unofficial school trip" that his wife and her former student made - 
              when the latter was still schooling - where both slept in the same hotel
               room and "watched each other sleep".<br><br>During cross-examination, the husband also said the alleged ongoing affair had resulted in his wife treating the family poorly.<br><br>The
               court has adjourned the matter to a later date, when witnesses 
              including the wife's former student and the couple's children are 
              expected to take the stand. </span></span></p>

              <p>Well, you've just explained pretty much the facts. Why would the paper get in trouble? Because it's owned by SPH. SPH has close links with the Lee family. For so many years...because of this fear of getting into trouble, they withhold info that might offend them.</p>
