              <p>Barack Obama wins re-elections. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <h1 class="headline">Barack Obama wins election for second term as president</h1>
              <p>President Barack Obama handily defeated Gov. Mitt Romney and won 
              himself a second term on Tuesday after a bitter and historically 
              expensive race that was primarily fought in just a handful of 
              battleground states. Obama beat Romney after nabbing almost every one of
               the 12 crucial battleground states.</p>
              <p>The Romney campaign's last-ditch attempt to put blue-leaning 
              Midwestern  swing states in play failed as Obama's Midwestern firewall 
              sent the  president back to the White House for four more years. Obama 
              picked up  the swing states of New Hampshire, Michigan, New Mexico, 
              Iowa, Virginia,  Wisconsin, Colorado, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Minnesota 
              and Ohio. Of the  swing states, Romney picked up only North Carolina. 
              Florida is still too  close to call, but even if Romney wins the state, 
              Obama still beat him  in the Electoral College vote. The popular vote 
              will most likely be  narrower than the president's decisive Electoral 
              College victory.</p>
              <p>In a sweeping victory speech early Wednesday morning, Obama thanked 
              every American who voted, and vowed to work with leaders from both 
              parties to tackle the country's challenges.</p>
              <div id="_mcePaste">"Our economy is recovering, a decade of war is 
              ending, a long campaign is now over," he told a crowd of cheering 
              supporters in Chicago. "And whether I earned your vote or not, I have 
              listened to you, I have learned from you and you have made me a better 
              president." Obama added he has "never been more hopeful about America. 
              ... We're not as divided as our politics suggest. We remain more than a 
              collection of blue states and red states."</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>
              <p>In his speech, he offered clues to the policy goals of his second  
              term, which included a deficit reduction plan that combines tax  
              increases with spending cuts, a comprehensive overhaul of the nation's  
              federal immigration laws and tax reform. He called on Republicans to  
              join him in achieving those goals.</p>
              <p>The battle for the White House between Obama and Romney divided the  
              nation, causing, at times, bitter disputes between the parties. Obama  
              urged his supporters to look beyond the fight of the past several months
               and  defended the process of choosing a president.</p>
              <p>"I know that political campaigns can sometimes seem small, even   
              silly," Obama said. "And that provides plenty of fodder for the cynics  
              who tell us  that politics is nothing more than a contest of evils or  
              the domain of  special interests. If you ever get the chance to talk to 
               folks who  turned out to our rallies and along the rope lines of high  
              school gyms,  or saw folks working late at campaign office or some tiny 
               county a long way from home, you'll discover something else."</p>
              <p>Romney conceded in Boston in a speech around 1 a.m. ET. "Like so many
               of you, Paul [Ryan] and I have left everything on the field. We have 
              given our all to this campaign," Romney said. "I so wish that I had been
               able to fulfill your hopes to lead your country in another direction. 
              But the nation chose another leader." Romney congratulated the president
               and his campaign on their victory.</p>
              <p>The Obama victory marks an end to a years-long campaign that saw 
              historic advertisement spending levels, countless rallies and speeches, 
              and three much-watched debates.</p>
              <p>The Romney campaign cast the election as a referendum on Obama's 
              economic policies, frequently comparing him to former President Jimmy 
              Carter and asking voters the Reagan-esque question of whether they are 
              better off than they were four years ago. But the Obama campaign pushed 
              back, blanketing key states such as Ohio early on with ads painting him 
              as a multimillionaire more concerned with profits than people. The Obama
               campaign also aggressively attacked Romney on reproductive rights 
              issues, tying Romney to a handful of Republican candidates who made 
              controversial comments about rape and abortion.</p>
              <p>The ads were one reason Romney faced a 
              steep likeability problem for most of the race, until his expert 
              performance at the first presidential debate in Denver in October. After
               that debate, and a near universal panning of Obama's performance, 
              Romney caught up with Obama in national polls, and almost closed his 
              favorability gap with the president. In polls, voters consistently gave 
              him an edge over Obama on who would handle the economy better and create
               more jobs, even as they rated Obama higher on caring about the middle 
              class.</p>
              <p>But the president's Midwestern firewall—and the campaign's impressive
               grassroots operation—carried him through. Ohio tends to vote a bit more
               Republican than the nation as a whole, but Obama was able to stave off 
              that trend and hold an edge there over Romney, perhaps due to the 
              president's support of the auto bailout three years ago. Romney and his 
              running mate, Paul Ryan, all but moved to Ohio in the last weeks of the 
              campaign, trying and ultimately failing to erase Obama's lead there.</p>
              <p>A shrinking electoral battleground this year meant that only 12 
              states were really seen as in play, and both candidates spent most of 
              their time and money there. Though national polls showed the two 
              candidates in a dead heat, Obama consistently held a lead in the states 
              that mattered. That, and his campaign's much-touted get-out-the-vote 
              efforts and overall ground game, may be what pushed Obama over the 
              finish line.</p>
              <p>Now, Obama heads back to office facing what will most likely be 
              bitterly partisan negotiations over whether the Bush tax cuts should 
              expire. The House will still be majority Republican, with Democrats 
              maintaining their majority in the Senate.</p>
              <p>The loss may provoke some soul searching in the Republican Party. 
              This election was seen as a prime opportunity to unseat Obama, as polls 
              showed Americans were unhappy with a sluggish economy, sky-high 
              unemployment and a health care reform bill that remained widely 
              unpopular. Romney took hardline positions on immigration, federal 
              spending and taxes during the long Republican primary when he faced 
              multiple challenges from the right. He later shifted to the center in 
              tone on many of those issues, but it's possible the primary painted him 
              into a too-conservative corner to appeal to moderates during the general
               election. The candidate also at times seemed unable to effectively 
              counter Democratic attacks on his business experience and personal 
              wealth.</p>
              <p>"In the coming weeks and months I am looking forward to reaching out to leaders of both parties," Obama said.</p>
              <p>He won't have much time to fulfill that promise. With tax hikes 
              looming and a sequestration deal that will make enormous , automatic 
              cuts in government funding, Congress and the White  House must move 
              quickly to find a compromise and put Obama's high-minded  rhetoric into 
              action.</p>
