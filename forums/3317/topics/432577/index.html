              <p>IN October 2010, a Singaporean Chinese woman and her Caucasian 
              permanent resident husband discovered that their baby's blood group did 
              not match theirs.</p>
              <p>The baby's complexion was also markedly different from theirs. More 
              bad news was to follow when a DNA test showed that the baby born on Oct 1
               2010 was not biologically related to the husband.</p>
              <p>Thomson Medical Centre, which carried out the in-vitro fertilisation 
              procedure in January, apologised when the incident was made public.</p>
              <p>On Wednesday, the centre was charged in a district court for
               breaching the terms and conditions of its licence issued by the 
              Ministry of Health (MOH) by failing to ensure that suitable procedures 
              were followed in carrying out assisted reproduction treatment.</p>
              <p>The charge does not make any reference to the baby mix-up, 
              alleging that the centre had processed two semen specimens at the same 
              workstation at the same time. Pipettes used at its fertility centre were
               also said to have been reused instead of being discarded, as is 
              standard protocol.</p>
              <p>The case was adjourned till Tuesday.</p>

              <p><strong>Thomson Medical fined for breaching licence</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Thomson Medical has been fined the maximum S$20,000 
              after pleading guilty to breaching a condition of its Health Ministry 
              licence some seven months after news broke about a sperm mix-up at the 
              facility.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The medical centre 
              failed to comply with a clause which requires the assisted reproduction 
              (AR) director to ensure suitable practices are used in carrying out AR 
              activities, required by its licence under the Private Hospitals and 
              Medical Clinics Act.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Thomson Medical had 
              processed at the same time two semen specimens inside one laminar hood -
               a working space where procedures are performed in a laboratory - on Jan
               23 last year.<br><br>The centre also failed to discard, after each step
               of processing, instruments known as disposable pipettes, which are used
               to hold liquids.  <br><br>Instead, the centre labelled the disposable pipettes and kept them for use in subsequent processing for the same patient.  <br><br>Last
               November, it was reported that one of the centre's units, the Thomson 
              Fertility Centre, had wrongly used another man's sperm to impregnate one
               of its patients.  <br><br>The couple, a Singaporean Chinese woman and 
              her Caucasian permanent-resident spouse, has decided to keep the child 
              even though the husband's sperm was not the one used in the botched 
              in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) procedure.  <br><br>Following the mix-up, the Health Ministry imposed a suspension of all new AR activities at the centre in November last year. <br><br>-CNA/wk</span></span></p>
