              <p><strong>S'pore closes popular beaches after oil spill</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : Public beaches stained by an oil slick from a tanker 
              damaged in a collision off Singapore have been closed ahead of the 
              island's summer school holidays, officials said Thursday. </span></p>
              <p><span>A chocolate-like film covered a stretch of water along the popular
               East Coast Park after crude from Tuesday's collision slipped out of a 
              floating cordon at sea.
              <br> <br> Officials maintained that most of the spill was still far from the 
              shores of the city-state, which has one of the world's busiest ports and
               expects 11.5 million to 12.5 million tourists this year, more than 
              double its population.
              <br> <br> "The main oil slick is largely contained out at sea," a spokeswoman for 
              the Maritime and Port Authority (MPA) told AFP.
              <br> <br> A National Environment Agency (NEA) advisory said "the extent of the 
              impact is currently minimal, but will require some clean up over the 
              next few days."
              <br> <br> The NEA estimated that some 7.2 kilometres (4.5 miles) of beach and rock
               bunds along the east coast, as well as a canal, had been affected by 
              the slick after wind and tide conditions made containment at sea 
              difficult.
              <br> <br> The Malaysian-registered tanker MT Bunga Kelana 3 was carrying nearly 
              62,000 tonnes of crude when it collided Tuesday with the MV Waily, a 
              bulk carrier registered in St Vincent and the Grenadines.
              <br> <br> About 2,500 tonnes of crude leaked from a gash on the double-hulled 
              tanker's port side, officials said. Such tankers are designed to limit 
              spillage in case of a rupture.
              <br> <br> Emergency crews are using biodegradable dispersants and absorbent 
              material to soak up the oil, while 3.3km of booms surround the main oil 
              slick in a busy shipping lane straddling Singapore, Malaysia and 
              Indonesia.
              <br> <br> Signs have been put up to advise the public to stay away from the 
              affected beaches until the cleaning is complete.
              <br> <br> The month-long school summer holiday starts on Friday, a public holiday 
              (Vesak Day).
              <br> <br> On long weekends, Singaporeans, expatriates and tourists normally throng
               the park for swimming, barbecues and other activities.
              <br> <br> Singaporean environmentalists were closely monitoring the situation and 
              preparing to take part in the cleanup and animal rescue operations.
              <br> <br> "If it more or less hits the sands, it's mainly the invertebrates like 
              the crabs, the sea snails that will likely be affected," said Louis Ng, 
              executive director of activist group Animal Concerns Research and 
              Education Society.
              <br> <br> He said his group would visit the affected areas and "if there are any 
              animals, then we will rescue them."
              <br> <br> "From yesterday we were told it was contained. I think we will have a 
              look this afternoon and will know better."
              <br> <br> The government has loaned canvas skirting to offshore seafood farms near
               the spill site to cover their underwater nets and prevent any leaked 
              oil from contaminating their fish stocks.
              <br> <br> The collision took place in a busy shipping route along the Singapore 
              and Malacca straits but ship traffic was not affected by the incident 
              and clean-up, port officials said.
              <br> <br> Singapore is one of the world's leading ports, with data from the port 
              authority showing the island-nation handled 472 million tonnes of cargo 
              last year, with bulk oil cargo constituting 37.5 per cent of the total. </span></p>

              <p><strong>Straits of Malacca &amp; RFC to cooperate to clean up S'pore oil spill</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : Members of the Straits of Malacca and Singapore 
              Revolving Fund Committee (RFC) have agreed to cooperate to clean up the 
              oil spill resulting from Tuesday's collision of two vessels at sea. </span></p>
              <p><span>The RFC consists of members from the littoral states of Indonesia,
               Malaysia and Singapore. 
              <br> <br> The committee holds annual meetings to discuss issues relating to oil 
              spills and also hold regular joint exercises. 
              <br> <br> It held its 31st meeting in Singapore Thursday and was briefed on the 
              extent of the oil pollution from the collision.  
              <br> <br> During the meeting, the committee noted that the incident underscored 
              the importance of having the Standard Operating Procedures for Joint Oil
               Spill Combat in the Straits of Malacca and Singapore. 
              <br> <br> The SOP will help prevent environmental damage and disruption to 
              shipping traffic in the Straits of Malacca and Singapore when such 
              accidents occur. 
              <br> <br> The RFC also acknowledged that quick action and co-operation have helped
               to mitigate the impact of this incident.
              <br> <br> They also re-affirmed the continued close co-operation among the three 
              littoral states in combating oil pollution in the Straits of Malacca and
               Singapore. 
              <br> <br> They also pledged to work together to further enhance joint responses in
               the future. </span></p>
