              <p>Emergency teams scramble to contain nearly 2,000 tonnes of crude oil that leaked into the Singapore Strait after two vessels collided in the busy waterway, according to port officials.</p>
              <p>The <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=maritime+port+authority+singapore&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz"><span style="color: #334499;">Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore</span></a> (MPA) reveals that the Malaysian-registered tanker MT Bunga Kelana 3 has been damaged in a collision with a bulk carrier MV Wally registered in St. Vincent and the Grenadines.</p>
              <p>According to Malaysia’s <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=maritime+enforcement+agency&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;sado=1&amp;cs=bz"><span style="color: #334499;">Maritime Enforcement Agency</span></a>, the collision tore a 10-metre gash in the Malaysian tanker.</p>
              <p>The tanker’s operators, Malaysia-based AET, said in a statement, “Oil booms are being placed around the leaked cargo to contain the spill.”</p>
              <p>Nobody was injured in the accident and ship traffic in the area has not been affected by the incident that took place 13 km off Singapore in the Traffic Separation Scheme at 6.10am Tuesday, according to the release.</p>
              <p>The <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=traffic+separation+scheme&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz"><span style="color: #334499;">Traffic Separation Scheme </span></a>is a commercial channel that runs along the Straits of Malacca and Singapore.</p>
              <p>In the aftermath of the accident, both vessels were anchored off Singapore and neighbouring Malaysia and Indonesia have been notified.</p>
              <p>Salvage operators interviewed said that the spill could be damaging for the environment but a swift response by the authorities would significantly lessen the impact.</p>
              <p>“I think it can be controlled. 2,000 tonnes will not do much damage if the teams are already there,” a salvage operator tells <em>AFP.</em></p>

              <p><strong>Oil slick threatens S'pore coast after ship collision</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : Emergency teams scrambled to contain a 2,500-tonne oil
               spill near one of the world's busiest ports on Tuesday after two 
              vessels collided in the Singapore Strait, officials said. </span></p>
              <p><span>A crude oil slick about four kilometres (2.5 miles) long and one 
              kilometre wide was spotted near the east coast of Singapore hours after 
              the pre-dawn collision, Singapore's Maritime and Port Authority (MPA) 
              said.
              <br> <br> The Malaysian-registered tanker MT Bunga Kelana suffered a gash on its 
              port side after colliding with the MV Waily, a bulk carrier registered 
              in St Vincent and the Grenadines, Malaysian maritime officials said.
              <br> <br> Singapore's MPA said a total of 20 vessels from Singapore and Malaysia 
              were involved in the clean-up effort while 200 personnel were on standby
               to attend to coastal areas that might be affected by the slick.
              <br> <br> "Efforts to contain and clean up the oil spill are ongoing," it said, 
              adding that neither the spill nor the emergency response had affected 
              ship movements in the busy commercial route running along the Singapore 
              and Malacca straits.
              <br> <br> The city state was working closely with Malaysian and Indonesian 
              authorities.
              <br> <br> Containment booms were being used to confine the oil slick, which was 
              being treated with biodegradable dispersants designed to break down the 
              slick into smaller globules to be collected by response vessels.
              <br> <br> Singapore marinas, ferry terminals, sea sports centres and other 
              waterfront facilities were told to be prepared for possible effects of 
              the oil spill, although one salvage expert said much of the crude would 
              evaporate.
              <br> <br> A strong smell of fuel wafted over parts of Singapore as some of the oil
               evaporated in the tropical heat.
              <br> <br> Singapore is one of the world's busiest ports, with data from the MPA 
              showing the island-nation handled 472 million tonnes of cargo last year,
               with bulk oil cargo constituting 37.5 per cent of the amount.
              <br> <br> Malaysia's Maritime Enforcement Agency said in a statement that the MT 
              Bunga Kelana 3 had been towed to Singapore's Changi port for repairs 
              while the MV Waily was still anchored at the collision site.
              <br> <br> The statement added that the double-hulled tanker - designed to minimise
               cargo spillage in case of an accident - was carrying almost 62,000 
              tonnes of crude.
              <br> <br> Earlier, the agency told AFP the collision had torn a 10-metre (33-foot)
               gash in the tanker's port side.
              <br> <br> The tanker's operators, Malaysia-based AET, said in a statement: "Oil 
              booms are being placed around the leaked cargo to contain the spill."
              <br> <br> A spokeswoman for AET said the tanker had been carrying Bintulu light 
              crude and the oil was most probably the one leaking into the sea.
              <br> <br> "It seems to be a lot but if it is light crude, it will just evaporate,"
               said Ho Yew Weng, response and projects manager of disaster management 
              firm Oil Spill Response Singapore.
              <br> <br> Ho added that Singapore's hot climate would make the crude disperse even
               faster, and with the oil's prolonged exposure to the sun since morning,
               "a lot of evaporation would have taken place".
              <br> <br> Temperatures were likely to reach as high as 32 degrees Celsius (90 
              degrees Fahrenheit), the Singapore Meteorological Service said.
              <br> <br> Other salvage operators interviewed by AFP said the spill could 
              potentially be damaging for the environment, but the authorities' swift 
              response would significantly lessen the impact.
              <br> <br> "I think it can be controlled. 2,000 tonnes will not do as much damage 
              if the teams are already there," a salvage operator who did not want to 
              be named said.
              <br> <br> The spill was significantly smaller than that affecting the Gulf of 
              Mexico, which has seen hundreds of thousands of gallons (litres) of oil 
              leak into the sea each day since the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded and 
              sank last month.

              <p><strong>Scramble to save fish stock</strong></p>
              <p>FISH farmers are frantically trying to save their stock of fish, 
              which could die if oil from a two-vessel collision yesterday reaches 
              their net cages.</p>
              <p>The Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority of Singapore (AVA), which 
              manages all the fish farms here, says there is a possibility that the 
              oil slick will reach north-east Singapore today.</p>
              <p>All 51 farms off the Changi coast are covering their nets 
              with canvas skirting to prevent the oil from getting in. The skirting is
               on loan to them from the AVA.</p>
              <p>Some farmers are also taking extra precautions, such as 
              lowering their nets deeper into the ocean to minimise exposure to the 
              oil on the surface, or piping oxygen into net cages.</p>
              <p>'There is a possibility of the spill reaching Pulau Tekong 
              and Pulau Ubin today, depending on the tides and wind,' said AVA's 
              director of agricultural industry Wong Hon Mun.</p>
              <p>'What we are doing is taking precautions. Should the oil 
              come, at least the farms are protected.'</p>

              <p><strong>Oil patches hit shore</strong></p>
              <p>SMALL patches of oil and sheen have been spotted at Changi Naval 
              Base, contradicting statements from petroleum shipper AET that the oil 
              spill had been contained and 'would not spread out of the' spill zone.</p>
              <p>In the latest update on the clean-up operations, the Marine Port 
              Authority (MPA) said six response craft equipped with dispersants were 
              dispatched to manage the oil and sheen, which was spotted at around 2am 
              on Wednesday morning.</p>
              <p>As at 11.30am on Wednesday, 15 craft and more than 120 
              personnel were deployed as part of the containment and clean up efforts.
               3,300 metres of containment booms are being used to contain the oil 
              slick.</p>
              <p>The MPA stressed that other than this, the oil slick 'has 
              not affected Singapore's coastlines, with the water in Singapore's 
              anchorages reported to be 'clean'.</p>
              <p>It added that weather, tidal and wind conditions will play 
              an 'important role' in the containment of the oil slick.</p>
              <p>'Efforts to contain and clean up the oil slick are 
              continuing, and traffic in the Traffic Separation Scheme of the 
              Singapore Straits remains unaffected,' said the MPA.</p>

              <p>i wonder what people in the authorities doing. So a little spill never mind lah. note that our seas are very small only what the spill to flow to city area and marina barrage area? how we respond now i see no hope if disaster strike. matters like this is a test of how we can handle situations and disasters. no hope. they just don't know how fragile our singapore environment and eco systems are.</p>
              <p>the companies owning the ships shouuld be investigated for the accidents. if not any tom hairy dick can also drive a shipe like drive car accident on the road. and talking about rules there are lots of to observe at sea lathough no traffic lights. it happen in singapore waters so shall be trial according to singapore law at sea.</p>
              <p>never hear our neighbours offering help or advise or at least wayang show. onyl when the current change and water flow to their border then they only kaopehkaobu.</p>

              <p><strong>Parts of east coast beach closed due to oil spill </strong></p>
              <p>Part of East Coast beach has been closed to the public after traces of 
              oil from yesterday's oil spill were found near the shore. <br> <br> According to the National Environment Agency, the affected portion 
              stretches for 4.9 kilometres between the National Sailing Centre and the
               Goldkist Beach Resort. <br> <br> The first traces of oil in the area were detected in the area at about 
              3.45 pm today. <br> <br> Patches of oil slick were also found at the coastline between Tanah 
              Merah Ferry Terminal and Changi Naval Base. <br> <br> NEA has since deployed officers to clean up both sites and is advising 
              the public to stay away from the affected areas for the time being. <br> <br> Meanwhile, containment and clean up efforts in the sea off Changi East 
              are still ongoing. <br> <br> The oil spill followed a collision between two ships off Singapore's 
              eastern shore.</p>
