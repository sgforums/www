              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: A secondary school teacher pleaded guilty on 
              Wednesday to a string of offences that involved him using his mobile 
              phone to take upskirt videos.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Seow Swee Hong, 39, who taught at a school in the eastern part of Singapore, was picked up by police on July 25 last year.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>A store manager of the Popular bookstore at Toa Payoh HDB Hub had caught him taking upskirt videos of female students there.<br><br>In
               one instance, he took out his mobile phone, knelt down to position his 
              phone near one student's legs, and recorded a video of her shorts and 
              thighs. <br><br>He then continued to follow her and took more videos of her shorts and thighs as she walked or stood in the bookstore.<br><br>Court
               documents revealed that earlier that day, Seow had also taken similar 
              videos of some female students in the school he taught at.<br><br>The 
              video recordings in his phone showed images of the students' thighs as 
              they walked up the stairs and while they were sitting in the canteen.<br><br>Other videos taken at supermarkets on different days were also found in his mobile phone.<br><br>Prosecution proceeded on 10 charges of insulting the modesty of women, and took 84 into consideration.<br><br>The court heard that he committed at least half of the offences while he was on police bail.<br><br>Most of his victims were girls dressed in school uniforms.<br><br>Defence
               counsel David Liew asked for a pre-sentencing report, citing that his 
              client had obsessive-compulsive disorder, and could not control himself.<br><br>Seow will be back in court on October 12 for sentencing.<br><br>He could be sentenced to one year's jail and fined on each charge.<br><br>- CNA/cc</span></span></p>
