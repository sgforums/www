              <p>Is the Iranian community big in Singapore, should the authorities be of concern regarding recent violence cause by Iranians?</p>
              <p>Iranians arrested after blasts on a
              Bangkok street aimed to attack Israeli diplomats, and the
              devices used were similar to bombs targeting Israelis in <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/india/">India</a> and Georgia this week, according to <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/thailand/">Thailand</a>’s police chief.</p>
              <p>“The suspects targeted Israeli diplomats in Thailand,”
              Priewphan Damaphong told reporters in Bangkok yesterday, hours
              after he confirmed that the Bangkok bombs contained magnets
              designed to attach to vehicles. India’s initial investigations
              suggest that a magnetic device was attached to an Israeli
              diplomat’s car on Feb. 13 in New Delhi seconds before it
              exploded injuring the woman, the city’s police commissioner,
              B.K. Gupta, has said.</p>
              <p>“The type of explosive device is similar to the incident
              in India,” Priewphan told reporters in Bangkok. The men “were
              not targeting a place.”</p>
              <p>The incidents in India, Georgia and Thailand increase
              tensions as Israeli leaders, who haven’t ruled out a military
              strike, say time is running out for sanctions to deter <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/iran/">Iran</a> from
              building nuclear weapons. The U.S. and the European Union have
              tightened economic restrictions while seeking to avert a
              military conflagration in a region that holds more than half of
              global oil reserves.</p>
              <p>Israeli Prime Minister <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/benjamin-netanyahu/">Benjamin Netanyahu</a>’s security
              cabinet convened yesterday to discuss the attacks and hear
              Foreign Ministry and security officials’ assessments of the
              situation, Netanyahu’s office said in an e-mailed statement.</p>
              <h2>Iranian Threat</h2>
              <p>Before the meeting, Netanyahu told the Knesset, <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/israel/">Israel</a>’s
              parliament, that unless Iran is stopped, attacks against Israel
              will spread to other countries.</p>
              <p>“Israel’s security apparatus will know how to fight the
              Iranian threat,” Foreign Minister Avigdor Liberman said
              yesterday, according to an e-mailed statement from his office.</p>
              <p>Iran denies involvement in the attacks.</p>
              <p>“Efforts by Israel to harm the friendly relations between
              Thailand and Iran will bear no results,” <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/ramin-mehmanparast/">Ramin Mehmanparast</a>, a
              foreign ministry spokesman, was <a title="Open Web Site" rel="external" href="http://www.mehrnews.com/fa/newsdetail.aspx?NewsID=1534577">quoted</a> as saying by the Iranian
              state-run Mehr news agency. Israel’s “coordinated baseless
              accusations of our country having a hand in blasts in India and
              Georgia and Bangkok shows the plot and the setting up of a
              suspicious scenario.”</p>
              <h2>Scientists Killed</h2>
              <p>The attacks follow the deaths of several Iranian nuclear
              scientists, the most recent in a Jan. 11 car bombing in Tehran
              that Iran said Israel had orchestrated. They also coincided with
              the fourth anniversary of the killing of Imad Mughniyeh, who was
              a leader of the military wing of the Iranian-backed Lebanese
              Hezbollah movement, which Israel and the U.S. consider a
              terrorist organization.</p>
              <p>India, Thailand and <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/georgia/">Georgia</a> were probably targeted
              according to the assets the perpetrators were able to deploy,
              Will Hartley, head of the Terrorism &amp; Insurgency Centre at
              defense researcher IHS Jane’s, said in an e-mail.</p>
              <p>“The initial impression is that they were selected to
              demonstrate a wide-ranging international capability, rather than
              an intent to target the specific countries themselves,” he
              said.</p>
              <p>Thai officials detained two men with Iranian passports,
              including one who blew his own legs off in Feb. 14 blasts.
              Priewphan identified one of the suspects as Mohammad Khazaei,
              42, who he said police have connected to the explosions with
              closed-circuit television images.</p>
              <p>The men were charged yesterday with possession of explosive
              devices with the intent to harm others, Foreign Ministry
              spokesman Thani Thongpakdi said by phone.</p>
              <h2>Third Suspect</h2>
              <p>Malaysian authorities arrested a third suspect in the
              attack, <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/malaysia/">Malaysia</a>’s Inspector General of Police Ismail Omar said
              in cellphone text message. “He is being investigated for
              terrorism activities in relation to bombings in Thailand,” Omar
              said. Thai police are also searching for an Iranian woman who
              helped the three men rent the house in Bangkok.</p>
              <p>The arrests mark the second time in as many months Thai
              authorities have detained suspects accused of targeting Jewish
              sites in Bangkok. Police last month charged a Swedish-Lebanese
              man they linked to Hezbollah with possessing illegal substances
              after detaining him in connection with a plan to attack sites in
              the Thai capital frequented by Americans and Israelis.</p>
              <p>The arrest came three days after the U.S. Embassy in
              Bangkok warned Jan. 13 that “foreign terrorists” aimed to
              attack tourist areas. The U.S. and U.K. again warned citizens
              traveling in Thailand to remain vigilant after Feb. 14 attacks,
              which injured four people in addition to the suspect.</p>

              <h1>Nod given for extraditing Singaporeans in Iran weapons parts case</h1>
              <h1>Court orders 4 in Iran case to be sent to US</h1>
              <p>Four Singaporeans accused by the American government of sending 
              weapons parts to Iran were ordered to be extradited to the United States
               by a district court on Friday.</p>
              <p>The US authorities alleged that the 
              Singaporeans, three men and a woman, conspired to evade a US trade 
              embargo against Iran by smuggling electronic components from a US 
              company to Iran, which then ended up in explosives in Iraq.</p>
              <p>Noting that the hearing was only to ascertain whether
               there was sufficient evidence for extradition, District Judge Chia Wee 
              Kiat said the prosecution had made its case despite the denials of the 
              four.</p>
              <p>In his 48-page judgment, he wrote: 'Where 
              does the truth lie? Clearly, this can only be ascertained at trial where
               the evidence, explanations and credibility of witnesses can be tested 
              under cross-examination.'</p>
