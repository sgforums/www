              <h1 class="storyheadline">Flammable gases detected at Benoi Road shipyard</h1>
              <p>FLAMMABLE gases had been detected at the Benoi Road shipyard, the 
              scene of a fatal accident that claimed the lives of two workers on 
              Thursday.</p>
              <p>Zainudin Wan Jusoh, a 43-year-old Malaysian and 20-year-old 
              Bangladeshi Hasan Mainul, were working on a barge at the UDL Shipyard in
               Benoi Road at the time of the explosion.</p>
              <p>The strong blast dislodged the wall panels of a nearby workshop, 
              leaving the 10 workers within with minor injuries. The windscreens of 
              vehicles and windows in buildings in the vicinity shattered from the 
              impact of the explosion.</p>
              <p>On its findings, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) said four of
               14 tanks on the barge had ruptured, and traces of flammable gases had 
              been found in the remaining tanks.</p>
              <p>The presence of these vapours have been attributed to a 
              spray painting job that was carried out 3 days before the accident, 
              which may have fuelled to a flash fire, though MOM's investigations have
               not confirmed if a flash fire took place at all.</p>
              <p>The Ministry is still conducting inquiries into the matter, 
              to confirm if a flash fire had occurred and whether hot works were being
               carried out.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <h1><span style="color: #999999;">Explosion believed to be caused by sudden release of compressed air</span></h1>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Two foreign workers died after an explosion rocked a shipyard in Tuas, with the blast felt even 3km away.<br><br>The explosion at about 1.20pm yesterday at the UDL Shipyard in Benoi Road split a flat-bottom barge into two, causing it to flip over.</p>
              <p>The explosion also ripped out the metal walls and part of the roof of a workshop beside the barge, and shattered the windscreens of vehicles, and windows in adjacent buildings.</p>
              <p>The incident is believed to have occurred when the victims, 43-year-old Malaysian Zainudin Wan Jusoh and 20-year-old Bangladeshi Hasan Mainul, were conducting checks for leaks in one of the barge's tank compartments.</p>
              <p>Their bodies were recovered near the barge, estimated to be about 100m long and about 10m tall.</p>
              <p>The explosion is said to have been caused by a sudden burst of compressed air during air testing, a process used to maintain the water-tightness of a barge.</p>
              <p>The loud impact sent about 100 workers from nearby companies scrambling out of their premises.</p>
              <p>Among them was Mr Karuppiah Thangamani, 31, a tyreman who works at a company opposite the accident site.</p>
              <p>"Everything was shaking, it was like an earthquake," he said.</p>
              <p>Hundreds of others, some from as far as 3km away, converged on the scene after being jolted by a sound which they described as loud as a bomb explosion.</p>
              <p>Safety was the main concern for the management at Goltens, a company opposite the shipyard. All its 147 employees were sent home.</p>
              <p>The metal ceiling at one of the company's buildings was reduced to dangling strips, and windows were shattered.</p>
              <p>"They are traumatised. When you see the mess up there, it is quite a relief that no one got hurt," Mr Tom Boyle, the company's managing director, said of his workers.</p>
              <p>He was at his desk when the impact of the explosion brought down a false ceiling, leaving an air-conditioning unit hanging precariously above him.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h1><span style="color: #ff0000;">Industry experts speculated</span> that an explosion could have taken place because welding was being done while there was still compressed air in the barge. The welding was possibly to fix a hole that would compromise the water-tightness of the barge.</h1>
              <p>The Singapore Civil Defence Force, which received a call at 1.23pm, sent two fire engines, two fire bikes and an ambulance. Officers arrived in eight minutes, and announced the two men dead upon arrival.</p>
              <p>A spokesman said no one was hospitalised.</p>
              <p>The Ministry of Manpower said it has ordered a stop to all work at the site, which is occupied by Haosen Marine.</p>
              <p>While investigations into what happened are ongoing, industry experts who spoke to The Straits Times speculated that an explosion could have taken place because welding was being done while there was still compressed air in the barge.</p>
              <p>The welding was possibly to fix a hole that would compromise the water-tightness of the barge.</p>
              <p>However, such welding would cause the air to expand, and therefore gush out all at once. Air that is pumped in is usually released bit by bit after the test is over.</p>
              <p>A 37-year-old friend of the Malaysian victim said he had introduced the father of two to the job at Haosen Marine, and that the man had been working there for about seven months.</p>
              <p>His family has been informed, he added.</p>
              <p>The niece of Mr Zainudin's wife said the family has gathered at his home in Johor Baru.</p>
              <p>"We were shocked. We didn't expect it to happen. His wife is inconsolable."</p>
              <p>The Bangladeshi victim is believed to have worked here for three months.</p>
              <p>The management of Haosen did not want to comment.</p>
