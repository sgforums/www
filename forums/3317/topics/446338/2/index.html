              <p>You do realise that the words are not really meant for the student? Indirectly, it is calling for the parents to pay more attention to their child studies.</p>
              <p>It is still ok to not be able to spell "ruler" "table" etc. But not knowing how to dot an "i"? seriously?</p>
              <p>and everyone was once a student, and should know that some parents are totally bochap in their child's studies, and throw everything to the teacher.</p>
              <p>There is only so much a teacher can do, when parents are reluctant to enforce basic rules at home, e.g. make sure child does homework, revise for spelling etc. you need 2 hands to clap.</p>
              <p>I have seen many child so spoilt by their parents, that their parents fight to bring their precious child out of every "hardship" their child faced in his life.</p>
              <p>If child don't want to do homework, then let him be.</p>
              <p>If child kena scolding by teacher for poor grades, complain straight to principal.</p>
              <p>If child don't want to go to school, write parent letter and excuse him for xyz reasons.</p>
              <p>It was quite ridiculous when I once saw my colleague hand in a parent's letter to my boss, for not coming for work. Spare the rod, spoil the child. This is indeed true.</p>

For if you are a local you embarass the locals and if you are a foreigner then it is all kudos to the government policy. And trying to compare relief to a full time is another all time champion of ur lack of knowledge of teaching industry while trying to act as a know it all.

              <p>2) Which school, what level, what kind of students? 14% sounds nice. but from wad marks to what marks? I heard of people who improved their student's grades from 20/100 to 40/100, an increase of 50%, but so what? still considered fail. And I'm sure most fulltime teachers would have done relief teaching before signing on with MOE. obviously, relief teaching is much much easier than fulltime teaching, if not we won't be seeing the annual exodus of teachers from the teaching service.</p>
              <p>3) Teaching is easy, I agree. But making your students improve is not. If the student is unwilling to study, and parents who not want to/unable to discipline their child, the student will never improve, no matter what the teacher do (which is kind of limited, given that nowadays parents easily complain about teachers overstepping boundaries. e.g. give too much homework/pressure on their child. complain about teacher scolding child. complain about why child is not allowed to bring handphone into O level exam.</p>
              <p>They seem to insulate their child against everything, regardless of right or wrong. Is it wrong for a teacher to comment that a child's handwriting is ugly? In the past, my parents would have me whacked upside down for that, for bringing shame to the family. And today? Parents response by posting on stomp, and complain about the teacher.</p>
              <p>And lastly, the teacher where got keep the parents in the dark? haha. She so clearly wrote down the child's problem: Ugly handwriting, poor spelling, talkative in class. And she has definitely captured the parents' attention.</p>
              <p>It is good that she point out the problems early in the first month of Pri 1, instead of giving the parents a nasty wakeup call in Pri 2, when they discover their child failing exams.</p>
