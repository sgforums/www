              <p>quite true and true.</p>
              <p>But I think that there are more good teachers around in neighbourhood schools than you think. It is just that alot of them most likely become demoralised by many factors like student attitude, red tape and unreasonable/uncooperative parents.</p>
              <p>in elite schools, students are already smart, come from rich/well-to-do families, can afford to have tuition, and thus do well as expected. So cannot say that elite school teachers are confirm good.</p>
              <p>In fact, I think neighborhood sch teachers are the most impressive, given the frequency of news reports of success stories, where the teacher inspire XYZ problem student into top scorers for PSLE, o lvl, a lvl etc.</p>
              <p>If a teacher can achieve such "miracles" for XYZ student, then clearly, he is a good teacher, and those students who did poorly under that teacher only have themselves to blame.</p>

              <p>That’s either an increase of 20% or 100%,

              <p>I’d say “all” would be inaccurate.  One business stream I work with is education, in particular assessing and improving school effectiveness.  Typical of schools that we work with, you’d have the leadership team plus a few enthusiastic teachers leading the charge, some ambivalent staff members and a few, say 20-30%, who go out of their way to avoid raising their game.  The ones who are interested in effectiveness focus upon ways of improving performance.  That last 20-30%, on the other hand, waste their breath and everybody's time listing out all of the difficult things about their jobs (inattentive kids, parents not doing what teachers are paid to do, etc.) and personify the old saying, “those who can, do; those who can’t, teach”.<br><br>One of the sad realities of management is that there are almost always going to be a few people who drag their heels.  Some come to the party after you’ve read the riot act to them, and for the others, the only thing to do is carry out a mercy killing and call it performance management.  Some performance-focussed sectors (aerospace and finance are good) get with the program, probably as a matter of surviving against the competition, while others like education seem content to carry a certain proportion of dead weight.  Sadly, there are still a number of idiots out there who still see teaching as an iron rice bowl, and believe they have the right to continue collecting their pay while applying a misguided cookie-cutter approach to their jobs instead of taking the trouble to understand what they are there to achieve.<br><br>So, we get to the obvious point here: what can be done in this situation?  Well, it’s not going to take too much tea-leaf reading to see that this teacher is simply not receiving support from her colleagues.  After all, barring career-ending enmity, who would allow a colleague to place such grievously stupid comments on something to be handed to a student, and in turn to the student’s parents?  If she’s going off doing such dumb things, I’d say that she’s unlikely to be mature enough to confer with her colleagues about the best means of getting students’ attention and motivating them.  That being the case, and seeing as how a certain proportion of the staff needs to be spoonfed, the school’s leaders might be best off putting a peer review and feedback process into place.  If the lagging staff members still don’t raise their game, it’s time to clear out some dead wood, employment arrangements permitting.</p>

              <p>I’d say “all” would be inaccurate.  One business stream I
              work with is education, in particular assessing and improving
              school effectiveness.  Typical of schools that we work with,
              you’d have the leadership team plus a few enthusiastic teachers
              leading the charge, some ambivalent staff members and a few, say
              20-30%, who go out of their way to avoid raising their game. 
              The ones who are interested in effectiveness focus upon ways of
              improving performance.  That last 20-30%, on the other hand,
              waste their breath and everybody's time listing out all of the
              difficult things about their jobs (inattentive kids, parents not
              doing what teachers are paid to do, etc.) and personify the old
              saying, “those who can, do; those who can’t, teach”.<br> <br> One of the sad realities of management is that there are almost
              always going to be a few people who drag their heels.  Some
              come to the party after you’ve read the riot act to them, and for
              the others, the only thing to do is carry out a mercy killing and
              call it performance management.  Some performance-focussed
              sectors (aerospace and finance are good) get with the program,
              probably as a matter of surviving against the competition, while
              others like education seem content to carry a certain proportion of
              dead weight.  Sadly, there are still a number of idiots out
              there who still see teaching as an iron rice bowl, and believe they
              have the right to continue collecting their pay while applying a
              misguided cookie-cutter approach to their jobs instead of taking
              the trouble to understand what they are there to achieve.<br> <br> So, we get to the obvious point here: what can be done in this
              situation?  Well, it’s not going to take too much tea-leaf
              reading to see that this teacher is simply not receiving support
              from her colleagues.  After all, barring career-ending enmity,
              who would allow a colleague to place such grievously stupid
              comments on something to be handed to a student, and in turn to the
              student’s parents?  If she’s going off doing such dumb things,
              I’d say that she’s unlikely to be mature enough to confer with her
              colleagues about the best means of getting students’ attention and
              motivating them.  That being the case, and seeing as how a
              certain proportion of the staff needs to be spoonfed, <strong>the school’s
              leaders might be best off putting a peer review and feedback
              process into place.  If the lagging staff members still don’t
              raise their game, it’s time to clear out some dead wood, employment
              arrangements permitting.</strong></p>

              <p>Ya, i agree with you that there are alot of such lagging staff members around putting a bad name to the profession.</p>
              <p>2 points to raise here:</p>
              <p>1) There is already such a process in place, as common in the civil service. But it is precisely this program which is obstructing efficiency, since the performance review follows a bell curve, and the current situation seems that this system favors the laojiaos. The newbies can only suck thumb and wait for their "turn" for better grades and subsequent promotion.</p>
              <p>2) yes, dead wood should be cleared out. but can school administrators afford to let their staff go, regardless of how ineffective they are? To become a teacher requires specialised training, which takes time and money, and clearly, MOE obviously won't spend extra money hiring addition teachers outside their projected figures.</p>
              <p>Each year, if you have individuals who voluntarily leave the system, and if you still want to clear out the "dead wood", the school might end up with a shortage of staff, affecting the student-teacher ratio. I don't think not many principals would want to risk that.</p>

              <p>Ah, interesting.<br> <br> It would be worth looking into what that Bell curve actually measures - 
                  if time-in-service is part of the equation, then it would indeed favour 
                  the lao jiaos.  On the other hand, if the measure is based upon student 
                  performance (performance improvements would be a useful component), it 
                  might be that the lao jiaos are actually better at teaching.  Either 
                  that, or they get dibs on the best-performing students for starters.</p>
              <p>As
                   for clearing out the dead wood, an industrial-relations minefield comes
                   as part of the territory.  The iron-rice-bowl club get surprisingly 
                  energetic when it looks like that rice bowl's going to be broken after 
                  all - too bad they can't apply that energy to their real work (hey, did that just sound like a report card remark? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png">).  One 
                  drastic measure I've seen is implementing a policy where all long-term 
                  employment contracts were cancelled and replaced by 3-5 year contracts 
                  that involved performance reviews before renewal, accompanied by a 
                  prescribed review system.  That upset a lot of teachers, but it sure 
                  gave them a well-deserved wake-up call, and resulted in a significantly 
                  improved teaching system.</p>
