              <p><strong>Coroner: 6 bodies found at home; Ohioan arrested</strong></p>
              <div class="bd">
              <div class="content">
              <p>CLEVELAND – A convicted
              rapist who fled before police arrived to arrest him on new rape charges
              was arrested Saturday in his inner-city neighborhood after police found
              six decomposing bodies at his home.</p>
              <p>Police spokesman Lt.
              Thomas Stacho said Anthony Sowell was walking down the street on the
              east side of Cleveland when authorities spotted him and took him into
              custody.</p>
              <p>Sowell initially denied he was the man authorities
              were looking for but admitted his identity as officers began
              fingerprinting him, Stacho said. Charges against him are pending.</p>
              <p>Officers
              initially identified three bodies at Sowell's home, Stacho said. Powell
              Caesar, a spokesman for the Cuyahoga County coroner's office, said
              additional remains were found and confirmed Saturday as three more
              bodies, for a total of six.</p>
              <p>As of Saturday, autopsies had been
              performed on all six bodies but no cause of death or names were
              announced. Two autopsies were done Friday.</p>
              <p>The first two
              bodies were found Thursday night when police went to Sowell's home to
              arrest him on charges of felonious assault and rape. Police say he had
              spent 15 years in prison for a 1989 rape.</p>
              <p>Cuyahoga County
              Coroner Frank Miller identified two bodies as black females and said
              one had died of a violent death ruled a homicide. No race or gender was
              determined for the others.</p>
              <p>Police established a command post
              in the neighborhood to take missing-person reports and additional
              information on outstanding missing persons in the neighborhood.</p>
              <p>Teresa
              Hicks, 48, was among the neighbors who said they were relieved about
              the arrest but left with a heightened fear of crime. She said she has
              known Sowell since high school.</p>
              <p>"He was crazy," she said from her porch Saturday. "Sometimes he would just go off if he didn't have his way."</p>
              <p>Darren
              Dunlap, 38, frequently visits the neighborhood to see his brother or
              friends. He said Sowell was known for borrowing money and looking for
              scrap metal to sell.</p>
              <p>Hicks said she didn't think Sowell had a
              job but understood from conversations with him that he lived on a
              monthly check. She said she didn't know its source.</p>
              <p>Police
              were checking crime reports to find matches for similarities to the
              1989 rape or the most recent allegation against Sowell.</p>
              <p>Minutes
              before the arrest was made, police Chief Michael McGrath tried to
              reassure parents that it was safe for their children to go
              trick-or-treating in the neighborhood if they followed standard
              precautions like avoiding strangers and staying in a group.</p>
              <p>Hicks said her daughter would not be trick-or-treating.</p>
              <p>Detectives
              with a search warrant found two bodies Thursday on the third floor of a
              duplex and began checking a fresh grave dug in the basement. The bodies
              were in an advanced state of decomposition, suggesting they'd been in
              the home a long time.</p>
              <p>Police were checking missing-person reports back to June 2005, when Sowell was released from prison.</p>
              <p>As a convicted sex offender, Sowell was required to report regularly to the sheriff's office, which said he had complied.</p>
