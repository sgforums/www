            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>SEOUL, South Korea - Former President Roh Moo-hyun, embroiled in a
              penetrating corruption investigation, leaped to his death Saturday _ a
              shocking end for a man whose rags-to-riches rise took him from rural
              poverty to Seoul's presidential Blue House. He was 62.</p>
              <p>Roh, a self-taught lawyer who never attended college and didn't have
              the elite background typical of Seoul politicians, had prided himself
              on being a "clean" leader immune to South Korea's traditional web of
              corruption.</p>
              <p>Allegations that Roh, president from 2003-08,
              accepted $6 million in bribes from a businessman while in office
              weighed heavily on the ex-leader, who appeared emotionally wrought last
              month as he prepared to face prosecutors.</p>
              <p>Roh hurled himself off
              a 100 foot (30 meter) high cliff early Saturday while hiking, trailed
              by a security guard, near his home in Bongha, police in the nearby
              southern port city of Busan said. Life had become unbearable and "too
              many people are suffering because of me," Roh wrote in a note found on
              his computer, police said.</p>
              <p>"What's left for me for the rest of my
              life is just to be a burden to others," his note said. "Don't be too
              sad. Aren't life and death both part of nature? Don't feel sorry. Don't
              blame anybody. It's destiny." He asked to be cremated, a small
              gravestone erected near his home.</p>
              <p>Roh's suicide stunned the
              nation. At train stations and shopping malls across the country, South
              Koreans were glued to TV monitors. Many snapped up special newspaper
              editions about Roh. Tens of thousands flooded his Web site, many
              posting condolences.</p>
              <p>"I was utterly shocked," said Chun Soon-im,
              63, of Seoul. "They say 'hate the sin but not the sinner,' and that's
              how I feel. The investigation must continue and we must get to the
              truth, but I cannot help feeling sorry for the man and those left
              behind."</p>
              <p>Mourners wailed as Roh's coffin, draped in red, returned
              to Bongha from a Busan hospital. His two children, sobbing, followed
              the casket to the community center near his birthplace of Gimhae, some
              280 miles (450 kilometers) from Seoul. Hundreds lined up late in the
              night to pay their respects.</p>
              <p>In the capital, more than 2,500
              people held a somber candlelight memorial service at a makeshift
              mourning site, many bowing, burning incense and leaving white
              chrysanthemums, a traditional Korean symbol of grief.</p>
              <p>In
              Washington, President Barack Obama said he was "saddened" by the news
              and offered his condolences to Roh's family and the South Korean people.</p>
              <p>Roh's
              is the latest high-profile suicide in a country with the highest
              suicide rate among the 30 nations in the Organization for Economic
              Cooperation and Development.</p>
              <p>The corruption allegations against Roh were by no means the worst leveled against a South Korean president.</p>
              <p>In
              1997, two ex-presidents were convicted of pocketing hundreds of
              millions of dollars in bribes while in office. Chun Doo-hwan, president
              from 1981-88, was fined $270 million; Roh Tae-woo, leader from 1998-93,
              was fined $350 million.</p>
              <p>But the accusations were deeply shameful to Roh, who built a reputation as anti-corruption crusader.</p>
              <p>"I
              feel ashamed before my fellow citizens. I am sorry for disappointing
              you," Roh told supporters three weeks ago before turning himself over
              to prosecutors who grilled him for more than 10 hours.</p>
              <p>During the interrogation, Roh denied the allegations against him, the prosecution spokesman Cho Eun-sok said.</p>
              <p>He
              previously acknowledged that a local businessman indicted in December
              in a separate bribery scandal _ gave his wife $1 million, which he did
              not consider a bribe. He also said he was aware the man gave $5 million
              to another relative but thought it was an investment.</p>
              <p>Prosecutors
              suspect all $6 million eventually reached Roh, and were expected to
              announce soon whether they would seek to arrest him. His wife and
              children also were summoned for questioning, and last week his elder
              brother was sentenced to four years in prison in a separate bribery
              scandal.</p>
              <p>A worried Roh wasn't eating properly and had taken up smoking recently, news reports said.</p>
              <p>Roh's
              backers accuse conservative supporters of President Lee Myung-bak, who
              took over from Roh in February 2008, of carrying out the probe as
              political revenge. Near Seoul's City Hall, Roh supporters stood in line
              to sign a petition seeking Lee's impeachment.</p>
              <p>Lee, who learned of
              Roh's death just before a summit with European Union officials,
              appeared grim Saturday. He found news of Roh's death "truly hard to
              believe," spokesman Lee Dong-kwan quoted him as saying.</p>
              <p>Roh's
              death was a tragic end for the humble son of farmers who never attended
              college but still managed to pass the country's tough bar exam in 1975
              and opened his own practice three years later.</p>
              <p>He forged a
              reputation as a human right lawyer, defending students accused of
              sedition under previous military-backed administrations. He once was
              arrested and his law license suspended for supporting an outlawed labor
              protest.</p>
              <p>Roh's political career took off with his election as a liberal lawmaker to the National Assembly in 1988.</p>
              <p>His
              ascension to the presidency came in a surprise 2002 election win on a
              campaign pledge not to "kowtow" to the United States, one that
              resonated with young voters.</p>
              <p>But in 2004, Roh made the costly
              misstep of urging voters to support candidates from his Uri Party in a
              violation of political neutrality laws. He was impeached, then
              reinstated months later after a court ruled in his favor.</p>
              <p>Roh
              maintained liberal predecessor President Kim Dae-jung's "sunshine
              policy" of offering North Korea aid to facilitate reconciliation,
              holding a summit in Pyongyang with North Korean leader Kim Jong Il in
              2007, the second such meeting between leaders of the two countries that
              technically remain at war.</p>
              <p>"I lost my lifetime democracy movement comrade. I feel like half of my body has collapsed," Kim said, according to an aide.</p>
              <p>Though
              criticized as inexperienced and confrontational by some, Roh was
              praised by others as a humble, candid leader who pushed for political
              reform and fought against corruption.</p>
              <p>"He shocked us twice:
              first, by betraying our trust in him as the keeper of justice when it
              was revealed that he'd received the illegitimate money; now, in showing
              that he was not even responsible enough to face the consequences of his
              action," said Kim Hye-jung, 35, of Seoul. "As a supporter of the values
              he stood for, I feel greatly let down."</p>
              <p>Roh is survived by his
              wife, Kwon Yang-sook, son Roh Gun-ho and daughter Roh Jeong-yeon.
              Funeral arrangements were not immediately available.</p>

              <p><strong>South Korea plans public funeral for ex-leader Roh</strong></p>
              <p>SEOUL (Reuters) – 
              South Korea's government and the family of <span id="lw_1243218662_0" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc; background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; cursor: pointer;   -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial;">former President Roh Moo-hyun</span> agreed on Sunday to hold a public funeral for the leader who likely
              jumped to his death after being hounded for weeks in a widening
              corruption scandal.</p>
              <p>Roh, 62, whose single five-year term as president ended about 15 months
              ago, appears to have leapt from a cliff behind his rural home on
              Saturday morning.</p>
              <p>He wrote in a note before his death: "Don't blame anybody. Please
              cremate me. And please leave a small tombstone near home." Local police
              said the results of a provisional investigation indicate the death was
              suicide.</p>
              <p>"It is more desirable to send the former president off in an honorable
              and courteous way befitting a former president and to allow as many
              people as possible to pay reverence and praise him," Cheon Ho-seon, a
              spokesman for Roh when he was president, said in a statement.</p>
              <p>Local media said the government and family were looking to hold the
              funeral on Friday for Roh, a self-taught lawyer who rose from rural
              poverty and won the presidency backed by a generation of students who
              hit the streets to fight for democracy in the 1980s.</p>
              <p>Perhaps Roh's most celebrated moment came when he went to Pyongyang in 2007 for a summit with <span id="lw_1243218662_1" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc; cursor: pointer;">Kim Jong-il</span> in what was only the second meeting of leaders of the divided peninsula.</p>
              <p><span id="lw_1243218662_2" class="yshortcuts">North Korea</span> reported on Roh's death on Sunday, saying in a two-sentence dispatch:
              "Media at home and abroad are linking the motive of his death with the
              mental burden caused by the intensive investigation of the prosecution."</p>
              <p>Roh was questioned last month by prosecutors on suspicion that his family took about $6 million in bribes from a <span id="lw_1243218662_3" class="yshortcuts">shoe company CEO</span>, which tarnished a reputation he tried to nurture of being a reformer who wanted to clean up government.</p>
              <p>The South Korean public largely saw Roh as an ineffective leader whose
              government was marred by numerous missteps and overwhelmingly voted to
              replace him with a conservative businessman who pledged to undo Roh's
              economic policies.</p>
              <p>The likelihood of suicide could boost sympathy for opponents of his successor <span id="lw_1243218662_4" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc; background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; cursor: pointer;   -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial;">President Lee Myung-bak</span>,
              whose hardline policies have largely overturned the more accommodating
              approach of Roh in dealings with North Korea and strike-prone <span id="lw_1243218662_5" class="yshortcuts">labor unions</span>.</p>
              <p>Mourners in <span id="lw_1243218662_6" class="yshortcuts">Seoul</span> paid respects to Roh at the weekend while tearful residents of his
              southeast Bongha Village hometown lined the streets when a coffin
              carrying Roh's body arrived back from hospital on Saturday.</p>

              <p><strong>Emotional funeral for South Korea's Roh Moo-hyun</strong></p>
              <p>SEOUL, South Korea – A sea of wailing mourners filled the streets of <span id="lw_1243596113_0" class="yshortcuts" style="background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; cursor: pointer;   -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial;">Seoul</span> for the funeral Friday of former President <span id="lw_1243596113_1" class="yshortcuts">Roh Moo-hyun</span>, whose suicide six days earlier amid a deepening corruption probe plunged <span id="lw_1243596113_2" class="yshortcuts" style="background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; cursor: pointer;   -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial;">South Korea</span> into grief and anger.</p>
              <p>Heads bowed, thousands took part in a solemn ceremony in the courtyard of the 14th-century <span id="lw_1243596113_3" class="yshortcuts">Gyeongbok Palace</span> before the hearse carrying Roh's body headed to a grassy plaza outside
              City Hall for emotional public rites attended by a reported 500,000
              people. Riot police later moved in as the crush of mourners delayed the
              hearse from leaving the capital.</p>
              <p>Police
              dispatched some 21,000 officers to quell any protests by Roh supporters
              who accuse conservative political opponents led by <span id="lw_1243596113_4" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc; cursor: pointer;">President Lee Myung-bak</span> of driving the liberal former leader to his death with the bribery investigation.</p>
              <p>The criticism comes as Lee faces an increasingly belligerent <span id="lw_1243596113_5" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc; cursor: pointer;">North Korea</span>,
              which just two days after Roh's death carried out a nuclear test in a
              move widely condemned as a violation of U.N. resolutions.</p>
              <p>Roh,
              62, died May 23 after throwing himself off a cliff behind his home in
              the southern village of Bongha. Roh, president from 2003 to 2008,
              recently had been questioned about allegations he and his family
              accepted $6 million in bribes during his presidency.</p>
              <p>He
              denied the bribery accusations, but they weighed heavily on a man who
              prided himself on his record as a "clean" politician in a country
              struggling to shake a deeply rooted culture of corruption.</p>
              <p>The suicide stunned the nation of 49 million, where the outspoken Roh — a self-taught former <span id="lw_1243596113_6" class="yshortcuts">human rights lawyer</span> who swept into office on a populist tide — was celebrated as a leader
              for the people and was a favorite among young South Koreans for
              standing up to Washington.</p>
              <p>Though many were
              critical of his antiestablishment ways, others rallied around his
              efforts to promote democracy, fight corruption and facilitate
              rapprochement with North Korea.</p>
              <p>Roh "lived a
              life dedicated entirely to human rights, democracy and fight against
              authoritarianism," Prime Minister Han Seung-soo said at the palace
              funeral. "Our people won't forget what you accomplished for the country
              and the people despite a number of hardships."</p>
              <p>Last weekend, Roh supporters refused to let Han and others from the ruling <span id="lw_1243596113_7" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc; background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; cursor: pointer;   -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial;">Grand National Party</span> pay their respects in Bongha, with some dousing politicians with water and pelting them with eggs.</p>
              <p>Roh
              supporters have called the probe against him "political revenge," and
              posters accusing Lee of driving Roh to his death plastered the walls of
              one Seoul subway station.</p>
              <p>"I've never been so
              ashamed of being a citizen of this country — a country that kills its
              own president," said Won Seung-tae, 52, of Seoul. "It feels like we've
              lost all respect in pushing each other to extremes."</p>
              <p>Opposition lawmakers jeered Lee as he and his wife approached the altar Friday to pay their respects.</p>
              <p>"<span id="lw_1243596113_8" class="yshortcuts">President Lee Myung-bak</span>,
              apologize!" opposition lawmaker Baek Won-woo yelled, jumping to his
              feet and cursing Lee before security guards hauled him away. "This is
              political revenge, a political murder!"</p>
              <p>A
              somber Lee looked back momentarily and hesitated before laying a white
              chrysanthemum on the altar and bowing before Roh's portrait. Lee had
              called Roh's death "tragic" upon learning of the suicide Saturday.</p>
              <p>Roh's death triggered a wave of grief across <span id="lw_1243596113_9" class="yshortcuts">South Korea</span>, overshadowing the nuclear threat from North Korea's test blast Monday.</p>
              <p>At
              City Hall, sobbing mourners wore yellow paper hats with images of Roh
              and waved yellow handkerchiefs as they watched the funeral on large
              monitors. The plaza was awash in yellow, Roh's campaign color.</p>
              <p>"I
              respected him. He was a person who never compromised with injustice,"
              said Chang Min-ki, 30, a yellow scarf tied around his neck. "I feel
              like I've lost everything."</p>
              <p>The funeral procession began at dawn in Roh's hometown.
              Villagers lined Bongha's streets as the hearse blanketed with white
              chrysanthemums departed for the capital.</p>
              <p>More than 2,500 were invited to a formal ceremony in the
              courtyard of the stately palace in the heart of ancient Seoul, where
              Roh's portrait sat on a bed of 1 million chrysanthemums laid in the
              shape of a Rose of Sharon, South Korea's national flower.</p>
              <p>Roh's suicide note, in which he begs his wife and two children,
              "Don't be too sad" and describes his suffering as "unbearable," was
              read aloud.</p>
              <p>Buddhist monks and Catholic nuns chanted prayers as part of the
              multifaith ceremony reflective of South Korea's changing modern
              history, where <span id="lw_1243596113_10" class="yshortcuts">Confucian</span> mourning traditions mix with Christian, shamanistic and Buddhist rites.</p>
              <p>Roh's prime minister, Han Myung-sook, apologized for "not protecting" the late leader.</p>
              <p>"We are sorry, we love you and we were happy with you," said Han, South
              Korea's first female prime minister, her voice trembling with emotion.
              "Please rest in peace."</p>
              <p>At the plaza outside the City Hall that Lee built, performers
              in hemp mourning outfits carried out traditional Confucian rites
              designed to send Roh's spirit to heaven and to comfort his soul. As his
              hearse moved through the crowd, mourners showered it with airplanes and
              cranes made of yellow origami.</p>
              <p>As some screamed "Down with <span id="lw_1243596113_11" class="yshortcuts">Lee Myung-bak</span>," riot police began moving in to break up the crowd before the hearse was able to depart.</p>
              <p>Roh's ashes were to return to his village to be buried with a small gravestone as he wished.</p>
              <p>TV showed the funeral live, as well as footage of Roh in more
              lighthearted moments: serenading his wife with a guitar, feeding
              ducklings and taking his granddaughter for a bike ride.</p>
              <p>South Koreans mourned online, too, with some portals carrying
              live broadcasts of the funeral and users flooding bulletin boards and
              Roh's own Web site with hundreds of thousands of <span id="lw_1243596113_12" class="yshortcuts" style="background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; cursor: pointer;   -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial;">condolence messages</span>.</p>
              <p>"You didn't bow to any other country but you bowed to us citizens.
              You'll always be the father of the nation," wrote one user, Choi
              Jae-chul. "<span id="lw_1243596113_13" class="yshortcuts">Rest in peace</span> and please protect South Korea from heaven."</p>

              <p><strong>Thousands of SKoreans mourn as Roh's ashes buried</strong></p>
              <p class="first">SEOUL (AFP) - - Tens of thousands of South Koreans
              bade their final farewell to former president Roh Moo-Hyun, who leapt
              off a cliff to his death in May while facing corruption allegations.</p>
              <p>A crowd estimated by police at 30,000 gathered as the former liberal
              leader's ashes were buried on a hillside near his retirement home in
              Bongha village close to the southeast coast.</p>
              <p>Live footage showed mourners filling up seats near the burial site and spilling onto nearby hillsides, many of them weeping.</p>
              <p>Roh,
              who held office from 2003 until 2008, took his own life on May 23. His
              dramatic death sparked a huge national outpouring of grief despite low
              popularity ratings towards the end of his term.</p>
              <p>The self-educated
              lawyer and rights activist was credited with easing authoritarianism
              and advancing democracy. He pushed for reconciliation with North Korea
              and held a summit with its leader Kim Jong-Il in 2007.</p>
              <p>Roh also
              campaigned against corruption. But on April 30, in a nationally
              televised spectacle, state prosecutors had questioned him about six
              million dollars which his family members received from a wealthy shoe
              manufacturer.</p>
              <p>Roh never admitted personal wrongdoing but apologised on his family's behalf.</p>
              <p>Supporters
              said Roh, 62, was publicly humiliated by a politically motivated probe
              under the current conservative government despite what they called a
              lack of evidence against him personally. Prosecutors denied political
              motives.</p>
              <p>Roh's ashes had been kept at a Buddhist sanctuary at
              Bongha since his funeral, which attracted an estimated 130,000 people
              to central Seoul. They were buried 49 days after his death in
              accordance with Buddhist custom.</p>
              <p>Sun Jin-Kyu, head of the sanctuary, said Roh fell victim to attacks from the establishment and conservatives.</p>
              <p>"You are a martyr who fought for the underprivileged," he said in a mourning speech.</p>
              <p>Following
              religious rites, relatives and ministers in Roh's government, including
              former prime minister Han Myung-Sook, took turns to lay wreaths before
              his portrait.</p>
              <p>When video footage showing Roh playing a guitar and
              singing an activist's song was played, some sang along before bursting
              into tears.</p>
              <p>Others carried banners mourning Roh's death or flew yellow paper planes, his campaign colour in 2002.</p>
              <p>A
              white celadon pottery urn containing the ashes was placed inside a
              stone coffin before relatives took turns shovelling earth onto it. The
              ceremony ended with a 21-gun salute.</p>
              <p>A small and humble gravestone was set up as Roh requested in a poignant suicide note.</p>
              <p>Separate
              ceremonies were held at major Buddhist temples and churches in Seoul
              and other regions, attended by leading politicians as well as ordinary
              people who could not travel to Roh's home town.</p>
