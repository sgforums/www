              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>They also believe that their credit card information had been compromised.<br><br>At least six customers told Channel NewsAsia that they've been affected.<br><br>One reported unauthorised transactions of up to S$7,000.<br><br>Customers of several banks, including DBS, UOB, Standard Chartered and Citibank, reported similar experiences. <br><br>One of those affected is Ms Ong, who said she had not used her iTunes account for two years.<br><br>But she was shocked when she received her credit card bill for February.<br><br>"When
               I called the credit card company and asked whether there are similar 
              case ongoing, they couldn't quite give me an answer. They actually 
              mentioned that they can terminate my card and issue me a new card. At 
              the same time, they can conduct an investigation but it will take 60 
              days. So, in the meantime I don't really need to make payment for these 
              two unauthorised transactions, but I have to wait till 60 days later for
               the report to be out," said Ms Ong, a customer of Standard Chartered 
              Bank.<br><br>One of the affected banks, UOB, has investigated the 
              unauthorised transactions and has reimbursed the full amount to its 
              customers.<br><br>It reminded customers to check their credit card statements and alert the bank if they find discrepancies in their statements.<br><br>- CNA/ck</span></span></p>

              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Police say anyone who suspects that their iTunes accounts have been hacked can lodge a report via the </span><span class="path">Electronic Police Centre</span><span> or at any Neighbourhood Police Centre or Police Post.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The report should

               Never send money, or give credit card or online account details to 
              anyone you do not know and trust, especially if you have not met him/her
               before. <br><br>- Ensure you know how to stop any subscription service you want to sign up to.<br><br>- Check website addresses carefully. Scammers often set up fake websites with very similar addresses.<br><br>-
               No one should ever release their confidential information, such as 
              account user id, password, PIN, credit card details etc. to anyone over 
              an email.<br><br>- CNA/fa</span></span></p>
