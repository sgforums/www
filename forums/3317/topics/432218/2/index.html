              <p><strong>Staff morale not in the pink of health at some nursing homes</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: As the Ministry of Health gets set to undertake a 
              review of the nursing home system, operators here have another task on 
              their hands: Raising staff morale, in the wake of the patient abuse case
               at Nightingale Nursing Home.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>For instance, 
              Peacehaven Nursing Home executive director Low Mui Lang told MediaCorp 
              the recent episode has inevitably cast a negative light on nursing home 
              staff, with even those who perform well feeling discouraged.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Similarly, Dr 
              Belinda Wee, co-director at private nursing home Good Shepherd Loft, 
              said the welfare of caregivers has often been forgotten and maintaining 
              their well-being could prevent patient abuse. The nursing home holds 
              weekly meetings for staff to voice issues, even as there are constant 
              reminders for them to provide good patient care.<br><br>With the sector 
              under the spotlight, nursing homes are also ensuring that communication 
              channels with family members of patients remain open.<br><br>A 
              spokesperson for Ren Ci Hospital said: "We've actively engaged our 
              patients' families and conducted surveys on a regular basis to obtain 
              feedback on the service quality of our healthcare staff."<br><br>So far,
               operators MediaCorp spoke to have not reported a spike in feedback but 
              Mr Lawrence Ang, voluntary chairman of Ju Eng Home for Senior Citizens, 
              noted that some patients or family members could take this chance to 
              cast aspersions.<br><br>He noted that running at full capacity - which 
              many homes by voluntary welfare organisations are - creates stress for 
              staff as they spread themselves thin. Some patients can also be 
              difficult, especially those who shout vulgarities and even molest 
              nurses, he added.<br><br>Several members of the public have called the MediaCorp News Hotline with claims of poor treatment.<br><br>One
               caller, an administrator who wanted to be known only as Mr Chan and 
              whose grandmother stays in a private nursing home, believes that patient
               abuse is a common occurrence.<br><br>"The recent incident at 
              Nightingale was unfortunate but at least it finally prompted the 
              authorities to do something about it," said the 55-year-old.<br><br>The 
              Ministry of Health receives 12 to 15 complaints and feedback each year, 
              mostly about poor customer service, rude staff or unsatisfactory care.<br><br>Apart
               from the review, other steps have been taken in recent years for the 
              sector and the Government had announced plans to boost manpower and 
              resources, including the building of six new homes by 2013.<br><br>Meanwhile,
               the Agency for Integrated Care said on Monday that it has been 
              partnering service providers to enhance the capabilities of nursing home
               staff and has rolled out a shared procurement programme to help homes 
              improve their efficiency. <br><br>Its spokesperson told MediaCorp that 
              more care options such as home care are being expanded so that patients 
              are admitted to nursing homes only as a last resort. - </span><span class="path">TODAY</span></span></p>
