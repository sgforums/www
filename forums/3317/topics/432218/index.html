              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: The Nightingale Nursing Home along Braddell Road has 
              been suspended with effect from April 12, from admitting new patients, 
              after some of its staff members were found to have mistreated a resident
               there.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The incident came to
               light after Channel NewsAsia alerted the Ministry of Health to a video,
               taken by a hidden camera on a patient's bedside.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The video showed an elderly woman patient sitting next to a bed without any clothes, while the ceiling fans in the room were on.<br><br>After a while, two staff members were shown lifting the patient and throwing her onto a bed. <br><br>In one footage, a staff member was shown slapping the patient after she moaned in pain.<br><br>The old lady has been a resident of the home for the past four years.<br><br>The
               nursing home said it has disciplined the staff involved, and placed 
              additional measures such as getting senior staff to visit the wards and 
              checking the conduct of its staff.<br><br>The measures also include holding regular meetings with patients and their family members.<br><br>In
               its reply to Channel NewsAsia, the Ministry of Health said: "There were
               significant lapses in the care standards provided to the patient in 
              question. <br><br>"This should not have happened. There should have been
               tighter supervision of staff rendering care to vulnerable patients. 
              Patients' dignity and respect must be upheld at all times".<br><br>A family member of the patient said: "Of course we are unhappy with the incident. <br><br>"We sent her there for the nurses to take care of her; we're disappointed with what happened. <br><br>"There are other old folks at the home. We hope by bringing this matter up, it will help to improve things at the home. <br><br>"We have since moved our mother to another nursing home".<br><br>The
               Ministry of Health said it will closely monitor the nursing home to 
              ensure all additional measures required of it are properly implemented 
              and subsequently ascertain if the suspension imposed on the home should 
              be reviewed or further sanctions imposed.<br><br>It said: "Our 
              inspectors regularly check that all nursing homes are properly 
              maintained, keep their patient records in order and institute effective 
              infection control measures. <br><br>"Nursing home operators are also 
              required to maintain care standards on medication administration, fall 
              prevention, housekeeping, etc. <br><br>"Nursing homes that do not meet 
              the required standards or which require closer monitoring for any other 
              reason will be subject to more regular audits. MOH will also guide them 
              on how to improve their performance".<br><br>-CNA/wk</span></span></p>

              <p>TWO years ago, Madam Irene Ong decided to set up closed-circuit 
              television (CCTV) cameras inside the wards of the two nursing homes that
               she runs.</p>
              <p>The reason? She had received complaints from family members of the 
              residents there that her staff had been handling the elderly residents 
              in a rough way.</p>
              <p>Sure enough, video footage showed some handlers mistreating the 
              residents when transferring them from their chairs to their beds.</p>

               Ng, manager of Windsor Convalescent Home, said: "We told them, 'this is
               not the way to treat an old patient'. You just imagine: your own 
              parents, if they are being treated this way....You want yourself to be 
              (treated) in this way in future? There will be a retribution."<br><br>The home has put in place several measures to help staff nurses perform their job.<br><br>The
               centre manager is on standby 24 hours should any such incident occur. 
              New nurses are also put through a mentorship programme.<br><br>The 
              nursing home has 50 patients aged between 50 and 90 years. It has 14 
              staff nurses, all of them foreign workers coming from the Philippines 
              and Sri Lanka. <br><br>The job there is stressful, so it's important that staff nurses' well-being is taken care of.<br><br>Ms
               Maggie Ng said: "Usually, we will check with them (to see)whether they 
              are ok. (We tell them that if they have) any problems, just come and see
               us. Don't let go of your frustrations on patients."<br><br>Louanne 
              Rhomei, a nurse at Windsor Convalescent Home, said: "Even if we are very
               stressful at work, we just manage our anger. We are not angry with them
               (residents). We just tell them (nicely) even if they (say) bad words."<br><br>At
               the ECON nursing homes, regular checks are in place to ensure the 
              well-being of patients. These include daily checks by the centre manager
               and staff nurses. Measures are also in place so that residents can 
              provide constructive criticisms and feedback.<br><br>- CNA/ir</span></span></p>

              <p>I blew my top when I saw that video on the news. I want to know what sort of disciplinary action was taken on the Nightingale's Home staff and business owners. Disciplinaries action such as not allowing new patients intake is deem insufficent and too lienent an act. </p>
              <p>MOH should take over the operation of the home and revoke the licences of the home's operators. And if revoked of licence is deemed too harsh, at least MOH should put in managers to clean up the act (at the business operator expenses) and to conduct more checks until the operators are deemed to be able to manage again. The business operator should also be fined heavily for their neligence.</p>
              <p>The caretakers (presumbly foreigners from the video taken) should be punished before being sacked from the service.</p>

              <h1 class="headline">Elderly woman had been complaining of abuse for 3 years</h1>
              <p>The man who had secretly recorded his mother's abuse at Nightingale Nursing Home revealed that he did so in response to her complaints about their treatment.</p>
              <p>The 41-year-old, who identified himself as Mr Zhuo, told <em>Shin Min Daily </em>that
               of the four years his mother, Madam Bai, had stayed at the home, she 
              had been complaining to him for about three years. This triggered his 
              decision to place a <span id="lw_1307769907_8" class="yshortcuts">hidden video camera</span> disguised as a clock by his mother's bed at the home.</p>
              <p>The resulting footage obtained was recorded in March and handed to MediaCorp Channel 8, before it was sent to the Ministry of Health (MOH) on 22 March.</p>
              <p>Describing the recording, Zhuo said, "I saw that two nurses were helping my mother take a <span id="lw_1307769907_7" class="yshortcuts">bath</span>.
               They took off my mother's clothes and left her sitting in a chair for 
              half an hour. In this time, a fan was blowing in her direction."</p>
              <p>He added that from his observation, the nurses did not help Madam Bai put her clothes back on after her bath.</p>
              <p>"Now I know why my mother is always saying she is cold in the mornings," he said.</p>
              <p>However, more abuse cases have since been revealed.</p>
              <p>At the Irene Nursing home and Serene Nursing Home, owner Irene Ong told <em><span id="lw_1307769907_1" class="yshortcuts">The New Paper</span></em> that she fired three foreign nursing staff from her centres over the past two years over incidents of abuse.</p>
              <p>Ong said that she was informed by other employees that the staff 
              members in question had been hitting the patients under their care in 
              separate cases.</p>
              <p>Having installed a closed-circuit television (CCTV) camera system to monitor her staff and patients in both her <span id="lw_1307769907_2" class="yshortcuts">nursing homes</span>, Ong was able to check the recorded footage for evidence to confirm the reports.</p>
              <p>She also said that she had reported one of the incidents to the authorities, but decided to take matters into her own hands.</p>
              <p>"We really pity the patients," she said. "It is just not right to physically abuse them."</p>
              <p>At the same time, she and other <span id="lw_1307769907_5" class="yshortcuts">nursing home</span> caretakers also shared that the challenge of looking after the elderly 
              is significant, and can at times be frustrating for foreign staff who 
              are usually not able to understand dialects, often the only languages 
              spoken by elderly patients.</p>
              <p>Ong, for example, told the same paper<em></em> that she hires staff from <span id="lw_1307769907_9" class="yshortcuts">Myanmar</span> and the Philippines because she is unable to find any Singaporeans to take up the job.</p>
              <p>Moreover, patients with dementia add a new dimension of difficulty for staff administering to them.</p>
              <p><span id="lw_1307769907_0" class="yshortcuts">Nurse manager</span> Jacqueline Voon, 40, from privately-run Paean Nursing Home, emphasised the need for particular patience when dealing with patients who have dementia.</p>
              <p>"The difficulty is that they make a lot of noise and disturb (other 
              patients)," she said. "If it gets out of hand, then we will refer (the 
              patient) to the doctor to increase the dosage of their medication."</p>
              <p>She also said that Paean takes <span id="lw_1307769907_3" class="yshortcuts">preventive measures</span> to handle abusive patients, such as ensuring that they do not have access to sharp objects.</p>
              <p>Windsor Convalescent Home manager Maggie Ng, 55, <em></em>added
               that her home has seen many cases of patients who punch and use their 
              walking sticks to beat staff. Her employees often have no protection 
              against such incidents as the patients often attack without warning.</p>
              <p>Other elderly healthcare practitioners say that nursing staff need to
               be properly trained to deal with elderly patients, especially those 
              with mental health issues.</p>
              <p>Ng Wai Chong, 42, assistant director at the Tsao Foundation's Hua Mei Mobile Clinic,
               said, "Perhaps we need to take another look at our strategy in the long
               run for community care so that families don't have to send as many 
              people to <span id="lw_1307769907_6" class="yshortcuts">nursing homes</span>."</p>
              <p>The MOH said it conducts regular inspections of all nursing homes to 
              ensure compliance with its mandatory licensing requirements.</p>
              <p>Its inspectors check that the homes are properly maintained, keep their patient records in order and have effective <span id="lw_1307769907_4" class="yshortcuts">infection control measures</span> in place, among other factors.</p>
              <p>Home operators are also pitted against care standards on medication administration, fall rates and housekeeping.</p>
              <p>The ministry subjects homes that do not meet these standards to more 
              regular audits, and provides guidance to them to improve their 
              performance.</p>
              <p>For reports of breach in care delivery or standards, the public can call the MOH hotline at 1800-225 4122.</p>

              <p><strong>MOH to undertake holistic review of nursing homes</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: The Health Ministry will undertake a holistic review 
              of the various systems and processes currently in place at nursing 
              homes, said Health Minister Gan Kim Yong.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>This is to see if 
              there is room for improvement and to prevent a recurrence of the recent 
              abuse of a patient at the Nightingale Nursing Home.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Mr Gan was speaking to reporters after attending a dengue exhibition on Saturday.<br><br>A
               video, which showed Nightingale Nursing Home staff flinging a elderly 
              woman onto a bed and slapping her on the mouth to keep her quiet, 
              sparked an uproar among many Singaporeans, who expressed shock at the 
              treatment of the patient at the nursing home.<br><br>The ministry said it takes a serious view of such incidents and will review the governance of nursing homes.<br><br>Mr
               Gan said: "From the MOH point of view, it's important for us to learn 
              from this incident and that's why we'll take a holistic review on the 
              various measures that we've put in place to see whether we can improve 
              on the system, the surveillance or monitoring system, as well as how we 
              can work closer with the nursing homes to advise them, to help them to 
              put in place necessary measures to ensure that such incidents don't 
              happen in the future."<br><br>Mr Gan was also sorry about what had happened.<br><br>He
               said: "I like to apologise to the family who have seen their mother 
              subjected to the treatment at Nightingale Nursing Home. Such lapses are 
              of grave concern to us."<br><br>And that is why the ministry suspended the nursing home since April, even as investigations were ongoing, said Mr Gan.<br><br>Mr
               Gan said that the "nursing home is now under surveillance and 
              monitoring by the ministry" and that the ministry will "watch how the 
              nursing home progresses from this point onwards." The ministry will also
               step up surveillance on the nursing home for a period of time.<br><br>With regard to the two staff members involved, he said one has left the nursing home, while the other was given a warning.<br><br>Mr
               Gan said the incident has been a learning lesson for his ministry, but 
              assured Singaporeans that most nursing homes are safe with many measures
               to ensure proper care of patients.<br><br>The ministry is also grateful
               to MediaCorp for highlighting the situation, which allowed a full and 
              proper investigation to be carried out.<br><br>-CNA/ac</span></span></p>
