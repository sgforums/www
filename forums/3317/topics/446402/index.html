              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>He committed the act
               onboard SBS bus service number 30, which was travelling along West 
              Coast Road towards Ayer Rajah Expressway.<br> <br>Ms Ng, who was 21 at 
              the time of the incident, said on Tuesday that she had fallen asleep but
               was woken up by "some poking sensation" near her right breast.<br> <br>She said no one was beside her on the seat but she noticed a man sitting behind her.<br> <br>Thinking
               it might have been her bag that had caused the pressure, Ms Ng adjusted
               the bag away from her body and continued with her nap.<br><br>A few minutes later, the court heard, she was awoken by the same poking sensation. <br><br>To
               confirm her suspicions that the man was the culprit, Ms Ng pretended to
               fall asleep again. Less than a minute later, she saw a hand coming from
               behind, through the gap between the window and the seat. <br><br>She suddenly sat up straight and the hand was withdrawn immediately.<br> <br>Ms
               Ng said as Kwan was the only person sitting directly behind her, she 
              decided to follow the bespectacled man until he reached his home.<br><br>She
               went into the lift of the block where he stayed and waited for him to 
              press the button for the 10th floor before she pressed on the 11th.<br><br>Kwan
               exited the lift when it arrived at the 10th floor, but Ms Ng kept the 
              lift door open until she heard the sound of keys. She then stepped out 
              of the lift and saw him entering a unit.<br><br>In the meantime, Ms Ng's boyfriend arrived at the scene and called the police.<br> <br>Deputy
               Public Prosecutor Agnes Chan noted that Kwan showed no remorse for his 
              actions, as he had attempted to repeat the act a third time.<br><br>In 
              sentencing Kwan, District Judge (Mrs) Lee Poh Choo agreed with the 
              prosecutor that a signal should be sent to those who prey on young women
               as thousands of them use public transport daily.<br><br>- CNA/al</span></span></p>
