              <p>the future was right after all about singapore then!no matter how u want it to go for the better it will still go in the way it was destined to no matter how hard u tried.</p>

              <p><br>nope. see Aljunied. if low don't take a chance don;t go for it then yesterday hisotry willnever be made. the things i see going wrong with hippos is that they need even better and more qualified candidiates. speeches given during rallies is imporant, how the candidates speak and rpesent themselves. charisma also play a role. the policies the candidates bring out, yest bashing PAP but ata limit. policies include those for their constituency and those at national level.</p>
              <p>nope sometimes its the timing also. when the time is right and we have all the right elements in place, cases like Aljunied wins for the hippos will always happen.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Elite Gundam, i disagree with your giving up. we have to ensourage qualified hippos who really want a change for spore to come forward. the wins of PAP votes are coming down. once hippos slowly gain the experiencs, and some have the chance to work on representaing spore to work at national issues, work with communicating with other countries' official and slowly build up singapores stability alongside the PAP, then a changing of the guard overnithgt is not impossible.</p>

              <p>Is TS very å§”å±ˆ when screw by an cheer staff ? They have not heard my story yet. Once when I was queueing to buy porridge in an coffee shop in Jurong East, I had already paid an porridge auntie and as she received the payment, she closed her eye and later when the porridge are ready, she asked me to pay again and when I claimed that I already pay, she says the payment was made by an older man queue in front of me and the payment she received are based on "his" porridge</p>
              <p>In fact I suspected that that elder man in front either did not pay for his porridge in the first place or he already pay and act like an <span id="result_box" class="short_text" lang="zh-CN"><span title="Click for alternate translations">"æœ¨</span><span title="Click for alternate translations">å¤´" for the whole thing (If that uncle guy in front really did not settle his payment, he is an jerk to be happy that an "xiao char bor"</span></span><span id="result_box" class="short_text" lang="zh-CN"><span title="Click for alternate translations"> provide free lunch for him )</span></span></p>
              <p>Anyway I continue to claim politely that I had already pay for the porridge and this time that xiao char bor porridge auntie turn into an "Ah Lian" and insisted the payment was made by the uncle in front. As I am running late for work if this going on and in the end I "give in" and pay double for her.</p>
              <p>What really made my blood boiled is the nasi lemak stall next door which is run by another "Singaporean" auntie saw the whole incident and know that I am innocent, and instead of helping an fellow Singaporean, she just commented on me "that guy is really stupid" (mind you she is our fellow singaporean, not alien, PR or foreigner.) and when that Xiao Char Bor Porridge auntie heard that she reply back "No you are all wrong, it is the uncle in front that made the payment".</p>
              <p>The moral of this story : YOU PEOPLE SUCK and didn't came here beg for sympathy for any wrongdoing happen to you here since your choose to mind your own business and blame every misfortune happen to you are foreigner 's fault which is usually not the case.If your cannot endure, just be an good "Gu Niang" and stay at home</p>
