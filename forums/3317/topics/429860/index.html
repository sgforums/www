              <p>A STOMPer says this Cheers employee, a Chinese national, made a nasty 
              comment about Singaporeans after a minor misunderstanding. The STOMPer 
              had left exact change for her drink on the counter and was about to 
              leave, only to be scolded by the woman.<br><br>The STOMPer related the incident:<br><br>"I
               find it unacceptable for us in Singapore to tolerate such rude 
              behaviour as it would only tarnish the good image of Singapore. <br><br>"It all happened at the Cheers outlet near the Istana, Dhoby Ghaut. <br><br>"I
               was getting a drink and this China national cashier ignored my presence
               just because I queued towards the side, so she went on to serve three 
              others behind me. <br><br>"After the three left I kept my cool and 
              placed the exact change on the counter. She took my drink so thinking 
              she'd already keyed it in, I took the drink and left. <br><br>"The cashier shouted at me loudly in Chinese: 'people in this country are brainless, just grab things and leave'. <br><br>"There was 2 other customers who heard this and smiled at me. I was utterly embarrassed! <br><br>"The shouting and harsh words were very uncalled for! <br><br>"Can Cheers please discipline your cashiers? As a customer, I was made to feel really embarrassed, and it ruined my day!"</p>

              <p>Call me silly, but as a guest in our country shouldn't these people at least show some graciousness or perhaps even a little respect?</p>
              <p>I asked that question once of a foreign talent, and I was told right in my face "Respect must be earned, and you guys don't deserve any"</p>
              <p>The PAP has rolled out the red carpet to these FT and put them on a pedestal, and now they feel that they have the right to talk to Singaporeans that way as 2nd class people in their own country.</p>
              <p>I have worked overseas before, and I would never have dared or thought to say anything like that to anyone in my host country.</p>
              <p>This is the state of play right now, after many years of our foreign talent policy.  And now we have to deal with it.</p>

              <p>I myself,as a student at 23years old who have not step out to the workforce,have not come across all the nasty things that  the so called "FT" that they have embraced.Just by reading things like these online,all these so called FT behaving so un culturedly no manners whatever nonsensical they would be involved,plus the chinese hawkers who attacked our own over something minor..Reading about ppl get their jobs displaced because of CHEAP FT,being sidelined at workplace,having HR manager who is a FT who only recruits ppl from his own motherland,our MOE going to chinese villages getting those kids with full scholarship for them to study here,fill up our local uni places,and some of them ran away after completing the degree..</p>
              <p>SO MANY MORE..I thought ENOUGH IS ENOUGH,not to say the other high profile errors that our billion dollar team have amassed the past 5yrs.</p>
              <p>reading all these makes me blood boil already,i can't imagine those true blue singaporeans who have been at the end of all these things.I really feel for them.While i am ending my studies soon and stepping into the workforce,i really ponder,wonder and can't help but to be doubtful of my future.</p>
              <p>Really need more opposition MPs to challenge them, and give them a run of their MILLION DOLLAR SALARIES.I hope they REALLY WAKE up and not talk only-NATO.Because at the end of the day they will still form the next govt and all we could do nothing if there they still hold 2/3 of the majority in parliament</p>

              <p>nation building and defence of singapore is the responsibility of everyone.it cant be lumped to any organisation.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>yeh lor. but although we see quite a number of oppositions we still need more bigger pool of higher calibre hippos next eelction to make even more breakthough. i do not see potong pasir as a failure. Chiam's health has not been good. someone to take over his role there has to be done. looking ba the results sitoh won only by marginal. even with lina's standing up at PP he still in marginal so the spirit of PP behind Chiam is still very alive even when he is not there. Then NSP's nicole seah at Marine parade lost with flying results, an A grading i will give to a new comer opposition.</p></div>

              <p><br>yes may be true. but i think the hippos are learning and if they want to win they know they have to field even better candidates, fight bravely but wisely is not perceived as cowardly. while some of the hippos health deteriotes. abolishing GRC so that all can high 1 : 1.</p>
