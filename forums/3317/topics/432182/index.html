              <p>Sugarland's emotional performance of "Stand Up," featured the Gilbert family from <span class="xn-location">Joplin, MO</span>, who lost their home in the recent tornadoes and served as a call to action to encourage viewers to give to the American Red Cross (<a href="http://www.redcross.org/"><span style="color: #6099e9;">www.redcross.org</span></a>) in support of continued disaster relief.  Keith Urban rocked his single, "Long Hot Summer," while Lady Antebellum performed their newest hit, "Just a Kiss" and then segued into the Prince classic, "Kiss."  Jason Aldean was then joined onstage by special guest Ludacris, who performed Jason's hit, "Dirt Road Anthem," which included lyrics especially written for this performance, and which will also be available for download on iTunes at midnight.   Finally, Aldean added a bonus track, closing the show with the ultimate country party song, "My Kinda Party."</p>
