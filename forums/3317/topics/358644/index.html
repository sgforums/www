              <p class="first">KUALA LUMPUR (AFP) - - A small Malaysian restaurant is
              once again proudly trading as "McCurry", after its unlikely victory in
              an eight-year legal battle with US fast food giant McDonald's.</p>
              <p>With its trays of fragrant tandoori chicken and fish masala, and
              customers at formica tables cooled by fans turning lazily overhead, the
              business is difficult to confuse with McDonald's and its racks of
              burgers.</p>
              <p>"You can't have fries with that but we do have a very good potato curry," owner AMSP. Suppiah, 55, says with a laugh.</p>
              <p>But
              Suppiah and his wife Kanageswary spent eight years battling in the
              courts for the right to retain the name of the business, pursued by
              McDonald's lawyers who forced them to operate as "M Curry" for several
              years.</p>
              <p>"We were surprised that a giant like McDonald's would want
              to take action against us even though there was nothing in common
              between us and them," Suppiah said.</p>
              <p>"We decided to appeal because
              we felt we were right and the court of appeal agreed with us this
              week," he said after a Malaysian court ruled the business had not
              infringed on the McDonald's trademark by using the prefix "Mc".</p>
              <p>To
              the delight of the local press which has covered the landmark case
              closely, Suppiah then took a tall ladder to climb to the brightly
              coloured signboard and reinstate the controversial "c".</p>
              <p>Tucking
              into a breakfast of "dosai" or Indian pancakes, Suppiah says he never
              expected to win the battle against the international food giant.</p>
              <p>"There
              were times when we almost gave up hope because who would have imagined
              that we could win against such a big company with so much money and
              resources at their disposal," he said.</p>
              <p>The mom and pop operation
              is one of numerous simple restaurants serving up Indian fare in this
              multicultural country, which is dominated by Muslim Malays but also
              home to ethnic Indian and Chinese communities.</p>
              <p>Suppiah, a former
              accountant, says his troubles began when he set up the restaurant in
              1999, shortening the name Malaysian Chicken Curry Restaurant to the
              McCurry restaurant.</p>
              <p>"But within a year, I began receiving letters from McDonald's urging me to change the name and threatening legal action."</p>
              <p>Unable to resolve the impasse, McDonald's sued Suppiah and a
              Malaysian High Court agreed with the hamburger chain in 2006, forcing
              Suppiah to remove the prefix from his signs and business.</p>
              <p>Kanageswary says she is thrilled with the legal U-turn, but adds the victory has come at a cost.</p>
              <p>"We
              faced a lot of mental anguish and embarrassment over the issue and for
              eight years our business has been in limbo because no one wants to
              invest in a company facing litigation and so we have not been able to
              make any improvements to the restaurant," she said.</p>
              <p>"Hopefully, we can move on now."</p>
              <p>However, the Suppiahs' lawyer Sri Dev Nair thinks McDonald's will not give up so easily.</p>
              <p>"The
              case has shown that McDonald's want to control the monopoly over the
              use of the prefix 'Mc' and it has a lot of money to be able to do this
              so many small restaurants just give in to them," he said.</p>
              <p>"We expect them to challenge the ruling and we will be prepared to face them in court."</p>
              <p>The US corporation can apply to have the case reviewed in the Federal Court, which is the court of last resort on the matter.</p>
              <p>Suppiah says he does not hold any grudges.</p>
              <p>"My
              children like eating at McDonald's so I will continue going there and I
              would like to invite the president of McDonald's worldwide to come here
              to McCurry's and have a dosai, on the house -- but we can't supersize
              it."</p>
