              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: A new study has shown that about a third of Singaporeans are "cynics" who do not trust politicians.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The survey, conducted by the Institute of Policy Studies, covered nearly 1,100 Singaporeans, aged 21 and above.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>It was carried out in July and August last year, around nine months before the May general election.<br><br>Compared
               to other liberal democracies like the US, which sees a higher 
              percentage of cynics (47%-73%), researchers say the 30 per cent figure 
              for Singapore is not huge.<br><br>Still they say the ruling People's Action Party should be "worried".<br><br>The
               study's definition of cynics include people who think they are often 
              manipulated by politicians; politicians forgetting their election 
              promises; and politicians who think having power is more important than 
              catering to the people's wishes.<br><br>In other words, cynics are unhappy with the person, rather than the system.<br><br>However, the study did not differentiate whether the politician is from the ruling or opposition parties.<br><br>Arun
               Mahizhnan, deputy director of the Institute of Policy Studies, said: 
              "Certainly in the recent past, in Singapore, there is some disaffection 
              with the delivery of public goods. You heard about the transportation 
              problems, the housing problems, even things like the flood. <br><br>"So 
              to what extent are these permanent features? To what extent are these 
              immediate reactions? This is yet to be determined. But this survey 
              suggests that there is a significant minority who are cynical and there 
              are ways in which the cynicism could be addressed."<br><br>The study 
              also found that there is no significant relation between a cynic, how 
              much he earns, his education and age. It said the difference is not a 
              socio-economic one but a political one. That means cynics in Singapore 
              cut across the entire cross-section of the community.<br><br>Unlike 
              other countries, cynics in Singapore are also not influenced by 
              mainstream media. Rather, about 13 per cent get their news from 
              alternative new media sites like The Online Citizen and 
              Yawningbread.org.<br><br>They are mostly young and educated.<br><br>So 
              experts say policy makers should exploit the Internet and new media in 
              their engagement efforts, on top of deepening relations - both online 
              and offline.<br><br>Dr Zhang Weiyu, National University of Singapore's 
              assistant professor of communications &amp; new media, said: "Since 
              these people tend to use online channels and interpersonal channels to 
              discuss politics, we should take advantage of these two channels to 
              reach out to this group of people. <br><br>"They probably also go to 
              mass media but they don't do that as often as people who are less 
              cynical and we find that they have lower trust in these mass media 
              compared to people who are less cynical. <br><br>"So the government or 
              the policy makers should take advantage of the Internet and other 
              interpersonal interactions to influence these people - interpersonal 
              like Meet-The-People sessions and also I suggest that we can conduct 
              more consultational panels with normal citizens. <br><br>"We need to 
              encourage interpersonal discussions directly between politicians and 
              citizens. So it's not just politicians trying to send their message 
              through mass media to the citizens because we find that interpersonal 
              talk has a big influence."<br><br>The study also showed that mainstream 
              media complement alternative new media sites. For example, 72.2 per cent
               turn to television for news, while 71.6 per cent read the newspapers 
              for their main source of information.<br><br>Another group that need to 
              be engaged further are those who claim they do not consume any news, be 
              it through traditional or alternative media sources. They constitute 
              about 14 per cent of respondents.<br><br>- CNA/al</span></span></p>

              <p><strong>Important to keep political cynics a minority: PAP MPs</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Three out of 10 Singaporeans are political cynics and
               MPs from the People's Action Party said it is important to keep this 
              number low.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>They believe it is difficult to act in the best interest of the country if people doubt their credibility and trustworthiness.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>They were responding to a study by the Institute of Policy Studies (IPS) which measured political cynicism among Singaporeans.<br><br>The
               result did not come as a surprise to many as this level of political 
              cynicism was evident during the watershed General Election in May and a 
              keenly fought Presidential Election.<br><br>In the IPS study, 
              respondents were asked whether politicians quickly forget their election
               promises after a campaign, whether having power is more important to 
              politicians than catering to people's wishes, and whether people are 
              often manipulated by them.<br><br>While the IPS study did not 
              differentiate between politicians from the ruling or opposition parties,
               it is believed this cynicism is targeted, to a greater degree, at the 
              ruling party.<br><br>But some PAP MPs are undaunted.<br><br>Member of 
              Parliament for Sembawang GRC, Mr Vikram Nair, said: "There's certainly 
              more criticism levelled at the PAP than the opposition. Part of it is 
              the fact that we've been in government for so long. <br><br>"But right 
              now, the opposition is controlling one GRC and one SMC, so they are also
               responsible for more things. I guess the more things you're responsible
               for, the more they too will find themselves probably getting 
              criticised."<br><br>Mr Baey Yam Keng, Member of Parliament for Tampines 
              GRC, said: "I think it shows people are discerning. They do have a view 
              so they will not trust everything they hear or see. <br><br>"I think 
              it's good compared to other developed economies. It's lower than US or 
              Netherlands. It's a reflection of how Singapore population is more 
              educated and more informed. Personally, it's not necessarily a bad 
              sign."<br><br>In the US, a similar study found 47 per cent to 73 per cent of the people were 'cynical'. <br><br>Mr Baey said that Singapore's level of cynicism is not alarming, and that each society needs to be looked at on its own.<br><br>He added that Singapore has to find its equilibrium, where people, government, ruling party and opposition parties can co-exist.<br><br>But the MPs qualify that cynicism does need to be kept in check.<br><br>Mr
               Nair said: "Cynicism is also infectious. If someone is cynical, it's 
              possible especially if they write a lot about it. They could get other 
              people to be cynical so that the number may grow. That is a danger we 
              face. <br><br>"But it's always easier to criticise than to address every
               criticism levelled against you. So there's a limit to how much we will 
              be able to do to counter that."<br><br>Singapore Management University's
               Assistant Professor Eugene Tan said: "It's important that we keep the 
              number of cynical Singaporeans to the political process to a minimum, 
              simply because we're at the stage of our political development where 
              it's important for every Singaporean to be engaged. <br><br>"There are 
              severe challenges, and if talk about active citizenry, that cannot take 
              place if you have a citizen who is cynical about the political actors."<br><br>The
               IPS study implies that policymakers should exploit the Internet and the
               new media in their engagement efforts. In addition, the study suggests 
              politicians hold interpersonal discussions to reach out and convert the 
              cynics.<br><br>Mr Nair said: "For myself, I never run away from critics.
               I'm actually quite happy to get involved in debates. Quite often, I'm 
              also seeing people writing very long acrimonious e-mails, sometimes 
              anonymously to my inbox. <br><br>"But the trouble is if you write 
              detailed responses to every one of them, you really won't have the time 
              to do your other work. So I think there probably needs to be some 
              balance."<br><br>Mr Nair agrees and believes that more should be done to educate Singaporeans about the work that politicians do.<br><br>Channel NewsAsia also approached opposition MPs on this issue but they declined to comment.<br><br>- CNA/fa</span></span></p>

              <p>Any one understands how can there be no significant relation with "education" and "age" but the cynics can be mostly young and educated? Unless the article is referring to the population make up in general which is basically not saying anything.</p>
              <p>Anyway, 30% is actually quite low. If anything it seems to point at a more ignorant and guilible society in Singapore.</p>
