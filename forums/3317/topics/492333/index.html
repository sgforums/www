              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Png Eng Huat 'stirring hate and anger' with Facebook post: Tan Chuan-Jin</span></strong></p>
              <div>
              <div>SINGAPORE: Minister for Social and Family Development Tan Chuan Jin said on Tuesday (Jul 19) that Hougang Member of Parliament Png Eng Huat was "stirring hate and anger" in a Facebook post about how Mr Tan and his entourage were given expedited clearance at the immigration checkpoint at Tuas.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>On Sunday, Mr Tan and a group of residents and volunteers returning from a durian trip to Johor Bahru were able to skip the immigration queue. In a Facebook post on Monday, Mr Png wrote that he too, had been at the checkpoint with his residents after a trip to Desaru, and that they were among other travellers at who had had "to wait patiently for hours for their turn". Mr Png added that one of his residents was 89 years old and another had been injured during the tour. </div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>The opposition Workers' Party MP wrote: "If these two elderly residents can wait in queue patiently for their turn, so can all my volunteers and grassroots members."</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>In response, Mr Tan wrote on Facebook on Tuesday: "It was not about the old folks," he wrote. "It was aimed at stirring hate and anger, not only to be directed at me, which I can understand politically, but also at my residents and volunteers (who organised as well as helped guide each bus), as well as our officers who secure our borders. It's unfortunate that (Mr Png) and his colleagues chose to politicise the issue."</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Mr Tan stated that he had been on an official visit to the Malaysian Deputy Home Affairs Minister's Hari Raya open house but that he travelled by bus so that he could be with his residents and volunteers during the trip. He added that on their return journey, the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) facilitated the clearance for him and his security officers who were carrying their firearms, as well as the residents and volunteers on his bus.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>In a statement earlier on Tuesday, the ICA clarified that it is normal practice for ministers on both sides of the Causeway, as well as members of the Malaysian royalty, to be given expedited clearance at the land checkpoints.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>In his post on Monday, Mr Png also commented that "most people in the queue probably did not mind" that Mr Tan was given expedited clearance, but took issue with his "entourage of grassroots leaders and members with shopping bags in tow" who were also given fast clearance.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Mr Tan responded: "If he accepts that it's reasonable that our office holders get facilitated, then surely the others in that bus need to be cleared as well so that the bus can leave and not add to the vehicular queues there."</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>In its statement, ICA also revealed that Mr Png was cleared through immigration in about half an hour.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Mr Tan wrote: "I had the impression Mr Png waited a very long time. ICA checked their cameras to ascertain the waiting time. He carefully omits to mention that he waited for all of 30 mins. I actually bumped into (MP for Nee Soon GRC) Louis Ng too. He and his delegation were also in the queue for about half an hour or so." </div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>On the elderly residents who needed help, the Social and Family Development Minister added: "And oh, by the way, any traveller who requires special assistance can approach our ICA officers on duty. I believe it is more effective and real to assist our fellow Singaporeans in this way."</div>
