              <p><strong>NMP hopeful Beatrice Chia flattered to be considered 'dangerous'</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: She says she is flattered to be considered "more
              dangerous than Siew Kum Hong", after submitting her application for the
              post of a Nominated Member of Parliament (NMP).
              <br> <br>And theatre practitioner Beatrice Chia-Richmond has "absolutely no
              issue with netizens voicing their opinions, approvals or disapprovals",
              even after reading the scorching comments on the government's REACH
              website on Thursday night.
              <br> <br>TODAY had reported about the deluge of comments to REACH's thread
              on NMP candidates, and on Thursday night, the number of posts and page
              views tripled from a day earlier, with 337 comments and 5,661 hits as
              of 10.45pm.
              <br> <br>While some accused NMP hopefuls Chia-Richmond and theatre director
              Loretta Chen, as well as incumbent Siew of having a "personal agenda",
              others defended Mr Siew's record in Parliament.
              <br> <br>Ms Chia-Richmond said she welcomed the netizens' feedback, although
              many of her friends were mortified by some of the scathing remarks.
              <br> <br>"I would say that it might be too early to presume the issues I
              would be voicing should I have the opportunity to be in Parliament,"
              she said. <br> <br> Her body of work has dealt with themes of discrimination, and the "gay
              theme has been featured often as it is an issue", she said, adding: "As
              a citizen of Singapore, a working artist, a wife and a young mother, I
              believe I have many other concerns besides LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual
              and transgender) issues."
              <br> <br> Some netizens like Chan Chow Phang believe the NMP nomination should not be determined by a single issue.
              <br> <br>Another, Mr Bryan Tan, pointed out that then-First Deputy Prime
              Minister Goh Chok Tong had said in 1989 that the NMP scheme was
              implemented to evolve a "consensual style of government where
              alternative views are heard and constructive dissent accommodated".
              <br> <br>Mr Siew said he was heartened and comforted by those who had spoken
              in his favour. But many of those who oppose his re-nomination have
              "mischaracterised my position", and "there are a number of baseless
              accusations and misrepresentations there".
              <br> <br>Ms Chen said she was "bemused by the comments", adding that as a
              "working-class artist" - her father was a clerk, mother a homemaker,
              and her brothers had to quit school early to work - she was capable of
              handling and raising issues for the arts, youth, elderly and
              disenfranchised.
              <br> <br> "If you truly want an open harmonious society, you must allow for diversity," she added.
              <br> <br>A REACH portal spokeswoman told TODAY that "the interest and
              discussion show that Singaporeans are not an apathetic lot and they
              will come forward to give views and feedback to REACH when they feel
              strongly about an issue, and we are heartened".
              <br> <br>"As with every issue, there will always be diverse views, so it's
              not surprising to see different views being expressed on this issue,
              whether mature or less so," she said, adding that Parliament's NMP
              Select Committee will make an independent decision based on a set of
              evaluation criteria.
