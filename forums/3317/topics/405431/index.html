              <p>A former senior advisor to Bill Clinton says the only thing which can rescue Barack Obama's presidency as his approval figures continue 
                        to plunge is a terror attack on the scale of Oklahoma City or 9/11, 
                        another startling reminder that such events only serve to benefit 
                        those in authority.</p>
              <p>Robert Shapiro (a jew) makes it clear 
                        that Obama is relying on an October surprise in the form of a terror 
                        attack to rescue his presidency.</p>
              <p>“The bottom line here is that 
                        Americans don’t believe in President Obama’s leadership,” 
                        said Shapiro, adding, “He has to find some way between now and 
                        November of demonstrating that he is a leader who can command confidence 
                        and, short of a 9/11 event or an Oklahoma City bombing, I can’t 
                        think of how he could do that.”</p>
              <p>Shapiro is a prominent globalist who has attended numerous 
                        Bilderberg Group meetings over the past decade.</p>

              <p>Hmm... they are just coincidental lah.  9/11 is outsider work.  There are some evidences that seem to indicate usa government knows the situation before the planes crash on these buildings. They just make the buildings burst into flames more awesome, so they have more muha say against terrorist.  Which is to use terrorist attack (that they can't already avoid becos the plane will crash) to their best advantage.</p>
              <p>Shapiro is saying nonsenical thing lah... It is a bigger mess to Obama to clear up to use terrorist attacks.  More likely he is saying this to gain ppl attention to muslim terrorism against jew...or watever...to get usa to more support Israel.. Don't believe damn politic ppl on crazy babblings..</p>
