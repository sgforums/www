              <p>A Johor state assemblyman says about 3,000 Malaysians board buses to Singapore daily to gamble away S$3 million at the integrated resorts (IRs).</p>
              <p>According to a <em>Utusan  Malaysia</em> report, Datuk Tee Siew Kiong, who is a  central committee member of the
               Malaysian Chinese  Association (MCA), a  key party in the ruling 
              Barisan Nasional  coalition, asked the federal government to take  
              measures to control the flow of these Malaysians to the IRs.</p>
              <p>Mr Tee, who is the assemblyman for Pulai Sebatang Pontian, said, 
              “They spend a minimum of S$1,000, which is equivalent to S$2.9 million a
                day, or S$83 million a month, for the purpose of gambling.”</p>
              <p>Malaysian politicians are also concerned by the number of locals travelling to Singapore to gamble.</p>
              <p>The same paper added that Mr Tee was the first to state the number of
               Malaysian visitors  daily and how much they spent, but did not say how 
              he arrived at  those figures.</p>
              <p>MCA Youth chief Datuk Wee Ka Siong recently expressed concern over 
              the hike in the number of ‘free tours’ taking Malaysians to the  
              casinos. He said he initially thought that such tours  were organised 
              only from Johor, but revealed that they are  also available from Penang.</p>
              <p>Mr Tee added that from the information he received, 30 buses make the
                daily round trip, with seven of those being buses from Singapore, the 
              report said.</p>
              <p>“This can raise social problems and destroy the family  institution 
              as there are local tourists who gamble until they have to  borrow from 
              ah long (loan sharks),” he said.</p>
              <p><em>Utusan</em> reported Mr Tee claiming that there were Malaysians 
              working in Singapore who spend  their entire salaries at the IRs, and 
              that there had been instances  where life savings were drawn out and 
              properties sold to feed the gaming  habit.</p>
              <p>He suggested to the federal government to stop tourism  agencies and 
              buses from taking Malaysians to the casinos. “We do not  want this thing
               to continue because it has more negative effects than  positive ones,” 
              Mr Tee told the paper.</p>
              <p>Some people Yahoo! Singapore spoke to were not surprised by the number of Malaysians visiting the IRs.</p>
              <p>“I guess for those staying further south and close to Singapore would
               want to come here to gamble as it’s more convenient,” said salesman Jay
               Chan, 32.</p>
              <p>Store supervisor Zack Goh, 29, said it’s not expensive to travel down
               to Singapore. “My relatives from Malaysia are visiting the casinos 
              quite often because its affordable and they are drawn by the new IRs.”</p>
