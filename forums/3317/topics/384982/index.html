              <p>The Competition Commission of Singapore or CCS has issued a Proposed
              Infringement Decision against ticketing services provider SISTIC. <br> <br> This is for possibly contravening section 47 of the Competition Act. <br> <br> Essentially, the section prohibits a dominant firm from engaging in
              anti-competitive business practices that exclude competitors from
              competing in any market, resulting in harmful effects in Singapore. <br> <br> CCS says SISTIC has separate agreements with The Esplanade and Singapore Sports Council which contain explicit restrictions. <br> <br> These restrictions require all events held at the Esplanade and the
              Singapore Indoor Stadium to use SISTIC as the sole ticketing service
              provider. <br> <br> Furthermore, SISTIC had 17 other similar agreements with event organisers. <br> <br> CCS also noted that SISTIC raised its booking fees against ticket to three dollars per ticket in January 2008. <br> <br> The Proposed Infringement Decision is a written notice setting out the basis on which CCS arrives at the proposed decision. <br> <br> Following the legal procedures, SISTIC is given eight weeks to put
              forth its responses, counterarguments and relevant facts for the CCS'
              consideration. <br> <br> CCS will then consider the merits of SISTIC's representations before
              finalising its decision on whether there has been an infringement of
              the Act.</p>

              <p><strong>Not all the blame is on Sistic</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: The Competition Commission of Singapore (CCS) may have
              come down hard on Sistic when it directed the ticketing agent to answer
              a charge on anti-competitive practices through abuse of its dominant
              position in the market - but should the CCS also direct its attention
              at the venue owners as well? </span></p>
              <p><span>This poser came up in the wake of the show-cause call issued by the anti-competition watchdog earlier this month.  
              <br> <br> Take arts impressario Robert Liew. He reckons that Sistic's monopoly
              has arisen not entirely through its own design, but because of
              conditions set by Singapore Indoor Stadium (SIS) and The Esplanade. <br> <br> "They dictate that the ticketing agent has to be Sistic if promoters want to stage their production at these premises."   
              <br> <br> Mr Liew is the Association of Concert and Event Management Singapore's
              (ACEMS) president and managing director of Arts Management Associates. <br> <br> Although he did not say if the CCS should look at the role of the venue
              owners, Mr Liew said venue owners "should give others a chance -
              competition is good for business." <br> <br> So, unless the two venue operators change their approach, more players are unlikely to enter the market, he added.  
              <br> <br> The Esplanade is said to own 35 per cent of Sistic, while the Singapore Sports Council owns 65 per cent.  
              <br> <br> Singapore now has five ticket providers - Gatecrash, TDC, Sistic and
              Apesnap which entered the market in March, and OneTicketHub, in June. <br> <br> Would the CCS' action - and the entry of newest kid on the block
              OneTicketHub - encourage more to enter the market and so lead to lower
              ticket prices? <br> <br> If the responses of event organisers are anything to go by, the short answer seems to be "no".    
              <br> <br> TICKET PRICES  
              <br> <br> Arts organisers that MediaCorp spoke to felt that local productions are
              generally already more affordable compared to overseas imports, as
              these include costs like artiste fees, hotel accommodation, airfare,
              withholding taxes as well as costs of technical hire and marketing and
              royalties, Mr Liew explained. <br> <br> Tickets might cost less for arts and concerts goers in Europe and America because the land cost there is cheaper.   
              <br> <br> "For many major cities, venue rentals may be lower, artists are there
              for longer runs, so costs are amortised, and many of these venues are
              adopted or supported by philanthropists," said Mr Liew. <br> <br> The price of a ticket has two components: The first is the ticketing
              charge levied on consumers, which could range from $1 to $3 ticket,
              plus collection fees. <br> <br> The second comprises charges levied on the promoter or presenter. These
              are administration fees, commission, inside charges, complimentary
              ticket charges, credit card charges to credit companies, and additional
              services fees and charges as required. <br> <br> There are also charges, which can be quite substantial like advertising on the ticket agent's website, said arts organisers.  
              <br> <br> "Ticket charges are part of the cost of a ticket. It's something I have
              to take into account when budgeting for a production," said Nanyang
              Academy of Fine Arts (Nafa) vice-president of administration Liew Chin
              Choy. <br> <br> Still, this has not prevented Cake Theatre, a small arts group, from using Sistic.  
              <br> <br> "We've been using them from the day we started four years ago," said
              Cake's artistic director, Natalie Hennedige. "Though the charges can be
              steep, Sistic has higher visibility and it has many counters." <br> <br> It is a conclusion shared by other arts organisers even if they do not use Sistic.  
              <br> <br> The Substation and Nafa's music department use Gatecrash and now One­TicketHub.  
              <br> <br> "It's not viable for small venues like ours - a blackbox theatre of 100
              seats - to use Sistic as the charges are expensive and we can't recoup
              the cost," said The Substation's co-artistic director Audrey Wong. Its
              ticket prices range between $15 and $25. <br> <br> Mr Edward Yen, Nafa's music assistant of concert and promotions, told
              Media­Corp it switched to OneTicketHub from Gatecrash for its year-long
              music concerts because of lower cost. <br> <br> "We're very pleased because it's value for money," said Mr Yen. "The
              only drawback is that a certain market segment is not comfortable about
              buying tickets online and printing them out." <br> <br> All said, ticket charges are still lower in Singapore than New York or
              the United Kingdom, according to Mr Liew, who has been in the business
              for more than 25 years. </span></p>
