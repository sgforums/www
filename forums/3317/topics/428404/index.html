              <p>AN UNEMPLOYED man was charged in court on Thursday with armed robbery
               of $450,000 from a businessman at a hotel room in Marina Bay Sands last
               week.</p>
              <p>No plea was taken from Octavius Tok Tien Howe, 37.</p>
              <p>He is said to have robbed Mr Gay Choon Hooi with an accomplice, of 
              the amount in the room at about 11pm on April 14, while each of them was
               armed with a knife.</p>
              <p>The prosecution successfully applied for him to be remanded 
              at Tanglin Police Division for a week with permission to take him out 
              for investigation to trace the accomplice.</p>
              <p>Tok had objected to the remand and denied committing any crime. He will be back in court on April 28.</p>
              <p>If convicted of armed robbery, he can be jailed between three and 14 years, plus at least 12 strokes of the cane.</p>

              <h1 class="headline">Man denies armed robbery at MBS</h1>
              <p>How does one lose S$450,000 at a casino without gambling?</p>
              <p>A <span id="lw_1303453509_9" class="yshortcuts">managing director</span>, Gay Choon Hooi, was allegedly robbed at knife point by two men last Thursday in a hotel room at Marina Bay Sands (MBS), <em><span id="lw_1303453509_7" class="yshortcuts">The Straits Times</span></em> reported.</p>
              <p>Octavius Tok Tien Howe, 37, was charged in a district court on Thursday with the <span id="lw_1303453509_1" class="yshortcuts">armed robbery</span>. His alleged accomplice, Neo Ek Khiang, is still at large. A <span id="lw_1303453509_0" class="yshortcuts">police prosecutor</span> applied for a week's <span id="lw_1303453509_2" class="yshortcuts">remand</span> so that the accomplice's whereabouts can be traced.</p>
              <p>However, Tok remained defiant.</p>
              <p>Dressed in a long-sleeved shirt and blue jeans, he objected to the remand and denied committing any crime.</p>
              <p>The stout and fair-complexioned man said that when he was arrested in
               Changi Airport, he asked the investigation officer for evidence of his 
              arrest.</p>
              <p>When the officer replied "armed robbery," he asked, "Where is the arm?"</p>
              <p>He went on to say that he would not have returned to Singapore if he had committed a crime.</p>
              <p>Tok, who is unemployed, accused the officer of not doing a "thorough"
               job and asked, "Why am I treated like this case is so serious?"</p>
              <p>District Judge Lim Tse Haw, who remanded Tok until next Thursday, 
              said that under the law, armed robbery was not a bailable offence as of 
              right, and police needed time to trace the accomplice.</p>
              <p>If convicted, Tok faces a jail term of three to 14 years and at least 12 strokes of the cane.</p>
              <p>Gay is a Singapore Permanent Resident (PR) in his 40s, and is the 
              managing director of CitiWall, a leading installer of aluminum works 
              such as windows, curtain walls and claddings.</p>
              <p>He is listed as director and shareholder of about a dozen firms on the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority website.</p>
              <p>A spokesperson for MBS told <em>The Straits Times</em>, "The safety 
              of our guests and staff is our top priority. We have strong procedures 
              and security measures throughout our property in order to provide a safe
               and secure atmosphere for our valued guests."</p>
              <p>She added that the management would work closely with the police and 
              authorities to prevent and detect illegal activities and that all 
              perpetrators be brought to justice.</p>
