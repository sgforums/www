              <p>SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) has made a police report after one of their officers at a Social Service Office (SSO) was allegedly assaulted, the ministry said on Tuesday (Nov 17). </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In a press release, MSF said that on Nov 6, a member of the public visited the SSO@Toa Payoh to apply for financial assistance. The officer was then allegedly assaulted when she was interviewing him to understand his financial situation better.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The SSO immediately called the police, and the man was arrested. The officer has since resumed work, after receiving treatment at the hospital for her injuries. MSF, as well as her immediate colleagues, are extending her the necessary support, it said.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Said the ministry: "MSF officers, including those at our SSOs, try our best to serve the public. For people seeking assistance from us, we seek their cooperation so that we can assess their situation and extend the appropriate assistance to them. We value our officers and will not tolerate any form of abuse against them. In instances where our officers are abused in the course of duty, MSF will not hesitate to bring the perpetrators to task."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Social and Family Development Minister Tan Chuan-Jin commented on the incident in a Facebook note on Tuesday: "My officers strive to do their best when they serve the public. Despite the occasional physical and verbal abuse our officers are subjected to, they remain committed and passionate about their cause."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Mr Tan added that while he understands the anxiety of some people the MSF serves, "there is a line that just cannot be crossed". </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"I will not tolerate any behaviour by anyone that causes harm to my officers. We will do our utmost to protect them in the course of their duties. I hope that my officers will have your support too as they do their best to serve," Mr Tan said. </p>
