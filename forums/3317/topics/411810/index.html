              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; font-size: x-small;"><strong>MANY casino
              employees, particularly dealers, from Marina Bay Sands could be
              submitting their letters of resignation as early as Monday. <br> <br> <br>One employee with the integrated resort, who declined to be named, said that "many dealers are not happy and want to resign". <br> <br>Industry insiders told my paper that many dealers are unhappy over issues such as pay, hectic work schedules and training. <br> <br>A social-networking website had a posting which suggested that there was a "mass resignation" of dealers early this month. <br> <br>One
              person who posted on the site said he was aware of at least eight staff
              serving the VIP rooms who would be leaving this month. <br> <br>The
              employee that my paper spoke to said that the reason why there could be
              an exodus of dealers is because "their contract is up". <br> <br>"They
              have three months of training and are bonded for six months after that.
              If they want to leave early, they have to pay (for the training). Now
              that the six-month bond is up, many want to leave," he said. <br> <br>It
              is understood that the training for many dealers began in February.
              Their bond began on the day Marina Bay Sands opened its doors, which is
              April 27. So, their six-month bond ends on Oct 26. <br> <br>If the dealers tender their resignation on Monday, that would give them about a month's notice before their bond ends. <br> <br>The
              employee said that he knew of at least three dealers who intend to quit
              next week. One of them had actually left a higher-paying job in the
              service industry to become a dealer as it was a new experience. The
              dealer even turned down an offer to work in a bank. <br> <br>Frustrated
              by issues such as not getting paid in a timely manner while on medical
              leave, as well as the hectic schedules in the first four to five months
              of work, the dealer decided to leave Sands. He was also upset about
              being paid less than dealers at Resorts World Sentosa, the other
              integrated resort. <br> <br>"The dealer regretted not taking up the
              bank job," the employee said, adding that the dealer is now looking at
              either working in the Sentosa IR or in a bank. <br> <br>The employee
              and another industry source said that dealers and other staff working
              on the casino floor of Sands cannot take leave for the rest of the year
              as it the dates have all been blocked out. <br> <br>The amount of work
              required of some staff has also gone up. Both the Marina Bay Sands
              employee and the industry source told my paper that about a month ago,
              many of the supervisors of the dealers had to take charge of more
              tables. <br> <br>According to a posting on a social- networking website, these supervisors now oversee six or more tables. <br> <br>When
              contacted, a Marina Bay Sands spokesman would say only that "we have
              not received any mass resignations from our casino team members".</strong></span></p>
