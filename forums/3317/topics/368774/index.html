              <p><strong>World's oldest man, British WWI veteran dies at 113</strong></p>
              <p class="first">LONDON (AFP) - - Henry Allingham, the world's oldest
              man and oldest World War I veteran, died Saturday at the age of 113,
              the nursing home in Britain where he spent his last years said.</p>
              <p>Allingham, who in 2008 led the country in marking the 90th
              anniversary of the World War I armistice, put his longevity down to
              "cigarettes, whisky and wild, wild women."</p>
              <p>"Everybody at St
              Dunstan's is saddened by Henry's loss and our sympathy goes out to his
              family," said Robert Leader, chief executive of St Dunstan's care home
              in Ovingdean, near Brighton on the south England coast.</p>
              <p>He had
              become the world's oldest man on June 17, Guinness World Records
              confirmed, when the previous holder, Tomoji Tanabe of Japan, died aged
              113.</p>
              <p>Allingham had marked his 113th birthday on June 6.</p>
              <p>Leader said Allingham was "very active right up to his final days."</p>
              <p>"As
              well as possessing a great spirit of fun, he represented the last of a
              generation who gave a very great deal for us," he said.</p>
              <p>"Henry made many friends among the residents and staff at St Dunstan's. He was a great character and will be missed."</p>
              <p>A funeral will take place later this month in Brighton.</p>
              <p>Prime Minister Gordon Brown led the tributes to the veteran.</p>
              <p>"I
              had the privilege of meeting Henry many times. He was a tremendous
              character, one of the last representatives of a generation of
              tremendous characters," he said.</p>
              <p>"My thoughts are with his family as they mourn his passing but celebrate his life."</p>
              <p>Allingham lived in three different centuries and saw six British monarchs on the throne.</p>
              <p>Events
              he lived through included the death of queen Victoria in 1901, the
              sinking of the Titanic in 1912, the invention of television by John
              Logie Baird in the 1920s and the Wall Street crash of 1929.</p>
              <p>A
              mechanic in the Royal Naval Air Service, he took part in the naval
              Battle of Jutland in 1916 and was one of the founding members of the
              Royal Air Force, which was formed in 1918.</p>
              <p>"I am greatly saddened to hear of the death of Henry Allingham," said Britain's Veterans Minister Kevan Jones.</p>
              <p>"For one of his age, his vigour for life was extraordinary.</p>
              <p>"I
              was humbled to meet somebody who had led such an amazing life and we
              owe such a huge debt of gratitude to him and his generation. My
              thoughts are with his family."</p>
              <p>Allingham had five grandchildren and 12 great-grandchildren, 14 great-great grandchildren and one great-great-great grandchild.</p>
              <p>Dorothy
              Allingham, his wife of 51 years, died in 1970, a decade after he had
              retired. In civilian life, he worked for carmaker Ford.</p>
              <p>Prince
              Charles, the heir to the throne, described Allingham as "one of our
              nation's historic treasures" in the foreword to the veteran's 2008
              autobiography, "Kitchener's Last Volunteer".</p>
              <p>"He does not want
              modern society to forget what his generation gave for our futures but,
              equally, the message of peace and reconciliation is one that he desires
              to convey above all else," Charles wrote.</p>
              <p>"We should all be
              humbled by this quiet, genial man and his desire to extol peace and
              friendship to the world, despite all the horrors he witnessed at such a
              young and impressionable age."</p>
              <p>The world's oldest man is now a 112-year-old American, Walter Breuning, who was born on September 21, 1896.</p>
              <p>The world's oldest woman is Gertrude Baines, a 115-year-old American.</p>
