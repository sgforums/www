              <p><span>SINGAPORE: A young grassroots leader has received flak from scores
               of netizens for calling Singaporeans "third-class" citizens on the 
              People's Action Party (PAP) Facebook page. </span></p>
              <p><span> The member, Jack Lin, later clarified that he meant "the behaviour of some citizens are still third world". </span></p>
              <p><span> He told Channel NewsAsia that his intention was to relay the fact that 
              certain people, hiding behind the curtain of anonymity, posting 
              irresponsible comments and insulting others, were having the conduct of 
              '3rd class'. </span></p>
              <p><span>Mr Lin, who is the general secretary of the Joo Chiat Community 
              Club Youth Executive Committee, had also angered some with his comments 
              on opposition parties.
              <br> <br> Young PAP Vice-Chairman Zaqy Mohamed said it could be "damaging" when people associate personal views as representing the party.
              <br> <br> So future initiatives would be to educate members on how to engage online.

              <p>sometimes i wonder if the mainstream PAP does observe the younger counterparts they have. they promote the arrogant, the proud, the "just talk and do nothing" and those that got into place by pulling strings.</p>
              <p>what about those who really want to make that change for their country? i believe there are a small number in young PAP that joined not entirely due to selfish reasons but want to contribute in little positive ways but due to the dog eat dog mentality and arrogant b*stards of the rest, they are subsequently "forced" out. </p>
              <p>don't they know they are digging their own grave if they keep promoting those b*stards into position of power eventually? </p>

              <p>I quote his exact words:</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; font-size: 12px;"><em>"We got first-class ministers and Government, but still got third-class citizens."</em></span></p>
              <p>Source: <a href="http://www.todayonline.com/Singapore/EDC100729-0000059/Third-class-citizens-comment-draws-criticism-from-Netizens">TODAY Online</a></p>
              <p>He later claimed that it was (I quote him again, same source):</p>
              <p> <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; font-size: 12px;"><em>"to relay the fact that certain people, hiding behind the curtain of anonymity, posting irresponsible comments and insulting others, were having the conduct of 'third-class'".</em></span></p>
              <p>If that were the case, then that is still an admission of guilt, because his original comments had no disclaimers or explanations of anything to that effect. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p>Simi 'misinterpretation'? If he doesn't establish the context properly and use such harsh language, he is in fact giving no room for interpretation. The only possible interpretation that can come out of such comments would be 'arrogant and condescending'. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
