              SINGAPORE: A former Yuhua Secondary School teacher has pleaded guilty to a variety of charges, including trying to film girls in the washroom.
              
              Bertrand Ngien Wen-Tseah admitted to three counts of insulting a woman's modesty, three counts of criminal trespass, one of destroying evidence and one of mischief.
              
              The offences were committed over two months this year - January and February - mostly at school.
              
              The prosecution is proceeding on three charges insulting modesty, destroying evidence and mischief.
              
              Court documents stated that the 37-year-old had trespassed the school's female toilet in February where he installed three pin-hole cameras in each of the three cubicles.
              
              The cameras were placed behind the cubicle walls.
              
              On the same day, Ngien realised the cameras had been discovered by a colleague and tried to steal the micro SD memory cards.
              
              He was found out by school authorities a few hours later and was asked to return to school.
              
              On his way back to school, Ngien threw the memory cards into the canal in Jurong West.
              
              Then he met with the principal, vice-principal and senior teachers and was told a police report would be made.
              
              To further get rid of evidence, Ngien threw the laptop issued to him by the Education Ministry down the rubbish chute at his Clementi home at night.
              
              He had used the school laptop to view footage of earlier videos of the girls using the toilet.
              
              If convicted of insulting modesty of a woman, he could be jailed up to a year and fined.
              
              For destroying evidence, Ngien could be put behind bars for up to two years and fined.
              
              He also faces a maximum jail term of one year and a fine, for committing mischief.
              
              He is expected to be sentenced on 25 July.
