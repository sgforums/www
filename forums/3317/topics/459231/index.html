              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Former Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew on Wednesday 
              shared some key elements of Singapore's success in attracting 
              investments, which Russia can emulate.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Addressing the 7th 
              Russia-Singapore Business Forum, Mr Lee said key to attracting 
              investments is to ensure the safety and security of those who come to 
              work here and their families.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>For Mr Lee, taking 
              part in the Russia-Singapore Business Forum is a regular affair, since 
              he is familiar with Russia's political and business climate from his 
              many visits there.<br><br>Mr Lee was asked what Russia could do to attract more investments.<br><br>"You
               must have the least bureaucracy to prevent them from carrying on their 
              business. An investor who comes in... it is our duty to help him 
              succeed. When he succeeds, his friends will know about it and they will 
              also come in," said Mr Lee.<br><br>"Today, we have more multi-nationals 
              in Singapore, in manufacturing and R&amp;D, services, in any field you 
              like... We make the place liveable, safe for foreigners and their 
              children... therefore (making it) easy for them to settle here and do 
              business. If you do the same in Russia, you will succeed," he added.<br><br>With
               Singapore's long-term population and manpower challenges in the news, 
              Mr Lee also spoke about the pace of admitting foreigners.<br><br>"We are
               short of workers today. We have 5.2 million people of whom 1.5 million 
              are foreign workers... We need more. Although they are coming in at a 
              slower pace, they are coming in," said Mr Lee.<br><br>There was also a suggestion that Mr Lee make his memoirs and books available online.<br><br>While Mr Lee felt it is up to the publishers, the forum's organisers said they hope to achieve it in a year's time.<br><br>- CNA/cc</span></span></p>
