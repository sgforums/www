              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Singapore's five Community Development Councils 
              (CDCs) have seen an increase in the number of social assistance cases 
              coming to them for help in 2012.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>A key reason for 
              this uptrend is the revision in the criteria of people who can now 
              qualify for such help under the ComCare scheme.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The scheme was revised last year.<br><br>Among
               the changes - the income criteria for short and medium term assistance 
              schemes have been revised and there are more pre-school and student care
               subsidies.<br><br>There are four key challenges which will shape the 
              work of the CDCs in 2013 - an expected slowdown in economic growth in 
              Singapore coupled with economic restructuring, preserving social 
              mobility, a rapidly ageing population and the continued costs of living 
              pressures.<br><br>For cleaner Tay Kheng Leong, a sole breadwinner 
              earning about S$700 a month, schemes from the North East CDC have come 
              in very handy for him to meet his daily and medical expenses for his 
              family members, who live in a two-room rental flat.<br><br>Mr Tay said 
              CDC has been giving him S$300 every month for more than a year. His 
              children get free textbooks and school uniforms. He provides for his 
              children's pocket money.<br><br>Between January and September 2012, the 
              CDCs received close to 44,900 applications for help, an increase of 8.2 
              per cent compared to 2011. In 2011, there were 41,500 applications for 
              the period between January and September.<br><br>Teo Ser Luck, mayor of 
              North East CDC said: "There is the lower middle income (group) that we 
              have to help. Based on the rising costs of living, some of them may be 
              struggling, some of them may have a one-time expenditure which they 
              could not handle or afford. These are the ones we look out for. <br><br>"But
               we have to make our schemes more readily available on the ground and 
              accessible. That is why more resources would be put into the community, 
              engaging the residents and helping the residents this year."<br><br>Dr 
              Teo Ho Pin, mayor of North West CDC added: "This year we have set aside a
               budget of about S$3.5 million in our CDC funding to support the needy. 
              What we want to do is to provide a more holistic approach to help the 
              needy families to achieve self reliance. <br><br>"In the areas of social
               assistance services, we will be decentralising some of our service 
              points. Secondly we will be improving our processing time. Today we are 
              processing 99 per cent of our cases within four weeks. We are going to 
              do it within two weeks, so that we can respond faster."<br><br>Dr Amy 
              Khor, coordinating chairman of the mayors' council, feels more can be 
              done to improve the accessibility and delivery of social assistance. <br><br>"The
               CDCs are also actually working to further enhance and improve the 
              efficiency and effectiveness as well as accessibility of social 
              assistance and social assistance delivery," said Dr Khor, who is also 
              the mayor of South West CDC. <br><br>"We are looking at a standard 
              referral form and protocol, as well as working closely with our partner 
              agencies to ensure that no one falls through the cracks and that they 
              can get targeted assistance which is needed, relevant and useful to 
              them."<br><br>Sam Tan, mayor of Central Singapore CDC said: "In the 
              past, there were many who lived in the one and two-room rental flats, 
              they may not be able to read the newsletter, internet and so on. We have
               done a lot of outreach activities like doing home visits, working 
              closely with the VWOs (voluntary welfare organisations), the seniors 
              activity centres, asking them to recommend the probable and suitable 
              (potential beneficiaries) so that we can get in touch with them."<br><br>But there may still be some who do not qualify for the schemes and who need some interim help.<br><br>"In
               our case we always take a more generous approach in that we always 
              exercise flexibility for people who may just marginally, or for some 
              reasons may have exceeded the criteria a little bit more," said Mr Tan. <br><br>"We
               always look at their family background to find if there are other 
              justifying factors or reasons so that we can have reasons to offer the 
              assistance to them, even though they may have exceeded the criteria."<br><br>"Definitely
               there are applicants who may not qualify, but they come forward. Some 
              of them may know that outright they do not qualify," said Dr Khor.<br><br>"They
               may suffer pay cuts but they expect to maintain their standard of 
              living. That can be a problem and so we need to counsel and explain to 
              them. In some cases when they really do not qualify because of their 
              income criteria, we may still assist them through our own local schemes,
               in various ways, may not be in cash assistance but other ways, in terms
               of training where they can get other jobs. Or for instance in terms of 
              looking at their needs of their children."<br><br>The next focus area for the CDCs is the elderly, and a pilot programme is underway in Marine Parade to assess their needs.<br><br>Dr
               Mohamad Maliki Osman, mayor of South East CDC explained: "Marine Parade
               is where we pilot the concept of a city of all ages where we want to 
              help the seniors ensure that they are able to age successfully with the 
              younger generation. <br><br>"So we assess all the abilities of the 
              elderly, whether they are wheelchair bound, whether they have visual 
              difficulties. The whole of Marine Parade is assessed physically and at 
              the same time they also look at the social infrastructure of Marine 
              Parade to respond to the varying needs of senior citizens there. 
              Hopefully if Marine Parade succeeds we will try to expand it to other 
              towns."<br><br>When it comes to employment assistance, the picture at 
              the CDCs is slightly different. The CDCs say the number of people coming
               to them for job referrals and employment matters has dipped slightly in
               2012 compared to 2011. And one key reason for this fall in numbers is 
              the tight job market in Singapore last year.<br><br>Between January and 
              November 2012, the number of people approaching the CDCs for training 
              and employment assistance was 24,500, a 3 per cent drop compared to the 
              same period in 2011.<br><br>The success rates of those being placed into
               employment has also been higher in 2012. 11,800 were placed into jobs 
              between January and November 2012, compared to 10,100 for the same 
              period in 2011.<br><br>But if Singapore faces a recession, the mayors 
              say they are ready with their help schemes, having gained from the 
              experiences in 2003 and 2008.<br><br>- CNA/xq</span></span></p>
