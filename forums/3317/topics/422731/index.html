              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: The number of teenage girls engaging in underage sex 
              rose last year, even as the authorities scored a success in reducing the
               number of younger girls from doing so.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The latest police 
              figures showed there were 198 cases of sexual penetration involving a 
              girl aged below 16, last year. This was 10 more than in 2009.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>However, the number of cases last year was an improvement from the figures in 2008, which saw 249 cases.<br><br>The
               police said that most of the time, these girls were having underage sex
               with men known to them, usually their boyfriends or friends.<br><br>In 
              one such case at the Subordinate Courts last month, Muhammad Shafiq 
              Abdul Ghani, then 20, pleaded guilty to having consensual sex with a 
              14-year-old girl between late February and early March, last year. The 
              District Court heard the girl had initiated sex as she wanted to "have 
              his child" which Muhammad Shafiq agreed.<br><br>Now 21, he was spared 
              jail and fined S$4,000. District Judge Eddy Tham felt the girl's "active
               initiation" where the offender was below 21 was a sentencing 
              consideration. Prosecutors have appealed.<br><br>However, statutory rape cases - for girls under 14 - went down.<br><br>Compared to 2009, last year saw a 40 per cent drop in the number of cases.<br><br>Deputy
               Superintendent (DSP) William Goh, said the police has been delivering 
              talks on teenage sex and the law to students from secondary schools and 
              junior colleges, as well as training teachers so that they can raise 
              awareness on the issue.<br><br>"Since 2009, the police have extended 
              such talks to social service networks, with the objective of widening 
              the reach to create a greater awareness of the legal and social 
              consequences of teenage sex," he added.<br><br>Mr Yusof Ismail, chief 
              executive of Ain Society, which works with troubled youth, suggested the
               authorities could extend these talks to primary school students as he 
              was now seeing children, aged 12 to 14, becoming sexually active.<br><br>He said: "If we want to bring numbers down over the next five years, we should consider extending efforts upstream."<br><br>Clinical psychologist Carol Balhetchet suggested using role models, such as celebrities, to deliver the abstinence message.<br><br>"Families
               could help in spreading the right values but parents sometimes don't 
              touch on the subject because it is awkward," she added<br><br>Agreeing, 
              DSP Goh said all stakeholders, including the community, schools, 
              parents, and media have an important role to play in educating youth 
              against underage sex.<br><br>"Care should be taken by families to 
              observe changes in the behaviour or activities of the young as most of 
              the perpetrators in such cases are known to the victims," he added.<br><br>-CNA/ac</span></span></p>

              <p>Arent they taught about sex education in secondary school? At most school should teach them how to use condom for safer sex so as to prevent unwanted babies.</p>
              <p>Anyway, does anyone know whether condom can be purchase under the 16?</p>
