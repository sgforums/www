              <p><strong>Long queues at Shell stations islandwide</strong></p>
              <p>Queues formed at some Shell stations islandwide due to a promotional
              deal of a dollar per litre of petrol the company is offering today. <br> <br> However a minor computer glitch at a Shell station in Alexandra this morning resulted in several drivers being turned away. <br> <br> These early birds were told to go to another petrol station nearby. <br> <br> Charles Quah was one of the drivers affected :<br><br> " I was among the first few so I did not have to wait at all but the
              problem was they were people behind me and all of them were told to go
              to the next Shell station and we were told to go to the one in
              Commonwealth but of course when we went there there was a long line. No
              I did not pump petrol at all, to be there at about 10 am and to be
              among the first few and we were told that the pumps were not working. " <br><br> Shell says the problem was resolved within 30 minutes and only one station was affected. <br> <br> Other than that, most drivers MediaCorp spoke to said they did not have to wait too long for their turn. <br> <br> "No it was only for a few minutes, about five minutes. "<br> <br> "About 20 minutes."<br> <br> "About 10 minutes, quite fast." <br><br> To ensure a smooth flow of traffic, Shell has deployed 150 Cisco guards at almost all its stations islandwide. <br> <br> Besides the discounted fuel, the company would also like to remind their drivers about the importance of fuel efficiency. <br> <br> Henry Chu is the General Manager of Retail Sales and Operations at Shell :<br><br> " We have about 800 thousand of fuel saving booklets which teaches our
              consumer to save as they drive and at the same time we also tell them
              with fuel save 95 or 98 the extra one litre where can you go. "</p>
