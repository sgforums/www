              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Singapore must adapt and learn to manage greater diversity in perspectives, value systems and aspirations.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Senior Minister of 
              State for Information, Communications &amp; the Arts Grace Fu said the 
              challenge of increasing social diversity is likely to become greater as 
              the society evolves.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>She highlighted this as one of the challenges Singapore face in its next phase of nation-building.<br> <br>Ms
               Fu was speaking at a partnership signing ceremony between SIM 
              University (UniSIM) and the People's Association's leadership 
              development arm (NACLI) on Saturday morning.<br><br>She said while 
              diversity makes Singapore a unique melting pot of cultures and heritage,
               it can only be so if its social fabric is strong.<br><br>And there are emerging trends that tug at Singapore's social fabric.<br><br>Ms
               Fu said social media has amplified voices beyond what was attainable in
               the traditional media. And in an arena that is noisy, some people have 
              attempted to be more extreme and assertive to be heard, at times to an 
              extent that's uncomfortable for the majority.<br><br>Hence, she said the task of bonding and bridging these groups will become even more important.<br><br>She
               added that the People's Association and its wide network of 32,000 
              grassroots leaders will have their work cut out for them in the years 
              ahead.<br><br>Another key challenge for Singapore is to connecting youths and the community.<br><br>Ms
               Fu said Singapore needs to continue engaging the young early and build 
              up their community spirit so that they can play a crucial role in 
              creating the country's future.<br><br>The third challenge she highlighted is Singapore's ageing population.<br><br>There is a need for more programmes, services and facilities to keep senior citizens active, employed and healthy.<br><br>Ms
               Fu said apart from the government, all stakeholders such as community 
              leaders, voluntary and civic groups need to continue to play a role in 
              making the lives of seniors more meaningful.<br><br>To overcome the 
              three challenges she's outlined, Ms Fu urged Singaporeans to become 
              active citizens and participate actively in making Singapore better.<br><br>- CNA/fa</span></span></p>

              <p>Social diversity, but education system is uniform, all use the alien bastard english as dominant. This will weaken the diverse local cultures. It is wrong and must be rejected.</p>

              <p>managing social diveristy cannot sustain well if you do not understand its psychological diversity in the first place....</p>
              <p>we have been well aware of multi-racialism since the day we were born....much of our lives are affected by policies which are getting farther away from ground sentiments and reality....these policies remain overly academic or over emphasized in nature i.e. women charter, rather than reflecting and resolving ground problems....</p>
              <p>imbalances left unchecked and aggravated overtime would only be accumulative voices of dissent....</p>

              <p>They talk about diversity then why impose the uniform education system with the bastard language?</p>
              <p>Peranakans want to use english don't want mandarin, dialects also cannot, that is their business wah. </p>
              <p>Why go and destroy all the chinese schools and nantah leh?</p>
              <p>I want to ask that bastard Lee Kuan Yew why he destroyed chinese schools and suppressed dialects. He is not showing respect to the chinese in Singapore.</p>

              <p>I think that refers to Harry Lee Kuan Yew. He destroyed all the chinese schools and suppressed dialects.</p>
              <p>I am not comfortable with Lee Kuan Yew's racist and eugenicist views.</p>
              <p>Lee Kuan Yew has some of the most ludicrous and disgraceful social views. </p>
              <p>His intellect is really backward and poor.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/sad.png" alt="sad.png"></p>
