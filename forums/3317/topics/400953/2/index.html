              <p><strong>7 suspects in Sunday Kallang Attacks; three caught</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Seven people were believed to have been involved in the
               recent spate of attacks in the Kallang area on Sunday, which left one 
              man dead and three others seriously injured. </span></p>
              <p><span>The Criminal Investigation Department, or CID, today said three 
              Malaysians have been arrested in connection with the attacks.
              <br> <br> They are aged between 21 and 26 years old.
              <br> <br> Four other suspects are still at large.
              <br> <br> The CID said the men were caught after a 24-hour operation that saw 100 
              police officers deployed to comb the area.
              <br> <br> An Indian construction worker was slashed to death and his body was 
              found in an open field near the Kallang MRT station.
              <br> <br> Three others were also viciously slashed and are now in the intensive 
              care unit at Tan Tock Seng Hospital.  - CNA/vm </span></p>

              <p><br>see can get information from media after police follow up. if its two differnt gangs then its too much of na coicidence.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>sounded like thai only. the criminals might used another language to hide their identity. these are things that police and investigators should take note of. now they have made some arrests so see the outcome. premature releaasing of information might alert any possible of the gang remaining at large.</p>

              <p><strong>Five nabbed, two at large</strong></p>
              <p>FIVE men who carried out what police described as a 'cruel' and 
              'inhumane' spate of attacks in the Kallang area on Sunday have been 
              arrested after an operation involving more than 100 policemen.</p>
              <p>The five, all Sarawakians who worked here as cleaners and odd-job 
              labourers, went on a planned orgy of violent theft which has rarely been
               seen here.</p>
              <p>The men, some of whom stayed at a Syed Alwi Road lodging house, are 
              believed to have hatched their crimes with two others. The gang went on a
               knife-wielding rampage that left one person dead, two others in 
              intensive care and another with half his palm hacked off - all for $400 
              cash and three cellphones.</p>
              <p>Police have mounted a huge manhunt in several areas for the remaining
               two suspects who are believed to be part of the same gang.</p>
              <p>The gang may also be responsible for one or two other similar 
              slash-and-rob incidents in the area recently.</p>
              <p>Said Criminal Investigation Department (CID) chief Ng Boon Gay: 'What
               the group had done was very violent. They not only robbed people of 
              some small items... some mobile phones and cash... they caused harm and 
              killed one of them. These are all innocent victims. They had nothing to 
              do with the culprits.'</p>

              <p><strong>3 Sarawakians charged</strong></p>
              <p>A MAN from Sarawak was charged with the murder of a construction 
              worker while two others were accused of gang robbery.</p>
              <p>No plea was taken from general worker Micheal Garing, 22, who 
              allegedly committed murder by causing the death of Indian national 
              Shanmuganathan Dillidurai, 41, with three others at an open field along 
              Kallang Road on Sunday.</p>
              <p>In the same court, Sylvester Barogok, 26, and Shahman Milak,
               21, both also from Sarawak, were charged with committing gang robbery 
              of a mobile phone, cash of $32, a work permit card and an ez-link card 
              from Mr Raja Kana Kazi under an overhead bridge at Sims Drive last 
              Friday evening.</p>
              <p>The duo were allegedly with Micheal, Hairee Landak, 19, Tony
               Imba, 31, and Donny Meluda, 19, one or more of whom were armed with a 
              parang.</p>
              <p>All three were remanded at Central police division lock-up 
              for further investigation. They will appear in court on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>If convicted of murder, Micheal faces the death penalty. The
               maximum punishment for gang robbery is a jail term of five to 20 years 
              and not less than 12 strokes of the cane.</p>

              <p><span>SINGAPORE : Police have arrested one more suspect linked to a 
              spate of violence in Kallang, which left one dead and three seriously 
              injured in the early hours of Sunday. </span></p>
              <p><span>The 31-year-old suspect was arrested at about 8.15pm on Wednesday 
              at the Golden Mile Food Court in Beach Road, following extensive 
              follow-up investigations by the police.
              <br> <br> He will be charged in court with murder on Friday.
              <br> <br> Police investigations are still on-going to trace the last suspect in 
              the case. So far, six out of the seven suspects have been arrested.
              <br> <br> Three of them were charged in court on Wednesday. 
              <br> <br> One of them, 22-year-old Micheal Anak Garing was charged with the murder
               of an Indian construction worker at an open field near Riverine by The 
              Park condominium.
              <br> <br> The Malaysian is alleged to have committed the crime with three other 
              men.
              <br> <br> Two of the alleged members of the group were charged with armed robbery.
              <br> <br> They were accused of committing the robbery with five others under an 
              overhead bridge in Sims Drive on May 28.
              <br> <br> One or more of the accused were allegedly armed with a parang.
              <br> <br> The court has allowed detectives to take the trio out of remand to the 
              crime scene for investigations.

              <p><strong>More Sarawakians charged</strong></p>
              <p>A SECOND general worker from Sarawak was charged with murdering an 
              Indian national in Kallang while another man was accused of gang 
              robbery.</p>
              <p>Hairee Landak, 19, is alleged to have caused the death of 
              construction worker Shanmuganathan Dillidurai, 41, at the open field 
              along Kallang Road near to Riverine by the Park Condominium on Sunday.</p>
              <p>He allegedly committed the offence with Micheal Garing, 22, 
              Tony Imba, 31, and Donny Meluda, 19. Micheal was charged with murder on 
              Wednesday. Police picked up Tony at Golden Mile Food Centre on Wednesday
               evening. Hairee was remanded until next Wednesday when his case will be
               mentioned together with Micheal's.</p>
              <p>In the same court, another Sarawakian, Peter Usit Musa, 22, 
              was brought to court for the Sims Drive gang robbery last Friday - while
               one or more of them was armed with a parang.</p>
              <p>The victim, Mr Raja Kana Kazi, was allegedly relieved of his
               mobile phone, $32, work permit and ez-Link cards.</p>
              <p>Of the seven-man gang, only Sylvester Barogok, 25. and 
              Shaman Milak, 21, have been charged with gang robbery which upon 
              conviction, carries a jail term of up to 20 years and not less than 12 
              strokes of the cane. Peter was remanded and will appear in court next 
              Thursday.</p>
