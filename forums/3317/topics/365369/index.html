              <p class="first">LOS ANGELES - Chris Brown pleaded guilty Monday to
              assaulting Rihanna and the two were ordered to stay away from each
              other, in a deal that keeps the singer out of prison but requires him
              to clean up graffiti or roadside trash.</p>
              <p>Brown's plea to a felony charge will subject him to substantial
              scrutiny by probation officials, and the judge's order puts the kibosh
              on any short-term prospects for reconciliation with his pop diva
              girlfriend as well.</p>
              <p>The guilty plea came before a preliminary
              hearing was scheduled to start. The hearing had been billed for weeks
              as a public face-off between the pair, with Rihanna set to testify
              against her one-time boyfriend.</p>
              <p>Instead, Brown averted the
              potentially damaging meeting by entering a plea that will subject him
              to probation for the next five years as well as force him to perform
              six months of community service.</p>
              <p>Mark Geragos, Brown's lawyer,
              said the plea represented the singer taking responsibility for his
              actions _ which included beating, choking and biting Rihanna during a
              fight early Feb. 8, according to police.</p>
              <p>After Brown left the
              courtroom, Rihanna entered and was addressed by Los Angeles Superior
              Court Judge Patricia Schnegg, who explained to the Barbados-born singer
              that she had issued a stay-away order.</p>
              <p>Rihanna had not been
              seeking such an order, but the judge imposed one anyway. The order
              requires that Brown and Rihanna stay at least 50 yards from each,
              except at industry events when the distance is reduced to 10 yards.</p>
              <p>The
              judge also told Rihanna it's not a one-way order _ and that she, too,
              shouldn't get any closer to Brown than the order allows.</p>
              <p>"This is
              a kid who's never been in trouble before," Geragos said after the
              hearing. "He embraces this as chance to get the message out that
              domestic violence will not be tolerated. He wants to get his life back
              on track."</p>
              <p>Brown will be formally sentenced on Aug. 5.</p>
              <p>Schnegg
              accepted Brown's plea, but expressed some concerns because Brown is not
              a California resident. She said Brown likely will be allowed to do his
              service in his home state of Virginia, but she didn't want him to spend
              his time at churches or community centers.</p>
              <p>Instead, Schnegg
              ordered Brown to get his hands dirty by doing work equivalent to what
              he would do in California _ clean up grafitti or roadside trash.</p>
              <p>She also said he'll have to return to California every three months and attend domestic violence counseling.</p>
              <p>Sandi
              Gibbons, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County district attorney's
              office, said the terms were in line with what others receive when they
              are charged with similar crimes and have no prior criminal history.</p>
              <p>Brown spoke softly throughout the hearing as he waived his rights and told the judge he understood the gravity of his plea.</p>
              <p>"I think it's commendable you took responsibility for your conduct," Schnegg told Brown.</p>
              <p>She said she hoped "the terms and conditions of your probation will have some meaning."</p>
              <p>Rihanna
              spoke briefly, too, telling Schnegg she understood the terms of the
              stay-away order and that after Brown's sentencing she might ask for its
              terms to be loosened.</p>
              <p>Rihanna, 21, recorded one of 2007's most
              popular songs with "Umbrella" and has numerous other hits. Her looks
              have made her a cover girl for magazines, as well as a pitchwoman for
              Cover Girl cosmetics.</p>
              <p>The deal provides an end to a case that
              sparked intense media interest and severe backlash against Brown.
              Sponsors and radio stations dropped him, and the singer had to cancel
              several high-profile appearances, including a performance at the
              Grammys.</p>
              <p>The singer once known for his squeaky-clean image now
              has a substantial blemish on his record. Brown, 20, rose to fame after
              the 2005 hit "Run It!" He was nominated for a Grammy for "No Air" with
              Jordin Sparks and named Billboard's top artist in 2008.</p>
              <p>Intense
              media coverage led to Rihanna being identified as Brown's victim mere
              hours after the attack. Within weeks, a photo of the singer and model's
              bruised and battered face was posted on celebrity gossip site TMZ.</p>
              <p>The
              posting sparked an investigation by the Los Angeles Police Department
              into whether one of its own officers leaked the photo to the Web site.
              Brown's attorney unsuccessfully argued the leak hurt Brown and that he
              should be granted access to LAPD's investigative files.</p>
              <p>Brown recently proclaimed in a video posted to YouTube that he was "not a monster."</p>
              <p>Even after Monday's hearing, lawyers for Brown and Rihanna refused to discuss the status of the pair's relationship.</p>
              <p>Brown
              was arrested hours after police say he hit and threatened Rihanna after
              leaving a pre-Grammy party in Los Angeles. He was later charged with
              felony assault likely to produce great bodily harm and making criminal
              threats.</p>
              <p>If convicted, the singer faced sentences ranging up to nearly five years in prison.</p>
              <p>After
              an inital retreat from the public eye, both musicians have gradually
              appeared in public more frequently. Lately they have been photographed
              separately, including at a National Basketball Association finals game
              between the Orlando Magic and Los Angeles Lakers.</p>
              <p>But neither has been able to shake the stigma of the court case and return to their usual jobs _ making music.</p>
              <p>The logistics of Brown's sentence may make it difficult to get back to his job.</p>
              <p>"It
              amounts to a very sweaty house arrest," said Loyola University Law
              School Professor Stan Goldman, who was in the courtroom. "You have to
              have the discipline to show up several times a week. How many times
              will this interfere with a record date or an appearance?"</p>
