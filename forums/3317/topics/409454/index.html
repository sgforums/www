              <p>Just a few minutes of madness caused Gabriel Lim, 28, to lose S$100,000 – his entire life savings – on an online gaming website. What possessed him to take such a risk?</p>
              <p>Currently unemployed, the former store supervisor first got hooked to online baccarat last November after friends introduced him to the game.</p>
              <p>The lure of ”easy money” induced Lim to set up an account with the 
              online gaming website. Initially, Lim started with small S$5 bets but 
              blessed with ”beginner’s luck”, his winnings soon came up to an average 
              of S$2,000 a day in the first few months.</p>
              <p>“I was playing it almost three hours each day at home and sometimes in the office too,” he told Yahoo! Singapore.</p>
              <p>“I remember winning S$15,000 within a day, it really felt good,” said
               the diploma holder, who quit his job to focus full-time on his new 
              passion.</p>
              <p>The adrenaline “rush” from winning big caused Lim to make bigger and 
              bigger bets, all in the hope of making a huge windfall. Then came the 
              crash in March earlier this year — in just a matter of minutes.</p>
              <p>Revealing how he lost $100,000 in the blink of an eye, he said, “The 
              simple rule [in online gambling] is to use the ‘doubling up’ method, 
              where you double your bet amount each time you lose. But remember, once 
              you lose ten games in a row, log off and accept defeat,” Lim said.</p>
              <p>“But I lost discipline and control and went against the ‘rule’. I 
              continued with the 11th game thinking I would be able to win back my 
              losses but lost everything instead.”</p>
              <p>“I was stunned for a few minutes and when I realised all my money was
               gone, the only thing I wanted to do was smash things up to vent my 
              anger and frustration,” he said.</p>
              <p>Afraid his parents would find out, he turned to his elder brother after seeing his personal savings wiped out.</p>
              <p>“[My brother] lost S$50,000 at the casino so he understands what I am going through,” Lim said.</p>
              <p>So how is he dealing with the loss?</p>
              <p>Lim nonchalantly said no one is to blame except himself. When Yahoo! 
              Singapore spoke to him, the single man didn’t appear too affected 
              by losing such a huge sum of money.</p>
              <p>He even remains adamant that he is not a compulsive gambler. He says 
              he is now looking for a new job so he can start saving from scratch in 
              order to build up another pool of capital.</p>
              <p>“I will continue to gamble once I save enough cash and I believe this
               time round, I will follow the rules and win back my money,” he said 
              confidently.</p>
              <p>“I don’t consider myself a compulsive gambler because to me, it’s 
              more of a tactical thing where I strategise to win money. The key is 
              discipline.”</p>
