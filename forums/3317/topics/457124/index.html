              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: A fashion accessory that belonged to a Member of Parliament (MP) will soon be auctioned off. </span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>MP for Marine Parade GRC, Ms Tin Pei Ling, has donated her Kate Spade bag to AWARE's fundraiser.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The bag had received
               much publicity after a photo of her posing with the box circulated on 
              the internet after she was introduced as a candidate in the General 
              Election last year.<br><br>The iconic bag, still in mint condition, will go under the hammer at AWARE's auction next month. <br><br>The auction price for the bag starts at S$500.<br><br>Ms
               Tin said AWARE had approached her in June this year and she felt it was
               worthwhile to do something meaningful for a worthy cause. <br><br>She 
              explained: "I thought that since the bag received so much publicity 
              during the last General Election, I felt it could be put to good use to 
              draw attention to a worthy social cause.<br><br>"In this context, in the
               course of my work in the community, I do meet a lot of women, from 
              single mothers, sometimes abused wives and even the elderly. I feel for 
              them and I think they need our help and support.<br><br>"Therefore I 
              thought it would be worthwhile to contribute towards AWARE's efforts 
              like their crisis helpline, their befriender services, legal clinic and 
              even counselling services".<br><br>Asked if the publicity about the bag 
              would be revived again since it is being put up for an auction, Ms Tin 
              said: "I think there will be some public attention but I hope this 
              attention can be drawn to the worthy social causes we are trying to push
               out here and that is to try and reach out and help women who really 
              need our support out there in the community."<br><br>The AWARE auction is part of the AWARE Awards, Singapore's first gender equality awards.<br><br>Money raised from the auction will go towards funding AWARE's Support Services.<br><br>This
               year's AWARE fundraiser is known as the Supersonic Big Ball, which will
               be held on 10 September at the Grand Copthorne Waterfront Hotel.<br><br>- CNA/ck</span></span></p>
