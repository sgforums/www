              <p>Police have noted an increase in the number of reported email scams
              where Internet users are deceived into revealing their email account
              information. <br> <br> The users’ email accounts would then be taken over by the scammers and
              emails requesting for financial assistance would be sent to the
              victim's friends and relatives in the victim’s name. <br> <br> These emails, sent out in the victim's name, are intended to deceive
              the recipients into believing that the victim is stranded and cannot be
              reached though any means other than email, and in urgent need of
              financial assistance. <br> <br> Typically, the scammers would also request for the money to be sent urgently to an overseas account via remittance companies.<strong></strong> <br> <br> Police advise the public to be wary of such email phishing scams and email scams requesting for financial assistance: <br> <br> No email service providers, banks, financial institutions, or companies
              would email their customers to reveal or verify their user account
              information, passwords or PIN over the Internet for security reasons.<em> <br> <br> If users receive such emails, they ought to be careful and not respond
              by clicking on any web link or opening any file attachments inside the
              email. <br> <br> When in doubt, customers should contact the relevant email service
              providers, banks, financial institutions or companies for verification.<br> </em> <br> Should the public receive such emails, Police say they whould attempt
              to contact the person in question to verify his whereabouts and
              authenticate the email request. <br> <br> More details of other scam tactics and the relevant crime prevention
              advisories can be found at the Singapore Police Force website at <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.spf.gov.sg/">www.spf.gov.sg</a></span> or the Commercial Affairs Department website at <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.cad.gov.sg/">www.cad.gov.sg</a></span>.<span style="font-family: Book Antiqua;"> </span></p>

              <p>ONE NEW CASE in STOMP<br></p>
              <div class="story_headline2">'Poor and desperate' mum seeks help to clear $100,000 debt via email</div>

              <p>STOMPer<strong> philanthropist</strong> received an email about a 'poor and desperate' mother seeking financial
              help to clear her debts and wondered whether this was a scam.<br><br>The STOMPer says:</p>
              <p>"I was surprised when someone sent me an email with an appeal to help a so-called 'poor and desperate' mother.<br><br>"This young mother claims to have  5 kids and hopes a kind samaritan would come along to help her settle her debts.<br><br>"Is this a genuine plea from a mother or is this a sob story or an attempt to con Singaporeans of their hard earned money?<br><br>"The email says:<br><br>"Hello, I’m a housewife. I’m 35 this year. I’ve been married for 12 years and have 5 children, ranging from 11 to 2 years old.<br><br>"With much regret, my hubby and I started a family without any savings. He was already in debt when I first met him.<br><br>"Debts he incurred from his failing business. Even then, we still planned for 4 kids; our no. 5 was an accident.<br><br>"With loans from banks and relatives and credit cards' outstanding amount, we are in total debt of SIN$100K.<br><br>"We barely survived, but with God’s mercy and grace, we managed to survive up till today and now.<br><br>"Every
              end of the month is the most difficult period, having to pay debts and
              monthly bills using my hubby’s $3K income. We are so financially
              depleted.<br><br>"I may be asking for an impossible request, but I still would like to take my chance.<br><br>"Is there anyone out there who is kind enough to lend me SIN$100k unconditionally?"</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Things to ponder:</strong></span><br>How can they owe SIN$100K?<br>Who would marry someone already in debt before marriage?<br>Who in the right mind have 5 kids when they are already in debt. Probably today's context not even 1 kid.</p>
