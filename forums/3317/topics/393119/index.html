              <p><span>JAKARTA - Indonesian counter-terrorism forces killed a man 
              believed to have been one of the masterminds of the 2002 Bali bombings 
              on Tuesday during a raid in the capital Jakarta, police and reports 
              said. </span></p>
              <p><span>The man was among three people killed in two raids on the city's 
              outskirts.
              <br> <br> Police did not disclose the identities of the three, saying "a forensic 
              examination was still being carried out". 
              <br> <br> But a police source told AFP one was believed to be Dulmatin, a leader 
              of the Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) militant group and an Al-Qaeda-trained 
              bomb-making specialist for whom Washington is offering a 
              10-million-US-dollar bounty.
              <br> <br> It is not the first report of his death. In 2008, Philippine military 
              officials said they believed Dulmatin's body had been exhumed on the 
              island of Tawi-tawi.
              <br> <br> The security ministry's counter-terrorism chief, Ansyaad Mbai, told AFP 
              that "if it's true that it's him, we will be very grateful that the most
               wanted terrorist has been killed in Pamulang. It will be a big relief 
              to us."
              <br> <br> At a news conference, national police spokesman Edward Aritonang said 
              that one of the three was killed in a gunfight with counter-terrorism 
              police at an Internet cafe in Pamulang city west of the capital.
              <br> <br> Witnesses saw a body bag taken from the cafe into an ambulance following
               the gunfight. In a later raid a few kilometres from the first incident 
              two other people on a motorcycle were shot dead, an AFP photographer 
              witnessed.
              <br> <br> Police confirmed that the operation was linked to a counter-terrorism 
              raid in Aceh province in which a militant training facility was 
              discovered. Sixteen suspects have been arrested so far and charged under
               counter-terrorism laws.
              <br> <br> The series of operations comes ahead of a planned visit by US President 
              Barack Obama this month.
              <br> <br> Believed to be in his late 30s, Dulmatin is accused of helping JI plan 
              and carry out the Bali bombings, which killed 202 people on the 
              Indonesian resort island, most of them foreign tourists.
              <br> <br> JI is a Southeast Asian extremist group inspired by Al-Qaeda. Its 
              ultimate goal is to unite Indonesia, Brunei, Malaysia, Singapore and the
               southern Philippines into a fundamentalist Islamic state, using 
              terrorist attacks to destabilise existing governments.
              <br> <br> The group has carried out more than 50 bombings in Indonesia since April
               1999, according to the Brussels-based International Crisis Group, 
              including the 2002 Bali bombings and attacks on the resort island in 
              2005 that killed 20.
              <br> <br> The last such attack killed seven people and two suicide bombers in two 
              luxury hotels in Jakarta last July.
              <br> <br> Malaysian terror mastermind Noordin Mohammad Top, killed in September 
              2009, allegedly organised the attacks as part of his Al-Qaeda-inspired 
              "holy war" on the West. He was falsely reported to have been killed a 
              month earlier by local media.
