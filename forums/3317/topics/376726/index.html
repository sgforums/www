              <p><strong>15% of gamblers studied found to have suicidal tendencies</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : A study done on 350 gamblers has found that about 15 per cent of them have made suicide attempts. </span></p>
              <p><span>Researchers want to educate doctors on how to identify and treat such problems, at a regional scientific meeting in Singapore.
              <br> <br> There are fears that Singapore's two future casinos will increase the problem of gambling addiction. 
              <br> <br> So apart from putting in place safeguards like exclusion orders for
              vulnerable groups - like discharged bankrupts and those on social
              assistance - and prohibiting casino advertising in the local media,
              efforts are also being made to increase awareness of the problem and
              getting it treated early.
              <br> <br>Dr Thomas Lee, consultant, Addiction Medicine Department, Institute
              of Mental Health, said: "Gambling problems are very much present in
              Singapore...We have cruises to nowhere and nearby countries. We have
              Singapore lotteries, jackpot machines. But certainly because of the two
              IRs (integrated resorts), there is a lot more public awareness now."
              <br> <br>The issue will be discussed at length at the National Health
              Group's Annual Scientific Congress on October 16 and 17. It is the
              largest annual scientific meeting in Singapore since its inception in
              2002.
              <br> <br> Experts said gambling addiction is difficult to diagnose because it is a hidden disorder. But doctors need to be on the alert.
              <br> <br>Dr Lee said: "Very importantly, the primary care providers - the
              general practitioners and the polyclinic doctors - need to have a high
              degree of suspicion of people who come to them for stress-related
              disorders or sleep problems to find out if these people have a gambling
              problem.
              <br> <br> "A lot of them suffer from concurrent depression, and because of depression they may have suicidal ideas."
              <br> <br>In a local study done on pathological gamblers in treatment, about
              15 per cent of them were found to be suicidal. That figure is
              consistent with studies done globally. <br> <br> Another area of concern is the rising trend of inhalant abuse in youths.
              <br> <br> During the two-day congress - which is expected to draw more than 3,000
              delegates - experts will discuss how to better treat those addictions.
              <br> <br> Other highlights of the Scientific Congress include the latest updates on infectious diseases like H1N1 and dengue.
              <br> <br>Researchers will also present findings from a multi-institutional
              study on long-term survivors of childhood cancer - the first study of
              its kind in Singapore.
              <br> <br>Children under the age of five have the highest incidence of
              childhood cancer. But 80 per cent to 90 per cent of them can be
              expected to be cured.
              <br> <br> Researchers hope to set up a clinic for cancer survivors to go for further follow-up if they have problems. </span></p>
