              <p><strong>Mini CIQ for pedestrians in JB to start next year </strong></p>
              <p>JOHOR BARU: Construction of the proposed mini Customs, 
              Immigration and Quarantine (CIQ) complex for pedestrians in Johor Baru, 
              is expected to start by next year, says Johor Baru MP Datuk Shahrir 
              Samad.</p>
              <p>He said the discussions between Home Ministry officials, state 
              non-governmental organisations, the police, state assemblymen in Johor 
              Baru as well as city councillors were showing positive signs of 
              implementing the project.</p>
              <p>“The technical details will be solved 
              by this year. Realistically, the project is expected to start by early 
              next year,” he said.</p>
              <p>Shahrir said that close-door discussions, 
              which had been held three times, were chaired by Home Ministry 
              secretary-general Datuk Seri Mahmood Adam and among those in attendance 
              were himself and the Inspector-general of Police Tan Sri Musa Hassan.</p>
              <p>“In the latest meeting, the IGP (Musa) had concluded that the 
              mini-CIQ would not pose any security threat to the state or the country.</p>
              <p>“We are optimistic that the project will get underway after ironing
               some technical issues,” he said. Saturday.</p>
              <p>Speaking to 
              reporters Saturday after the latest meeting, Shahrir said that among the
               technical issues was the issue of land near the Causeway, which was 
              owned by the state government, the size and design of the complex, cost 
              of the project as well as whether the complex would cater to both 
              inbound and outbound traffic.</p>
              <p>He added that the proposed 
              mini-CIQ for pedestrians was first brought up in 2008 after the new CIQ 
              was first opened after members of the public complained about traffic 
              congestion and lack of facilities for pedestrians.</p>
              <p>“The majority
               of Johoreans people and businesses want this facility (mini-CIQ).</p>
              <p>“Such
               a facility can also revive the businesses in Johor Baru city centre, 
              which has taken a drastic hit since the new CIQ opened as traffic to and
               from Singapore no longer flowed there,” he said, adding that, 
              presently, traffic via the new CIQ flowed to the Stulang area.</p>
              <p>Shahrir said that the mini-CIQ would be conveniet for pedestrians 
              travelling to and from Singapore via the Causeway.</p>
              <p>“The 
              government has shown great commitment in making this proposal a reality.</p>
              <p>“The plight of the people, especially pedestrians must be taken 
              care of,” he said.</p>
              <p>Currently, public transport commuters leave 
              the CIQ through Johor Baru Central and City Square, requiring a long 
              walk to the nearest bus stop.</p>
              <p>In Jan last year, Shahrir, who was
               the then Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs minister, had proposed 
              utilising the old CIQ for pedestrian traffic, which could be the 
              solution to the long walk public transport users had to endure at the 
              new CIQ.</p>
