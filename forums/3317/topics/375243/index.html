              <p><strong>PAP Community Foundation to expand childcare centres, raise teachers' pay</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: The number of childcare centres run by the PAP
              Community Foundation(PCF) is set to more than double in the next two
              years to meet demand.
              <br> <br> The PCF, which runs 33 Sparkle*Tots childcare centres, is looking to add at least 40 more in the next two years. 
              <br> <br>This is in line with a plan announced earlier by the Ministry of
              Community Development, Youth and Sports, to add some 200 childcare
              centres industry-wide in the next five years.
              <br> <br>The PCF officially opened a Sparkle*Tots childcare centre on
              Saturday. The Punggol East Sparkle*Tots Infant and Childcare Centre was
              officially opened by Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean. <br> <br> Since beginning its operations on 1 June this year, 50% of the 71
              places have already been filled up, with several on the waiting list. <br> <br> The area's Member of Parliament, Mr Michael Palmer, said it is not
              ruling out opening another centre in Punggol East next year, once a
              suitable location has been identified.
              <br> <br> Efforts are also being made to improve the quality of education in both childcare centres and kindergartens. 
              <br> <br>They said learning should always be fun for children, hence a
              play-based curriculum. But more importantly, children these days are
              expected to learn more at a young age so a special pedagogy is being
              developed to help them increase their curiosity and help them be smart
              with words, smart with numbers and develop interpersonal skills.
              <br> <br>All that can only be achieved with the help of qualified PCF
              teachers. And to reflect the more demanding nature of their work, these
              teachers will get a pay rise in line with market values.
              <br> <br>Deputy Prime Minister Teo, who is also the PCF council chairman,
              said: "This is important, because we want to make sure that we can
              attract and retain good teachers for our students."
              <br> <br>PCF Group CEO, Tay Swee Yee, said: "The industry as a whole has to
              really sell early childhood educators as a profession, so we need to
              come together and appeal to (these educators), especially new entrants.
              <br> <br>"It is teaching in effect, but teaching at a very critical age of a
              child - between the age of two to six - that's the time that children
              are like a sponge, they soak up everything, all the knowledge and
              that's a very good time to teach them."
              <br> <br>A kindergarten principal with a professional Degree in Early
              Childhood Education will receive a salary ranging from $2,300 to $4,375
              per month, depending on experience, ability and performance. <br> <br> The salary of teachers with a Diploma ranges from $1,300 to $2,720. 
              <br> <br> A teacher with a basic academic degree can command a starting pay of at
              least $2,100 and those with good Honours academic degree can expect to
              start at a higher salary.
              <br> <br> Non-early childhood working experience will also be factored into the starting salary.
              <br> <br>The PCF also wants its teachers to continue learning by making
              scholarships and subsidies available to them to encourage them to
              upgrade their skills.
              <br> <br> By 2013, PCF aims to equip 95% of its teachers with a professional diploma and at least 25% of them with a degree.
              <br> <br> The PCF also wants to encourage its principals to upgrade themselves, and in the long term, have all of them possess a degree.
