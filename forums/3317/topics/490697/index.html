              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Singaporeans must work together to shape their future: PM Lee<br><br></strong></span></p>
              <p>SINGAPORE: The future of Singapore depends on what Singaporeans make of it together, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said on Sunday (Nov 29).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He was speaking at the launch of the Future of Us exhibition, which offers a glimpse into what living in Singapore could be like in 2030.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"What will our future be like? That's what the Future of Us exhibition is about. It's up to each one of us to voice our hopes and future dreams. To make the choices to realise these dreams. To help one another and work as Team Singapore, to shape our own destiny so that we can build our own Singapore that's inclusive, diverse but united," Mr Lee said.<br></p>
              <p>To that end, the Government is kicking off the SGfuture citizen engagement series. The initiative will be led by ministers Grace Fu and Chan Chun Sing, and will provide Singaporeans with a platform to come together to share their views, aspirations and ideas for the future through discussions and dialogue sessions. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The initiative builds on the nationwide Our Singapore Conversation, the largest feedback-gathering exercise in the nation’s history, which involvedinvolving more than 660 dialogue sessions where Singaporeans discussed their views on Government policies.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Mr Lee said he hoped Singaporeans will help shape their collective future through the engagement series.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"I hope you will step forward to work with fellow Singaporeans to shape our future – the Future of Us," he said. "So that by SG 100, we will have another celebration as happy and satisfying as this."<br></p>
              <p>Mr Lee added: "Fifty years from now, our children can come back and tell their grandchildren: It was here they caught a glimpse of what they could create for the future, and we were moved to turn dreams into reality and to write the next chapter of the Singapore story.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>“And that is why after SG50, Singapore continued to be an endearing and shining little red dot for many more years to come."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Future of Us exhibition runs from Dec 1 to Mar 8. It will be the last major event to round up the nation's SG50 celebrations. More than 85 per cent of tickets for December have been snapped up.</p>
