              <p><span>SINGAPORE: International news agency, Al Jazeera, has been taken 
              to task for not checking its facts in its report on the homeless in 
              Singapore. </span></p>
              <p><span>Speaking in Parliament on Tuesday, Community Development, Youth 
              and Sports Minister Vivian Balakrishnan stressed that homelessness is a 
              complex problem and that the government will continue to enable people 
              to be self-reliant.
              <br> <br> A video titled "Government Policies Force Some Onto The Streets" was 
              produced by Al Jazeera.
              <br> <br> It featured a couple camping on the beach, claiming that they had been 
              homeless for nearly two years as a result of divorce proceedings. 
              <br> <br> The government then made some checks and found a different story.
              <br> <br> The man in the video had made a tidy sum of over S$220,000 from the sale
               of three flats. Meanwhile, the woman still owns an HDB resale flat with
               her ex-husband.
              <br> <br> She was also getting financial help from the South West Community 
              Development Council.
              <br> <br> Dr Balakrishnan said: "Despite these circumstances, the social workers 
              and the FSC then offered sheltered housing for this couple. However, the
               couple rejected the offer and other services offered by MCYS. 
              <br> <br> “This is a clear example where a foreign media has failed to ascertain 
              the facts. Some irresponsible websites have also caused these falsehoods
               to circulate widely on the internet. Now that the facts are out, let us
               see whether those who have been propagating these falsehoods have the 
              courage and the honesty to set the record straight.
              <br> <br> "Homelessness or potential homelessness is a universal threat all over 
              the world. The question is how best to fix this. 
              <br> <br> “In Singapore, we have given housing, cheap affordable rental housing as
               well as heavily-subsidised first-time entry into home ownership. 
              <br> <br> “The people we have who insist on staying in beaches and parks are not 
              first timers and not people who have bought their first flat or first 
              rental flat. These are people who have almost always sold their second 
              flat or a third flat, have unfortunately dissipated the subsidies and 
              cashed them and now have run into problems. 
              <br> <br> “Members would have faced this problem which almost become emotional 
              blackmail."
              <br> <br> Meanwhile, Al Jazeera has ceased to operate its channel on mio TV.
              <br> <br> This prompted Nominated MP Viswa Sadasivan to ask about the talk that 
              this is linked to the report on the homeless.
              <br> <br> Acting Minister for Information, Communication and the Arts, Lui Tuck 
              Yew, said: “On the speculation that recent critical or negative reports 
              by Al Jazeera were the reason why the channel was taken off mio TV 
              service, this is unfounded. In a report by TODAY, Al Jazeera itself was 
              quoted as saying that "it was a 'mutual' decision between Al Jazeera and
               SingTel for the broadcaster to drop out of the latter's pay TV 
              service."
              <br> <br> Mr Lui noted that Al Jazeera's contract with SingTel was coming to an 
              end and was looking into other distribution avenues in view of its low 
              subscriber households. </span></p>
