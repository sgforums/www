               his 'soccer star' dreams and face reality. He made his own bed, and he 
              should rightfully lie in it.'</p>
              <p>Some even suggested Aliff resign and try a different profession. 
              Vincent Ong asked: 'Aliff, time to hang up your boots for good? Try your
               speeding skills on the F1 pro circuit.'</p>
              <p>Bennie Tay chided: 'Shame on you for even considering getting others 
              to pay for your crime! Spend the extra 53 days inside and do some soul 
              searching.'</p>

              <p>Tell him suck thumb, go sit inside prison and earn money like everyone else once he leave prison - the hard way.</p>
              <p>What a nice way to blow a $4K+ salary by drinking and driving just before a game...the sad thing is most of the national team have this mentality. Go to pubs/clubs and drink before the game, lost and then wonder why the punishment is so harsh.</p>
              <p>What a disgrace, local footballers from the old era earn little, but have more discipline than these wannabes pretending like they are rockstar's of the football world.</p>

              <p>those people in charge of s-league shd shoot themselves and die la. When we were in msia cup, we had the local semi-pro leagues. Remember thyrwitt soccerites? hehe. Then singapore's fifa ranking was around 100. Today it's still the same.</p>
              <p>The notion that going professional would raise our standards. I used to support s-league but then i finally realised it's an ass-league. We should at least be competing in asian cups regularly but we are still languishing. I think one problem that has to be addressed is the mentality. Look at the league, 99.9% are malays. Where are the chinese? We need to draw from a bigger pool of talent. Drawing from the malays is as good as picking from a population of 800,000 people. Then in this case, we are no better than fiji or dominican republic whose populations are even smaller.</p>
              <p>Long balls and long balls, that's all we can do to send the balls up front given the poor technique of local players.</p>
