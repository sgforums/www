              <p>Strange thing is he got money to drink but no money to pay the fine.</p>
              <p>From Stomp:</p>
              <p>After <a href="http://thecourtroom.stomp.com.sg/stomp/courtroom/case_of_the_day/518784/sleauge_player_jailed_fined_for_driving_offences.html">pleading guilty to his traffic offences</a>, 28-year-old Aliff Shafaein was slapped with a jail term and a $10,500 fine yesterday.<br><br>His
               new term with the football club was also initially withdrawn a month 
              ago. However, it seems the club will now offer him a second chance in 
              addition to helping him with his fine.</p>
              <p>"For the Tampines Rovers (TR) to even consider helping Aliff settle his 
              fines, that would highlight concerns about the sources of its revenue to
               begin with.<br><br>"Some of which may be partly NSA funding by the SSC,
               and hence raises the question of justifiability since NSA funding is 
              strictly for training, development, competition outlays, and certainly 
              not for bail-outs.</p>
              <p>"Should there be future accidents involving Aliff's drink driving again, will the victims get a second chance too?</p>

              <p><em>Tampines Rovers vice-captain Aliff Shafaein (in yellow),

              <p>Embattled S-League star Aliff Shafein has told his lawyer he hopes 
                  “ardent fans” would come forward to help him settle $10,500 in fines.</p>
              <p>The former vice-captain of S-League team Tampines Rovers is currently
                   awaiting jail after being sentenced to a three-week jail term on 
                  Tuesday following an offence in 2006 for driving without a valid 
                  licence.</p>
              <p>The 28-year-old midfielder has also been ordered to pay a fine of 
                  S$10,500 on ten other charges by a district court, or serve another 48 
                  days in jail, reported <em>The Straits Times</em>.</p>
              <p>District Judge Salina Ishak also sentenced him to an additional five 
                  days in jail after he only paid S$100 of a S$1,400 fine imposed in 2006.</p>
              <p>According to the same paper, Aliff has told his lawyer he hopes his 
                  fans would come forward to help him settle his latest fines so that 
                  he avoid spending extra days in jail.</p>
              <p>The footballer is no stranger to traffic offences after being caught 
                  driving an off-peak car without a supplementary licence and without a 
                  valid driving licence and insurance coverage in July 2007. He was also 
                  caught parking illegally and driving without a licence one month later.</p>
              <p>Just last month, Aliff was involved in a <a href="http://sg.yfittopostblog.com/2010/11/16/s-league-footballer-arrested-over-car-crash/">traffic accident along Lentor Avenue</a>, just hours before he led his club, <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=tampines+rovers&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">Tampines Rovers</a>, in the Singapore Cup final.</p>
              <p>He was drink-driving and driving again unlicensed and uninsured. He 
                  also did not have the consent of the car owner. The Stags 
                  eventually lost the final 1-0.</p>
              <p>Aliff’s lawyer, Mohamed Muzammil Mohamed, told the court that 
                  although his client’s playing career would be endangered by a long jail 
                  sentence, Tampines Rovers were willing to give him a second chance 
                  provided he promises not to break the law again.</p>
              <p>But now it’s also been revealed that Tampines Rovers team manager 
                  Syed Faruk has helped Aliff settle about 50 traffic summonses over the 
                  past two years, amounting to about S$30,000.</p>

              <p>i think he shd receive 5 strokes of the cane for his frequent disregard of the law and another 3 strokes for his audacious request for fans to clean his shit.</p>

              <p>I think this sentence (from the Yahoo article) says it all:</p>
              <p><em>But now it’s also been revealed that Tampines Rovers team
                                      manager Syed Faruk has helped Aliff settle about 50 traffic
                                      summonses over the past two years, amounting to about S$30,000.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I guess he thinks that if his own boss can help him with $30,000 worth of summonses, then $10,500 from his fans is peanuts....</p>
              <p>He has shown that he needs his ass to be tossed into jail so as to cure him of this entitlement mentality....</p>
              <p>In the first place, how the flying fcuk do you accumulate saman worth $30k? It just goes to show that he was never a responsible driver to begin with.</p>
