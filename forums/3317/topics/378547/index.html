              <p>MANILA - The Philippines
              shifted its efforts on Sunday to sending relief in northern provinces
              devastated by floods and cut off by landslides as the death toll and
              damages from two typhoons this month rose to art least 530.</p>
              <p>Rescue
              teams, using shovels and their bare hands to avoid triggering more
              landslides, continued to search for bodies in the areas of northern
              Luzon island that remained isolated.</p>
              <p>"The most important thing
              is to open roads so we can send relief goods because we cannot hope to
              find alternate routes," Defence Secretary Gilberto Teodoro said in a TV
              interview.</p>
              <p>"We have a massive push using our assets -- the armed forces, coast guard, police, and the U.S. forces are in the north."</p>
              <p>U.S.
              troops holding military exercises nearby sent a C130 transport planer
              and three Chinook helicopters to help bring food and medicines to
              Baguio City in mountainous Benguet province, 250 kms north of the
              capital and nearby areas cut off by landslides.</p>
              <p>"As of now,
              food and relief materials can only be delivered by helicopters because
              it will take 2-5 days to clear up roads and bridges washed out by
              floods and landslides," said Lieutenant-Colonel Ernesto Torres,
              spokesman for the national disaster agency.</p>
              <p>Lieutenant-Colonel
              Romeo Brawner, army spokesman said: "We are now slowly diverting our
              attention from rescue operations to disaster relief operations."</p>
              <p>BOULDERS BLOCKING ROADS</p>
              <p>Olive
              Luces, head of the civil defence office in the northern Cordillera
              region said the main access roads to Baguio City were still cut off by
              landslides, with boulders twice as high as commuter vans blocking the
              winding highway snaking through the mountains.</p>
              <p>The latest
              report of the national disaster agency placed the death toll from
              Typhoon Parma, which hit the Philippines a week ago, at 193, including
              134 from Benguet province alone.</p>
              <p>But Luces said at least 152
              died in Benguet, with 25 deaths in the nearby Mt. Province not included
              in the official report by the national headquarters.</p>
              <p>Initial
              estimates of damage from the two storms on production of rice, the
              country's staple, was estimated at 478,000 tonnes, equivalent to 7
              percent of the forecast harvest of 6.5 million tonnes in the fourth
              quarter, Jesus Emmanuel Paras, Agriculture undersecretary, said on
              Saturday.</p>
              <p>Manila, the world's biggest rice buyer, is
              considering importing rice to augment its supply for 2010 after the
              typhoon damage, with Vietnam and Thailand eager to provide the grain.</p>
              <p>Teodoro
              said total damage to crops and infrastructure from the two storms
              amounted to at least 15 billion pesos , with the Philippines now
              rushing a 10 billion peso additional budget for 2009 to fund
              rehabilitation efforts.</p>
              <p>Besides setting off landslides in the
              mountains, rains, dumped by Typhoon Parma have swollen rivers and
              reservoirs, forcing dams used for hydropower and irrigation to release
              water and causing more flooding in areas downstream.</p>
              <p>Parma
              first hit the Philippines on October 3 and hovered around the northern
              part of the main Luzon island throughout the week before weakening and
              moving out to sea.</p>
              <p>The floods and mudslides came two weeks
              after another storm, Ketsana, inundated areas in and around the capital
              Manila, killing 337 people and forcing half a million from their homes.</p>
