              <p><strong>Govt does not decide characteristics of Singapore's markets: SM Goh</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : Singapore's wet markets are not utilising land in the
              best possible way, especially in land-scarce Singapore, says Senior
              Minister Goh Chok Tong. </span></p>
              <p><span>He added that it is something to look into in the longer term.
              <br> <br> Mr Goh was at the official opening of the new S$18.2 million Geylang Serai Market on Sunday.
              <br> <br> The new Geylang Serai Market has an increased seating capacity with 365 wider stalls.
              <br> <br> The Malay community likes the Geylang Serai Market because all the products and foodstuff sold here are "halal".
              <br> <br> Mr Goh said: "But that does not mean that the market can be designated
              as a 'halal' market because this is a public market with funds from the
              government and public. It is not a private market. And it is a common
              space for all Singaporeans. <br> <br> "So as a public common space, it cannot be designated as a 'halal'
              market , because then other communities will demand a Buddhist market,
              a Christian market...that is not possible.
              <br> <br>"But I personally favour the ability of the market to retain this
              character of the Geylang Serai Market, and selling mostly 'halal' food,
              maybe even all 'halal' food. But this is left to market forces. <br> <br> "If you want to open a non-halal stall over here, the demand for your
              item may not be there. Why not consider elsewhere? But it is for them
              to decide, not for the government to designate. Any tender must be open
              to everybody."
              <br> <br>With several new blocks springing up around the Geylang Serai
              Market, Senior Minister Goh emphasised that it is important for the
              market stalls to cater to the needs of all races. So the kinds of
              stalls being set up in the Geylang Serai Market will be very much left
              to market forces to decide. <br> <br> Mr Goh noted that there would be more Chinese and several Indian families staying in these new blocks.
              <br> <br> He said: "There are a few new blocks which of course will be
              multi-racial in character, and there will be more Chinese staying in
              the new blocks. So the question I ask is, where will the Chinese
              population and Indian population go to shop?"
              <br> <br>Mr Goh said that if a stall becomes available in the Geylang Serai
              Market, some stall holder may want to cater to the non-Muslims in the
              area.
              <br> <br>He said: "There is a supermarket in the Joo Chiat Complex and the
              supermarket was set up to cater to the needs of non-Malays. And there
              is the Marine Parade market nearby. The Chinese can go there and buy
              other foodstuff. <br> <br> "So again, we leave it to the market forces. So long as the non-Muslims
              needs are met in the area, then we should be able to retain the
              traditional character of the Geylang Serai Market."
              <br> <br>While Mr Goh believes there is a need to look into the amount of
              space wet markets utilise, some Singaporeans will still prefer heading
              to wet markets rather than supermarkets, because many still want to
              touch and feel the items before buying them.
              <br> <br>Mr Goh said: "Why is it popular, because all of us are
              traditionalists, we are brought up to go to wet markets, we are able to
              poke at the fish, touch the fruits before you buy them and check with
              the stall holders. You go to the supermarket, you are unable to check
              and bargain; here we can do all sorts of things." </span></p>
