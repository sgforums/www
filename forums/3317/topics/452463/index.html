              <p>SINGAPORE - Singapore has to decide, going forward, whether it 
              aims to be a "Jurong Island" or a "Shenton Way", said retired top civil 
              servant Ngiam Tong Dow at a forum yesterday.</p>
              <p>Pitting the two models against each other and as metaphors of 
              "wealth creators" and "wealth managers", Mr Ngiam expressed concern that
               Singapore might be nurturing more of the latter, at the expense of the 
              former.</p>
              <p>"I believe that, while many Singaporeans are competent in our jobs, few 
              among us are brilliant," said Mr Ngiam, the former Ministry of Finance 
              permanent secretary, who is now Pro-Chancellor at the National 
              University of Singapore.<br><br> What would differentiate the 
              wealth creator from a wealth manager, he felt, would include attributes 
              such as tremendous reserves of energy, the ability to think out of the 
              box and "seeing possibilities where others can only see rocks".<br><br> Speaking to a group of around 250 engineering students, academics 
              and industry representatives at NUS Engineering Auditorium, Mr Ngiam was
               asked during the one-hour dialogue why Singapore could not possess both
               wealth creators and wealth managers. He replied that a job in the 
              technology sector has got more multiplier effects than one in the 
              services sector.<br><br> "Even if you take banking and wealth 
              management, there's no reason why people should come to Singapore to 
              manage their funds. It can be in the middle of the Indian Ocean with a 
              computer. The barriers to entry are very low," said Mr Ngiam.<br><br> Lauding the late Dr Goh Keng Swee's contribution to the wealth 
              creation of Singapore, Mr Ngiam noted how Dr Goh, who was Defence 
              Minister, had established Sheng-Li Holdings to build up Singapore's 
              defence technology. Sheng-Li was later renamed Singapore Technologies 
              (ST) Holdings.<br><br> Under Dr Goh, Mr Ngiam said that ST 
              engineers refurbished fighter aircraft and built battle tanks, which 
              were comparable to others internationally.<br><br> "After Dr Goh 
              retired from the Government in 1986, there is no one to replace him as 
              our wealth creator," he added. "The Government of Singapore Investment 
              Corporation and Temasek (Holdings) are sovereign wealth managers for our
               national savings and reserves. They are not wealth creators."<br><br> Temasek in particular, Mr Ngiam felt, is supposed to be a wealth creator, but are just being "fund managers".<br><br> Going forward, Mr Ngiam said the direction Singapore takes will 
              have an impact on its political, economic, educational and labour 
              policies. <br><br> Asked what Singapore can do now to nurture 
              wealth creation, Nr Ngiam said: "The engineering faculty should be given
               more resources." Later, he suggested that the Government could provide 
              funding for university final year students of any discipline to start 
              their business aspirations. <br><br> "At the end of the day, if 10 per cent succeed out of 100, there will be 10 future companies," said Mr Ngiam.</p>
