              <h1>Inside a global cybercrime ring</h1>
              <p><span id="articleText"><span class="focusParagraph">
              </span></span></p><p>(Reuters) - 
              Hundreds of computer geeks, most of them students putting themselves 
              through college, crammed into three floors of an office building in an 
              industrial section of Ukraine's capital Kiev, churning out code at a 
              frenzied pace. They were creating some of the world's most pernicious, 
              and profitable, computer viruses.</p>
              
              <p class="relatedTopics"><a href="http://www.reuters.com/news/media"></a></p>
              <p>According to court documents, former 
              employees and investigators, a receptionist greeted visitors at the door
               of the company, known as Innovative Marketing Ukraine. Communications 
              cables lay jumbled on the floor and a small coffee maker sat on the desk
               of one worker.</p>
              <p>As business boomed,
               the firm added a human resources department, hired an internal IT staff
               and built a call center to dissuade its victims from seeking credit 
              card refunds. Employees were treated to catered holiday parties and 
              picnics with paintball competitions.</p>
              <p>Top
               performers got bonuses as young workers turned a blind eye to the harm 
              the software was doing. "When you are just 20, you don't think a lot 
              about ethics," said Maxim, a former Innovative Marketing programer who 
              now works for a Kiev bank and asked that only his first name be used for
               this story. "I had a good salary and I know that most employees also 
              had pretty good salaries."</p>
              <p>In a 
              rare victory in the battle against cybercrime, the company closed down 
              last year after the U.S. Federal Trade Commission filed a lawsuit 
              seeking its disbandment in U.S. federal court.</p>
              <p>An examination of the FTC's complaint and 
              documents from a legal dispute among Innovative executives offer a rare 
              glimpse into a dark, expanding -- and highly profitable -- corner of the
               internet.</p>
              <p>Innovative Marketing 
              Ukraine, or IMU, was at the center of a complex underground corporate 
              empire with operations stretching from Eastern Europe to Bahrain; from 
              India and Singapore to the United States. A researcher with anti-virus 
              software maker McAfee Inc who spent months studying the company's 
              operations estimates that the business generated revenue of about $180 
              million in 2008, selling programs in at least two dozen countries. "They
               turned compromised machines into cash," said the researcher, Dirk 
              Kollberg.</p>
              <p>The company built its 
              wealth pioneering scareware -- programs that pretend to scan a computer 
              for viruses, and then tell the user that their machine is infected. The 
              goal is to persuade the victim to voluntarily hand over their credit 
              card information, paying $50 to $80 to "clean" their PC.</p>
              <p>Scareware, also known as rogueware or fake 
              antivirus software, has become one of the fastest-growing, and most 
              prevalent, types of internet fraud. Software maker Panda Security 
              estimates that each month some 35 million PCs worldwide, or 3.5 percent 
              of all computers, are infected with these malicious programs, putting 
              more than $400 million a year in the hands of cybercriminals. "When you 
              include cost incurred by consumers replacing computers or repairing, the
               total damages figure is much, much larger than the out of pocket 
              figure," said Ethan Arenson, an attorney with the Federal Trade 
              Commission who helps direct the agency's efforts to fight cybercrime.</p>
              <p>Groups like Innovative Marketing build the 
              viruses and collect the money but leave the work of distributing their 
              merchandise to outside hackers. Once infected, the machines become 
              virtually impossible to operate. The scareware also removes legitimate 
              anti-virus software from vendors including Symantec Corp, McAfee and 
              Trend Micro Inc, leaving PCs vulnerable to other attacks.</p>
              <p>When victims pay the fee, the virus appears
               to vanish, but in some cases the machine is then infiltrated by other 
              malicious programs. Hackers often sell the victim's credit card 
              credentials to the highest bidder.</p>
              <p>Removing
               scareware is a top revenue generator for Geek Choice, a PC repair 
              company with about two dozen outlets in the United States. The outfit 
              charges $100 to $150 to clean infected machines, a service that accounts
               for about 30 percent of all calls. Geek Choice CEO Lucas Brunelle said 
              that scareware attacks have picked up over the past few months as the 
              software has become increasingly sophisticated. "There are more advanced
               strains that are resistant to a lot of anti-virus software," Brunelle 
              said.</p>
              <p>Anti-virus software makers 
              have also gotten into the lucrative business of cleaning PCs, charging 
              for those services even when their products fall down on the job.</p>
              <p>Charlotte Vlastelica, a homemaker in State
               College, Pennsylvania, was running a version of Symantec's Norton 
              anti-virus software when her PC was attacked by Antispyware 2010. "These
               pop-ups were constant," she said. "They were layered one on top of the 
              other. You couldn't do anything."</p>
              <p>So
               she called Norton for help and was referred to the company's technical 
              support division. The fee for removing Antispyware 2010 was $100. A 
              frustrated Vlastelica vented: "You totally missed the virus and now 
              you're going to charge us $100 to fix it?"</p>
              <p>AN
               INDUSTRY PIONEER</p>
              <p>"It's sort of a 
              plague," said Kent Woerner, a network administrator for a public school 
              district in Beloit, Kansas, some 5,500 miles away from Innovative 
              Marketing's offices in Kiev. He ran into one of its products, Advanced 
              Cleaner, when a teacher called to report that pornographic photos were 
              popping up on a student's screen. A message falsely claimed the images 
              were stored on the school's computer.</p>
              <p>"When
               I have a sixth-grader seeing that kind of garbage, that's offensive," 
              said Woerner. He fixed the machine by deleting all data from the hard 
              drive and installing a fresh copy of Windows. All stored data was lost.</p>
              <p>Stephen Layton, who knows his way around 
              technology, ended up junking his PC, losing a week's worth of data that 
              he had yet to back up from his hard drive, after an attack from an 
              Innovative Marketing program dubbed Windows XP Antivirus. The president 
              of a home-based software company in Stevensville, Maryland, Layton says 
              he is unsure how he contracted the malware.</p>
              <p>But
               he was certain of its deleterious effect. "I work eight-to-12 hours a 
              day," he said. "You lose a week of that and you're ready to jump off the
               roof."</p>
              <p>Layton and Woerner are 
              among more than 1,000 people who complained to the U.S. Federal Trade 
              Commission about Innovative Marketing's software, prompting an 
              investigation that lasted more than a year and the federal lawsuit that 
              sought to shut them down. To date the government has only succeeded in 
              retrieving $117,000 by settling its charges against one of the 
              defendants in the suit, James Reno, of Amelia, Ohio, who ran a customer 
              support center in Cincinnati. He could not be reached for comment.</p>
              <p>"These guys were the innovators and the 
              biggest players (in scareware) for a long time," said Arenson, who 
              headed up the FTC's investigation of Innovative Marketing.</p>
              <p>Innovative's roots date back to 2002, 
              according to an account by one of its top executives, Marc D'Souza, a 
              Canadian, who described the company's operations in-depth in a 2008 
              legal dispute in Toronto with its founders over claims that he embezzled
               millions of dollars from the firm. The other key executives were a 
              British man and a naturalized U.S. citizen of Indian origin.</p>
              <p>According to D'Souza's account, Innovative 
              Marketing was set up as an internet company whose early products 
              included pirated music and pornography downloads and illicit sales of 
              the impotence drug Viagra. It also sold gray market versions of 
              anti-virus software from Symantec and McAfee, but got out of the 
              business in 2003 under pressure from those companies.</p>
              <p>It tried building its own anti-virus 
              software, dubbed Computershield, but the product didn't work. That 
              didn't dissuade the firm from peddling the software amid the hysteria 
              over MyDoom, a parasitic "worm" that attacked millions of PCs in what 
              was then the biggest email virus attack to date. Innovative Marketing 
              aggressively promoted the product over the internet, bringing in monthly
               profits of more than $1 million, according to D'Souza.</p>
              <p>The company next started developing a type 
              of malicious software known as adware that hackers install on PCs, where
               they served up pop-up ads for travel services, pornography, discounted 
              drugs and other products, including its flawed antivirus software. They 
              spread that adware by recruiting hackers whom they called "affiliates" 
              to install it on PCs.</p>
              <p>"Most 
              affiliates installed the adware product on end-users' computers 
              illegally through the use of browser hijacking and other nefarious 
              methods," according to D'Souza. He said that Innovative Marketing paid 
              its affiliates 10 cents per hijacked PC, but generated average returns 
              of $2 to $5 for each of those machines through the sale of software and 
              products promoted through the adware.</p>
              <p>ANY
               MEANS BUT SPAM</p>
              <p>The affiliate 
              system has since blossomed. Hackers looking for a piece of the action 
              can link up with scareware companies through anonymous internet chat 
              rooms. They are paid through electronic wire services such as Western 
              Union, Pay Pal and Webmoney which can protect the identity of both the 
              sender and the recipient.</p>
              <p>To get 
              started, a hacker needs to register as an affiliate on an underground 
              website and download a virus file that is coded with his or her 
              affiliate ID. Then it's off to races.</p>
              <p>"You
               can install it by any means, except spam," says one affiliate 
              recruiting site, earning4u.com, which pays $6 to $180 for every 1,000 
              PCs infected with its software. PCs in the United States earn a higher 
              rate than ones in Asia.</p>
              <p>Affiliates
               load the software onto the machines by a variety of methods, including 
              hijacking legitimate websites, setting up corrupt sites for the purposes
               of spreading viruses and attacks over social networking sites such as 
              Facebook and Twitter.</p>
              <p>"Anybody can 
              get infected by going to a legitimate website," said Uri Rivner, an 
              executive with RSA, one of the world's top computer security companies.</p>
              <p>A scareware vendor distributed its goods 
              one September weekend via The New York Times' website by inserting a 
              single rogue advertisement. The hacker paid NYTimes.com to run the ad, 
              which was disguised as one for the internet phone company Vonage. It 
              contaminated PCs of an unknown number of readers, according to an 
              account of the incident published in The New York Times.</p>
              <p>Patrik Runald, a senior researcher at 
              internet security firm Websense Inc, expects rogueware vendors to get 
              more aggressive with marketing. "We're going to see them invest more 
              money in that -- buying legitimate ad space," he said.</p>
              <p>To draw victims to infected websites, 
              hackers will also manipulate Google's search engine to get their sites 
              to come up on the top of anyone's search in a particular subject. For 
              instance, they might capitalize on news events of wide interest -- from 
              the winners of the Oscars to the Tiger Woods scandal -- quickly setting 
              up sites to attract relevant search times. Anti-virus maker Panda 
              Security last year observed one scareware peddler set up some 1 million 
              web pages that infected people searching for Ford auto parts with a 
              program dubbed MSAntispyware2009. They also snare victims by sending 
              their links through Facebook and Twitter.</p>
              <p>Some
               rogue vendors manage their partnerships with hackers through software 
              that tracks who installed the virus that generated a sale. Hackers are 
              paid well for their efforts, garnering commissions ranging from 50 to 90
               percent, according to Panda Security. SecureWorks, another security 
              firm, estimates that a hacker who gets 1 to 2 percent of users of 
              infected machines to purchase the software can pull in over $5 million a
               year in commissions.</p>
              <p>Hackers in 
              some Eastern European countries barely attempt to conceal their 
              activities.</p>
              <p>Panda Security found 
              photos of a party in March 2008 that it said affiliate ring KlikVIP held
               in Montenegro to reward scareware installers. One showed a briefcase 
              full of euros that would go to the top performer. "They weren't afraid 
              of the legal implications, " said Panda Security researcher Sean-Paul 
              Correll. "They were fearless."</p>
              <p>BANKING</p>
              <p>One of Innovative Marketing's biggest 
              problems was the high proportion of victims who complained to their 
              credit card companies and obtained refunds on their purchases. That hurt
               the relationships with its merchant banks that processed those 
              transactions, forcing it to switch from banks in Canada to Bahrain. It 
              created subsidiaries designed to hide its identity.</p>
              <p>In 2005, Bank of Bahrain &amp; Kuwait 
              severed its ties with an Innovative Marketing subsidiary that had the 
              highest volume of credit card processing of any entity in Bahrain 
              because of its high chargeback rates, according to D'Souza.</p>
              <p>Innovative Marketing then went five months 
              without a credit card processor before finding a bank in Singapore -- 
              DBS Bank -- willing to handle its account. The Singapore bank processed 
              tens of millions of dollars in backlogged credit card payments for the 
              company, D'Souza said.</p>
              <p>To keep the
               chargeback rate from climbing even higher, Innovative Marketing 
              invested heavily in call centers. It opened facilities in Ukraine, India
               and the United States. The rogueware was designed to tell the users 
              that their PCs were working properly once the victim had paid for the 
              software, so when people called up to complain it wasn't working, agents
               would walk them through whatever steps it took to make those messages 
              come up.</p>
              <p>Often that required 
              disabling legitimate anti-virus software programs, according to McAfee 
              researcher Dirk Kollberg, who spent hours listening to digitized audio 
              recordings of customer service calls that Innovative Marketing kept on 
              its servers at its Ukraine offices. He gathered the data by tapping into
               a computer server at its branch in Kiev that he said was inadvertently 
              hooked up to Innovative's website. "At the end of the call," he said, 
              "most customers were happy."</p>
              <p>Police
               have had limited success in cracking down on the scareware industry. 
              Like Innovative Marketing, most rogue internet companies tend to be 
              based in countries where laws permit such activities or officials look 
              the other way.</p>
              <p>Law enforcement 
              agencies in the United States, Western Europe, Japan and Singapore are 
              the most aggressive in prosecuting internet crimes and helping officials
               in other countries pursue such cases, said Mark Rasch, former head of 
              the computer crimes unit at the U.S. Department of Justice. "In the rest
               of the world, it's hit or miss," he said. "The cooperation is getting 
              better, but the level of crime continues to increase and continues to 
              outpace the level of cooperation."</p>
              <p>The
               FTC succeeded in persuading a U.S. federal judge to order Innovative 
              Marketing and two individuals associated with it to pay $163 million it 
              had scammed from Americans. Neither individual has surfaced since the 
              government filed its original suit more than a year ago. But Ethan 
              Arenson, the FTC attorney who handled the case, warned: "Collection 
              efforts are just getting underway."</p>

              <p>So yea, the best anti-virus application this year is still Common Sense 2010. The insurance, medical and paid anti-malware industries all have one thing in common - they feed on people's fears, and it's definitely one big lucrative business to profit from. You can even build a whole new business based on fear alone. I mean, how many times have you bought something not because you need it but because you were afraid of the potential consequences of not having it?</p>
