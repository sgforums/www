              <p>The first problem to hit was housing for the influx. No plan was
                  made to house them. So they rent out unsold  HDB flats to the
                  construction companies. Until the heartlanders complain. Then the
                  build domitories.</p>
              <p>Then the transport system. The transport system, trains and
                  buses, was based on studies of the <strong>local population centres
                  and travel pattern</strong>. The almost 1 million foreigners were
                  not factored into the calculations. That was a fatal error that
                  caused the system to fail.</p>
              <p>When such a large number of people come in in a short space of
                  time, the infrastructure has to be ready.</p>

              <p>look at the street directory and look at the LRT lines for a start. the routes are so simple that i don;t really see a need to pump so much money to build tracks and get LRT trains for that. the direct routes buses can cover already! with adding traoins and tracks to the simple routes, its= adds redundant manpower (most goes to foreigners), costs to maintaining the trains, tracks etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>if really need to build they rather build a special platform or road cornered off just for buese to use only, like raised express way. in this way the trains breaking down causing major disruption to traffic is almost zero percentage, and no fear of greater damages from terrorist attacks. no traffic lights on these expressways and people can always get to work on time between stops or stations, lower maintainance costs and the transport gahmen can really concentrate on ssomething else <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>the problem with train systems is the more complex system and track maintain, resulting in high costs, advantage being if things run smoothly no traffic lights fast appraoch. buses advantage is lower matainance, disadvanatge is teh congessted highly unpredictable traffic.</p>
              <p>merge the 2 systems and offset their own disadavantages. build seprated raised roads for buses only - remove traffic lights and traffic congestion problem - smooth travel froms tation to station or depot to depot since the raised road tracks now is direct, no traffic lights and smoooth, just like mart without the trains, tracks etc.</p>

              <p>frequency of buses on these tracks can be increased. please remove the buses with only a few sits and buidl buses with more seats. these rasied road ways can also let our ambulance and emergency vehicles use.</p>
