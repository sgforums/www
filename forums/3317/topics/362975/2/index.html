              <p>To induce the long hair cat to cough up the hair balls add veg about every fortnight. Many pet food contains too much calcium and esp the male coon will die from the choke in the bladder. That's what the lumps are. Initial signs are weak hind legs, follows by some blood in pee.</p>

              <div class="image"><img title="Suicide bombers strike Pakistan mosque, seminary" src="http://o.aolcdn.com/dims-hkg/dims/INTL/1/300/225/90/http://sg-portal-origin.web.aol.com/image-files/ap/2009/06/eeb1fd59-3067-4b9f-8f3b-55c051a66ca8@news.ap.jpg" alt="Suicide bombers strike Pakistan mosque, seminary"></div>
              </div>
              <div class="body">
              <p>Suicide bombers attacked a mosque and a religious school within minutes 
              Friday in two Pakistani cities, leaving one of the country's most prominent 
              anti-Taliban clerics dead in what authorities called a targeted killing.</p>
              <p>No one immediately claimed responsibility for either blast, but relatives of 
              Sarfraz Naeemi said he had received death threats recently after condemning 
              suicide attacks as un-Islamic and the Taliban as murderers.</p>
              <p>Pakistan has been rocked by a wave of bombings and other attacks in recent 
              weeks blamed on militants taking revenge for a military operation against the 
              Taliban in the Swat Valley region. More than 100 people have been killed since 
              May 27, and places of worship have been targeted three times since last 
              Friday.</p>
              <p>The government has vowed to rid the country of militants, and it has been 
              emboldened by broad support for the Swat campaign from a public that has started 
              openly denouncing the militants after years of ambivalence.</p>
              <p>After the blast that killed Naeemi, hundreds of outraged seminary students 
              gathered at the scene and demanded the Taliban leave Pakistan. "Down with the 
              Taliban!" they shouted.</p>
              <p>The campaign has intensified pressure on the militants in strongholds they 
              have established in the religiously ultra-conservative northwest on the border 
              with Afghanistan.</p>
              <p>Police official Sohail Sukhera said at least one assailant entered the 
              offices of the Jamia Naeemia seminary in the heart of Lahore shortly after the 
              end of traditional Friday prayers and detonated a bomb powerful enough to 
              collapse the building. Five people died and three were wounded.</p>
              <p>Naeemi was the apparent target of the attack and died on his way to a 
              hospital, said his son, Waqar.</p>
              <p>"I was still in the mosque when I heard a big bang. We rushed toward the 
              office and there was a smell of explosives in the air. There was blood and 
              several people were crying in pain," Waqar said.</p>
              <p>Television footage showed Naeemi's body lying on a stretcher, his beard and 
              hair covered in dust and blood stains around his nostrils.</p>
              <p>Naeemi had recently led dozens of moderate clerics in meetings and lectures 
              in which he denounced suicide attacks _ a common tactic of Pakistan's Islamist 
              groups _ and supported the military's operation to oust the Taliban from 
              Swat.</p>
              <p>A leading moderate, he advocated equal access to education for women and the 
              use of computers in schools _ ideas sharply at odds with the Taliban's harsh 
              interpretation of Islam.</p>
              <p>Naeemi's brother Mohammad Tajwar said the cleric had recently received death 
              threats but had refused the offer of police protection.</p>
              <p>The attack was quickly condemned as un-Islamic.</p>
              <p>"A true Muslim even cannot think of such activity," said Mufti Muneebur 
              Rehman, a senior moderate cleric and Naeemi's friend.</p>
              <p>"He was someone who would never speak the language of bullets, and targeting 
              such a soft person is a brutal act," said Hamid Saeed Kazmi, Pakistan's minister 
              for religious affairs. "Those who have done it have not served Islam. They are 
              not Muslims. They are the enemies of Islam and enemies of Pakistan."</p>
              <p>Punjab provincial Law Minister Rana Sanaullah blamed terrorists from the 
              tribal areas and Swat for Friday's attacks.</p>
              <p>In the second attack around the same time Friday, a pickup truck loaded with 
              explosives was rammed into the wall of a mosque in an area where soldiers live 
              in Noshehra, a small city in the northwest, police official Aziz Khan said. At 
              least four people died and more than 100 were wounded, he said.</p>
              <p>Militants were blamed for a suicide attack a week earlier on a mosque in 
              Upper Dir that killed at least 30 people. That blast prompted local villagers to 
              form a civilian militia that has chased and killed several militants since.</p>
              <p>Washington strongly backs the Swat operation, which is widely viewed as a 
              test of Pakistan's resolve to confront militancy after years of deals and 
              policies criticized as being too soft on the militants.</p>
              <p>Fierce fighting continued in Swat on Friday, the military said, where troops 
              captured Chuprial town in a major battle that killed 39 militants and 8 
              soldiers. It was the highest death toll in a single day's fighting in the 
              offensive, which began in late April and which the army says it is close to 
              winning.</p>
              <p>Elsewhere Friday, gunmen in Peshawar attacked the home of Lt. Gen. Masood 
              Aslam, the army commander of the Swat offensive, leaving him uninjured but two 
              militants dead; and military jets began bombarding suspected militant 
              strongholds in the tribal region of Bajur. Casualties were not immediately known 
              there.</p>
              <p>In another tribal region, Hangu, suspected militants detonated a roadside 
              bomb that killed the regional police chief and four other officers, said Farid 
              Khan, a police official.</p>
              <p>In Peshawar late Thursday, one officer was killed and a dozen other people 
              were wounded in a grenade and suicide bomb attack at a police checkpoint.</p>
