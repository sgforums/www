              <p>February 24th, 2013 |  Author: Online Press</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>(19 Feb) – Sreenesh Thaikkodathil Sreedharan, wanted for the murder of a trader, flew to Tiruchy airport from Singapore to escape notice. He even chucked his passport into a toilet dustbin aboard, but city police were ready and waiting</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Air India Express flight from Singapore touched Tiruchirappalli Airport on Friday and Sreenesh Thaikkodathil Sreedharan, wanted in a murder case, thought freedom was a walk out of the airport. He chucked his passport (G2803624) in a toilet bin aboard the aircraft so that there wouldn’t be a whiff of his identity. However, he hadn’t bargained for a wily Bangalore police lying in wait for him and walked right into their trap a la a Hollywood crime thriller.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Wanted for the cold-blooded murder of a cosmetics trader at Hotel Pai Viceroy on J C Road (see box), 30-year-old Sreedharan, a native of Calicut, had fled to Malaysia before settling down in Singapore. However, he soon ran into trouble in Singapore for overstaying on a tourist visa. But, he produced a work permit and sought the court’s permission to stay on. The court asked him to go back to India and return on the work visa.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Bangalore police, meanwhile, wasn’t exactly napping on the job. They had managed to track down his girlfriend, a call centre employee working in Whitefield. They put her under surveillance and learnt about the visa problem. They took his girlfriend into confidence and when he told her that he did not have money to buy an air ticket, police arranged a ticket for him and mailed it through her.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To escape from a lookout circular issued against him, Sreedharan insisted on landing at the lesser known Tiruchirappalli airport in Tamil Nadu, confident that he could give authorities the slip. However, police was not letting him escape this time. Unknown to him, they sent a person to Singapore to fly back with him on the same aircraft without his knowledge. And a team of police officers waited for him at the airport.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sensing that things could go wrong at the immigration counter, Sreedharan dumped his passport in the toilet dustbin. When asked to produce his passport, he told immigration authorities that he may have misplaced it in Singapore after the immigration check. When Bangalore police tried to take him into custody, he pretended that he was not the person they were looking for. However, Bangalore police, who were sure of his identity, told immigration authorities to check the aircraft he had arrived in.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A message was sent to the flight captain. As the flight was about to take off to Chennai, immigration authorities ran across the runway to stop the flight. Flight crew checked the passengers’ seat and toilet and found a passport chucked in the toilet dustbin. They handed it over to immigration authorities. The passport details tallied with the lookout notice issued against him. He was taken into custody and brought to Bangalore under maximum security.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The entire operation was supervised by joint commissioner of police, crime (west) Pronab Mohanthy who had earlier worked in the CBI and assistant commissioner of police G B Kowri.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Police commissioner B G Jyothiprakash Mirji rewarded the policemen who were part of the operation during a press conference on Monday.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Oh!  TCH bo chor gang!</p>

              <p>you see the problem comes from inida side. when they puit a name of a person on wanted list, all airports in indian should have know if this and ther eshould be no way for this guy toespcape. unless he escape tomalaysia before his inditiy and crimes were known.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>so no matter what  the so call india polcie follow up do, its useless theya re perceived as not effective already. all wanted criminals names should be constatly updated around the india polie and airports. it should be done in real time since now internet and digital age - no excuse.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>now comes malaysia and our part.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>howwell are we and our interpol working on infomration sharing?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>should india know that tis criminal somehow escaped adn fled overseas, they should immediately noitified the counttry/ countries this guy fled to. they should have notified malaysia. then malaysia shhould have put this guy as wanted man across all airports and ferry stations.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>their problem now becum our problem. so if anyone sway sway flal victim to this guy who to blame? can we blame india?</p>

              <p><br>you know what is the problem with our immigration i suspect or not.</p>
              <p>you cum singapore on social visit pass. when you oversaty, our police dont bother to check their system concurrently acorss to see who oversated. very easy one, people cum in all scan their passed, it will have a date of entry. when times up and that guy never renew or exit, our computers can put him on the wanted list already. when you are wanted police can look and should look for you.</p>
              <p>so many oversaty i bet polcie also dont botehr or do not bother to send investigators to check t=these overstayers out. they just wait for them to try means to escape then get caught. if dont get caught either still insingapore somwhere or fled already. if still in the island its ee who the people here sway keena be a victim when these oversatyers srtike.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>so we sway lor!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>have so many polcie officers driving here and tehre, might as well constantly have raids more offend or have a group of people to query into where this people went.</p>

              Sorry, I think you are out of touch with the real world, do u really think our MOM/ICA do a proper check.  If they really do it, I think they will find out that there are ton of FT with fake degree.
