              <p>AN AUXILIARY police officer, found dead with a gunshot wound to his 
              head in a toilet in Jurong in 2010, had harboured thoughts of ending his
               life prematurely, a coroner inquiry heard on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>Investigations into the death revealed that Aetos police constable 
              Lee Kong Beng, 39, owed nearly $40,000 in phone bills, bank loans and 
              furniture purchases.</p>
              <p>About two weeks before the shooting, he confided in a friend that his
               financial burden was so heavy he wanted to 'pop' himself. The other man
               advised the officer against shooting himself. Mr Lee, who is married 
              with a son, had been working with security firm Aetos since May 2008.</p>
              <p>Colleagues said that he appeared normal during his shift at 
              the Tuas checkpoint from 12.30am to 3pm on May 31 2010. But while 
              standing in a line to return weapons to the armoury in the Aetos office 
              in Corporation Road, he was heard to have muttered, 'I cannot take it 
              any more', before heading to the toilet.</p>
              <p>Moments later, a shot rang out. He was found lying face-up 
              on the floor of a toilet cubicle. Blood was pouring from a head wound 
              and his service revolver, a 0.38 Smith &amp; Wesson, was clutched in his
               left hand. On the suicide note found on him, he had scrawled that he 
              was sorry for what he had done. 'By doing so, I will no longer bring 
              further burden and suffering to myself,' he wrote.</p>
              <p>In his findings, State Coroner Victor Yeo said that Mr Lee -
               who had expressed suicidal intentions - died of a self-inflicted 
              gunshot. Although investigations did not reveal why Mr Lee was in debt, 
              earlier newspaper reports indicated that he was an avid football punter.</p>
