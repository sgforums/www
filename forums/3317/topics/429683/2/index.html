              <p>Sylvia Lim consoles voters: PITY FOR GEORGE YEO IS UNNECESSARY<br><br>In the second Worker's Party (WP) rally held on 29 April 2011, WP Chairperson Ms<br>Sylvia Lim urges her audience that feeling sorry for the current foreign<br>minister Mr George Yeo is unwarranted. Retired foreign ministers are always<br>accorded ambassadorial positions that garner almost the same type of wages and<br>privileges that incumbent ministers enjoy. Good examples are Mr Thommy Koh and<br>Mr David Marshall.<br><br>She also consoled voters that many incumbents and even opposition members have<br>the capability to manage Singapore's foreign affairs and shake hands with<br>foreign dignitaries. So even if George Yeo retires early, someone capable will<br>step up to take his place.  So not to worry because Singapore will continue its<br>friendly relations with all countries.<br><br>Her ended her speech with a classic statement:<br><br>Don't think of voting for Worker's Party as voting against George Yeo.<br>Think of it as helping him into early retirement.</p>

Retired foreign ministers are always<br>accorded ambassadorial positions that garner almost the same type of wages and<br>privileges that incumbent ministers enjoy. Good examples are Mr Thommy Koh and<br>Mr David Marshall.<br><br>She also consoled voters that many incumbents and even opposition members have<br>the capability to manage Singapore's foreign affairs and shake hands with<br>foreign dignitaries. So even if George Yeo retires early, someone capable will<br>step up to take his place.  So not to worry because Singapore will continue its<br>friendly relations with all countries.<br><br>Her ended her speech with a classic statement:<br><br>Don't think of voting for Worker's Party as voting against George Yeo.<br>Think of it as helping him into early retirement.</p>

              <p>How democratic do you think George Yeo really is? Here's a Straits Times report from 1995:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><span style="font-size: 9pt;"><strong>Debate yes, but do not take those in authority as ‘equals’<br> </strong>The Straits Times (Singapore) 20 Feb 1995 at p 11<br> </span></span><span style="font-family: Gill Sans;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><br> </span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">Remember your place in society before you engage in political debate, said Information and the Arts Minister George Yeo yesterday.<br> </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><br> </span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">Debate cannot degenerate into a free-for-all where no distinction is made between the senior and junior party, or what the Hokkiens describe as ‘boh tua, boh suay’.<br> </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><br> </span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">You must make distinctions—what is high, what is low, what is above, what is below—and then within this, we can have a debate, we can have a discussion, he added.<br> </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><br> </span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">Speaking to reporters … on the parameters of debate, an issue sparked off by the Catherine Lim controversy, he made it clear that people should not take on those in authority as ‘equals’. The Prime Minister responded to writer Catherine Lim for her article on his governing style because her tone showed disrespect for authority.<br> </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><br> </span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">Brig-Gen (NS) Yeo recalled that in 1991, the National Trades Union Congress raised a rumpus when Straits Times columnist Sumiko Tan criticised then union-MP Goh Chee Wee for his speech in Parliament. <br> </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><br> </span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">Mr Goh felt that Miss Tan was ‘wagging her finger at him’, he said. Likewise, during last year’s Budget debate, Parliament took issue with ST columnist Cherian George for his comments on the Speaker’s handling of the guillotine. ‘He had no right to speak to the Speaker as an equal.’<br> </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><br> </span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">Pointing to a more recent example, he noted that the judiciary responded when American academic Christopher Lingle took ‘pot shots’ at it in an article he wrote in the International Herald Tribune. He added: ‘This is not to say that MPs, ministers, Speakers or judges cannot be criticised … They ought to be criticised if they are wrong but it should always be done in a way which doesn’t tear the social fabric.’<br> </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><br> </span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">He said that these individuals did not arrogate to themselves the right to receive respect: MPs were elected while judges were appointed in a solemn ceremony.<br> </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><br> </span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">Turning to examples abroad, he said the British monarchy had fallen into disrepute because newspapers cirticise the royals to increase circulation. But the Thais threw those who criticise the royals into prison.<br> </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><br> </span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">‘Every society creates immune systems to defend its own key organs and we must have the immune system in Singapore. Otherwise, by slow increments, we allow these organs to be infected and degraded. And that is not good for us, it is not good for the health of whole society.’</span></span></p>

              <p>I am saddened by all your remarks about PAP.  What we are today is all the work of PAP.  First World, most liveable city.  The Opposition are just here harping the domestic issues which are happening all over the world and which Singapore is in a better position than in most countries.  They are stirring up people's emotions.  Would you rather ministers are paid well and we have good and safe government - a little red dot in the map and we have billions of dollars on reserves -  or would you rather change Presidents every few years and the country is in deep shit. The Presidents are mostly there for the money and are corrupted, so they suck the money out and then exit.  Money in their pockets.  Other countries can afford mistakes because they have resources, Singapore has zero resources, we can't afford big mistakes. Even the most powerful nation in the world who has presidency run for 2 terms, ie 8 years and then change hands.  They have trillions of dollars in debt.  What the opposition never say is how to attract investments.  With investments, jobs will be there.  China is now coming up with proficiency in English and soon investors will go to China for manufacturing, as well as logistics and infrastructure. We need to attract more investments.  Investors are watching us. If Singapore prove to be unstable with too many "mouths", they pull back.  Tell me, what is there to fight after this?  All go back to kampong days lah.  Opposition!! what are your plans for Singapore to expand trade and industry?  PAP are doing all they can for Singaporeans, can't please everyone. We are much better off than in most countries.  GST, North America as high as 15%.  Property tax in North America very high.  We pay up to 30 years loan, my sister in the US, pays US$500 a month on property tax for life?  Which is better?  Don't harp on domestic issues Opposition, think for the country how to stay competitive against China and India.</p>
              <p>Dear voters, I urge you all to consider hard when voting for Opposition.  If everyone thinks alike and there is freak election, all go chaos - GAME OVER FOR SINGAPORE!!!  I am sure PAP will definitely look after us in the long run better than the Opposition. So don't rock the boat.  For me, PAP is the way to prosper and live in a safe haven.  So vote wisely.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Firstly, who fly to China and plant the idea of opening up China to Mr Deng Xiaopeng to compete with Singapore in the beginning ? </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"> I can still remember what is the encouragement phrase " If Singapore can do it, China also can".  But he forgot China has many more natural resources than Singapore.

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Secondly, i second the opposition party suggestion of retaining the former PAP ministers as NMP to help Singapore.  If they are still willing to be NMP without the million dollar to bring Singapore forward out of love for their country.  Will they ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If there is still such a PAP mp, i will salute the person too. For willing to stay back as a NMP to help the opposition party to run Singapore.</span></p>
