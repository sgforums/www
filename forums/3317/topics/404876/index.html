              <p>STOMPer <strong>Unhappy Customer</strong> was disgusted with the 
              Citibank Credit Card staff who called him incessantly and demanded for 
              his documents by a certain time, even insisting that he apply for ready 
              credit after the STOMPer refused. <br><br>Unhappy Customer shared his 
              woes with STOMP in an email:<br><br>"After my previous application for a
               credit card was not followed-up properly and declined as a result, a 
              Citibank credit card staff called me up to insist that I submit a whole 
              new application all over again. <br><br>"He wanted the necessary 
              documents by a specific time but due to work commitments, I was unable 
              to email him on time. <br><br>"He ended up calling me and pestering me 
              for my documents umpteen times! <br><br>"Worst of all, he insisted that I
               take up ready credit in a forceful tone, claiming I could cancel after 
              the free period. <br><br>"When I turned him down, he sounded fed up. <br><br>"I
               was deeply disgusted with the level of service by this company." <br><br>Upon
               reading Unhappy Customer's account, STOMPer <strong>Vettel Webber</strong> recalled his similarly bad encounter with Citibank staff:<br><br>"After
               getting a CitiClear card, I started to receive calls from Citibank 
              telemarketers despite many reminders to put me on the 'Do Not Call' 
              list.<br><br>"This one telemarketer called Benjamin persuaded me to sign
               up for a Citibank savings account, and even arranged for a dispatch to 
              come to my office for me to sign the documents needed to open the 
              account.<br><br>"The nightmare started after I signed the form. Benjamin
               called me numerous times saying that he did not receive the photocopy 
              of my IC.<br><br>"After he called for the fourth time, I was so pissed 
              off that I offered to go down to a Citibank branch to submit a photocopy
               myself.<br><br>"To my amazement, he advised me not to do that because 
              it would be 'troublesome' and the staff are generally rude and 
              inattentive. He also added that there is 'a high chance that the 
              photocopy would be lost' and that I may get into trouble with 
              loansharks.<br><br>"Eventually, he said he received my photocopy but 
              because it was 'too dark and not visible', I had to fax it over again.<br><br>"What
               happened to all the previous photocopies of my IC? He never answered 
              that.<br><br>"When I did not sign up for the account, Benjamin's final 
              words to me were 'If I rely on your account for my commission, I would 
              be a million steps away from my million dollar dream.'<br><br>"I never 
              expected such poor attitude."</p>
