              <p><strong><span class="newsTitle">Men more likely to speed, women likely to use phones while driving</span></strong></p>
              <p>Men are more likely to speed.</p>
              <p>They're also likely not to stop when the traffic light turns amber.</p>
              <p>Women are more inclined to use their mobile phones while driving.</p>
              <p>These are some findings from survey conducted by AXA Insurance on some 500 motorists in Singapore.</p>
              <p><em>Lin Jiamei</em> with more.</p>
              <p>Among the dangerous driving habits, speeding, driving through an amber traffic light and tail-gating came up tops.</p>
              <p>Men are found to be more likely to go over the speed limit while
              women, true to the popular belief about their multi tasking ability,
              are found to be more inclined to use their phones behind the wheel.</p>
              <p>Men are also more likely to drive after drinking; about 11 per cent
              said they would do so , compared to 1 per cent for the women.</p>
              <p>The survey also found that young parents with kids below the age of
              12 are more likely to engage in dangerous driving behaviour, such as
              speeding, driving without a seat belt and overtaking without signaling.</p>
              <p>CEO of AXA , Henri Gurs.</p>
              <p>" Sometimes when you have young kids you have to pay attention to
              what they are doing behind, be it whether they are crying or shouting
              so this would likely have an impact on your attention when driving. "</p>
              <p>The top three deterrent against these bad driving habits --- demerit points, speed cameras and more traffic police on the road.</p>
              <p>Safety concerns, as AXA found, is a lesser deterrent.</p>
              <p>The survey also found that a majority of motorists have no clue to
              the 50 kmh speed limit on regular roads, though they do know the limit
              of 90 kmh on highways.</p>
              <p>The month long survey which was conducted in February this year,
              aims to find out more about the attitudes and perception of motorists
              in Singapore.</p>
              <p>The company has conducted similar polls in Europe and it will carry
              out a few more of such surveys here before deciding if the results
              would have any impact on its motor insurance policies.</p>
              <p>Mr Gurs again.</p>
              <p>" In Europe after analyzing all the survey results, we found that
              drinking which is a very bad habit, has an effect on the claims. That
              is why we have introduced a special benefit in Europe, where if you are
              a young person drinking too much at a party, we will pay for the taxi
              for you to return home instead of driving, so it is really after a
              survey of this sort that we have modified the benefits of the contract.
