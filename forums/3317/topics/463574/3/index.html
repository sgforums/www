              <div class="articleHeadline"><strong>Body of India rape victim arrives home in New Delhi</strong></div>
              <div class="articleHeadline"><br></div>
              <div class="articleHeadline">NEW DELHI - The body of a woman whose gang rape provoked protests and 
              rare national debate about violence against women in India arrived back 
              in New Delhi in the early hours of this morning.<br><br> The 
              unidentified 23-year-old medical student died from her injuries 
              yesterday, prompting promises of action from a government that has 
              struggled to respond to public outrage.<br><br> She had suffered 
              brain injuries and massive internal damage in the attack on Dec 16, and 
              died in hospital in Singapore where she had been taken for treatment.<br><br> She and a male friend had been returning home from the cinema, 
              media reports say, when six men on a bus beat them with metal rods and 
              repeatedly raped the woman. The friend survived.<br><br> Six suspects were charged with murder after her death.<br><br> A Reuters correspondent saw family members who had been with her 
              in Singapore take her body back to their Delhi home in an ambulance with
               a police escort.<br><br> Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's 
              convoy was at the airport when the plane landed and left soon 
              afterwards, the witness said.<br><br> The outcry over the attack 
              caught the government off-guard. It took a week for Singh to make a 
              statement, infuriating many protesters.<br><br> Issues such as rape, dowry-related deaths and female infanticide rarely enter mainstream political discourse in India.<br><br> Analysts say the death of the woman dubbed "Amanat", an Urdu word 
              meaning "treasure", by some Indian media could change that, although it 
              is too early to say whether the protesters calling for government action
               to better safeguard women can sustain their momentum through to 
              national elections due in 2014.<br><br> Protesters have staged 
              peaceful demonstrations in the capital New Delhi and in cities across 
              India in the last few days to keep the pressure on Mr Singh's government
               to get tougher on crimes against women. Last weekend protesters fought 
              pitched battles with police.<br><br> Authorities, worried about the
               reaction to the news of her death yesterday, deployed thousands of 
              policemen, closed 10 metro stations and banned vehicles from some main 
              roads in central New Delhi.<br><br> Most sex crimes in India go 
              unreported, many offenders go unpunished, and the wheels of justice turn
               slowly, according to social activists, who say that successive 
              governments have done little to ensure the safety of women.<br><br> Commentators and sociologists say the rape has tapped into a deep well 
              of frustration many Indians feel over what they see as weak governance 
              and poor leadership on social issues.<br><br> New Delhi has the 
              highest number of sex crimes among India's major cities, with a rape 
              reported on average every 18 hours, according to police figures. 
              Government data show the number of reported rape cases in India rose by 
              nearly 17 per cent between 2007 and 2011. REUTERS</div>

              <p><br>the solution is very simple. they have good many people protesting. they have to keep on protesting. for 1 million people to protest, maybe 0.5 million take first shift while the remaider 0.5 million take the second shift. protest until gahmen give in.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the nest rape happen, protest again, protest day and night and if have to take the laws into their own hands. kill gahmen officials. kill the criminals families, fight fire with fire, force the gahmen if not force the gahmen to step down. the next one cannot do it again, force him down until the law change.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #808080; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; line-height: 12px;">By </span><span style="color: #808080; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; line-height: 12px;"><span>SONIA FALEIRO</span></span></p>
              <div><span style="font-family: georgia, 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 15.333333015441895px; line-height: 22px;">I LIVED for 24 years in New Delhi, a city where sexual harassment is as regular as mealtime. Every day, somewhere in the city, it crosses the line into rape.</span></div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>
              <p style="font-size: 1.5em; line-height: 1.467em; font-family: georgia, 'times new roman', times, serif;">As a teenager, I learned to protect myself. I never stood alone if I could help it, and I walked quickly, crossing my arms over my chest, refusing to make eye contact or smile. I cleaved through crowds shoulder-first, and avoided leaving the house after dark except in a private car. At an age when young women elsewhere were experimenting with daring new looks, I wore clothes that were two sizes too large. I still cannot dress attractively without feeling that I am endangering myself.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.5em; line-height: 1.467em; font-family: georgia, 'times new roman', times, serif;">Things didn’t change when I became an adult. Pepper spray wasn’t available, and my friends, all of them middle- or upper-middle-class like me, carried safety pins or other makeshift weapons to and from their universities and jobs. One carried a knife, and insisted I do the same. I refused; some days I was so full of anger I would have used it — or, worse, had it used on me.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.5em; line-height: 1.467em; font-family: georgia, 'times new roman', times, serif;">The steady thrum of whistles, catcalls, hisses, sexual innuendos and open threats continued. Packs of men dawdled on the street, and singing Hindi film songs, rich with double entendres, was how they communicated. To make their demands clear, they would thrust their pelvises at female passers-by.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.5em; line-height: 1.467em; font-family: georgia, 'times new roman', times, serif;">If only it was just public spaces that were unsafe. In my office at a prominent newsmagazine, at the doctor’s office, even at a house party — I couldn’t escape the intimidation.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.5em; line-height: 1.467em; font-family: georgia, 'times new roman', times, serif;">On Dec. 16, as the world now knows, a 23-year-old woman and a male friend were returning home after watching the movie “Life of Pi” at a mall in southwest Delhi. After they boarded what seemed to be a passenger bus, the six men inside <a style="color: #666699; text-decoration: underline;" href="http://india.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/18/outrage-in-delhi-after-latest-gang-rape-case/">gang-raped and tortured</a> the woman so brutally that her intestines were destroyed. The bus service had been a ruse. The attackers also severely beat up the woman’s friend and threw them from the vehicle, leaving her to die.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.5em; line-height: 1.467em; font-family: georgia, 'times new roman', times, serif;">The young woman didn’t oblige. She had started that evening watching a film about a survivor, and must have been determined to survive herself. Then she produced another miracle. In Delhi, a city habituated to the debasement of women, tens of thousands of people took to the streets and faced down police officers, tear gas and water cannons to express their outrage. It was the most vocal protest against sexual assault and rape in India to date, and it set off nationwide demonstrations.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.5em; line-height: 1.467em; font-family: georgia, 'times new roman', times, serif;">To protect her privacy the victim’s name was not released publicly. But while she remains nameless, she did not remain faceless. To see her face, women had only to look in the mirror. The full measure of their vulnerability was finally understood.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.5em; line-height: 1.467em; font-family: georgia, 'times new roman', times, serif;">When I was 26, I moved to Mumbai. A commercial and financial megalopolis, it has its own special set of problems, but has, culturally, been more cosmopolitan and liberal than Delhi. Giddy with my new freedom, I started to report from the red-light district and traveled across rough suburbs late at night — on my own and using public transit. It seemed that something good had come out of living in Delhi: I was so grateful for the comparatively safe environment of Mumbai that I took full advantage of it.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.5em; line-height: 1.467em; font-family: georgia, 'times new roman', times, serif;">The young woman, however, will never have such an opportunity. On Saturday morning, 13 days after she was brutalized, this student of physical therapy, who had, no doubt, dreamt of improving lives, lost her own. She died of multiple organ failure.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.5em; line-height: 1.467em; font-family: georgia, 'times new roman', times, serif;">India has laws against rape; seats reserved for women in buses, female officers; special police help lines. But these measures have been ineffective in the face of a patriarchal and misogynistic culture. It is a culture that believes that the worst aspect of rape is the defilement of the victim, who will no longer be able to find a man to marry her — and that the solution is to marry the rapist.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.5em; line-height: 1.467em; font-family: georgia, 'times new roman', times, serif;">These beliefs aren’t restricted to living rooms, but are expressed openly. In the months before the gang rape, some prominent politicians had attributed <a style="color: #666699; text-decoration: underline;" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/28/world/asia/a-village-rape-shatters-a-family-and-indias-traditional-silence.html">rising rape statistics</a> to women’s increasing use of cellphones and going out at night. “Just because India achieved freedom at midnight does not mean that women can venture out after dark,”<a style="color: #666699; text-decoration: underline;" href="http://www.indiatimes.com/india/7-sexist-remarks-why-our-politicians-should-be-ashamed-51643.html">said</a> Botsa Satyanarayana, the Congress Party leader in the state of Andhra Pradesh.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.5em; line-height: 1.467em; font-family: georgia, 'times new roman', times, serif;">Change is possible, but the police must document reports of rape and sexual assault, and investigations and court cases have to be fast-tracked and not left to linger for years. Of the more than 600 rape cases reported in Delhi in 2012, <a style="color: #666699; text-decoration: underline;" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/31/world/asia/rape-incites-women-to-fight-culture-in-india.html">only one led to a conviction</a>. If victims believe they will receive justice, they will be more willing to speak up. If potential rapists fear the consequences of their actions, they will not pluck women off the streets with impunity.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.5em; line-height: 1.467em; font-family: georgia, 'times new roman', times, serif;">The volume of protests in public and in the media has made clear that the attack was a turning point. The unspeakable truth is that the young woman attacked on Dec. 16 was more fortunate than many rape victims. She was among the <a style="color: #666699; text-decoration: underline;" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/30/world/asia/weak-response-of-india-government-in-rape-case-stokes-rage.html">very few to receive anything close to justice</a>. She was hospitalized, her statement was recorded and within days all six of the suspected rapists were caught and, now, <a style="color: #666699; text-decoration: underline;" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/30/world/asia/india-rape-delhi.html">charged with murder</a>. Such efficiency is unheard-of in India.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.5em; line-height: 1.467em; font-family: georgia, 'times new roman', times, serif;">In retrospect it wasn’t the brutality of the attack on the young woman that made her tragedy unusual; it was that an attack had, at last, elicited a response.</p>

              <p style="font-family: Georgia; line-height: 21px;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">In the United Kingdom 400,000 women are sexually assaulted and 80,000 are raped each year (2010/2011).  </span></span></strong>These statistics do not include rape victims who are male, whose aggressors are both male and female. </p>
              <p style="font-family: Georgia; line-height: 21px;"> The population of the United Kingdom is 20 times smaller of India’s population.  </p>
              <p style="font-family: Georgia; line-height: 21px;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Yet living in the UK and reading its media, one could easily think that rape solely existed in India and that there is only injustice against women in the subcontinent and other ‘developing countries.’ </span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="font-family: Georgia; line-height: 21px;"> During the past week I have had many conversations with friends and colleagues about the twenty-three-year-old rape victim, now nick-named ‘Damani’ (lighting in Hindi). A few of these discussions have proven to be productive terrains for analysing rape as a social problem in the world today.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Georgia; line-height: 21px;">However the majority of these discussions have served as cathartic moments for the Westerner to express her disdain for those ‘other countries that do not respect women’s rights’ while proclaiming her own country’s superiority in this area.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Georgia; line-height: 21px;">Facebook comments as well have replicated this neo-colonial gaze towards other countries and in recent days India has been rendered a monolith in human rights abuses; yet the country in which I am currently living has aided my own country (the USA) to amass over 1,000,000 Iraqi, Afghani and Pakistani deaths. (Of course, nothing is mentioned about these women’s rights to live in these countries.) </p>
              <p style="font-family: Georgia; line-height: 21px;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">As such, I am gravely concerned by the focus placed by Westerners upon rape outside of their own borders since rape is not a problem unique to India.</span></span></strong>  Violence against women is a global problem that needs to be discussed honestly and without pigeon-holing certain cultures as more culpable.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Georgia; line-height: 21px;">Certainly women’s rights is an issue to be addressed from society to society and there are often nuances of difference from country to country regarding  womans’ roles–both perceived and real–within each culture.  </p>
              <p style="font-family: Georgia; line-height: 21px;">Yet, it is also true that these discussions can only happen candidly from within each society.  As the good people of India march in the thousands on the streets demanding reforms for women’s and girls’ rights–from the problems of female foeticide to educational access to personal safety on the streets of Delhi–it is imperative that we take Damani’s rape as a call to analyse rape and women’s rights here in the United Kingdom.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Georgia; line-height: 21px;">For while we can make comparisons between societies from the UK to India, this does not change the fact that Facebook is now rampant with postings from women here who use Damani’s tragic story to proselytise about the ‘evils of’ other countries far far away, citing that rape occurs every 20 minutes in India and ‘Let’s not forget Africa. And let’s not forget the women who are raped in warfare.’  The imperative here, of course, is that ‘we’ understand that it is worse ‘over there’. </p>
              <p style="font-family: Georgia; line-height: 21px;">Honestly, I am most uncomfortable with such arrogant brush strokes of judgement, especially made by people whose knowledge of India (or ‘Africa’ for that matter) is often limited to the media or at best, several months spent in ashram, yoga courses in Rishikesh, various beach hangouts in Goa and/or the ‘volunteer’ stints with NGOs which are riddled with all the appurtenances of Orientalism.  (And I will not delve here into my thoughts on the vulgar classification of independent African nations under the nomenclature of this monolith ‘Africa’ with zero differentiation made between societies and clearly no knowledge of the actual countries’ names and unique histories and cultures.) </p>
              <p style="font-family: Georgia; line-height: 21px;"> What is clear to me is that  years after the lesson’s of Fanon’s Black Skin, White Masks and Memmi’s <a style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #cf1028;" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0807003018/counterpunchmaga">The Colonizer and the Colonized</a> is that in the West we learned very little from the colonial heritage which implores the other to resemble us, to mimic our cultures as we perceive them to be superior.  Memmi writes:<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">  “The first ambition of the colonized is to become equal to that splendid (European) and to resemble him to the point of disappearing in him.” </span></strong></p>
              <p style="font-family: Georgia; line-height: 21px;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> Yet the inverse is also true: that the European expects this disappearance to occur because she sees herself and her culture as far superior to the other and the other’s culture. </span></span></strong> Hence Western subjects seem drawn to take up the case of ‘women’s rights’ each and every time a travesty is mediatised (not that they don’t happen daily here and abroad) in order to cathect a personal issue onto the world terrain of human atrocity.  The neo-colonial era of  burqa from 2001 is now transformed to the rape victim of 2012 who elusively escapes all media critique back home.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Georgia; line-height: 21px;">Yet, if we are to play the statistics game, we might as well do it properly and analyse not the rapes that occurs every 34 minutes in the United Kingdom, but the per capita offences per 100,000 which reveal a quite different statistical field of information.   As recorded by the police registries of each country rape offences in India show 1.8 rapes for every 100,000 versus 28.8 rapes reported for every 100,000 in the United Kingdom.  Of course we could then analyse what percentage of rapes are actually reported and deconstruct the pool and statistical methods, etc.  My point here is to underscore the importance in understanding that these figures are simply terrible when it comes to speaking comparatively for women’s rights in the world today–be it London or Delhi.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Georgia; line-height: 21px;">In one of my discussions this week about rape, one of my interlocutors questioned me about my experiences living in India and other countries outside Europe and North America asking me if I encountered ‘problems’ while traveling.  I was quite honest and spoke of an attack I suffered last Spring on a bus in Karnataka, India, where a man insisted on sitting next to me on a bus that was 60% empty.  Given that I had ridden next to groper on the way to the temple, a one hour journey, I decided to inform the man that the empty seat next to me was for women or children only. He immediately started to hit my head and as I put my arms up to protect myself from this drunken human, I was rather shocked that nobody on the bus did anything to help me.  I likewise noted to the women who asked if I experienced ‘problems’ that I had experienced the greatest aggressions as a woman while living in the West.  For instance, in Montreal, Quebec when 8 months pregnant I was physically assaulted by a man for ‘standing too close to [him]’ in a queue for a public telephone and while seven months pregnant I was not only run over by a drunk driver but to this day I am still fighting for the SPVM (Montreal Police) and the province of Quebec to proceed with an investigation.  I was also told minutes after being hit by the car, when trying to press for charges against this drunk driver this: “Madame, you are not hurt enough.”  A month later while asking for a report to be drawn up I was told: “Madame, because of your pregnancy hormones you probably imagined being hit by a car.”  And quite recently in London, I was stalked and harassed by my landlord during my first two weeks of living in my flat; yet it took weeks of lobbying the Metropolitan Police Service of Tottenham to take seriously the gravity of the threat.  Apparently this man’s presence in my life as a landlord was considered a civil issue despite his persistent attempts to enter my flat daily and sending 18 pages of SMS in three days with references to his mental instability (ie. ‘I am losing my mind’).  Clearly women’s rights are not as fixed in the West as some of my interlocutors would like to believe and I simply could not claim that I had suffered greater threats to my person as a woman in India, Algeria, or Mexico any more I have suffered as a woman in Canada or the United Kingdom.<br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Yet in some of these discussions, I felt pressured to jump onto what I refer to as the ‘burqa bandwagon,’ a discursive space where Western women assert their societal superiority and their own country’s excellence in legal jurisprudence.  Personally, I am not drawn to such dialectical arguments and neo-colonial spaces since progress is simply not a linear development that begins at A and ends with Z, nor is it a demarcation that can be made from across many oceans to societies that have very specific differences in how women interact with men and other women.  I am also far too aware of the media blackout that has surrounded the murders of women, children and men in the past eleven years in this ‘War on Terror’ in Afghanistan, Iraq and Pakistan perpetuated by ostensibly ‘enlightened’ and ‘democratic’ Western nations.  The innocent dead see none of this democracy.  Were we to examine honestly the place of rape in the global sphere, the UK and the US would have to shoulder a huge amount of blame for having rendered unstable these countries they have invaded and occupied lending a greater vulnerability to women and children specifically as the link between women’s rights and economic development and literacy is well documented.  As I have lived much of my life in various countries throughout Latin America, the Maghreb, the Middle East and in Asia, I have come to learn how societal inflections on the human experience do not reveal facile notions of oppressor/oppressed.  I have witnessed how the oppression of women is often effected–as it is here in the West as well–by other women and that hand in hand with oppression of women is the oppression of men, albeit an entirely different form of oppression.  Such discussions that polarise women against men and the ‘modern’ against the ‘backwards’ only end up reaffirming a certain Western superiority and linearity of thought which ends up reaffirming Western paradigms of power and predispositions for framing the ‘savage, misogynist culture of India’ as the backdrop for our paradisiacal projections of a fictionalised equality.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Georgia; line-height: 21px;">As war crimes in Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo have highlighted rape over the past fifteen years, so did the pervasive Bosnian ‘Rape Camps’ of the 1990s remind us of the power of rape as a weapon of control in conflict situations closer to home.  Yet, rape goes much further back than the US soldiers’ war crimes in Viet Nam of the 1960s and 1970s or the Nanking rapes by the Japanese forces in 1937. Rape is found throughout history as it is well documented and cannot simply be linked to x or y spot on the planet.  Moreover, media incursions into post 9/11 Afghanistan have highlighted the need to understand rape in a larger context wherein women are not the only victims: what was uncovered by many journalists post 9/11 is that boys and young men were also the victims of the Northern Alliance.  Likewise, revelations such as the Zimbabwe female gangs who have been raping male soldiers has recently come up again in media focus demonstrating the power of women to be sexually violent. When one Facebook poster writes about Damani, stating, “As long as there are men on this planet it will never end…,” I reminded her of the rape of men and the problems facing these men in terms of reporting the violence and of having these reports being taken seriously. The stigma for men to report rape today in any country is most humiliating as these men are basically told that it is impossible for them to physically be raped or that he should ‘consider himself fortunate.’  Recent research into the rape of men is revealing that there are far more male rape victims than previously estimated and that many of the perpetrators are women (most often mothers, aunts, nannies, etc).  In the United States of America 10% of all rape victims are men.  And in another rape case in India this week which has received far less Western media attention, a seventeen-year-old girl from northern Punjab committed suicide after being gang raped by men with the help of a female accomplice.  To demarcate rape as a unidirectional domain whereby only women are raped by men (or that only men can possibly be rapists) is a disservice to undertaking any honest discussion about rape today. Likewise, to discuss rape purely within the confines of ‘underdevelopment’ and ‘third-world nations’ is to diminish the reality of rape right here in the United Kingdom and other Western nations.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Georgia; line-height: 21px;">What is going on with the need for Western subjects to highlight Damani’s death as somehow endemic to India and other ‘third-world’ nations alone?  I suspect that there is something much deeper going on in this growing problem of armchair Facebook ‘advocacy’ which reveals myriad humans who click and ‘like’ an article about a truism.  For it is self-evident that a tortured puppy or a raped Indian medical student is ‘a bad thing’, yet these are the items of vast interest for people to idle away their days on Facebook.  There is a huge disconnect in my fellow Londoners who post about the travesty of Damani whilst espousing the superiority of their own culture.  On the one hand there is something incredibly violent about casually posting, sharing and liking an article about a rape without the deconstruction of similar events in our own political landscape.  On the other hand, this growing trend of armchair Facebook advocacy falsely simulates a political action–as if ‘liking’ or ‘sharing’ such articles is actually doing something other than objectify a rape and a death which is for Damani’s family and community alone to experience.  All the rest is cultural fetishism.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Georgia; line-height: 21px;">Let us learn from India and get off our computers to engage in real political dissent speaking against all forms of rape here and now.</p>
