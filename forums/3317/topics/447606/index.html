              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: A man who allegedly raped an Indonesian maid twice, 
              then tried to kill her by throwing her off the second-storey flat where 
              she works, has claimed trial.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Ravindran Annamalai, 44, also faces a trespassing charge and another of voluntarily causing hurt with a dangerous weapon.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The 26-year-old 
              victim survived the ordeal and took the stand on Monday on the first day
               of the trial in the High Court. She gave evidence in-camera, which 
              means the media and the public were not allowed in the courtroom.<br><br>No details that could lead to the identification of the victim can be published, the court also ordered.<br><br>According
               to the prosecution's opening statement, on the morning of Sept 9, 2009,
               there was a power trip in the maid's employers' home, and Ravindran 
              helped to restore the electricity supply to the flat.<br><br>Later that 
              afternoon, when the maid was alone at home, Ravindran was said to have 
              rung the doorbell and asked her if he could watch her have lunch. The 
              woman rejected him and shut the door on him.<br><br>Later in the 
              afternoon, there was another power trip. When the maid tried to get out 
              of the flat to reset the circuit box along the corridor, Ravindran 
              allegedly approached her and asked her what the problem was.<br><br>He then pushed her into the flat and shut the door, said prosecutors.<br><br>Deputy
               Public Prosecutor Charlene Tay Chia told the court the maid will 
              recount how she tried to escape but was caught by Ravindran.<br><br>The 
              maid screamed and struggled but could not overcome Ravindran, who 
              dragged her into the master bedroom and raped her, said Ms Chia.<br><br>He then allegedly dragged her by the hair into another bedroom and raped her again.<br><br>After
               that, Ravindran was said to have dragged her to the kitchen by the 
              hair, where he took a pair of scissors and placed them on her neck. He 
              also wound a raffia string around her neck to strangle her, the court 
              heard.<br><br>Ms Chia said the maid then lost consciousness. By the time she awoke, she was already on a hospital bed.<br><br>Ms Chia said a total of 49 witnesses would be called.<br><br>Among
               them were two police officers who arrived at the void deck of the block
               where the maid worked at around 2.40pm that day. They will testify that
               the maid was lying face up on the ground floor, covered with a piece of
               batik cloth, injured and groaning in pain. She also identified her 
              assailant to them.<br><br>Other police investigators will also be called
               to the stand to testify that the flat in which the maid worked was in a
               state of disarray.<br><br>Ms Chia said the prosecution would prove that
               the maid's account of the sequence of events matched the statements 
              given by Ravindran.<br><br>The trial, which has been fixed for six days, continues on Tuesday. </span></span></p>
