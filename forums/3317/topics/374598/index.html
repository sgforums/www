              <p><span>SINGAPORE: A family doctor has won an award for going the extra mile to be a good neighbour to others.
              <br> <br> Dr Kong Kum Leng, who runs a clinic at Marine Parade, was nominated by his neighbours for The Good Neighbour Award.
              <br> <br> It was presented by Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong at the Marine Parade Town Carnival on Sunday.
              <br> <br> Dr Kong may not be a resident of Marine Parade, but he has been the neighbourhood's doctor for 35 years.
              <br> <br> Since then, the 65-year-old has been a good listening ear to many residents there.
              <br> <br> This caring doctor also makes house calls for patients who can't make a visit to his clinic.
              <br> <br> He even provides medical services to those who are less fortunate at low cost or even for free.
              <br> <br> Dr Kong recalls a story of one of his patients.
              <br> <br> "There's a lady, she was very sick and she came to see me at about
              12:15pm before lunch. I talked to her and she started crying. I said,
              'Have you eaten your lunch?' She said, 'No, I have no money to eat.' So
              she opened her wallet to show me and I found that she had only $2 in
              her wallet. I said, 'Ma'am, you don't pay me. This is done on a very
              goodwill by me and there's no charge. With the $2 you go and have a
              simple bowl of noodles'."
              <br> <br> His graciousness is so well-known that his neighbours at Marine Parade nominated him for the Good Neighbour Award.
              <br> <br>One of them is 41-year-old Edmond Lim who has been a patient of Dr
              Kong for 10 years. He said: "He's a very down-to-earth person and a
              very warm physician. In fact I get to know him more when I was in
              grassroots, where he spent a lot of time and also efforts looking after
              my low-income residents in the rental blocks. He's been showing a lot
              of kindness towards the elderly as well as the less fortunate
              residents."
              <br> <br>The Good Neighbour Award aims to recognise residents who have shown
              acts of kindness and contributed in promoting graciousness, harmony and
              cohesion in the HDB community.
