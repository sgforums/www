              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Singapore youths generally have the same ideals as 
              that of the government, observed Emeritus Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong 
              at the end of a national conversation session at the Marine Parade 
              constituency.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Mr Goh said this will make it easier for the government to work together with the generation of the future.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>"Supposing they come
               up with very different ideals from what we think should be for the 
              prosperity and stability of Singapore. It's going to be very 
              troublesome," he said. <br><br>"Supposing they had all argued about 
              welfare state and so on, then that's very troublesome for us because we 
              know that without resources, without economic growth and so on, a 
              welfare state will lead us to ruins."<br><br>Some of the goals set by 
              participants during the conversation with Marine Parade residents 
              included a more cohesive society and more sustainable economic growth.<br><br>The 45 participants comprised youths and working adults.<br><br>Mr Goh felt that the society has, in recent years, been drifting without a clear sense of direction.<br><br>He added that having the same ideals does not mean goals can be reached if the society is divided. <br><br>Mr
               Goh said Singapore has never been more politically divided, so the 
              Singapore Conversation is a very serious effort to build a new compact 
              between the people and the government.<br><br>"The worry is as we 
              emphasise more freedom for the people, (society) becomes more 
              cosmopolitan, takes in more foreigners, immigrants and so on, (and) our 
              society begins to loosen as a result of these new trends," he said. <br><br>"The
               old (generation) is getting smaller in proportion. The young 
              (generation) is getting bigger, with different experiences... and if 
              they don't get a new sense of bonding in working as a group, can you 
              imagine how we move into the future?"<br><br>Mr Goh also pointed out 
              even though ideals may be similar, young Singaporeans may disagree with 
              the processes and priorities in policy-making.<br><br>Youths felt that 
              at this stage of the conversation, ideals that surface would naturally 
              be similar to the government. But they believed there is still space for
               disagreements.<br><br>"When the conversation is couched in very generic
               themes and terms, of course, we have the same broad general ideals and 
              there is a consensus," said Chris Lim, a participant at the session. <br><br>"But
               when the minute details of policies are discussed, that's when 
              differences will start to appear, in the ways of how we do it. This is a
               question that remains to be answered in the course of our national 
              conversation."<br><br>This is the first time Mr Goh has attended the national conversation session. <br><br>He has been conducting several community conversations with his residents at Marine Parade.<br><br>Mr Goh explained that these conversations were more unstructured, where residents could discuss policy issues.<br><br>Lawrence
               Wong, committee member of Our Singapore Conversation, said he is 
              satisfied with the progress and outreach, three months after the 
              initiative started.<br><br>Mr Wong was also present at the session in Marine Parade.<br><br>He
               said: "We've been trying to reach out to as broad spectrum of society 
              as possible, and I think we've had very good representation of people 
              who come enthusiastically to share, and we've got very good ideas. 
              There's certainly more that we can do."<br><br>Separately, at a session 
              of Our Singapore Conversation held with the Malay Muslim community at 
              Bukit Batok East, participants raised the issue of cultivating 
              patriotism in every Singaporean, especially the younger generation.<br><br>"What
               is important to me also is that they talk about patriotism, which is 
              something I did not find in the other conversations," said Minister of 
              State for Social and Family Development Halimah Yacob. <br><br>"In this 
              conversation, they say it is important within the context of building a 
              strong national identity, reinforcing multi-culturalism, 
              multi-racialism, that we are patriotic Singaporeans and how we continue 
              to project that."<br><br>- CNA/xq</span></span></p>

              <p>Typical neo liberal right wing garbage propaganda. No wonder the Socialist international kicked the PAP out. </p>
              <p>They sold out the left wing agenda long ago. This fake left wing party.</p>
              <p>If foreigner with money brings it to Singapore, give them the welfare state that they crave, don't tax and grab their money. Give them the welfare. </p>

              <p>But if Singaporean, every single cent also must suck it out from them. No welfare for them. More welfare programs means more government spending, higher budgets.</p>
              <p>Higher budget means more tax on rich. And the rich people doesn't want that. Welfare programs for poorer working class or lower middle class is worthless to the rich. That is the real reason of the neoliberal agenda.</p>
