              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: The move to scrap one avenue for rich foreigners to 
              fast-track their permanent residency applications by parking large sums 
              of money here will have little impact on the Republic's economy, 
              analysts noted.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>In fact, an analyst 
              went as far as to describe the Financial Investor Scheme (FIS) - started
               in 2004 - as having "outlived its usefulness".</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Under the FIS, high 
              net worth individuals from overseas with net personal assets of S$20 
              million - and at least S$10 million of assets held in Singapore for five
               years - can, via the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), expedite 
              their PR application through private banks or other financial 
              institutions. <br><br>Up to S$2 million of the S$10 million these foreigners park here can be used to buy private residential property. <br><br>"The
               scheme has outlived its usefulness and its scrapping will have no 
              impact on the economy as Singapore can now stand on its own merit and it
               won't hurt Singapore's attractiveness to foreigners," Chesterton Suntec
               international head of consultancy &amp; research Colin Tan told Today. <br><br>On Wednesday, the Business Times reported that the FIS will be scrapped by the end of this month. <br><br>On
               why the FIS was being scrapped, the MAS explained that the scheme and 
              the Global Investor Programme (GIP) - which is run by the Economic 
              Development Board - have become similar and it would be more efficient 
              to have just one investor scheme for PRs.<br><br>The MAS reiterated that
               Singapore continued to welcome quality individuals who are keen to 
              contribute to the Republic economically and private banks can continue 
              to direct their clients to the GIP facility.<br><br>The GIP is targeted at entrepreneurs with a track record and who can boost employment here. <br><br>Under
               the GIP, foreigners have to invest S$2.5 million in a new company or to
               expand an existing business in Singapore and the company should have an
               annual revenue of at least S$30 million.<br><br>Citi economist Kit Wei 
              Zheng felt the government's rationale to scrap the FIS was to "ensure 
              that (foreigners) who have obtained their PR via these schemes are able 
              to contribute productively to the real economy via job creation, and not
               merely through financial investments that drive up asset prices". <br><br>Barclays
               Capital economist Leong Waiho added: "Even among wealthy PR applicants,
               we favour long-term strategic investors who are prepared to sink roots 
              in Singapore and who can create economic value (create jobs for 
              Singaporeans). <br><br>"This sets them apart from the more opportunistic
               crowd, who park money here to take punts in our asset markets, and who 
              expect to gain PRs along the way." <br><br>Mr Kit noted that it was 
              impossible to "come up with precise numbers about just how much 
              investments or PRs into Singapore was due directly to the FIS" - given 
              that the figures are not made public. But he pointed out that since the 
              inception of the FIS, the share of PRs in property sales has risen from 
              10.7 per cent in 2004 to 13.5 per cent as of last year. "Obviously not 
              all new PR buyers came under the FIS, but it would be reasonable to 
              assume it had some impact," he said.<br><br>Separately, real estate 
              consultancy CBRE said on Wednesday in a report that despite lower sales 
              volume in the first three months of this year, regional private 
              investors are expected to remain active in the property market here.<br><br>According
               to CBRE, the total investment sales hit S$4 billion in the first 
              quarter, down 53 per cent on-year and 49 per cent on-quarter.<br><br>It 
              attributed the slower private investment sales to the weak global 
              capital market sentiment and the introduction of cooling measures such 
              as the Additional Buyer's Stamp Duty. <br><br>Nevertheless, it noted 
              that mass market projects remained popular, prompting developers - 
              especially from China and Malaysia - to place more aggressive bids for 
              land tenders.</span></span></p>
