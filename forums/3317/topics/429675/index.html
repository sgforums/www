              <p>LOS ANGELES/HONG KONG, May 4 (Reuters)-
              Billionaire Sheldon Adelson's Las Vegas Sands Corp 
              disappointed investors with a lower-than-expected quarterly
              profit at its Singapore casino-resort, sending the company's
              shares down 10 percent.</p>
              <p>Sands posted first-quarter earnings below Wall Street
              forecasts and said lower-than-normal casino table game winnings
              hit its Singapore revenue by about $30 million and its Las Vegas
              revenue by about $45 million.</p>
              <p>Hong Kong-listed shares of Sands China Ltd , LVS's
              lucrative Macau unit, fell more than 5 percent on Wednesday,
              despite beating analyst expectations with a rise of 46.1 percent
              in quarterly adjusted earnings before interest, tax,
              depreciation and amortization (EBITDA)to $378.6 million.</p>
              <p>Analysts said the share price fall was due to negative
              sentiment over the parent company's Singapore operations, but
              strong first-quarter figures and the opening of a new casino
              early next year would give the stock further upside.</p>
              <p>Kenneth Fong at J.P. Morgan in Hong Kong said Sands China
              was strategically positioned for a better second half with
              strong mass-market growth.</p>
              <p>"On top of the operational improvement, we expect to see
              more progress in construction of Lots 5 &amp; 6 (Sands' next casino
              project) when Galaxy Macau frees up labour gradually into its
              opening," he said.</p>
              <p>Operator of the Venetian casino resort in Macau, the world's
              largest gaming market, Sands China posted a better-than-expected
              property EBITDA, up 11 percent on the quarter.</p>
              <p>Las Vegas Sands, which operates the Venetian and Palazzo
              resorts on the Las Vegas Strip, earns most of its money in Asia,
              from its newest resort in Singapore and in Macau, where
              allegations of malfeasance by a former executive have prompted
              investigations by regulators such as the U.S. Department of
              Justice.</p>
              <p>Stellar gaming revenue in the former Portuguese colony has
              boosted revenue streams for Sands China and casino magnate Steve
              Wynn's Wynn Macau Ltd , despite competition from local
              players such as gaming tycoon Stanley Ho's SJM Holdings Ltd
               , which has a near one-third share of Macau's gaming
              market.</p>
              <p>Macau gaming revenue set a new revenue record in April of
              $2.56 billion, with revenue expected to dwarf that of the Las
              Vegas strip several times over for the year.</p>
              <p>SINGAPORE DISAPPOINTS</p>
              <p>But Singapore's Marina Bay Sands, which started limited
              operations just about a year ago, generated adjusted EBITDA of
              $284.5 million, well below the average Wall Street estimate of
              $325 million.</p>
              <p>The giant iconic building is located at the mouth of the
              Singapore river, while Genting Singapore Plc's Resorts
              World, the only other casino in Singapore, is on Sentosa island.</p>
              <p>The profit margin at the Singapore resort was 48.6 percent,
              down from 54.6 percent in the fourth quarter of last year.</p>
              <p>"Everybody is freaking out about the Singapore margin," said
              Hudson Securities analyst Robert LaFleur. "They are generating a
              phenomenal amount of EBITDA, but the question is we are going
              through the first year trying to figure out the true profit
              potential of that market."</p>
              <p>The $5.5 billion Singapore Sands, the world's second-most
              expensive casino resort after MGM's CityCenter in Las Vegas,
              held its official opening in February and company officials said
              at the time that it had already attracted 11 million visitors.</p>
              <p>Unlike other gambling jurisdictions, including Macau and the
              U.S. state of Nevada, the city-state does not announce monthly
              gambling revenue totals, making it more difficult for investors
              to gauge the market.</p>
              <p>"There is nothing whatsoever that makes us think margins
              will decrease," Adelson said on a conference call.</p>
              <p>In Las Vegas, Sands posted adjusted EBITDA of $65.2 million,
              which was also short of analyst estimates, as strong group
              meeting and convention business was offset by a low rate of
              casino winnings at table games.</p>
              <p>Adjusting for one-time items, the casino operator earned 37
              cents per share in the quarter, short of an average estimate
              from analysts for 44 cents for share, according to Thomson
              Reuters I/B/E/S.</p>
              <p>The company reported a quarterly net profit of $228.2
              million, or 28 cents per share, a year earlier.</p>
              <p>Overall net revenue for the quarter totaled $2.11 billion.
              Analysts had expected a tad more, or $2.14 billion.</p>
              <p>Sands shares closed at $45.87 in New York and were lower at
              $41.44 in after hours trading.</p>
