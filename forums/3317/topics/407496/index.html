              <p>ONE of two feuding factions vying for control of Singapore's only 
              Malay-based political party wants the Registrar of Societies to 
              determine who is rightfully in charge of the party.</p>
              <p>The faction in question, led by Mr Borhan Ariffin, is confident the Registrar will decide in their favour.</p>
              <p>Its spokesman Ali Aman said on Saturday that was because 'we have the support of the majority of our members'.</p>
              <p>His faction, within the Singapore Malay National 
              Organisation(PKMS), held an extraordinary general meeting on Saturday. 
              It was attended by 100 party delegates.</p>
              <p>At a press conference after the meeting, Mr Ali also said 
              the faction he represented planned to contest the coming General 
              Election, hopefully under the banner of the Singapore Democratic 
              Alliance led Mr Chiam See Tong.</p>
              <p>The rival faction issued a statement on Saturday evening to 
              say they did not recognise the meeting held earlier by Mr Borhan's 
              group.</p>

              <p><strong>Rift over control of Malay-based political party PKMS deepens</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : The rift appears to be deepening between the two 
              factions fighting for control of Singapore's only Malay-based political 
              party, the Singapore Malay National Organisation or PKMS. </span></p>
              <p><span> One faction led by Borhan Ariffin announced on Saturday that it wanted 
              the Registrar of Societies to determine who is rightfully in charge. </span></p>
              <p><span>It also held an Extraordinary General Meeting at a hotel.
              <br> <br> On Sunday afternoon, the faction led by PKMS president Ali Asjadi held 
              its Annual General Meeting at the party's office in Changi Road.
              <br> <br> He said the party does not recognise the meeting held by Mr Borhan's faction, as he is no longer a member.
              <br> <br> He said it will be taking legal action against the group for defamation.
              <br> <br> The tussle began at a party election in 2006, when party leader Osman 
              Hassan led a group to oust Mr Borhan, who was the party president at the
               time.
              <br> <br> Both sides agreed to settle the issue at fresh polls in 2007.
              <br> <br> In September last year, members and supporters from both sides clashed 
              in a street brawl outside the PKMS building. Twelve members were charged
               with rioting, and the case is ongoing. </span></p>

              <p><strong>PKMS leaders seek to end tussle</strong></p>
              <p>NEWLY elected leaders of the Singapore Malay National Organisation 
              (PKMS) said they are considering taking legal action over the ongoing 
              tussle with a breakaway faction, which also claims leadership of the 
              party.</p>
              <p>'We need to put a stop to this prolonged debacle which is causing 
              unnecessary confusion and dissatisfaction among members and the Malay 
              public alike,' Mr Ali Asjadi said in a statement on Sunday.</p>
              <p>'Our silence and diplomatic approach have been taken for granted.'</p>
              <p>Mr Ali was elected party president on Sunday after an annual
               general meeting at the PKMS building in Changi Road to elect a new 
              supreme council.</p>
              <p>He had been deputy to party president Osman Hassan, who stepped down on Sunday to become adviser to the council.</p>
              <p>Last Saturday, the rival faction held its own extraordinary 
              general meeting and said it wanted the Registrar of Societies to 
              determine which faction was rightfully in charge of the party.</p>

              <p><strong>PKMS ordered to give up HQ</strong></p>
              <p>THE High Court has ordered members of a breakaway faction of the 
              Singapore Malay National Organisation (PKMS) to sign over trust deeds to
               the party's Changi Road building to elected party officials.</p>
              <p>If they fail to sign over the deeds and the transfer documents by Aug
               24, the Registrar of the Supreme Court will do so on their behalf.</p>
              <p>The order by Justice Lai Siu Chiu was made at a closed-door hearing 
              on Tuesday, according to court documents seen by The Straits Times.</p>
              <p>The move could bring Singapore's only Malay-based political 
              party a step closer to settling a leadership dispute that has been going
               on for the past four years.</p>
              <p>The court order came two days after a new PKMS supreme 
              council, led by former deputy president Ali Asjadi, was elected at a 
              party conference on Sunday.</p>
              <p>The leadership saga began in 2006 when Mr Ali Asjadi, Mr 
              Osman Hassan and Mr Malik Ismail led a group which ousted then-president
               Borhan Ariffin and his deputy, Mr Ali Aman, at the party polls.</p>
