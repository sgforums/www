              <p><span>SINGAPORE : Former Singapore sprinter Tan Eng Yoon died in a road accident on Saturday morning. </span></p>
              <p><span>The President of the Singapore Olympians Association helped
              oversee the National Stadium's construction as a sports administrator.
              <br> <br> He was 82 years old.
              <br> <br> Mr Tan was General Secretary of the Football Association of Singapore in the 1990s.
              <br> <br> He represented the country at the 1956 Melbourne Olympics in the triple jump and 100-metre sprint.
              <br> <br>In 1959, he won Singapore's first medal, in the 400-metre hurdles,
              at the inaugural South-East Asian Peninsular Games, the pre-cursor to
              the present-day SEA Games.
              <br> <br> He also won the triple jump gold and his national record for this event stood for 32 years.
              <br> <br> As National Track and Field coach in the 1960s and 1970s, Mr Tan also nurtured athletes like sprint king C Kunalan.
              <br> <br>Mr Kunalan said: "He was just elected as the President of the
              Singapore Olympians Association. And he has taken his work so
              seriously. Can you imagine he is 82 and he was working at that
              intensity, at that sincerity.
              <br> <br> "Having travelled with him to a couple of games overseas, I can see that he is all for the athlete when he is travelling."
              <br> <br>MediaCorp understands that Mr Tan was hit by a car while crossing
              Upper Thomson Road on his way to the Church of the Holy Spirit.
              <br> <br>More than two months ago, an elderly couple heading to the same
              church were also knocked down by a car. The man sustained head injuries
              while his wife died at the scene.
              <br> <br>Meanwhile, the Football Association of Singapore said that a minute
              of silence will be observed for Mr Tan before Monday's S.League
              season-opener. </span></p>

              <p><strong>Funeral of ex-Olympian Tan Eng Yoon to be held on Wednesday</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : National athletes from the 1960s and 1970s have been
              paying their respects to former Singapore Olympian Tan Eng Yoon, who
              died in a road accident on Saturday morning. </span></p>
              <p><span>Among them were former hurdler Osman Merican, ex-sprinter Glory
              Barnabas, as well as former high jumper Nor Azhar Hamid, a national
              record holder in the 1970s.
              <br> <br> All had fond memories of Mr Tan who had coached them.
              <br> <br>"This was something that shouldn't have happened, because he is a
              very fit person... and he kept himself very healthy, so it's very
              unfortunate that it has to be an accident. That part is hard to
              accept," said Osman Merican. <br> <br> "He used to coach me on the starts. That was one of my weakest areas
              and he would make me do it again and again until I was better... The
              other thing was the relay... (he) made sure we did our paces properly
              and I think we had one of the best teams in the relay," said Barnabas. <br> <br> Mr Tan's wake is being held at Church Of The Holy Spirit in Upper Thomson Road and his funeral will be on Wednesday.
              <br> <br> MediaCorp understands that former sprinter C Kunalan and other members
              of the Singapore Olympians Association are expected to pay their
              respects on Monday.
              <br> <br> Mr Tan was the president of the association, which was started recently. </span></p>
