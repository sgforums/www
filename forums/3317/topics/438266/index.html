              <p>Writing the new “Buffett rule”
              proposed by President <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/barack-obama/">Barack Obama</a> to snare more <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/tax-revenue/">tax revenue</a> from millionaires will prove to be logistically and
              mathematically difficult.</p>
              <p>The concept, named for billionaire investor <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/warren-buffett/">Warren Buffett</a>,
              would require Americans earning more than $1 million a year to
              pay at least the same tax rate as middle-class households. Such
              a rule would be problematical to craft or ineffectual because
              higher earners aren’t the only taxpayers benefiting from breaks;
              many middle-income families take advantage of deductions and
              credits that drive their rates below the 17.4 percent that
              Buffett pays.</p>
              <p>Buffett has said he and other Americans earning more than
              $1 million a year should pay more in taxes than they currently
              do. The administration wants to include Buffett’s concept in a
              broad overhaul of the U.S. tax code. Obama didn’t include
              specific language in the proposal he released today.</p>
              <p>“We’re not going to give the Congress a detailed proposal
              for how to meet that principle because we think there are a
              bunch of different ways to do that,” said Treasury Secretary
              <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/timothy-geithner/">Timothy Geithner</a>, adding that the details of the rule would
              depend on the rest of the structure of a new tax system.</p>
              <h2>‘Game-Changer’</h2>
              <p><a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/charles-schumer/">Charles Schumer</a> of New York, the third-ranking Democrat in
              the Senate, said on a conference call with reporters today that
              the proposal would have broad support in his party and would be
              a “game-changer” in the tax debate.</p>
              <p>“It really works well as a defining principle, but I think
              it works even better as an actual piece of legislation,”
              Schumer, a member of the tax-writing Finance Committee, said.
              “Let’s draft the language and get it scored. Let’s put it on
              the floor and let’s have a vote.”</p>
              <p>The example that Obama gave during his speech today
              illustrated the difficulty of applying the Buffett principle in
              practice. He said that a teacher earning $50,000 shouldn’t pay a
              higher tax rate than an investor making $50 million.</p>
              <p>“I reject the idea that asking a hedge-fund manager to pay
              the same tax rate as a plumber or a teacher is class warfare,”
              Obama said at the White House. “It’s just the right thing
              to do.”</p>
              <p>That example isn’t as straightforward as it appears. Under
              current law, that teacher would have a maximum taxable income of
              $40,500, after subtracting the standard deduction and personal
              exemption. The teacher’s federal income tax would be $6,250, or
              12.5 percent of the $50,000 income.</p>
              <h2>Specific Breaks</h2>
              <p>The teacher’s tax rate, though, would be higher if payroll
              taxes were included. It would be lower if the teacher took
              advantage of the specific breaks available to middle-income
              taxpayers: those for retirement savings contributions and
              health-care flexible spending arrangements, and deductions for
              student loan interest and out-of-pocket expenses of educators.</p>
              <p>The tax rate would be even lower if the teacher were
              married or had children, which would allow for a larger standard
              deduction, personal exemptions and a <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/child-tax-credit/">child tax credit</a>. A married
              couple with two children can earn as much as <a title="Open Web Site" rel="external" href="http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxfacts/displayafact.cfm?Docid=471">$45,776 without
              paying income taxes</a> this year, according to the <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/tax-policy-center/">Tax Policy
              Center</a>, a nonpartisan Washington research group.</p>
              <h2>Making Choices</h2>
              <p>As a result of those complexities, lawmakers trying to
              write a Buffett rule would have to make some choices about how
              to measure a middle-income family’s earnings and tax rate. They
              also face complicated arithmetic for higher-income taxpayers.</p>
              <p>Assuming the millionaire investor received all of his or
              her income from long-term capital gains and dividends, the tax
              rate would be 15 percent, the preferential rate for investment
              income.</p>
              <p>That rate could be much lower if the investor took itemized
              deductions for state and local taxes, mortgage interest and
              charitable contributions. It would be higher if the investor
              also had some wage income.</p>
              <p>Writing a Buffett rule into law would require defining
              income and setting a minimum rate for it, said <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/roberton-williams/">Roberton Williams</a>, a senior fellow affiliated with the Tax Policy Center.
              That definition might need to address sources of income, such as
              municipal bond interest, that aren’t included under the regular
              income tax.</p>
              <h2>‘Opening the Door’</h2>
              <p>“Every time you set up something like this, you’re opening
              the door for the tax lawyers to come in and get around the
              attempt to raise revenues,” Williams said.</p>
              <p>Obama’s prime target for what he calls income-tax fairness
              is the 20-point gap between the top rate for <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/capital-gains/">capital gains</a> and
              ordinary income tax rates.</p>
              <p>In 1986, President <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/ronald-reagan/">Ronald Reagan</a> signed an overhaul of the
              tax code that equalized the tax rates on capital gains and
              ordinary income at 28 percent. Since then, Congress has raised
              the top income tax rate to 35 percent and dropped the top
              capital gains rate to 15 percent.</p>
              <p>During a briefing at the White House today, Geithner said
              the rates of high-income taxpayers vary depending on their
              profession.</p>
              <p>People who earn much of their income from wages, such as
              corporate executives and professional athletes, have relatively
              high tax rates. Investors who make money from capital gains and
              dividends tend to have lower rates.</p>
              <p>Buffett, the 81-year-old chairman and chief executive
              officer of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., said his federal tax bill
              last year, or the income tax he paid and payroll taxes paid by
              him and on his behalf, was $6.93 million.</p>
              <h2>‘Lower Percentage’</h2>
              <p>“That sounds like a lot of money,” Buffett wrote in an
              essay calling for higher taxes on millionaires in The <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/new-york/">New York</a> Times last month. “But what I paid was only 17.4 percent of my
              taxable income -- and that’s actually a lower percentage than
              was paid by any of the other 20 people in our office.”</p>
              <p>Several bipartisan groups, including the fiscal commission
              appointed by Obama last year, have proposed eliminating the
              preferential tax rates for capital gains as part of a tax
              overhaul that would also lower rates on wage income.</p>
              <p>That approach, rather than the calculation of a minimum
              tax, might be the most straightforward way to satisfy the
              Buffett principle, Williams said.</p>
              <p>“That certainly makes it a lot easier,” he said. “But a
              lot of people would oppose that on the argument that there are
              good reasons to tax capital income at lower rates.”</p>
              <p>The arguments for lower capital gains rates include the
              benefits of encouraging investment, and tax economists say that
              lower dividend rates minimize the double taxation of income
              already taxed at the corporate level.</p>
              <h2>Minimum Tax</h2>
              <p>The Buffett rule would essentially operate as a type of
              alternative minimum tax.</p>
              <p>Since 1969, the U.S. has imposed a minimum tax of some sort
              on the nation’s highest earners to prevent them from using legal
              deductions, credits and exemptions to avoid paying taxes. That
              year, in response to a report that 155 people earning more than
              $200,000 had paid no taxes, Congress created the forerunner to
              the alternative minimum tax.</p>
              <p>The AMT came into its current form in the 1986 <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/tax-code/">tax-code</a> overhaul. It requires taxpayers to compare their tax liability
              under the regular tax code with their liability under the AMT.
              Because the AMT doesn’t allow taxpayers the full benefits of the
              state and local tax deduction or personal exemptions, people
              with large families or who live in high-tax states in the
              Northeast tend to be disproportionately affected.</p>
              <p>Congressional lawmakers’ efforts to prevent people from
              legally avoiding all taxes haven’t been successful. In 2008, the
              most recent year for which data is available, 18,783 people
              filed U.S. tax returns with adjusted gross incomes of at least
              $200,000 and owed no taxes. That represented 0.43 percent of
              high-income taxpayers, the biggest non-payer percentage in an
              Internal Revenue Service study that dates to 1977</p>

              <h1>Corporate Jets Face Flight Fee in Obama Plan</h1>
              <p>President <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/barack-obama/">Barack Obama</a>’s
              administration proposed a $100 per-flight fee on corporate jets
              and other turbine-powered planes that use the U.S. air-traffic
              system.</p>
              <p>The fee would raise an estimated $11 billion over 10 years,
              according to the president’s recommendations to the 12-member
              congressional committee charged with finding ways to trim the
              deficit. The fee is aimed at private aircraft, which currently
              don’t pay their fair share of costs of operating the aviation
              system, the administration said today.</p>
              <p>About two-thirds of the air-traffic system is paid for by
              aviation excise taxes, including levies on airline tickets and
              on fuel. Last year these taxes raised $10.8 billion, according
              to the Department of Transportation.</p>
              <p>There is a disparity between what airlines and their
              passengers pay into the system and what users of private
              aircraft pay, <a title="Open Web Site" rel="external" href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2012/assets/jointcommitteereport.pdf">the plan</a> said.</p>
              <p>An airline flight from <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/los-angeles/">Los Angeles</a> to <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/san-francisco/">San Francisco</a> would
              generate $1,300 to $2,000 in taxes, depending on the number of
              passengers and what they paid for tickets. A private jet, which
              requires almost the same services from air-traffic controllers,
              would pay about $60 in fuel taxes, the plan said.</p>
              <p>“General aviation users currently pay a fuel tax, but this
              revenue does not cover their fair-share use of air traffic
              services,” the plan said.</p>
              <h2>Opposition Mounts</h2>
              <p>A coalition of nine U.S. associations representing users
              and manufacturers of corporate and private aircraft issued a
              joint statement “expressing our unified opposition” to the
              proposal.</p>
              <p>“Mr. President, many foreign countries have imposed per
              flight charges on general aviation and the results have been
              devastating,” the e-mail statement said. “Please do not go
              down the dangerous path and cost jobs in our community.”</p>
              <p>General-aviation pilots pay their fair share of fuel taxes
              and a new fee would create “a costly new federal collection
              bureaucracy,” the groups said.</p>
              <p>The groups that issued the letter include the Washington-
              based <a title="Open Web Site" rel="external" href="http://www.gama.aero/">General Aviation Manufacturers Association</a>, whose members
              include <a class="web_ticker" title="Get Quote" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=GD:US">General Dynamics Corp. (GD)</a>’s Gulfstream and <a class="web_ticker" title="Get Quote" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=TXT:US">Textron Inc. (TXT)</a>’s

              <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/wisconsin/">Wisconsin</a>.</p>
              <h2>NetJets Reacts</h2>
              <p><a class="web_ticker" title="Get Quote" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=BRK%2FA:US">Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)</a>’s NetJets, the largest U.S. firm
              selling fractional shares of corporate jets, issued a statement
              from Chairman and Chief Executive Jordan Hansell agreeing with
              the trade groups. NetJets, based in Columbus, <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/ohio/">Ohio</a>, has more
              than 7,000 customers worldwide.</p>
              <p>A similar proposal introduced by President <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/george-w.-bush/">George W. Bush</a>’s
              administration was defeated in Congress after opposition by the
              same groups.</p>
              <p>That plan, which was introduced in 2007, was supported by
              the <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/airline-industry/">airline industry</a>, which argued that corporate aircraft

              airlines including <a class="web_ticker" title="Get Quote" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=DAL:US">Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL)</a>, has joined the

              <p>“We oppose any new taxes on airlines or their
              passengers,” ATA President <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/nicholas-calio/">Nicholas Calio</a> said in a statement.</p>
              <p>The Obama plan is aimed at pilots who fly under the
              supervision of air-traffic controllers.</p>
              <p>Nearly all small private, piston-powered planes wouldn’t
              have to pay the fee, the proposal said. It would also exempt
              aircraft operated by the military or other government agencies,
              air ambulances and any flight that doesn’t require air-traffic
              guidance.</p>

              <h1 class="disqus_title">Investors Back Obama's Buffett Rule</h1>
              <p>Global investors overwhelmingly
              support President Barack Obama’s proposed tax increase for those
              earning annual incomes of $1 million or more in an effort to
              reduce the deficit.</p>
              <p>By a margin of 63 percent to 32 percent, respondents in a
              Bloomberg Global Poll approved of the president’s proposal,
              known as the “Buffett rule” in a nod to <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/warren-buffett/">Warren Buffett</a>, the
              chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., who has said it is wrong
              that he pays a smaller share of his income in taxes than does
              his secretary.</p>
              <p>Obama said Sept. 19 that making sure that the wealthy pay
              at least the same tax rate as the middle class was “just the
              right thing to do.” House Speaker <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/john-boehner/">John Boehner</a> accused the
              president of practicing “class warfare,” saying any new tax
              would hurt <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/job-creation/">job creation</a> and Buffett’s situation was not typical.</p>
              <p>The call for the rich to pay more, however, found backing
              among financial professionals in the quarterly Global Poll of
              1,031 investors, analysts and traders who are Bloomberg
              subscribers. “Higher tax payments could help to avoid or delay
              potential social disturbances and in addition create some kind
              of a general solidarity,” says Henry Littig, chief executive
              officer of Henry Littig Global Investments AG in Cologne,
              <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/germany/">Germany</a>, a poll respondent.</p>
              <p>In the U.S., support for the idea was lower, with more than
              half opposing it, although four in 10 supported it. “The U.S.
              does not have a tax rate problem -- we have a spending and
              entitlement problem,” said poll respondent Jay Wright, managing
              director of Samco Capital Markets in San Antonio, <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/texas/">Texas</a>. “And
              if we do not address it quickly we are going to be <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/greece/">Greece</a>.”</p>
              <h2>Strong Support</h2>
              <p>Support for the millionaire’s tax was highest in <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/europe/">Europe</a>,
              where French President <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/nicolas-sarkozy/">Nicolas Sarkozy</a> plans a 3 percent
              surcharge on incomes above 500,000 euros ($680,000.) European
              poll respondents backed Obama 78 percent to 17 percent;
              Bloomberg customers in <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/asia/">Asia</a> supported the president’s idea 69
              percent to 21 percent.</p>
              <p>“Increasing taxes on millionaires may not harm the
              economy, but it will not help it either,” said Don Lindsey,
              chief investment officer at George Washington University, who
              participated in the survey. “What we need is a complete
              overhaul of the tax system.”</p>
              <p>In a New York Times op-ed last month, Buffett wrote that
              his federal income tax bill was $6.94 million, or 17.4 percent
              of his taxable income -- a lower rate than any of the other 20
              employees in his Omaha, Nebraska, office.</p>
              <h2>Ultra-Wealthy</h2>
              <p>In an interview today with Bloomberg Television, Buffett
              said the “ultra-wealthy” should pay a new minimum tax, without
              any change in tax rates on income or <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/capital-gains/">capital gains</a>. “An athlete
              making $10 million -- he would not have a change in his tax rate
              at all or $20 million or $30 million even,” Buffett said. “But
              somebody that buys a stock index future and sells it
              10 seconds later and gets 60 percent by long-term gains, he
              would have a different world to live in.”</p>
              <p>The new tax would apply to perhaps 50,000 individuals and
              raise around $20 billion annually, Buffett said.</p>
              <h2>‘Send in a Check’</h2>
              <p>Buffett has repeatedly said that his secretary pays a
              higher share of her income in taxes than he does, prompting
              Republicans such as Senate Minority Leader <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/mitch-mcconnell/">Mitch McConnell</a> to
              gibe: “If he’s feeling guilty about it, I think he should send
              in a check.”</p>
              <p>Some participants in the Bloomberg poll agreed. “Buffett
              is being very deceptive,” said Michael Prisby, corporate
              investment officer at Citizens Financial Bank in Munster,
              <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/indiana/">Indiana</a>. “He may be taxed at a capital gains rate of 15
              percent, but that doesn’t mean all high earners are.”</p>
              <p>On average, taxpayers with annual incomes of more than $1
              million last year paid a 29 percent tax rate, compared with 15.1
              percent for those making between $50,000 and $75,000, according
              to the non-partisan <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/tax-policy-center/">Tax Policy Center</a> in <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/washington/">Washington</a>.</p>
              <p>Some high-income individuals, like Buffett, do pay a lower
              average tax rate because much of their income is derived from
              capital gains rather than wages. In 2009, the most recent
              Internal Revenue Service data shows that 1,470 individuals with
              at least $1 million in annual income paid no income tax.</p>
              <h2>‘Disproportionate Rewards’</h2>
              <p>The debate over a “Buffett rule” tax caps an era in which
              disproportionate rewards have gone to those at the top of the
              nation’s income distribution. Between 1993 and 2008, the top 1
              percent of families captured 52 percent of total income gains,
              according to a 2010 paper by economist Emmanuel Saez of the
              University of <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/california/">California</a>, Berkeley.</p>
              <p>“The Buffett rule does not apply to all rich people or the
              average rich person, but it does apply to some rich people,”
              said <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/roberton-williams/">Roberton Williams</a>, an analyst at the Tax Policy Center.</p>
              <p>The administration has said it has no plans to submit a
              detailed millionaires’ tax proposal to Congress. For now, that
              means the main significance of the Buffett rule is political not
              financial.</p>
              <p>The proposed tax is the rhetorical centerpiece of White
              House jockeying in the run-up to the deliberations of a
              congressional “supercommittee” seeking $1.5 trillion in
              deficit reduction by Nov. 23.</p>
              <p>Earlier this week, Douglas Edwards, who described himself
              as “unemployed by choice” after retiring as an early employee
              from Google, urged the president to “please raise my taxes” at
              a town hall in <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/mountain-view/">Mountain View</a>, California.</p>
              <h2>Far From Rich</h2>
              <p>Lionel Mellul, co-founder of Momentum Trading Partners in
              <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/new-york/">New York</a>, said he endorsed the idea of the rich paying more,
              while taking issue with the $1 million threshold. A New Yorker
              with a $1 million annual income is “far from really being
              rich,” he said.</p>
              <p>In follow-up interviews, many respondents called for a
              stem-to-stern overhaul of the <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/tax-code/">tax code</a>.</p>
              <p>“Until the administration completely overhauls the
              personal and corporate tax code to both drive growth and
              incentivize the efficient transfer of capital and risk, the
              wealthy people will just have their tax lawyers find more
              loopholes to lower their taxes,” said Jonathan Sadowsky, chief
              investment officer at Vaca Creek Asset Management in <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/san-francisco/">San
              Francisco</a>.</p>

              <p>Come to think of this issue, supposing spore really want to implement this in spore where rich and high earning salary workers need to pay extra income tax to help the needy and the poor, couldnt it be better?</p>
              <p>All ministers, mps, millionaires and above, presidents, high earner workers, self employed (with gst) will have to pay extra percentage of income tax. That amount collected will help the needy and the poor families in spore.</p>
