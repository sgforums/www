              <p><strong>COC finds financial irregularities at Sri Siva Krishna Temple</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : The Commissioner of Charities (COC) has found 
              financial irregularities and serious lapses in the governance and 
              management of the Sri Siva Krishna Temple at Marsiling Rise. </span></p>
              <p><span> This follows its inquiry into the temple early this year. </span></p>
              <p><span> The COC has also lodged a report with the Commercial Affairs Department. </span></p>
              <p><span>Responding to media queries, police confirmed that a report on 
              financial irregularities found at Sri Siva Krishna Temple was received 
              from the COC on 3 June 2010. 
              <br> <br> A police spokesperson said: "The Commercial Affairs Department has 
              commenced investigations into the report. It is inappropriate for us to 
              comment further at this juncture as investigations are on-going."
              <br> <br> The red flag was raised at the Sri Siva Krishna temple in July last 
              year, when the Hindu Endowment Board (HEB) expressed its concerns to the
               Community Development, Youth and Sports Ministry.
              <br> <br> In February, the COC launched its inquiry.
              <br> <br> The findings pointed to evidence of serious lapses in governance and book-keeping.
              <br> <br> Among them are suspected forgery of payment vouchers and misappropriation of the temple's funds.
              <br> <br> These include payments purported to have been made but not received by 
              the vendor, donations made to the temple but not accounted for in the 
              temple's accounting records, as well as missing donation receipt books.
              <br> <br> The transactions took place between January 2007 and July 2008 before 
              the Protem Committee, set up by HEB, took charge of the financial 
              affairs of the temple. 
              <br> <br> The COC also found serious lapses in the governance and management of the temple between January 2007 and July 2008.
              <br> <br> While there was a Management Committee, the temple was also in the sole control of then president, A Sivalingam. 
              <br> <br> The COC said there was a severe lack of segregation of duties, and checks and balances. 
              <br> <br> For example, Mr Sivalingam had sole custody of the donation monies and gold received by the temple.
              <br> <br> He also maintained the accounting records, approved contracts/purchases 
              and disbursed cash/cheques on behalf of the temple. Most of the 
              decisions of the temple were made by him or with his acquiescence.
              <br> <br> The inquiry also revealed the lack of proper controls over the revenue collection and receipt books.
              <br> <br> The COC has initiated action to remove Mr Sivalingam as a charity trustee.
              <br> <br> The COC noted that a new Management Committee was elected at the temple's annual general meeting held in April 2010. 
              <br> <br> Mr A Sivalingam had voluntarily resigned from the office of the 
              President on 6 May 2010. However, he was subsequently elected as the 
              temple's advisor and chief executive officer with effect from 22 May 
              2010.
              <br> <br> Given the inquiry findings of mismanagement in the administration of the
               temple during his tenure as the president, the COC is concerned with 
              his continued involvement in the temple's affairs.
              <br> <br> Any representation regarding COC's intention to remove Mr Sivalingam as a
               charity trustee should be submitted by 22 August 2010 via 
              mcys_charities@mcys.gov.sg or by post to the Office of the Commissioner 
              of Charities at 512 Thomson Road MCYS Building Singapore 298136.
              <br> <br> The temple's annual income for FY2007 was S$350,000 - mainly from donations. Its net asset is valued at S$2.7 million. </span></p>

              <p><strong>15 committee members of Sri Siva Krishna Temple to help with investigations</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Channel NewsAsia  has learnt that 15 committee members 
              of the Sri Siva Krishna Temple have been called up to help with 
              investigations. </span></p>
              <p><span> A committee member said she received the letter which was sent to 14 others from the authorities on Thursday. </span></p>
              <p><span> The Commissioner of Charities (COC) said on Thursday that it found 
              financial irregularities and serious lapses in the temple's governance 
              and management, following an inquiry. </span></p>
              <p><span> It then lodged a report with the Commercial Affairs Department in June. </span></p>
              <p><span> Among its findings, the COC took issue with then President A Sivalingam -
               now the temple's adviser and chief executive officer - effectively 
              having sole control of the temple in 2007 and 2008. </span></p>
              <p><span> The COC is seeking to remove him as a charity trustee. </span></p>
              <p><span> When contacted, a committee member who did not want to be identified, 
              spoke positively of Mr Sivalingam's efforts in growing the temple over 
              the last 30 to 50 years. </span></p>
