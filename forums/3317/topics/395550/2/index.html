              <p><strong>Fined for swiping gaming chip</strong></p>
              <p>A MAN who picked up another person's gaming chip at Resorts World 
              Sentosa casino earlier this month was fined $2,000 on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>Truck driver Lai Ken Khiong, 44, pleaded guilty to dishonestly 
              misappropriating a $500 chip belonging to Ms Zhao Hua, 35, at RWS on 
              June 6.</p>
              <p>The court heard that Ms Zhao, an assistant sales and 
              marketing manager, had accidentally dropped the $500 chip while gaming 
              at a baccarat table that evening.</p>
              <p>Lai saw the chip on the floor and immediately picked it up. 
              He walked away.</p>
              <p>A woman saw this and alerted Ms Zhao who went after Lai and 
              asked if he had taken her chip. He denied it. Ms Zhao then alerted the 
              casino security.</p>
              <p>When detained, Lai had various chips totalling $178, which 
              was what he was left with after using the $500 chip to gamble at a 
              blackjack table.</p>
              <p>He could have been jailed for up to two years and/or fined.</p>

              <p><strong>S.African casino cheat jailed</strong></p>
              <p>A SOUTH African businessman who cheated a casino of $14,000 last 
              month was jailed for seven months on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>Sibongile Arthur Mgxashe, 33, admitted to deceiving dealers on duty 
              at the roulette table at Resorts World Sentosa casino by intentionally 
              placing chips worth $200 on the winning bets after the results were 
              announced on May 20 and 21.</p>
              <p>On both occasions, he received a payout of chips worth 
              $7,000.</p>
              <p>A district court heard that Mgxashe arrived here on May 16 
              to buy clothes for his business in South Africa. He left for Genting 
              Highlands, Malaysia on the same day, and returned two days later after 
              having lost US$2,000 playing blackjack and roulette.</p>
              <p>As a result, he decided to 'past post' - which entails 
              placing a bet on the winning number after it has been called - to recoup
               some losses.</p>
              <p>Deputy Public Prosecutor Gay Hui Yi told District Judge 
              Thian Yee Sze that there were aggravating factors in this case. The 
              offences, she said, were pre-meditated and the total amount involved was
               $31,525, of which only $8,032 had been recovered.</p>
              <p>Three charges of theft and one of attempted cheating were 
              taken into consideration. Mgxashe could have been jailed for up to 10 
              years and fined for each count of cheating.</p>

              <p><strong>3 convicted of casino theft</strong></p>
              <p>TWO men and a woman were convicted of theft of gaming chips from 
              casinos on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>Carpenter Chen ShuChun, 39, was jailed for two weeks after he 
              admitted to stealing two pieces of $100 chips from Mr Tan Wee Soon, 63, 
              at Marina Bay Sands casino on June 25. A magistrate's court heard that 
              the victim was playing roulette when he went to sit on a chair in 
              between another roulette table where he had also placed his bet.</p>
              <p>Chen, a Chinese national, took the opportunity to shift Mr Tan's $200
               bet from the red colour box to the third column bet without consent. 
              The victim found his winning bet and the $400 chips he was supposed to 
              get missing and informed the croupier.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, Chen had claimed his winning of $600 from the third column
               bet and left. He subsequently gambled away the money. He was arrested 
              on July 5 at the casino.</p>
              <p>In the same court, another Chinese national Qu Lihua, 43, a study 
              mama, was fined a total of $6,000 for theft of gaming chips worth $1,000
               and $750 from two men at Resorts World Sentosa casino on May 18 and 
              June 10 respectively.</p>
              <p>A Singaporean freelance employment agent, Thio Sin Huan, 60, was fined a
               total of $4,000 for theft of two $25 chips at RWS casino on May 4. 
              Another two similar charges were taken into consideration. The maximum 
              penalty for theft is a jail term of up to three years and a fine.</p>

              <p>Tey decided to steal it.</p>
              <p>He walked to the male toilet with the handbag and took $600 cash, $600

              <p>Tey left the $5,000 handbag in the toilet.</p>
              <p>He was stopped by a security officer who checked on his identification

              <p>CHEONG Yong Heng was so brazen, he returned to steal more chips from a
               Thai national at the Marina Bay Sands casino on the afternoon of June 
              15.</p>
              <p>The 36-year-old was fined a total of $2,000 on two theft charges on 
              Thursday.</p>
              <p>A district court heard that closed-circuit television footage showed 
              Cheong standing behind a Thai woman playing Sic-Bo - a game of three 
              dice, more commonly known as 'tai sai'.</p>
              <p>While she was engrossed in the gaming, he unzipped her handbag, which
               was slung over her shoulder, and stole four $25 chips at about 2.30pm. 
              An hour later, he returned and took two more $25 chips from her handbag.</p>
              <p>The victim became aware of the theft at 3.30pm when she noticed that 
              her handbag was unzipped and some of her chips were missing. She 
              informed the casino staff, who then checked the CCTV footage.</p>
              <p>Cheong was still in the casino and was detained by security staff two
               hours later. He surrendered four $25 chips to the police and later made
               restitution of $50 to the victim.</p>
              <p>Cheong could have been jailed up to three years and/or fined up to
