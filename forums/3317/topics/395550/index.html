              <p><strong>3 foreigners caught for allegedly cheating at RWS casino</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : Three foreigners were caught for allegedly cheating at
               the casino at Resorts World Sentosa on Saturday. </span></p>
              <p><span>Two of them are French nationals, while a third is from Spain. 
              <br> <br> The three, aged between 46 and 64, are alleged to have entered the 
              casino on several occasions.
              <br> <br> Police said they were caught for committing past-posting at the roulette
               table on at least three occasions. Past-posting is the act of placing 
              the bet after the result is known.
              <br> <br> On Friday and Saturday, they were paid winnings of S$13,400 by the 
              dealers.
              <br> <br> However, their acts were detected by casino surveillance and they were 
              detained on Saturday at about 1.30pm by casino security officers, who 
              referred them to the police.
              <br> <br> The three are in Singapore on Social Visit Passes.
              <br> <br> The three men will be charged in court on Monday with cheating.
              <br> <br> If convicted, they face jail of up to 10 years, as well as a fine. </span></p>

              <p><strong>Resort World's first casino cheat gets 10 months' jail</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : A Chinese national has become the first person to be 
              convicted here for attempting to cheat the casino at Resorts World at 
              Sentosa (RWS). </span></p>
              <p><span>Hou Yongwei was sentenced to 10 months' jail for sneaking in a 
              S$600 bet - in order to deceive a dealer into paying him S$6,000 - after
               the results had been declared.
              <br> <br> The 26 year-old had attempted to commit the past-posting offence on 
              March 28 at a game called "Tai Sai" in which punters bet on the value of
               three dices rolled in a covered tumbler.
              <br> <br> The court heard that Hou tried to place his chips after the dealer had 
              lifted the cover of the tumbler and declared the winning bet to be 
              triple-4s, but was caught in the act. 
              <br> <br> He was reported to the security manager of the casino, who viewed the 
              closed-circuit television footage and confirmed Hou's offence.
              <br> <br> During sentencing, District Judge Ronald Gwee said a strong message must
               be sent out to all potential casino cheats that they would face 
              substantial sentences if they were convicted.
              <br> <br> Hou could have been jailed up to five years and fined.
              <br> <br> Meanwhile, a cashier at the Resorts World casino was charged with a 
              theft of S$10,000 from the casino.
              <br> <br> Lim Ee Wah allegedly stole the cash while she was on duty on April 6. 
              She told a district court that she intended to plead guilty and would 
              make restitution.
              <br> <br> Lim will return to court on May 10. If convicted, she faces up to seven 
              years behind bars and a fine.

              <p><strong>Cabby admits cheating casino</strong></p>
              <p>A CABBY became the first Singaporean to plead guilty on Friday to 
              cheating and attempted cheating at Resorts World Sentosa (RWS).</p>
              <p>As an undischarged bankrupt, Loo Siew Wan is banned from entering or 
              gambling in casinos here.</p>
              <p>The 53-year-old posed as his elder brother, Mr Loh Siow Kok,
               to get in by using the 55-year-old's driving licence and paying an 
              entry levy of $100 on Feb 21. The next day while playing at a baccarat 
              table, he tried to cheat by placing a bet of two $100 chips on 'banker' 
              after the winning result was declared as 'banker'.</p>
              <p>But his past-posting act was seen by a fellow gamer who 
              immediately raised an alert. Having been exposed, Loo quickly took back 
              his chips and walked away from the table. The dealer informed his pit 
              supervisor. A CCTV footage confirmed his dishonest act.</p>
              <p>When a police officer came at about 1.20am, Loo gave false 
              information by producing his brother's driving licence when asked about 
              his identity.</p>
              <p>Four other charges were taken into consideration. Loo has 
              convictions for firearm possession in 1989 and gambling in 2000. Chief 
              District Judge Tan Siong Thye will sentence Loo next Friday.</p>

              <p><strong>Man fined for casino theft</strong></p>
              <p>A MACHINE operator will serve four weeks' jail after he could not pay
               the $4,000 fine yesterday for stealing two $1,000 cash chips from a man
               at a baccarat table at the casino in Resorts World Sentosa (RWS).</p>
              <p>Tian Chun Feng, 26, took the chips from Mr Mook Swee Meng after he 
              left the game temporarily to place another bet at a nearby table.</p>
              <p>Tian, a Chinese national, who had been observing the game, 
              moved in and stole the 56-year-old hawker's cash chips when the latter 
              walked away.</p>
              <p>An unknown man saw what he did and alerted Mr Mook, who gave
               chase and managed to stop Tian.</p>
              <p>Tian returned the chips to the victim, who reported the 
              incident to the duty security officers. Tian was detained and the police
               were called.</p>
              <p>Pleading for leniency, Tian told District Judge Shaiffudin 
              Saruwan that he was in no position to pay if the court fined him.</p>

              <p><strong> MBS casino bomb hoax</strong></p>
              <p>A MAN was brought to court on Tuesday for allegedly making a bomb 
              hoax call that 10 bombs would explode at the newly-opened Marina Bay 
              Sands.</p>
              <p>No plea was taken from Fang Xing Chi, 30, a salesman.</p>
              <p>He is alleged to have called 999 at about 1.50am on Monday, 
              saying that 10 C4 or plastic bombs would explode in MBS casino and that 
              police had 12 hours to respond.</p>
              <p>He is said to have further told the operator: 'This is not a
               scenario. I am from the Islamic Jihad Party Control from Osama. This is
               real. I am from the mastermind' with the intention of inducing a false 
              belief that a terrorist act would be carried out.</p>
              <p>He was remanded for a week at Jurong police division for 
              investigation.</p>
              <p>The bespectacled Fang, who is tall and slim with short hair,
               said he wanted to get a lawyer but was facing financial difficulties.</p>
              <p>If convicted, he faces a fine of up to $100,000 and/or a 
              jail term of up to five years.</p>

              <p><strong>2 on casino cheating charges</strong></p>
              <p>A TANZANIAN has been charged with trying to cheat the newly opened 
              Marina Bay Sands (MBS) casino of $35,000 in a roulette game.</p>
              <p>Kipuyo Lemburis Israel, 34, was brought to court last Friday for 
              allegedly trying to cheat a dealer on duty at a roulette table at MBS by
               past-posting.</p>
              <p>Past-posting is the act of placing the bet after the result 
              is known.</p>
              <p>He is said to have intentionally placed a chip with a cash 
              value of $1,000 on a single number bet last Thursday after the result 
              had been declared, to induce the dealer to pay him $35,000 worth of 
              chips.</p>
              <p>The amount is the largest so far in a casino-related crime 
              here.</p>
              <p>MBS, which opened on April 27, is the Republic's second 
              integrated resort, after Resorts World Sentosa (RWS), which opened in 
              February.</p>

              <p><strong>Man fined for casino theft</strong></p>
              <p>A MAN was fined a total of $1,500 on Monday for stealing casino chips
               from gamblers at Resort Worlds Sentosa (RWS) last month.</p>
              <p>Malaysia Lai Boon Ngee, 32, a car mechanic, pleaded guilty to three 
              counts of theft from two victims, $25 worth of chips from Mr Lim Yoon 
              Hin, 38, and a $5 chip from Mr Soh Ah Seng, 47.</p>
              <p>He committed the offences between May 22 and 23.</p>
              <p>A court heard that he was at the roulette table busy 
              watching others bet on May 23 when he placed his beige-coloured chip on 
              top of Mr Lim's set of grey-coloured chips at box number 33.</p>
              <p>He then withdrew his own chip together with four of Mr 
              Lim's, pretending that he had changed his mind on the bet.</p>
              <p>Mr Lim did not realise the loss of his chips nor did he pay 
              attention to his surroundings.</p>

              <p><strong>M'sian man stole casino chips</strong></p>
              <p>A MALAYSIAN man who stole five chips amounting to $200 from a woman 
              at Resorts World Sentosa casino last week was fined $2,000 on Monday.</p>
              <p>Ahmad Sharifuddin A. Shukor, 57, pleaded guilty to stealing the chips
               from Madam Lye Sam Moi, 57, at a baccarat table on June 10.</p>
              <p>The court heard that Madam Lye was gambling with two others 
              at the casino when she told her friend, Madam Zhao Fengzhi, 49, to look 
              after a stack of chips at the edge of the baccarat table. She then went 
              to another table to gamble.</p>
              <p>Ahmad came along and told Madam Zhao, a Chinese national, 
              that the stack of chips on the table was left by his friend. But Madam 
              Zhao insisted that the stack belonged to her friend and pulled the chips
               nearer to her.</p>
              <p>After a few games, Madam Zhao turned her head when her 
              friend called her and when she turned back, the chips were gone. She 
              called Madam Lye, who returned to the table and complained to the 
              dealer.</p>
              <p>CCTV footage showed Ahmad taking the victim's chips. After 
              cashing out his chips and the victim's, he left and went to Marina Bay 
              Sands casino to gamble and lost all his money there. He could have been 
              jailed for up to three years and fined.</p>
