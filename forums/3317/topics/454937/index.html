              <p><strong>JB police form special team to investigate kidnapping case</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Malaysian media Mstar.com.my has reported that Johor 
              Bahru (JB) police have formed a special team to look into the kidnapping
               of a Singaporean family on Sunday.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The head of 
              Investigations of the Johor Police Department, Amer Awal, was quoted as 
              saying that authorities are working on several leads.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Armed men kidnapped 
              37-year-old Singaporean Rita Zahara's younger sister, two children and 
              maid, when they stopped at a petrol station in the early hours of the 
              morning on Sunday.<br><br>They took off in her car and demanded ransom for the release of Ms Zahara's family.<br><br>The family was released unharmed, after several hours.<br><br>Ms Zahara's car, a white Nissan Sunny, is still missing.<br><br>Channel
               NewsAsia spoke to a regular traveller to Johor Bahru who said such 
              crimes won't deter his travel plans but has this piece of advice.<br><br>Alan
               Tang, who travels to JB three to four times a week for work, said: "I 
              think the key thing to note is to be vigilant. Avoid quiet and isolated 
              areas. The thing that lots of people tend to overlook is the maintenance
               of your car. Make sure you have a car that is well serviced to avoid 
              having unnecessary breakdowns when you are in a foreign country. Most 
              people like to pump petrol when in Malaysia, so choose petrol stations 
              which are fairly crowded."<br><br>- CNA/ck</span></span></p>
