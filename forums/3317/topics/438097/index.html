              <p><a class="web_ticker" title="Get Quote" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=UBSN:VX">UBS AG (UBSN)</a>, the Swiss lender that says
              it sustained a $2 billion loss from unauthorized trading at its
              investment bank, told clients it “remains strong” and will
              scrutinize how it monitors risks.</p>
              <p>While the loss “is disappointing, UBS remains strong,
              well-capitalized and committed to serving you,” executives at
              UBS Financial Services wrote yesterday in an e-mail to
              customers. <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/karina-byrne/">Karina Byrne</a>, a spokeswoman for the Zurich-based
              firm, confirmed a copy of the message obtained by Bloomberg
              News.</p>
              <p>Kweku Adoboli, 31, a trader on the Delta One desk at UBS’s
              investment bank, was charged in the U.K. today with fraud and
              false accounting. UBS Chief Executive Officer <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/oswald-gruebel/">Oswald Gruebel</a> called the loss “unauthorized” and “distressing” in an e-
              mail to employees yesterday, without giving details.</p>
              <p>“UBS is taking this incident very seriously,” the firm
              said in the e-mail to customers. “In addition to cooperating
              with the authorities, UBS will thoroughly review its risk
              management and control processes.”</p>

              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE: The Government of Singapore Investment Corporation (GIC) has defended its investment in Swiss bank UBS.<br><br>This was in response to a forum letter in TODAY newspaper, which called for GIC to be more transparent with its losses.<br><br>The letter came after a US$2.3 billion loss was made by a rogue trader at UBS.<br> <br>GIC is the largest shareholder of UBS with a stake of more than six per cent.<br><br>In a letter to the media, GIC said its investment in UBS was made before the onset of the global financial crisis of 2008. <br><br>It reiterated that in retrospect, the timing for the investment could have been better. <br><br>GIC also pointed out that during the same period, it had made good investment decisions and these have offset the losses on UBS.<br><br>GIC said its total portfolio has fully recovered to its value prior to the global financial crisis.  <br><br>The firm added that it does not disclose strategies or details of specific investments to preserve its competitive edge.<br><br>It
               reiterated that its investment objective, as set out by the government,
               is to achieve good long-term returns over a 20-year investment horizon.
               <br><br>GIC said its performance is assessed based on "our overall portfolio and not on individual investments". <br><br>As of 31 March 2011, the firm's 20-year annualised real rate of return, in excess of global inflation, was 3.9 per cent.<br><br>GIC also pointed out that more information is available in its annual report, which is posted on its website.<br><br>It had bought into the bank's ordinary shares at a conversion price of 47.7 Swiss francs or $67.60 per share.<br><br>The shares closed at around 20 per cent of that value the day the loss was announced.<br><br>This
               means that since its original investment of around 11 billion Swiss 
              francs in 2008, it made an estimated paper loss of about six to seven 
              billion Swiss francs at today's price.<br><br>-CNA/wk</span></span></p>

              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>GENEVA - Swiss 
              banking giant UBS announced Saturday the resignation of chief executive 
              Oswald Gruebel, less than two weeks after the bank was rocked by a rogue
               trading scandal that lost it $2.3 billion.<br><br>Switzerland's largest bank said in a statement that its board of directors had accepted Gruebel's resignation. <br><br>Sergio
               Ermotti has been named as interim CEO effective immediately, the 
              statement said, nine days after the arrest of Kweku Adoboli, a UBS 
              trader accused of a 1.7 billion euro fraud.<br><br>UBS Chairman Kaspar 
              Villiger said in the statement that while the board "regrets" his 
              resignation Gruebel "feels that it is his duty to assume responsibility 
              for the recent unauthorised trading incident."<br><br>Villiger praised 
              Gruebel for "his uncompromising principles and integrity", and 
              acknowledged that during his tenure "he achieved an impressive 
              turnaround and strengthened UBS fundamentally."<br><br>The board also 
              said it would "fully support" the independent investigation into the 
              rogue trading and would ensure that "mitigating measures" were 
              implemented to prevent such incidents from recurring.<br><br>Swiss media
               speculation had been mounting that Gruebel would be ousted at the 
              long-scheduled UBS board meeting held in Singapore in the run-up to 
              Sunday's Grand Prix -- the bank is a major sponsor of Formula One 
              racing.<br><br>Reports said Gruebel was expected to seek a vote of 
              confidence during the meeting, with the bank under pressure from 
              shareholders and some Swiss politicians over the rogue-trading scandal.<br><br>But
               Villiger, shortly after the statement was released, told journalists 
              the UBS board did not want Gruebel to step down immediately, and would 
              have preferred he stayed on until a key shareholders' meeting, set for 
              the spring of next year.<br><br>But for Grubel, staying on until next 
              year would not have sent a strong enough signal regarding his 
              responsibility for the scandal, and so he chose to resign now, Villiger 
              explained by phone from Singapore.<br><br>When contacted by the media, a
               spokesperson from the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation 
              (GIC) declined comment on news of Gruebel's resignation.<br><br>The GIC is UBS' largest shareholder.<br><br>Earlier this week, it urged board members to act to restore faith in UBS.<br><br>It had also issued a rare public rebuke to the bank, saying it has asked UBS for details on how it planned to tighten controls.<br><br>UBS
               had turned to Gruebel, a former Credit Suisse boss, to stem its record 
              losses amid the global financial crisis and seek a way out of its bitter
               tax evasion spat with the United States.<br><br>Gruebel, 67, had 
              engineered Credit Suisse's own recovery in the early 2000s, after the 
              bank took massive charges arising from the Enron scandal. Within a year,
               the bank returned to profitability.<br><br>Likewise at UBS, Gruebel managed to restore the bank's profitability around 18 months after he took over the helm.<br><br>Within
               minutes of taking the reins at UBS, he told his staff that massive cost
               cuts were imminent and since 2009, proceeded to slash thousands of 
              jobs, trimming a bank that was getting too large to govern.<br><br>Investors
               heaved a sigh of relief when the bank not only became profitable again 
              in the third quarter of 2010, but also stemmed an outflow of client 
              assets for the first time since the financial crisis.<br><br>However, 
              Gruebel has now been forced to resign after UBS was hit with an internal
               crisis on his watch -- the discovery of unauthorised trades allegedly 
              made by Adoboli which lost the bank $2.3 billion.<br><br>Born November 13, 1943 in eastern Germany, Gruebel had entered the banking industry as an apprentice at Deutsche Bank.<br><br>His
               interim successor Ermotti had been appointed chairman and CEO of UBS 
              Group Europe, Middle East and Africa in April, according to the UBS 
              Investment Bank website.<br><br>- AFP/CNA/ls</span></span></p>
