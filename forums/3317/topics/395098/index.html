              <p> </p>
              <p>THREE-YEAR-OLD Prateek Garg once smacked his Chinese playmate for calling him Indian. 'I'm Singaporean!' bawled the child, whose favourite food is chicken rice.</p>
              <p>His mum, training and development manager Shweta Garg, 30, came to Singapore from India in 2004. Dad Vishal Garg, 32, is an assistant vice-president at Barclays Capital. They are permanent residents (PRs) here.</p>
              <p>Having picked up the Singaporean kiasu (afraid to lose) trait, the Gargs moved to a Marine Parade condominium to improve Prateek's chances of getting into nearby Tao Nan School or Ngee Ann Primary School.</p>
              <p>But a slew of recent changes to favour citizens over PRs means they get one fewer ballot than citizens for places in popular schools.</p>
              <p>'I totally agree that Singaporeans must be given a privilege, but we are doing our part for the country and giving back to it,' said Mrs Garg, about the recent changes that range from public housing to education and health care.</p>
              <p>'If my son can't get into a good school because of the balloting, what do I tell him? That it was because you are not Singaporean?'</p>
              <p>Today's Insight asks PRs what they feel about the recent changes, and whether they are now encouraged to sink roots here or seek greener pastures elsewhere.</p>

              <p>The PRs/FTs are now publicly and openly stating they are smacking Singaporean (most prob, they put race only but its plain obvious the chinese kid is a sgp since if its another PR im sure the parents will not rest easily).</p>
              <p>PRs/FTs are putting it on national paper they denounced the govt for not giving them enough priviledges, threatening as usual they will seek greener pastures if not given equal rights. Stating that they are contributing as much if not more to Singapore then Singaporeans??</p>
              <p>More then often, we keep having the same group of these FTs writing to ST Forum complaining about our system, YET they are the ones staying in our country, sucking on our economy, taking away the higher paying jobs, enjoying the high lives in Singapore AND they COMPLAIN THE MOST ABOUT unfairness?!?!?!</p>
              <p>If the govt still does not realise why singapore CITIZENS are unhappy about the way PRs and FTs are throwing their weight around us, please OPEN ur eyes and READ! this is but the tip of an iceberg, there are plenty more out there who are worse!</p>

              <p>I would not call them foreign trash otherwise we are lower ourselves to their level. PRs are fine by me, provided they are the ones doing jobs such as the construction workers, factory workers, etc. Jobs which being better educated, sgps will not do.</p>
              <p>But there is nothing wrong, unlike what a lot of people complain about no one doing the jobs so they have to look for foreigners. Do they expect a poy or uni grad to construct a HDB or work as a line worker in the factory?</p>

              <p>Samuel, the Banking and Finance industry functions differently from other industry.</p>
              <p>AVP is generally just 2-3 levels above entry level for a graduate, achievable in around 2-3 yrs if fast or 5 yrs under normal performance. Above AVP there are plenty more levels to go, not to mention each team in a dept normally have an AVP for foreign bank such as Barclays. In a department of around 20, you will be looking at around 3-5 AVPs.</p>
              <p>Even for VPs are mostly head of departments and there are a LOT of departments in a bank. Titles are much cheaper nowadays.</p>
