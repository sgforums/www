              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: The labour movement disbursed a total of S$9.13m 
              through U Care Fund to low-income union members and families through six
               different assistance programmes this year.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>This translates to helping over 90,000 low-income members and their families.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The assistance 
              programmes are U Stretch vouchers, U Care Back To School vouchers, 
              Family Recreation &amp; Fun Carnivals, U Care Education Co-Funding 
              scheme, and donations to NTUC Eldercare Trust and NTUC First Campus 
              Bright Horizons Fund. <br><br>The NTUC concludes its U Care Fund efforts
               for the year, with a U Care Back To School Fair. The fair is being held
               at the Toa Payoh Central Amphitheatre (outside Toa Payoh Library) from 
              9-11 December.<br><br>Organised yearly to complement the Back To School 
              voucher programme, the fair reaches out especially to low-income members
               with school-going children, to help lighten their expenses for the new 
              school year through exclusive deals and special promotions on 
              school-related merchandise offered by participating merchants. <br><br>The fair promotions are also extended to all union members. <br><br>In
               2011, S$3.6 million worth of U Care Back To School vouchers were 
              disbursed to help over 29,000 school-going children of low-income union 
              members prepare for the new school year. <br><br>Each child received 
              S$125 worth of Back To School vouchers, which can be used to buy 
              school-related items from participating retail outlets and authorised 
              suppliers at schools under the Ministry of Education. The vouchers can 
              also be used at the Back To School Fair.<br><br>NTUC Care and Share 
              director, Mr Zainudin Nordin, said: "This year, with concerns like 
              rising cost of living falling on the shoulders of our workers, we have 
              reviewed the application criteria of our assistance programmes. <br><br>"We
               have since increased the income ceiling so as to reach out to even more
               members. In total, the U Care Fund has disbursed about 53,000 voucher 
              booklets, over 8,000 recreation packages to some 32,000 union members 
              and their families, and supported over 6,000 students through co-funding
               of our unions’ bursary and scholarship programmes.<br><br>"We will continue to monitor the economic situation and be prepared to do even more when the need arises."<br><br>Mr
               Mohd Ali Bin Mohd Salleh, a 47-year-old taxi driver who benefited from 
              both the U Stretch and Back To School programmes, received S$725 worth 
              of assistance this year. <br><br>He said: "With six school-going 
              children and as my job does not guarantee a stable income, it can get 
              really difficult financially especially when we are looking at such a 
              gloomy economy outlook.<br><br>"I cannot express how grateful I am 
              receiving these vouchers by U Care Fund. They have helped tremendously 
              especially with expenses for my children’s new school term.” <br><br>- CNA/ir</span></span></p>
