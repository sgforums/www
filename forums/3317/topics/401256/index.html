              <p><a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=Marina+Bay+Sands&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz"><span style="color: #334499;">Marina Bay Sands</span></a> has been hit by fresh delays.</p>
              <p>Fresh reports says one of the star attractions of the integrated resort, The Lion King Show, will not make its roaring debut in September because its theatre facilities will not be ready in time.</p>
              <p><em>The Straits Times</em> understands that the award-winning Broadway musical by Disney could debut only next year.</p>
              <p>Nearly 200 applicants who were interviewed for stage, lighting and sound positions have now been told their names will be kept on file, but no date has been set.</p>
              <p>The delay comes after a wave of negative publicity for MBS.</p>
              <p>The IR was set to open last December but had to push back its soft launch to April. Then, last month, at the first major event it hosted, the Pacific Bar Association’s 20th Conference, delegates complained of power failures and lack of air-conditioning in their hotel rooms. </p>
              <p>Both sides are now locked in legal battle over payment.</p>
              <p>In related news, the centrepiece of Resort World Sentosa’s <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=RWS+Universal+Studios&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz"><span style="color: #334499;">Universal Studios</span></a>, the Battlestar Galactica ride, is still closed – more than two months after it was shut down due to a “technical glitch”.</p>
              <p>A Universal Studios spokesman declined comment on when the ride will re-open.</p>
              <p>However, a report on Genting Singapore issued last week by Bank of America Merrill Lynch said it expects the ride to re-commence only next year.</p>

              <p>For construction projects, they usually give to a main contractor who would eventually sub the projects/ supply of materials to smaller sub contractors.</p>
