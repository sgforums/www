              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam said 
              efforts to strengthen the nation's Singaporean core must be kept up.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Mr Tharman said this
               can be done by providing the best opportunities for Singaporeans to 
              develop their potential when young and have good jobs, and by ensuring 
              that the country's social policies place Singaporeans at the centre.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The deputy prime 
              minister, who is also the Minister for Finance, made the comments in a 
              Facebook post following Sunday night's National Day Rally.<br><br>On the
               issue of how Singaporeans relate to foreigners, Mr Tharman said 
              Singaporeans have reason to be concerned about the flood of foreigners 
              in the last decade.<br><br>But he cautioned that there is a need to find
               the right balance, in Singaporeans' interests, when addressing the 
              issue of foreigners. <br><br>Mr Tharman noted that the inflow of 
              foreigners has slowed as the government has tightened foreign worker 
              policies significantly over the last two years, but this has hurt local 
              small and medium enterprises (SMEs) badly. <br><br>He said the government will do all it can to help SMEs upgrade and invest in labour-saving technologies. <br><br>Mr
               Tharman also highlighted the significant shifts that have been made to 
              differentiate policies in favour of Singaporeans in the areas of 
              housing, education and healthcare.<br><br>He also said that the 
              government is "investing massively" to expand public transport and 
              relieve congestion that has also gone up over the years.<br><br>Mr 
              Tharman added that the government is doing more to help Singaporean 
              couples have children and bring them up. This, he said, is key to 
              Singapore's longer term future. <br><br>Mr Tharman also said that besides adjustments in policy, there is more that Singapore should be concerned about.<br><br>"It has to do with our national character -- the type of people we are and want to be," he said.<br><br>Most
               Singaporeans, Mr Tharman noted, are basically fair-minded, gracious 
              people, but the vitriol towards foreigners in online discussions is 
              quite out of our Singaporean character. <br><br>"Bad behaviour by a 
              small number of foreigners does not justify spiteful comments about 
              foreigners in general, or all foreigners of a particular race." he said.
               "It does no one good."<br><br>Mr Tharman urged Singaporeans to remain 
              as people who show understanding and empathy towards fellow citizens of 
              all races as well as towards foreigners working here. <br><br>But he 
              stressed that "new arrivals must make the special effort to interact, 
              make friendships with Singaporeans and respect our values". <br><br>He 
              advised new citizens to learn English, if they did not grow up with the 
              language, so that they can interact with Singaporeans of all races. <br><br>Mr
               Tharman also said improving the quality and affordability of pre-school
               for the country's children is one of the most important educational and
               social priorities of Singapore's future.<br><br>He said the country has
               to do all it can to help children from less advantaged homes in their 
              early years to develop and gain confidence in themselves. <br><br>Mr 
              Tharman added that opportunities must be made more equal so that every 
              child will be given the best chance to find his strengths as he grows 
              up. <br><br>This, he said, is the best chance to sustain social mobility, which is expected to slow down over time.<br><br>- CNA/wm</span></span></p>

              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE: Labour 
              Chief Lim Swee Say said the biggest challenge now is ensuring that 
              Singaporeans take shared ownership of the country's future. He called 
              for a consensus to forge new success areas for Singapore in the two 
              decades, including having a more gracious and inclusive society.<br><br>Mr Lim on Monday asked the Labour Movement to take action in a National Day Observance Ceremony.<br><br>Shaping
               the country's future involves everyone and Mr Lim said the next chapter
               of the Singapore story does not belong to the government alone.<br><br>He
               said: "Instead of spending time pointing fingers and blaming each 
              other, I think  we should all play our part, take action to create and 
              re-create, to make sure that this new Singapore will be something we can
               all be proud of."<br><br>Recognising domestic tensions that have 
              developed due to the influx of foreign workers, Mr Lim said a better 
              Singapore would mean a nation where both locals and non-locals 
              understand the need for each other.<br><br>He said having foreign 
              manpower supplement the labour force reflects the country's success, 
              where there is a shortage of workers because jobs outnumber the local 
              workforce.<br><br>Turning to low-wage workers, Mr Lim said what they do 
              must be respected, and noted that a key problem lies in how people view 
              certain types of work.<br><br>He said: "To succeed, it's not so much 
              about changing the legislation for this to happen, because if 
              legislation can make this happen, then we will not have the issue of a 
              widening income gap, or low-wage workers. Because at the end of the day,
               the solution has more to do with changing mindsets."<br><br>Touching on
               the national conversation the government wants to have with 
              Singaporeans, Mr Lim said it is an "all-way engagement". He urged 
              members of the labour movement to actively participate in this dialogue 
              to chart a shared vision for Singapore for current and future 
              generations.</span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Since when do Singaporeans look down on low wage workers, it is loose foreign policy that drive every one wage low.</p>
              <p>So, we are looking down at the man or woman in the mirror ?</p>
              <p>The people are already engaged but their engagement is deemed as negative and xenophobic.</p>
              <p>So, do they want to waste time and money to form useless committee to conduct fruitless conversation with single eye dragonian singaporean ?</p>
              <p>In the end to tell us the same thing, dun rely on cheng hu and you better integrate.</p>
              <p>When there is no more noise but lots of licking, the place is doomed.</p>
