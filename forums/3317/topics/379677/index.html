              <p>KUALA LUMPUR (AFP) - â€“ A Malaysian couple have been arrested for allegedly severely beating their Indonesian maid and leaving her bound and locked up in a toilet for two nights, police said Thursday.</p>
              <p>Indonesia has put a ban on sending domestic workers to Malaysia while the neighbours attempt to negotiate a deal on salaries and conditions, aimed at ending a string of appalling abuse cases.</p>
              <p>In the latest incident, a market vendor and his wife are accused of viciously beating their 36-year-old maid Mautik Hani, from Surabaya in Indonesia, who was found locked up in their house.</p>
              <p>District police chief Mohamad Mat Yusop said the man, aged in his 30s, surrendered to police on Wednesday while his 29-year-old wife was arrested on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>Newspaper reports have said that Hani was found, tied up around her hands and legs, by another Indonesian cleaner hired to replace her. She had noticed a foul smell coming from a locked bathroom.</p>
              <p>"When she was found, she was in the toilet at the back of the house. Her left eye was swollen, her right leg had a big wound that exposed the bone, and she had bruises all over her body," Mohamad told AFP.</p>
              <p>He said she was still being treated in hospital for her injuries.</p>
              <p>The New Straits Times said that Hani had been abused by her employers almost daily during the two months she worked at their home.</p>
              <p>Malaysia -- one of Asia's largest importers of labour -- depends heavily on domestic workers, mainly from Indonesia, but has no laws governing their working conditions.</p>
              <p>The government in May announced plans for new laws to protect domestic workers from sexual harassment, non-payment of wages and poor working conditions.</p>
              <p>Currently Indonesian maids typically work seven days a week for as little as 400 ringgit (113 dollars).</p>
