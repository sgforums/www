              <p>Hi Siliconchip, </p>
              <p>I am sorry, but such incident is not the fault of SAF, but the one that make the grenade.  Thus, when coming to handling of weapon, there is always an element of risk of malfunction.  </p>
              <p>I am now residing in Canada, but 20 yrs back, I serve my fair share of NS too.  Back then, we see accident almost any other days.  One incident I remembered clearly was, there's this recruit bringing his M16 to PC for checking, and fire one round off between the legs.  That will be human error.  But even then, it is not fair to blame SAF. </p>
              <p>Well, there are indeed many thing SAF has done wrong.  But this is not the one. </p>

              <p>Conscripts, who are not even full-fledged soldiers, are dying as though they are fighting a war while they are in fact undergoing training. I am talking about the big picture, recruits die every week , not all are reported by our super-free press.</p>

              <p>does compensation come into this at all? Or have they managed to get rid of all responsibility by some legal BS everyone has to sign at the start or whatever?</p>

              <p>Hi <span style="line-height: 17px; font-size: 15px; color: #333333; font-weight: bold;"><a style="text-decoration: none; color: #5d5ebc;" href="http://sgforums.com/users/273620">Siliconchip</a>, </span></p>
              <p>I agreed with what you said at 1.11am.  Report, yes they do, but not to media.  Frankly, In my course of training in SAF, I have loss 3 friends too.  1 in BMT, 2 in OCS.  We all mourned for them too.  But never report in papers, why?  Let me share:</p>
              <p>1. If news reported, how many parents will stop their kids to go NS.  If so, who will defence us?  If we have all regulars, in our small country and volatile economy, how to survive?  To expensive to have all regulars.</p>
              <p>2.Since Vietnam wall, have you not heard, how the media reporting skewed opinion, and making the commanders in the field to do their job well?  Especially the so call 'free speech nations'.  How can media help in all the battle so far?  If you are in the 'top' making decision, be it in company or in military, do you want others to report every things about you?  Or just to the relevant person who is involved?</p>
              <p>Don't get me wrong, that I am against you.  no, and I have no gain.  But a country without a strong military, have no ability to talk about peace. å¢¨å­�å…µæ³•.   I advocate peace, and we train to fight because our love ones, our friends, our land is worth fighting for.  Will you not agree?</p>
              <p>If there is no war, fine.  What I went thru' in SAF, take it as character building. æœ‰ç�†ç”±æ˜¯è®­ç»ƒï¼Œæ²¡ç�†ç”±æ˜¯ç£¨ç»ƒã€‚ If there is war, those training will come in handy. å…»å…µå�ƒæ—¥ï¼Œç”¨åœ¨ä¸€æœ�ã€‚ </p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; line-height: 17px; font-size: 15px;"><a style="text-decoration: none; color: #5d5ebc;" href="http://sgforums.com/users/273620">Siliconchip</a>, if I offend you in any way, I am sorry.  I am but your fellow Singaporean who love his country, but don't like the governing party.</span><span style="color: #333333; line-height: 17px; font-size: 15px; font-weight: bold;">  </span></p>
