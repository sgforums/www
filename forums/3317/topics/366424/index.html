              <p><strong>MM Lee speaks of need to restructure airport operations</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew said Singapore must
              restructure and strengthen its airport operations and regulatory system
              so that when recovery comes, the country's aviation sector will be
              ready to meet new challenges. <br> <br> Speaking at the launch of the newly restructured Civil Aviation
              Authority of Singapore (CAAS) and the Changi Airport Group on
              Wednesday, Mr Lee – who was instrumental in developing Changi as an
              aviation hub – noted that the economic crisis has seriously dampened
              air travel.
              <br> <br>But once the global economy recovers, he is confident the aviation
              industry will bounce back. He said the emerging economies in Asia and
              the Middle East will lead the next wave of demand for air travel and
              Singapore has to be ready for this.
              <br> <br>He said: "For the present, the aviation industry is in survival
              mode, with record-high fuel prices last year and an ongoing global
              recession. The demand for air travel and services has dropped
              drastically.
              <br> <br>"We see plunging airfares, falling demand for airlines' premium
              products and deteriorating cargo loads. All these are hitting airlines
              hard on their bottomlines."
              <br> <br>Mr Lee suggested that full service carriers re-examine their
              business models and form new alliances or mergers. He added that Changi
              Airport and Singapore Airlines must not be left behind in the different
              operating environment. <br> <br> He also stressed that one of the best investments that Singapore made
              in 1975 was to write off the S$800 million that was spent on Paya Lebar
              Airport – which was later handed over to the Air Force – and to build
              Changi Airport with two runways for S$1.5 billion.
              <br> <br>At that time, he said, it was big money. If Singapore had followed
              foreign experts' recommendation and had built the second runway at Paya
              Lebar Airport, the country's airport would not have become a global
              aviation hub.
              <br> <br>Mr Lee said Changi Airport has set the benchmark for service
              excellence and operational efficiency internationally. It has won over
              300 awards since 1987, including 13 awards in the first half of this
              year.
              <br> <br>He added: "The corporatised Changi Airport Group must have the
              drive and initiative to capitalise on the new opportunities and meet
              the increasing competition. As a corporation, it is better able to
              aggressively pursue overseas business ventures and investment
              opportunities.
              <br> <br>"It has the advantage of Changi as a brand name to enlarge its
              international presence. This will give greater flexibility to respond
              quickly to changes in the industry and in the global business
              environment. It will also attract and retain top talent to compete with
              global airport operators."
              <br> <br> The government said last year that it would be negotiating the sale of Changi Airport Group to investment firm Temasek Holdings.
