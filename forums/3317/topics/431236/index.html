              <p><span style="color: #003366;">By reading the headlines, the 1st thought that came to my mind was this guy must be a weirdo, enjoyed killing. After reading the whole article, did I realise what was his purpose of killing his own food. It was to remind him that a living thing had to die for him and be appreciative. "Angmo" mindset is always very different from Asians. What a way to be appeciative! What do you guys think? He is more on vegetarian diet.</span></p>
              <p>Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg has reportedly taken to eating only meat from animals he has killed in order to appreciate that a creature died so that he could live.</p>
              <p>The 27-year-old billionaire took on the dietary regimen as the latest in a series of "personal challenges" that he pursues in what little time he spends not working on Facebook, a Fortune magazine story explained on Thursday.</p>
              <p>"I'm eating a lot healthier foods," Zuckerberg is quoted as telling Fortune while discussing his switch to slaughtering livestock for his meals.</p>
              <p>"And I've learned a lot about sustainable farming and raising of animals," he continued. "It's easy to take the food we eat for granted when we can eat good things every day."</p>
              <p>A Silicon Valley chef who lives not far from Zuckerberg in the Northern California city of Palo Alto has introduced him to local farmers and coached him on killing his first chicken, pig, and goat, according to Fortune.</p>
              <p>His first kill was a lobster, which he executed by boiling.</p>
              <p>Larger animals that he kills are sent to a butcher, who sends the cut meat back to Zuckerberg and his girlfriend Priscilla to be cooked as they wish, the article indicated.</p>
              <p>Zuckerberg has shared his dietary endeavor on his Facebook page, where he posted a photo of a chicken he killed and dishes he made using the parts.</p>
              <p>"This year I've basically become a vegetarian since the only meat I'm eating is from animals I've killed myself," Fortune quoted Zuckerberg as saying in an email</p>
              <p>"I think many people forget that a living being has to die for you to eat meat, so my goal revolves around not letting myself forget that and being thankful for what I have."</p>
              <p>Zuckerberg said he takes on a personal challenge each year, with prior goals including learning Chinese and wearing a tie.</p>
              <p>"So far, this has been a good experience," Zuckerberg said of his new diet.</p>
              <p>"I'm eating a lot healthier foods and I've learned a lot about sustainable farming and raising of animals."</p>
              <p>He still visits restaurants, but opts for venues with vegetarian offerings, according to Fortune.</p>

              <p>he can also make his own shoes, spin his own fabric for clothes and collect rainwater, filter it for his own drinking water.</p>
              <p>Come on la...last time our ancestors all kill own food and do more in daily living.</p>
              <p>Just because now it is a modern society, it doesn't mean killing your own food to appreciate the food is more right.  You can also go and plant your own fruit trees, wait 10 years and pluck the fruits to eat . Then say i appreciate farmers.</p>
              <p> Is it feasible or not ?</p>
              <p> This Ang Mo now got money, no need to worry about daily expenses, he can experiment what he want but you go and ask a working parents to do that, see what answer he will get.</p>
              <p>Killing is still killing. So to appreciate a human, he should go and kill one, is it?</p>

              <p>Someone go and tell this co-founder, best way to appreciate food is to go absolutely hungry for three months or he must go and beg on the streets from others for food. </p>
              <p> I guarantee you he doesn't need to kill any food to appreciate it.</p>
              <p>Rich Ang Mo got nothing better to do in life, go and think up this kind of nonsense.</p>
              <p>Ask him to join the hungry africans for one year, see whether he will learn to be thankful having food on his table or not.</p>

              Wow this guy not much different as a hunter, just that he's a civilized hunter as din use gun n arrow. I rather be beggar to appreciate food better than to be like him. If I were the animal to be killed by him and yet he tells me that he feels sorry killing me and will appreciate my meat n will not waste it, I think I might vow in next life when he become an animal, I will do and say the same thing to him also.
              For those animals hv been killed by him, dono how many revengful vows these animals hv made before they are slaughtered.
              Now am in human form and hv exposed to buddhism, I will go pureland as my goal now.

              <p>Buddhism encourage no killing and vegetarianism. This guy practice killing in order to know the suffering of animals. I find his way of knowing suffering of living beings is very odd.</p>
