              <p><span>SINGAPORE: In just the month of September this year, Singapore's
              Changi Airport received another five awards including four "best
              airport" titles. </span></p>
              <p><span>Changi Airport said these awards were for its excellence in airport facilities and services.
              <br> <br> Changi Airport was voted the "Best Airport in the World" by readers of
              Business Traveller (UK edition), a leading global travel publication.
              Since it first won the title in 1988, Changi Airport has won the award
              for 22 consecutive years.
              <br> <br>Closer to home, Changi Airport received the same affirmation from
              readers of Business Traveller's Asia-Pacific edition. They chose Changi
              as the "Best Airport in the World" for the 18th consecutive year. <br> <br> In addition, Changi Airport was named "Best Airport Duty-Free in the World" by the magazine for the 12th year running.
              <br> <br> In another poll conducted by online travel magazine Smart Travel Asia,
              Changi Airport was ranked highest in the "Best Airport Worldwide"
              category out of more than 100 airports. <br> <br> According to Smart Travel Asia, Changi Airport's shopping facilities,
              greenery and colour, as well as the addition of Terminal 3 have made
              Changi "a formidable competitor".
              <br> <br>Separately, Changi Airport also received the "Best International
              Airport" accolade from Travel Weekly China - a major travel trade
              publication in China - as part of its China Travel and Meeting Industry
              Awards 2009.
              <br> <br>Chief Executive Officer of Changi Airport Group, Mr Lee Seow Hiang,
              said: "It is our top priority to continuously improve Changi's
              facilities and service standards to create an excellent Changi
              experience for travellers." <br> <br> Mr Lee added: "Despite the increasingly competitive operating
              landscape, we are heartened that Changi Airport continues to win such
              airport awards every year. <br> <br> "We appreciate the very strong support that travellers worldwide continue to give us. 
              <br> <br> "Such positive affirmation of our efforts serves as invaluable
              encouragement and motivation to all staff at Changi Airport to continue
              to do even better for all customers."
              <br> <br> Since its opening in 1981, Changi Airport has won more than 300 airport awards.
