              <p>Can a person love a dog so much that he or she is willing to part with 
                  thousands of dollars, just to be with the animal? This is the question 
                  that is bugging STOMPer MakeLoveNotWar, after he read 
                  the court case of a doctor and his ex-girlfriend, who are in a legal 
                  battle over their pet terrier.<br><br>Dr Tan Kok Chye, 36, a surgeon, 
                  and Ms Connie Tan, 29, a business executive, first bought the dog, 
                  Sasha, in August 2008, when they were living in Alabama, in the US.<br><br>When
                   they broke up shortly after that, Ms Tan brought the dog home to 
                  Singapore in November that year. However, Sasha disappeared from her 
                  Sembawang flat in March this year, and Ms Tan claims that she had learnt
                   the dog was at Dr Tan's apartment, and that he may have taken the dog 
                  from her home.<br><br>The High Court granted Ms Tan's request for the 
                  dog to be handed over to her until the ownership dispute is resolved.<br><br>After
                   reading<a href="http://thecourtroom.stomp.com.sg/stomp/courtroom/case_of_the_day/376498/doc_and_exgf_in_legal_fight_over_pet_dog.html"> </a>the story in STOMP's Court Room section, STOMPer 
                  MakeLoveNotWar wrote in STOMP, saying:<br><br>"How much would a terrier 
                  cost, $1,000 to $2,000?<br><br>"But according to the report, legal fees 
                  and costs in a High Court case can amount to at least $8,000. <br><br>"I
                   know a dog is a man's best friend and all, but is it really worth it 
                  paying so much money to fight over a dog?<br><br>"There are many poor 
                  people starving, disease-stricken and dying all over the world. Wouldn't
                   the money be put to better use by donating it to these people?<br><br>"Let's
                   talk about the issue of animal love in general, and put the case aside.<br><br>"I
                   feel that sometimes we misplace our compassion. We go on and on about 
                  how we should treat animals well, and we fight for animal rights and we 
                  spend so much money on our pets, but we do nothing about human beings 
                  dying around the world. <br><br>"We don't even need to go too far, there
                   are many needy people in Singapore that we can donate to, instead of 
                  treating our pets like kings."</p>

I can buy a new tv, i can just marry and get new family members..Not something that anyone would do rite?<br><br>It went to court cos she has exhausted all other means to get back what was hers through proper procedure with relevant authorities.

Sasha is important to her. It doesnt matter if its a dog, a car, a phone without ur own sex videos on it. Its just something important. I'm sure most would do alot when its something important to them.</p>

              <p>the dog belonged to them both, no ? .....</p>
              <p>this is what happens when two well educated, rational adults decide to behave irrationally .....</p>
              <p>so why should the police take sides ? ... don't you find it ridiculous that a dispute over the ownership of a pet dog has to involve the police and now, *smack forehead, the courts .......</p>
              <p>yes, we spend lots of money on the police ... so I would much rather they spend their time looking out for terrorists and catching rapists and murderers or something .... rather than mediating in the dispute of a pet dog ... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>

              <p>In order to make judgement or opinion of something..you should first know how it happened..whether they are irrational or not..thats not the point. Cos for you to do so would be irrational now wont it?</p>
              <p>Point is..what would you do if someone comes and take something valuable to you? If you are married, got divorced or things go wrong between the 2 of you..and your ex spouse decides to sneak  into your house..take your child and dump you child at his/her parents place. What would you do?</p>
              <p>If someone goes into your house, clean up all your belongings, what would you do? And if you go to the police making a report and they ask you do you have prove that things was stolen, how would you feel?</p>
              <p>It went to court simply because there was already no other alternatives to take...the law &amp; justice can only be served by the courts..the police cant do anything really. They dont mediate either. Are you tryin to say that if someone stole something valuable from you..you would just say..oh well?</p>
