              <p><strong>Source: Tribune online</strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>REUTERS: The father of al Qaeda-inspired gunman Mohamed Merah, who was shot dead by French police in March after going on a killing spree, has filed a murder suit in Paris, his lawyers said on Monday.</strong></p>
              <p>“This is a suit against unnamed persons for murder with aggravating circumstances concerning those who gave the orders at the top of the police” during the assault on Merah’s flat in Toulouse, said lawyer Isabelle Coutant-Peyre.</p>
              <p>Mohamed Benalel Merah said in March that he wanted to sue the RAID elite police unit that shot dead his son on March 22 during a shootout at the end of a 32-hour siege at his flat in the southern French city.</p>
              <p>The 23-year-old had shot dead three soldiers, and three children and a teacher at a Jewish school, in a wave of killings that shocked the country.</p>
              <p>He filmed himself carrying out the attacks and reportedly confessed to police before he was shot dead.</p>
              <p>“You’ve got 300 to 400 heavily armed people and a guy shut up all alone in his apartment. That alone is enough to raise questions,” said Coutant-Peyre, who is part of Merah’s legal team headed by Algerian lawyer Zahia Mokhtari.</p>
              <p>She said the family had video evidence that would be handed over to the authorities when they requested it.</p>
              <p>Mokhtari said in April that she had proof that Merah was “liquidated”, including two 20-minute videos probably filmed by Merah himself before he was shot dead.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You all know the details. The horrific mass murder of over seven innocent ppl, even three CHILDREN and a teacher outside a jewish SCHOOL. So, a selfcon-fessed mass-murderer who carried out seven hate killings, FILMED himself egoistically doing it, then and i quote the intl' herald tribune, "tried to shoot his way out of the siege in Toulouse after police from the elite RAID force entered his flat"</p>
              <p>He died after the french RAID team plastered his body with bullets. like a pincushion.</p>
              <p>So, with that fact in mind, now his daddy files a lawsuit against the RAID team(an equivalent of the SWAT team) for 'murder' of his son in an 'unwarranted', 'excessive' use of violence.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Was it really 'excessive'?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>mind you, the victims' families haven't even bothered to file a lawsuit of their own against the so-called victim's brother and father for their own hand in the killings, no?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>my view? one word: self-defence. why the court didn't throw out the case is an injustice in itself to the victims and the RAID team.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Still, an interesting topic. your views on this?</p>

              <p>I say so what he is unarmed.</p>
              <p>Mohamed Merah wasn't about to surrender. If I remember correctly he jumped out of a window. </p>
              <p>With the current situation of mass killings, by such lunatics, he should be peppered with bullets before he can press a button. Before he can so much as say Aa. </p>
              <p>So what if after he is pin cushioned by machine guns,  they find nothing on him.</p>
              <p>The police did the right thing by not taking chances. </p>
