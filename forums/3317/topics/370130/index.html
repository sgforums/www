              <p><strong>Serial con woman arrested for cheating men of their money</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: A woman, believed to be responsible for a series of
              cases of offering sex for cash and faking her own kidnapping, has been
              arrested. The suspect is an unemployed 22-year-old Chinese. </span></p>
              <p><span> On Wednesday at about 1am, the woman befriended a 24-year-old Chinese
              man through an Internet chatroom and offered sexual services in
              exchange for S$300. </span></p>
              <p><span> The two arranged to meet at a coffeeshop in Geylang the same day at
              about 2.35am. Upon receiving the cash, the suspect excused herself to
              go to the toilet but failed to return. The man then tried contacting
              the woman through her handphone. </span></p>
              <p><span> He also searched for her but to no avail. One and a half hours later,
              the man received a text message from the suspect claiming that she had
              been kidnapped. </span></p>
              <p><span> She requested him to help her by transferring an additional S$500 to an
              unknown bank account. At this point, the man decided to report the
              matter to the police. </span></p>
              <p><span> The suspect was arrested at Jellicoe Road on Thursday at about 10.45pm. </span></p>

              <p>POLICE have arrested three Chinese men aged between 38 and 48 years
              old for involvement in a case of armed robbery which took place earlier
              on June 18.</p>
              <p>At about 12.20 pm that day, the three suspects had robbed a
              29-year-old Chinese man of his cash and belongings worth about $400
              along Ang Mo Kio Ave 4.</p>

              <p><strong>Two conmen prey on elderly victims in 'drop money' scam</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Two men managed to con elderly victims of their cash and valuables worth $25,000 last week.
              <br> <br> Police say the conmen used the 'drop money' scam.
              <br> <br> Typically, the cases would involve the first culprit dropping his
              wallet near the targeted victim, after which his accomplice would pick
              it up and offer to split the money with the victim. <br> <br> The accomplice would hand over the wallet to the victims for
              safekeeping in exchange for the victim's valuables as collateral before
              making some excuse to leave the victim for a short while. <br> <br> When the accomplice fails to return as promised, the victims would end up with an empty wallet stuffed with tissue paper.
              <br> <br> So far, cases have been reported in Eu Tong Sen Street, Jalan Besar,
              Armenian Street, Telok Ayer Street/Cecil Street, Raffles Place, Bugis
              and Upper Wilkie Rd.
              <br> <br> Most of the victims were elderly persons aged between 60 to 79 years old.
              <br> <br> Police are appealing for information on the two men to help them with their investigations.
              <br> <br>Both men are believed to be Chinese aged between 40 to 50 years
              old. The first man is described as medium and plump in built, about 1.5
              to 1.6 metres tall, with short hair, and often seen wearing a T-shirt
              with dark coloured pants.
              <br> <br>The second man is described to be of medium and stout in built,
              about 1.8 metres tall, and spotting short black hair with a receding
              front hairline. He is also often seen wearing t-shirt with
              shorts/bermudas.
              <br> <br> Anyone with information on the two men is requested to call the Police Hotline at 1800-2550000. </span></p>

              <p>TO PROTECT her then boyfriend, a narcotics officer deleted his
              mobile and messages on a suspected drug offender's cellphone.</p>
              <p>Not only that, Norini Mohamed Aloon also tipped off her then
              boyfriend, Imran Mohamed, 33, that one Feroz Khan Surattee, 41, had
              been arrested.</p>
              <p>Feroz's phone had been seized by the Central Narcotics Bureau after
              a party of officers arrested him at his Circuit Road flat on Feb 18
              last year for possession and consumption of a controlled drug.</p>
              <p>CNB officer Mohammad Khairudin Rahmat, 28, found a text message on
              Feroz's phone from a mobile used by Imran saying that Imran would
              contact Feroz later to collect some heroin.</p>
              <p>Mr Khairudin also noticed there were other messages involving Imran's number on Feroz's phone.</p>
              <p>As they were leaving the flat, he handed the phone to Norini for safe-keeping.</p>
              <p>On their way to the van, Norini checked Feroz's mobile and noticed Imran's number in various folders.</p>
              <p>She quickly deleted all contents relating to Imran's mobile from the text message and call folders of Feroz's cellphone.</p>
              <p>The number which Imran used was actually subscribed by Norini's
              brother, Nordin, 35, who had allowed her to let Imran use the SIM card.</p>
              <p>When Mr Khairudin later realised that some of the text messages had been deleted, he alerted his superior.</p>
              <p>On being confronted, Norini admitted that she had deleted some of
              the text messages in Feroz's mobile to screen her boyfriend and brother
              from CNB investigation and prosecution.</p>
              <p>Norini was jailed for seven months on Wednesday after she admitted
              to destroying evidence and communicating secret information to an
              unauthorised person.</p>
              <p>She could have been jailed for up to two years and/or fined for destroying electronic record.</p>
              <p>Under the Official Secrets Act, she could have been fined up to $2,000 and jailed for up to two years.</p>

              <p><strong>Couple stole S$16,000 worth of toiletries</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: They had stolen toiletries to the tune of about
                  S$16,000 from supermarkets all over Singapore in eight months, and had
                  17 charges against them. </span></p>
              <p><span> But because Daniel Wong Chee Kian, 38, is a schizophrenic and his wife,
                  39-year-old Boo Lee Choo, has a mood disorder — according to their
                  Institute of Mental Health reports — the prosecution had already
                  reduced the number of charges against them to one each. </span></p>
              <p><span> And on Wednesday, they were both given a conditional discharge for
                  stealing with a common intention. The couple’s lawyer had urged the
                  court to grant them a conditional discharge and said they both seemed
                  to be on the road to recovery after going for medical treatment. </span></p>
              <p><span> Wong had originally faced 10 charges and Boo seven. </span></p>
              <p><span> On January 21 last year, Wong and Boo went to the Cold Storage
                  supermarket at Parkway Parade, took toiletries off the shelves and
                  placed them in a shopping basket as they walked through the lanes. </span></p>
              <p><span> A loss prevention officer, Mr Kelvin Po, who was monitoring the store’s
                  CCTV cameras found their behaviour suspicious and went to the lanes to
                  observe them. </span></p>
              <p><span> He saw Boo taking out items from the shopping basket that Wong was holding and placing them in a red paper bag. </span></p>
              <p><span> The couple then walked out of the supermarket without paying for the
                  items in the red paper bag. Those were valued at around S$150. </span></p>
              <p><span> Mr Po approached them but before he was able to introduce himself, Boo
                  tried to escape. She struggled with Mr Po and scratched his hands. Wong
                  ran away during the scuffle. </span></p>
              <p><span> Boo was eventually detained. Wong was arrested later. </span></p>

              <p>Upon reaching the carpark of Block 133 Pasir Ris Street 11, the
              suspect pinned a sharp object against the taxi driver's neck, and
              demanded that valuables be handed over.</p>
              <p>The suspect then took off with cash amounting to about 100 dollars and the victim's handphone.</p>
              <p>He will be charged in court tomorrow for armed robbery.</p>
              <p>If convicted, the man faces a jail term of up to 14 years and a minimum of 12 strokes of the cane.</p>

              shopping malls.</p>
              <p>The culprits are known to work in groups of twos or threes and would

              on the pretext of changing money.</p>
              <p>They have been known to also make small purchases, or request to view the variety of Singapore notes in the cash register.</p>
              <p>While talking with the victim, one of the culprits would take a
              stack of notes from the victim's hands or directly from the cash
              register.</p>
              <p>The culprit would then pretend to count the notes or browse through them out of interest.</p>
              <p>The other accomplices would also distract the victim by making other enquiries.</p>

              <p>The stack of notes would eventually be returned to the victim, but with some of the money stolen.</p>

              <br> <br> The cash and valuables stolen are said to amount to some S$3,000.

              him carrying a billiard cue and behaving suspiciously at a void deck in
              the vicinity of Hougang Ave 10.
              <br> <br> If convicted, he could be jailed up to 14 years and caned. </span></p>

              <p>Police have arrested a man for allegedly posing as an HDB contractor.</p>
              <p>The arrest comes just two weeks after they nabbed another man who's believed to have committed a similar offence.</p>
              <p>The 32-year old Chinese man who they caught yesterday is allegedly involved in more than 20 cases of cheating.</p>
              <p>It's believed that since July this year, the suspect would persuade
              his victims to replace their old wooden doors and metal gates with new
              ones.</p>
              <p>He would allegedly issue them with an invoice after pocketing the cash handed over to him as payment for the items.</p>
              <p>He would then dupe his victims by claiming he would install the doors and gates in a few days' time.</p>
              <p>But police say, the promised items never materialised and the suspect would be uncontactable.</p>
              <p>Through their investigations, officers from Clementi Police Division
              managed to arrest him along Geylang Road at around 6pm yesterday.</p>
              <p>The suspect will be charged with cheating in court tomorrow.</p>
              <p>If convicted, he could be jailed up to ten years and fined.</p>

              <p>Police have arrested two Vietnamese believed to be responsible for a string of pickpocketing cases in the Bugis area.</p>
              <p>One of them's a 20 year old man while his accomplice is a 60 year old woman.</p>
              <p>Plainclothes officers from the Central Police Division were
              conducting anti-crime patrols around Bugis Junction shopping mall
              yesterday afternoon when they noticed the suspects tailing some of the
              passers-by.</p>
              <p>The woman was then spotted peering into a shopper's bag while the man appeared to be acting as a lookout.</p>
              <p>She allegedly slipped her hand into the bag and felt around its contents before walking away with her companion.</p>
              <p>Officers moved in to arrest the duo after they witnessed this.</p>
              <p>The suspects were found with four Ez-link cards and two mobile phones - all believed to be stolen from their victims.</p>
              <p>The duo will be charged with theft in court tomorrow morning.</p>

              <p>Police raided a retailer at COMEX IT fair today and seized 55
              laptops installed with unlicensed Microsoft Windows XP Professional
              software worth more than $30,000.</p>
              <p>The China-made "Losang" branded laptops were also affixed with
              recycled Certificates of Authenticity - a label to help buyers
              determine whether the software they are buying is genuine.</p>
              <p>These certificates should not be sold independently of the software.</p>
              <p>The raid took place after the authorities received a tip-off through
              the Business Software Alliance anti-piracy hotline yesterday.</p>
              <p>Following this incident, Microsoft Singapore has urged consumers to exercise vigilance when purchasing computers.</p>
              <p>They must also ensure that they do not end up with systems pre-installed with illegal software.</p>
              <p>Jonathan Selvasegaram, Microsoft Southeast Asia's Corporate Attorney
              for Intellectual Property, says pirated software can pose a serious
              security threat.</p>
              <p>That's because illegal programmes can lead to a corrupted system, loss of data and identity theft.</p>
              <p>Investigations revealed that several hundred units of "Losang"
              laptops containing unlicensed software may have been imported into
              Singapore for sale during COMEX, says Mr Selvasegaram.</p>
              <p>The annual fair, which kicked off yesterday, is organised by publisher of IT-related products, Eastern Directories.</p>
              <p>Its General Manager, Melvin Koh.</p>
              <p>"We are actually investigating the case together with Microsoft itself. But we have yet to come up with anything yet."</p>
              <p>Under the Copyright Act, those found guilty of selling counterfeit
              software can be fined up to $10,000 for each article, jailed a maximum
              of five years or both.</p>
