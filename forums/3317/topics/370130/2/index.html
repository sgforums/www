              <p>Pressure vessels manufacturer, Steel Forming and Rolling Specialists
              and its Managing Director, Gan Oh Boon, was convicted of tax evasion
              this afternoon. <br> <br> This is the first company and director to be convicted of abusing a tax exemption scheme for new companies in Singapore. <br> <br> Investigations revealed that the company set up six related companies in December 2004 to abuse the scheme. <br> <br> The company included fictitious expenses amounting to some 1.6 million
              dollars in its audited statements of accounts for the years 2004 to
              2006, although no work or services were performed by them for the
              company. <br> <br> Steel Forming and Rolling Specialists consequently under-reported its
              profits by the same amount in its income tax returns for the Years of
              Assessment 2005 to 2007. <br> <br> Investigations also showed that Gan had omitted employment income in
              the form of benefits-in-kind, made up of hire-purchase instalments for
              his private car and his other private expenses paid for by the company. <br> <br> Mr Gan was jailed for two weeks and ordered to pay almost 997 thousand dollars in fines and penalties. <br> <br> The company was ordered to pay over a million dollars in fines and penalties.</p>

              <p><span>On Friday, Chye Siew Kok, 59, a former Ministry of Manpower (MOM)
              corporate service officer, was charged in court with cheating and
              forgery. <br> <br> In July 2006, Chye had forged a National Environment Agency food stall
              licence for his Xing Hua (Putien) Cuisine coffee shop stall at Foch
              Road, which he operated with a business partner, to deceive MOM.
              <br> <br> The next month, Chye told MOM twice that his stall had a valid licence, so that he could obtain the employment pass.
              <br> <br>If convicted, Chye can be jailed up to seven years with a fine, on
              each count of cheating. For forgery, the maximum jail term is 10 years,
              with a fine.

              <p><strong>Two men charged with attempting to get sexual favours</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Two men have been charged, separately, with attempting
              to obtain sexual favours in return for turning a blind eye on smoking
              offenders. </span></p>
              <p><span>One of them is 32-year-old Mohamed Rafi Abdul Alim who was
              employed by Certis-CISCO Security and attached to the National
              Environment Agency (NEA) as an enforcement officer.
              <br> <br>Along with three other officers, he approached a girl whom he saw
              smoking with her friends at the basement carpark of Queensway Shopping
              Centre in March this year.
              <br> <br>The girl and her friends were in school uniforms. The officers then
              took down the students' particulars and gave them a verbal warning.
              <br> <br>However, shortly after this, Mohamed Rafi allegedly sent the girl a
              text message asking for sexual services. It is believed that he
              promised not to refer her to the relevant authorities should she give
              in to his request.
              <br> <br>42-year-old Koh Hui Chong, a former NEA officer, faced a similar
              charge. He noticed a boy in his school uniform smoking at a playground
              in late April last year. <br> <br> Koh approached the student and informed him that he will be booked for
              under-aged smoking. He also asked the boy for his parents' contact
              details so that he could speak to them about the matter.
              <br> <br>However, the student gave him false information about his father.
              In response to this, it is believed that Koh approached the boy's
              school to obtain the details even though he was not authorised to do
              so.
              <br> <br>Koh then allegedly contacted the boy's mother in early May last
              year, asking for sexual services in return for not taking action
              against her son.
              <br> <br>If convicted under the Prevention of Corruption Act, both men could
              each be jailed up to five years and fined a maximum of S$100,000.

              <p>A Lead Aircraft Technician from SIA Engineering was charged in court with forgery this morning.<br> <br> Thirty-eight year old Kevin Sim Kar Yong was found to have forged a letter in July last year. <br> <br> The letter was addressed to a Senior Airworthiness Manager, Quek Tong Huat, from the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore. <br> <br> Sim tried to trick the manager into thinking that the letter was written by another colleague Lim Joo San. <br> <br> In the letter, he offered to bribe the manager with an unspecified sum
              of money in exchange for allowing Lim to pass the Aircraft Maintenance
              Technician examination. <br> <br> If found guilty, Sim faces a fine or imprisonment of up to four years or to both.</p>

              <p><strong>Counterfeit electronic goods syndicate busted</strong></p>
              <p>Police have broken a counterfeit electronic goods syndicate at Sim Lim Square following a 14-hour operation. <br> <br> Officers from the Criminal Investigation Department conducted raids at 12 outlets within the mall yesterday morning. <br> <br> Ten men and five women were arrested for possessing suspected
              counterfeit items with an estimated street value of 320 thousand
              dollars for the purpose of trade. <br> <br> The 15 are believed to be part of the same syndicate; two of them are believed to be the syndicate leaders. <br> <br> Items seized were mainly mobile phones purportedly from well-known
              brands as well as suspected counterfeit stickers and documents of
              renowned electronic products. <br> <br> Investigations are still ongoing.</p>
