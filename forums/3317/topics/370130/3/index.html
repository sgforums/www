              <p><strong>Man charged for corruption</strong></p>
              <p>A 43-year-old Singaporean has been charged with corruption. <br> <br> Self-employed Hamzah Karim, acted as a coordinator, referring motor
              vehicle accident cases to law firms in order to file a claim with
              insurance companies. <br> <br> In August 2006, the accused had allegedly arranged for a learner bike rider  to make a false accident report. <br> <br> The female rider met the accused at Changi General Hospital while
              seeking treatment for an injury that she sustained during a practical
              test for her bike licence. <br> <br> The accused said she could use her injury to make a false accident claim to make more money. <br> <br> Sometime later, the accused introduced a male friend and instructed her
              to lie that she was riding pillon when they collided with a taxi. <br> <br> If found guilty, Hamzah could face a maxmum penalty of a $100 thousand fine and imprisonment of five years.</p>

              <p><span>SINGAPORE: He took his friend's car – by force – and drove it for
              more than a month. Now David Tay Chin Heng, 36, will be caned and
              jailed for not knowing how to accept "no" for an answer. </span></p>
              <p><span>Tay had wanted to borrow the Honda Fit on March 4 this year, but his friend refused, saying he needed it for work.
              <br> <br> The odd-job labourer continued his attempts to persuade his friend, but
              when the latter would not budge, Tay pulled out a metal rod from his
              pouch and warned his friend not to "make him go crazy".
              <br> <br>When his friend tried to drive out of the car park at Kaki Bukit
              Place, Tay snatched the key out of the ignition. Out of fear, his
              friend surrendered the vehicle to him and made a police report the next
              day.
              <br> <br>The car was found more than a month later, abandoned in Bencoolen
              Street. The police found a metal rod, a baseball bat and a Swiss Army
              knife in the vehicle.
              <br> <br>On Monday, Tay was jailed three years and a month, and ordered to
              be caned 12 times for robbery and driving without a valid licence and
              insurance. He will also be disqualified from driving for four years
              after his release.

              <p><strong>ICA foils cigarette smuggling attempt</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) officers
              foiled a cigarette smuggling attempt at the Tuas Checkpoint last
              Friday. </span></p>
              <p><span>8,349 cartons of duty-unpaid cigarettes were found hidden among boxes of plastic storage containers in a container truck.
              <br> <br> The potential customs duty and GST payable for the contraband cigarettes amounted to some S$640,000.
              <br> <br> There was drama when the Malaysian driver was directed to an inspection
              bay after a routine scan found anomalies in the images. He crashed the
              prime mover into a pillar when the vehicle was directed to an
              inspection bay.
              <br> <br> The 47-year-old driver was found not qualified to handle a prime mover and referred to the Police for investigations.
              <br> <br> A relief driver and an assistant, who were sent by the company to take over the vehicle, were asked to witness the inspection.
              <br> <br>Both Malaysian drivers claimed that they were engaged by a "Mr
              Foo", also a Malaysian, to deliver the goods as the driver had met an
              accident.
              <br> <br>"Mr Foo" had also arranged for a car outside the Tuas Checkpoint to
              lead them to the delivery venue, as they were unfamiliar with the roads
              in Singapore.
              <br> <br>Each of them would be paid 200 ringgit when they return to
              Malaysia. They are currently assisting the Singapore Customs in their
              investigation.
