              <p><strong>Yemeni 12-year-old dies in labor</strong></p>
              <p class="first">SAN'A, Yemen - A 12-year-old Yemeni child-bride died
              after struggling for three days in labor to give birth, a local human
              rights organization said Saturday.</p>
              <p>Fawziya Abdullah Youssef died of severe bleeding on Friday while
              giving birth to a stillborn in the al-Zahra district hospital of
              Hodeida province, 140 miles (223 kilometers) west of the capital San'a.</p>
              <p>Child
              marriages are widespread in Yemen, the Arab world's poorest country,
              where tribal customs dominate society. More than a quarter of the
              country's females marry before age 15, according to a recent report by
              the Social Affairs Ministry.</p>
              <p>Youssef was only 11 when her father
              married her to a 24-year-old man who works as a farmer in Saudi Arabia,
              said Ahmed al-Quraishi, chairman of Siyaj human rights organization,
              which promotes the rights of children in Yemen.</p>
              <p>Al-Quraishi said
              that he stumbled upon Youssef in the hospital while investigating cases
              of children who had fled from the fighting in the north.</p>
              <p>"This is
              one of many cases that exist in Yemen," said al-Quraishi. "The reason
              behind it is the lack of education and awareness, forcing many girls
              into marriage in this very early age."</p>
              <p>Impoverished parents in
              Yemen sometimes give away their young daughters in return for hefty
              dowries. There is also a long-standing tribal custom in which infant
              daughters and sons are promised to cousins in hopes it will protect
              them from illicit relationships, he said.</p>
              <p>Al-Quraishi said there are no statistics to show how many marriages involving children are performed every year.</p>
              <p>The
              issue of child brides vaulted into the headlines here two years ago
              when an 8-year-old Yemeni girl went by herself to a courtroom and
              demanded a judge dissolve her marriage to a man in his 30s. She
              eventually won a divorce, and legislators began looking at ways to curb
              the practice.</p>
              <p>In February, parliament passed a law setting the
              minimum marriage age at 17. But some lawmakers are trying to kill the
              measure, calling it un-Islamic. Before it could be ratified by Yemen's
              president, they forced it to be sent back to parliament's
              constitutional committee for review.</p>
              <p>Such marriages also occur in
              neighboring oil-rich Saudi Arabia, where several cases of child brides
              have been reported in the past year, though the phenomenon is not
              believed to be nearly as widespread as in Yemen.</p>
