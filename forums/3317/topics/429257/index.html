              <h1 class="storyheadline">Crew of hijacked Singaporean tanker 'safe': Report</h1>
              <p>SEOUL - THE 25-strong crew of a Singaporean chemical tanker boarded 
              by pirates off Kenya are safe, the South Korean Yonhap news agency 
              reported Wednesday, citing Seoul's foreign ministry.</p>
              <p>The MT Gemini was carrying over 28,000 tonnes of crude palm oil from 
              Indonesia to Kenya when it was hijacked just off Kenyan waters on April 
              30 and diverted towards Somalia.</p>
              <p>The vessel's owner, Glory Ship Management, said on Sunday it last 
              communicated with the crew - comprising 13 Indonesians, three Myanmar 
              nationals, five Chinese and four South Koreans - early afternoon 
              Singapore time on the day of the hijacking.</p>
              <p>'The captain of the vessel contacted the shipping line in 
              Singapore earlier in the day via satellite phone and confirmed all crew 
              members were unharmed,' Yonhap quoted an unnamed foreign ministry source
               as saying on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>The hijackers have yet to make demands or ask the company to
               pay ransom for the crew and ship, Yonhap said, adding that no other 
              information on the hostages was currently available. The 25-strong crew 
              also included 13 Indonesians, three Myanmar nationals and five Chinese, 
              Yonhap reported.</p>
              <p>In November last year, a Singapore-flagged cargo ship with 
              19 Chinese crew which had been hijacked by pirates off the coast of 
              Somalia five months before was freed after sources said a ransom of 
              several million dollars was paid. -- AFP</p>
