Drive carefully and don't act like you're in singapore. Respect others. Speak a bit of malay to get by. The malays get cheesed off if you don't understand them. At least if you put some effort to speak their language, they'll be ok. Don't flaunt money or jewellery there.</p></div>

              <h1 class="headline">M’sia Immigration: Women's explanation 'suspicious'</h1>
              <p>Malaysia's Immigration Department has questioned the version of events given by the two Singaporean women who alleged they were mistreated by immigration officials in Johor Bahru, labelling their explanation "suspicious".</p>
              <p>In a statement obtained by <em>Yahoo! Singapore</em>, Immigration 
              Department Director-General Alias bin Ahmad confirmed the two women were
               arrested last week under the Immigration Act for not having valid 
              passes for entry into Malaysia.</p>
              <p>The duo could have been fined RM10,000 or jailed up to five years and caned six times.</p>
              <p>Datuk Alias said the women's earlier explanation that they were unsure 
              of immigration procedures at the Customs checkpoint was suspicious 
              because "both passports showed that both had been to Malaysia a number 
              of times."</p>
              <p>His statement added their most recent visits were on 
              31 July 2010 and April 6 this year. As such, the statement said their 
              allegation that there was no immigration officer at the check-in counter
               was "not reasonable".</p>
              <p>In addition, the statement said "all 38 counters were fully open to the public" on the day.</p>
              <p>In
               earlier reports, the two Singaporean women -- Lim Lili and Zhan 
              Tingting (not their real names) -- claim the lane they had entered was 
              unmanned.</p>
              <p>In particular, Miss Lim said she had been to JB many 
              times with her friends but it was her first time driving across the 
              Causeway. Also because it was her first time experiencing the new biometric scanner at the counter, the estate agent in her 20s said she tried using the intercom to ask an officer for help.</p>
              <p>After
               waiting for five minutes, they decided to move on without getting their
               passports stamped but after realising their mistake, they returned to 
              the
              customs checkpoint but were subsequently arrested and sent to a nearby 
              detention
              centre. There, they were ordered to strip and do squats in the nude.</p>
              <p>The
               statement said the women's treatment at the detention centre was 
              according to "standard operating procedures" as required for admission 
              of new prisoners. This includes a "thorough examination of the body of 
              the new detainees to ensure that no prohibited goods were hidden in body
               parts".</p>
              <p>The examination, it said, was conducted by an on-duty 
              female officer in a room in accordance with the standard procedures. The
               case was referred to the Deputy Public Prosecutor, who finally decided 
              to let the women off with a stern warning the next day.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, both women are set to file an official complaint against the <span id="lw_1308058946_0" class="yshortcuts">Immigration Department</span> of <span id="lw_1308058946_8" class="yshortcuts">Malaysia</span>.</p>
              <p>A spokesperson from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) told <em>Yahoo! Singapore</em> on Tuesday night that the two women had met its consular officers and 
              that they wanted to lodge a formal complaint to the Malaysian High 
              Commission. It's understood the MFA will help forward the complaint.</p>
              <p>The spokesperson added its consulate in <span id="lw_1308058946_3" class="yshortcuts">Johor Bahru</span> has also contacted Malaysian immigration authorities to inquire on the 
              immigration and detention procedures the women were subjected to.</p>
              <p>However, other representatives from within the <span id="lw_1308058946_5" class="yshortcuts">Immigration Department headquarters</span> in Kuala Lumpur that <em>Yahoo! Singapore</em> spoke to said the two women could have "blown the story out of proportion".</p>
              <p>A public relations officer, who wanted to be known only as Haidir, 
              said the two ladies should have waited at the immigration counter for an
               officer to assist them, even if the booth was unmanned.</p>
              <p>Otherwise, they should have approached any of the other officers in adjacent lanes, he added.</p>
              <p>"It is common sense for one to get his or her passport stamped upon 
              crossing the Causeway," said another immigration officer at the 
              Immigration of Johor State headquarters.</p>
              <p>"Just like Singapore, you need to get your passport stamped before 
              you enter the country; if not, you will be arrested... so it is the same
               procedure in Malaysia," said the officer, who declined to be named.</p>

              ill-treatment of two Singaporean women at the Pekan Nenas Detention 
              Centre recently.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The women were made to strip and do squats at the centre.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Responding to media

               as soon as the Singapore authorities receive it, their statement would 
              be handed to the Malaysian High Commission, with the hope this would 
              help the Malaysian investigators come to a quick conclusion.<br><br>Singapore said it will closely monitor the outcome of the official investigation.<br><br>The
               spokesman confirmed there had been several previous cases of 
              Singaporeans who had reported their passports were not stamped at 
              Malaysian Immigration checkpoints, and who had as a result, encountered 
              difficulties on exit.<br><br>As such the ministry reminds all 
              Singaporeans travelling to Malaysia, and in particular to Johor by road,
               to be vigilant and ensure their passports are stamped at entry and exit
               by the Malaysian Immigration authorities.<br><br>-CNA/ac</span></span></p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">JB officials suspended over nude squat claim</h1>
              <p>TWO Johor Baru immigration officials have been suspended over the 
              treatment of the Singaporean women detained last week - as the Singapore
               Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) said it would 'closely monitor' the 
              outcome of Malaysia's investigation.</p>
              <p>The two women have said they were ordered to undress and do squats 
              after accidentally passing through immigration without getting their 
              passports stamped.</p>
              <p>Malaysia's Immigration Department director-general Alias Ahmad said 
              yesterday that the officials have been suspended until the seven-man 
              panel completes its investigation. Meanwhile, the MFA said the 
              allegations 'are serious and raise concerns'. 'We welcome the quick 
              announcement of the Malaysian authorities of an immediate 
              investigation,' said a spokesman.</p>
              <p>Malaysia set up its multi-agency inquiry on Wednesday to 
              investigate the incident, which has led to criticism of the women's 
              treatment from both sides of the Causeway.</p>
              <p>The committee, comprising officials from the police, 
              prisons, immigration and detention centre departments, headed to Johor 
              yesterday to start the probe. Mr Alias told the Nanyang Siang Pau 
              newspaper the committee has been instructed to complete the task in five
               days, then submit a report to the Immigration Department. He said it 
              would summon the two Singaporean women if necessary.</p>
              <p>He stressed that their detention was legal as they had 
              broken Malaysia's Immigration Act and did not pass through the biometric
               fingerprint checks.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Seriously, if we do the same to the two malaysian girls (who happens to come from their major race) and claim that is a standard procedure. Do you think their official will be so yaya? They probably demand the same kind of explanation. talking about common sense. Leaving the barrier open without immigration officer is stupidity. The 2 girls are equally dumb too. No see coffin no cry eh..  </p></div>

              <p><strong>Malaysia's probe over naked squat claims will "take couple of weeks"</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Malaysia's inquiry into the case of two Singaporean 
              women who were allegedly detained, forced to undress and do squats will 
              take "a couple of weeks" to complete.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>This is according to
               Malaysia's High Commissioner to Singapore Md Hussin Nayan, who was in 
              Singapore for an arts event at ION Orchard on Saturday.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The two women said 
              they crossed immigration lines accidentally because they saw no one at 
              an immigration counter and had seen a green light ahead of them. <br><br>They
               were detained by Malaysia's Immigration authorities, who are 
              investigating the incident and have suspended the officers concerned.<br><br>Commenting
               on the case, Md Hussin Nayan said he hopes the incident will not cast a
               shadow on relations between the two countries.<br><br>He said: "My only
               hope is that Singaporeans don't shy away from going to Malaysia. This 
              incident in JB is definitely unfortunate but Malaysian authorities are 
              taking measures to investigate and to punish those actions that aren't 
              in conformity with the standards of operating procedures."<br><br>Well-known
               women's rights activist Marina Mahathir, who was also at the Singapore 
              event, said that Malaysians are also expecting an explanation.<br> <br>She said: "I can tell you a lot of Malaysians are very, very upset about it, particularly the women's groups. <br><br>"We
               think this was really uncalled for and we had this incident before with
               the police, not the immigration, and there was an order out that this 
              shouldn't be done at all.<br><br>"This is a bit of a shock to all of us.
               And the two immigration officers have been suspended pending 
              investigations, so we expect some explanation for this." <br><br>She added that Malaysia was generally a safe place and that Singaporeans should not have to worry about entering the country.<br><br>At
               a separate event in his constituency, Singapore's Foreign Affairs 
              Minister K Shanmugam said Singapore will be watching the issue 
              carefully.  <br><br>"The allegations made by the two ladies raise 
              serious concerns and we're happy that a committee has been set up and 
              Malaysian authorities have said they are going to investigate this," 
              said Mr Shanmugam.<br><br>Reports say the Malaysian panel to investigate the incident convened in Johor on 16 June to start the inquiry.<br><br>- CNA/ir</span></span></p>
