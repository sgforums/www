              <p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>
              <p>Malaysia's Home Ministry has yet to receive any official report on the 
              alleged mistreatment of two Singaporeans by immigration officers at the Johor 
              Bahru customs checkpoint last week.</p>
              <p>As such, Home Ministry Secretary-General Mahmud Ahmad declined to comment on 
              the matter, according to Malaysian paper <em>Sin Chew Daily</em>.</p>
              <p>However the case -- which saw two Singaporean ladies being strip-searched and 
              ordered to do squats in the nude while being detained -- has sparked widespread 
              outrage among Singaporean netizens.</p>
              <p>Since it was first posted late on Tuesday evening, the story has been shared 
              on Facebook over 3,000 times and drawn over 700 comments.</p>
              <p>Some have called for a boycott of shops in Johor Bahru while others called 
              for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to launch a proper investigation into the 
              alleged abuse.</p>
              <p><em>Yahoo! Fit-to-Post</em> reader <em>SH</em> commented, "As consumers and 
              tourists, we should vote with our pockets, boycott poor service shops and 
              countries which do not appreciate our tourism dollars."</p>
              <p>Another reader <em>Koh</em> wrote, "Is the Ministry of Foreign Affairs doing 
              something about this ? This is a common trick of Malaysian Immigration to extort 
              money from Singaporeans. Why do we need to go to JB to save money. Patronize a 
              country that obviously do not welcome you?"</p>
              <p>Yet others questioned why the two ladies ventured up to Johor Bahru for 
              supper at such a late hour.</p>
              <p>Reader <em>Patriot</em> wrote, "1.30am going to JB for supper just two ladies 
              ? Must be out of your mind right? Singapore got so many night haunts for supper 
              and yet you choose JB."</p>
              <p>The two Singaporeans in question were reportedly detained by Malaysian law 
              enforcement officers in <span id="lw_1308022170_2" class="yshortcuts">Johor 
              Bahru</span> early last Thursday morning after they were accused of entering 
              <span id="lw_1308022170_3" class="yshortcuts">Malaysia</span> illegally.</p>
              <p>The pair were also ordered to strip and do squats with their hands on their 
              ears for 10 times when they were sent to a detention centre.</p>
              <p>The ordeal happened when Lim Lili and Zhan Tingting (not their real names) 
              drove across the Causeway for supper at about 1:30am. When they reached the 
              Malaysian customs checkpoint, both women inadvertently did not get their 
              passports stamped.</p>
              <p>According to <em>Lianhe Zaobao, </em>Lim said she had entered a lane that 
              displayed a green light which signalled that the lane was in operation.</p>
              <p>Lim recalled seeing that the lane had no immigration officer at the counter 
              and it was at this point that they didn't get their passports stamped. Zhan then 
              alighted to purchase a "Touch N Go" prepaid card to pay for their entry into 
              Malaysia.</p>
              <p>As it was their first time experiencing the new <a href="http://sg.news.yahoo.com/blogs/singaporescene/system-causes-long-delays-jb-checkpoints-050832546.html">biometric scanner</a> at the counter, Lim used the intercom and 
              tried to ask another officer for help. Both waited at the counter for five 
              minutes before they decided to move on as Lim thought that there would be 
              another counter for them to scan their fingers.</p>
              <p>But instead, they drove into Johor Bahru without getting their passports 
              stamped and fingerprints scanned. Realising something was wrong, Lim drove her 
              car back to the customs to obtain an entry chop for their passports.</p>
              <p>However, when reached the customs at 2am, they were accused of entering 
              Malaysia illegally and questioned by Malaysian law enforcement officers.</p>
              <p>"When my statement was taken, both of us tried to explain ourselves and 
              requested for them to check with Singapore's immigration department to check 
              their departure timings and CCTV footage to clarify that once we knew there was 
              a mistake, we quickly turned back," said Zhan.</p>
              <p>The officers then curtly informed them of the offence and punishment, 
              emphasising the RM10,000 (S$4,069) and jail term.</p>
              <p>Both women were detained in a room until 5pm on 10 June and were only allowed 
              to make a phone call each.</p>
              <p>One of them called a friend while the other spoke to her brother, who 
              contacted the Singapore High Commission in Malaysia and the <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=ministry+of+foreign+affairs&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">Ministry of Foreign Affairs</a>.</p>
              <p>"Somebody with a higher rank came and started speaking to us in <span id="lw_1308022170_0" class="yshortcuts">Malay</span>. A translator told us if we 
              were willing to accept a fine of RM3,000 (S$1,220) to resolve the situation," 
              said Zhan.</p>
              <p>"And because we were so tired, we agreed to pay the fine and we signed an 
              agreement that was in Malay," Zhan added.</p>
              <p>Officers led the two women to an ATM machine to withdraw cash to pay the 
              fine. But the women received another shock when the officers suddenly said that 
              they will be sent to a detention centre in Pontian district and will be detained 
              for up to 14 days.</p>
              <p>Lim then asked the officers, "I thought we already settled the case?"</p>
              <p>They were later handcuffed and sent to the women's division at the detention 
              centre. Lim and Zhan met a female officer who ordered a strip search. Both women 
              were made to strip and do squats with their hands on their ears for 10 times 
              before they were allowed to change into their prison uniforms.</p>
              <p>Zhan said: "The place was dirty and smelly, the roach-infested room was 
              two-thirds of the basketball court, no bed, four wooden walls, with 50 people in 
              it."</p>
              <p>"We were treated like criminals even before we were pronounced guilty, it was 
              humiliating. Most of the detainees were Filipinos and Indonesians without 
              passports. We were the only Singaporeans."</p>
              <p>After a night in the centre, the officers woke them up at 5am to do the 
              Islamic morning prayers.</p>
              <p>She said in the span of 24 hours, besides eating and praying, we were stuck 
              in the room. When it was time to eat, we did not have forks and spoons and ate 
              with our hands. We did not dare to finish eating, but the rest of the detainees 
              told us to finish because if we did not, the officers will punish us."</p>
              <p>At the detention centre, the two of them were bitten by mosquitoes and bugs 
              the whole night. Zhan's hands and legs had red spots and her whole body hurt 
              while Lim's back and neck were bitten, and her skin was red and itchy.</p>
              <p>Both women were detained at the centre for 24 hours before another 
              immigration officer transferred them back to the Malaysia customs and detained 
              them for another six hours.</p>
              <p>Zhan said that other immigration officers mocked them and asked if the 
              detention centre was like a five-star hotel.</p>
              <p>On Friday night, an official handed both woman a warning letter and informed 
              them that they will not be charged, jailed or fined.</p>
              <p>When Lim went to retrieve her car, she saw it was badly scratched and 
              damaged. They were also told by an immigration officer who handled their 
              departure proceedings that they would not be able to enter Malaysia easily next 
              time.</p>
              <p>Looking back, Zhan acknowledged their mistake but said, "This is only a 
              trivial mistake. Does it warrant a need to detain us at the detention 
              centre?"</p>
              <p>The pair angrily added: "Next time even if you invite me over to Malaysia I 
              wouldn't want go in!"</p>
              <p>They were worried that the incident would affect their jobs, and wanted to 
              remind their friends to be more careful when travelling to Malaysia.</p>
              <p>Under their lawyer's advice, the pair might seek compensation from the 
              Malaysian authorities.</p>
              <p><span class="yui-editorial-embed"><span class="yui-editorial-embed">This is not 
              the first time Malaysian authorities have been accused of abusing their power. 
              In November 2005, another woman was made to perform nude squats. 
              <br></span></span></p>
              <p><span class="yui-editorial-embed"><span class="yui-editorial-embed">According to 
              police, the nude squats are meant to dislodge any hidden illicit drugs but the 
              incident led to the formation of an independent commission, which subsequently 
              recommended that the practice be stopped. <br></span></span></p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">JB immigration chief: squats not part of SOP</h1>
              <p>JOHOR BAHRU - CONDUCTING a body search sometimes requires detainees 
              to remove their clothing for thorough checks but squats were not part of
               the standard operating procedure, Johor Immigration director Nasri 
              Ishak said on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>Mr Nasri was commenting on a recent report of two Singaporean women 
              who were told to strip naked and perform squats after they were detained
               for not having their passports checked at the Causeway.</p>
              <p>'Removing clothes, however, is sometimes needed as it is essential 
              for our officers to ensure that the detainees are not hiding any 
              weapons,' he said.</p>
              <p>He, however, assured that the Home Ministry would conduct investigations into the matter.</p>
              <p>He added that these types of checks were conducted in a 
              private room and the two Singaporean women were attended to by a female 
              immigration official. They were eventually taken to the Pekan Nenas 
              detention centre pending investigations to their case.</p>
              <p>'After we forwarded the investigation papers, the Deputy 
              Public Prosecutor in charge of the case decided that they should be 
              deported back to their country,' he said, adding that there was no 
              reason for his officials to purposely humiliate the women. -- THE 
              STAR/ANN</p>
              <p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
              <p>It was previously reported that two Singaporean women who 
              had failed to get their passports chopped by immigration officials, were
               jailed for one night and told to strip naked and perform 10 squats. 
              They were eventually released back to Singapore the next day at 5pm.</p>

              <h1 class="headline">S’porean women to file complaint against M’sia Immigration</h1>
              <p>The two <span id="lw_1308058946_4" class="yshortcuts">Singaporean</span> women who were detained and allegedly mistreated by the <span id="lw_1308058946_2" class="yshortcuts">Johor</span> Customs are set to file an official complaint against the <span id="lw_1308058946_0" class="yshortcuts">Immigration Department</span> of <span id="lw_1308058946_8" class="yshortcuts">Malaysia</span>.</p>
              <p>A spokesperson from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) told <em>Yahoo! Singapore</em> that the two women had met its consular officers to discuss the issue, with the women also recounting the incident to them.</p>
              <p>He said that they had indicated that they would like to lodge a 
              formal complaint to the Malaysian High Commission about the alleged 
              mistreatment that they experienced while being detained in Johor.</p>
              <p>It is understood that the MFA will help to forward the complaint — once it has been made — to the Malaysian High Commission.</p>
              <p>The spokesperson added that its consulate in <span id="lw_1308058946_3" class="yshortcuts">Johor Bahru</span> has also contacted the Malaysian immigration authorities to inquire on 
              the immigration and detention procedures that the Singaporean women were
               subjected to.</p>
              <p>Last week, the two Singaporean women in question -- Lim Lili and Zhan
               Tingting (not their real names) -- drove across the Causeway for early 
              morning supper without getting their passports stamped.</p>
              <p>They had drove into a lane which was not manned and as it was their first time experiencing the new biometric scanner at the counter, Lim used the intercom and tried to ask another officer for help.</p>
              <p>Both waited at the counter for five minutes before they decided to 
              move on as Lim thought that there would be another counter for them to 
              scan their fingers. But they realised there would not be one.</p>
              <p>Shortly after when they realised their mistake, they returned to the 
              customs checkpoint but were subsequently sent to a nearby detention 
              centre and ordered to strip and do squats in the nude.</p>
              <p>Both women were detained in a locked, crowded room until 5pm the next
               day and were initally asked to pay a fine of RM6,000 (S$2,440). They 
              were eventually let off with a stern warning.</p>
              <p>Since the issue was reported by the media, it has sparked outrage among <span id="lw_1308058946_6" class="yshortcuts">Singaporeans</span> with some questioning the standard procedures that detainees are 
              subjected to by the immigration authorities in Malaysia. Others also 
              called on the MFA to launch a proper investigation on the incident.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, the Immigration Department of Malaysia is conducting an internal probe into the case.</p>
              <p>But the assistant director of the Special Administration Unit at the 
              Malaysian Immigration headquarters, Kaisan bin Kassim, told <em>Yahoo! Singapore </em>that he is not in a position to comment, as the case is now being handled by the Malaysian Ministry of Home Affairs.</p>
              <p>However, his department, which is based in Putrajaya, Kuala Lumpur, is taking steps to look into the incident internally.</p>
              <p>"We will investigate this issue since it has been raised by Singapore
               through various reports, and we will take this issue seriously," he 
              said<em> </em>in <span id="lw_1308058946_1" class="yshortcuts">Malay</span>. He said this also in response to comments from opposition Malaysian MPs about the incident.</p>
              <p>He declined to comment further asked if what the Singaporean women had allegedly experienced was standard procedures.</p>
              <p>However, other representatives from within the <span id="lw_1308058946_5" class="yshortcuts">Immigration Department headquarters</span> that <em>Yahoo! Singapore</em> spoke to said the two women could have "blown the story out of proportion".</p>
              <p>A public relations officer, who wanted to be known only as Haidir, 
              said the two ladies should have waited at the immigration counter for an
               officer to assist them, even if the booth was unmanned.</p>
              <p>Otherwise, they should have approached any of the other officers in adjacent lanes, he added.</p>
              <p>"It is common sense for one to get his or her passport stamped upon 
              crossing the Causeway," said another immigration officer at the 
              Immigration of Johor State headquarters.</p>
              <p>"Just like Singapore, you need to get your passport stamped before 
              you enter the country; if not, you will be arrested... so it is the same
               procedure in Malaysia," said the officer, who declined to be named.</p>
              <p>While declining to comment further on the RM6,000 fine allegedly 
              slapped on the Singaporeans, Haidir said it was possible that the women 
              were making that part of the story up.</p>
              <p>He further added that it was indeed standard procedure for detainees 
              under the Immigrations department to be subjected to nude squats, 
              particularly for females.</p>
              <p>He added, however, that male officers will never conduct these strip 
              searches and nude squats where female detainees are involved.</p>
              <p>"It is always a female officer who will handle a female detainee," he emphasized.</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">S'pore asks Malaysia about two women's ordeal in JB</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE'S Foreign Affairs Ministry has asked the Malaysian 
              immigration authorities for more information on the treatment of two 
              Singaporean women detained for nearly 48 hours in Johor Baru.</p>
              <p>The women - who wanted to be known only as Ms Chang and Ms Lim - told
               The Straits Times that they were handcuffed, thrown behind bars and 
              forced to undress and perform squats.</p>
              <p>Their nightmare happened after they accidentally entered Johor Baru 
              without getting their passports stamped, by driving through what they 
              said was an unmanned immigration lane.</p>
              <p>'Our consulate in JB has been in touch with the Malaysian 
              immigration authorities to enquire on the investigation and detention 
              procedures that the two Singaporeans underwent,' said a Ministry of 
              Foreign Affairs spokesman.</p>
              <p>Ms Chang, an insurance industry manager in her late 30s, and
               Ms Lim, an estate agent in her late 20s, met up with consular officers 
              here yesterday to recount their ordeal.</p>
              <p>They had driven across the Causeway for a snack in the early
               hours of last Thursday. After realising they had accidentally gone 
              straight through immigration, they immediately did a U-turn. They said 
              they were questioned by immigration officers, and then taken to the 
              Pekan Nenas detention centre in Pontian where they were ordered to strip
               and do 10 squats each.</p>
