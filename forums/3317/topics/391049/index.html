              <p>THE group chief executive officer of retailer RSH Holdings, Mr Vinod Kumar Gomber (right), died on Sunday, aged 59.</p>
              <p>The
              Straits Times understands that he died in Germany, where he was
              undergoing medical treatment. His body has been flown to Jaipur, in
              India, where his family and friends have gathered for the funeral.</p>
              <p>Details
              of his medical condition were not available yesterday. An RSH spokesman
              said that he 'died due to unexpected complications during the
              recuperation process'.</p>
              <p>RSH sells brands such as Zara, Bebe, Mango and Massimo Dutti in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Mr Gomber, a Singaporean, joined RSH in 1988 as head of Reebok Singapore, an RSH subsidiary.</p>
              <p>He
              was appointed group CEO in 1993, and held that post until 2006, when he
              was appointed group CEO of Emaar Properties, one of the world's largest
              real estate companies and which has a controlling interest in RSH.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>Gomber was also CEO of Emaar in Dubai, taken there by his mentor Alabbar (whose reputation is itself quite spotty in recent years). Also in the same tainted pond was Low Ping formerly KPMG Singapore, who went to set proper ethical accounting but did quite the reverse. Poor Gomber was responsible for Indian partner of Emaar and having inexplicably brought in that dubious partner, he must have been held responsible for the ensuing mess. The stress and the pain must have been terrible for the poor soul. Remains to be seen what happens to other singaporeans in Emaar, like Low Ping, Ng Boon Yew, and a host of IT guys who are anyway out of their depth there. Rumour has it that all these guys will now disappear, as Alabbar goes for "All Change", something he is very good at, to deflect blame from himself to poor suckers like Gomber. One faithful acolyte who might stay with him until the bitter end, unless she turns approver with Dubai investigative hounds, is Low Ping. She knows where the bones are encrypted; literally.</div>
