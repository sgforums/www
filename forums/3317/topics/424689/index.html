              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam said Singapore 
              cannot afford to let down its guard even though it has been successful 
              in preventing terrorist attacks in the past. </span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Speaking in 
              Parliament during the debate on the estimates for his ministry, Minister
               K Shanmugam said in addition to the threat from foreign terrorist 
              groups, Singapore has not been spared from the threat of individuals who
               are radicalised through exposure to online jihadist material.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The security agencies have detained four such self-radicalised individuals so far.<br><br>Mr Shanmugam stressed that tackling the threat of terrorism cannot be done by any government acting alone.<br><br>He
               added that a vigilant and cohesive community played a crucial role in 
              countering the spread and influence of jihadist ideology.<br><br>"Singapore
               continues to be an attractive terrorist target. Mr Alvin Yeo is right 
              to say that the nature of the threat requires that we all pull together 
              and play our part. There are no absolute guarantees, and certainly no 
              perfect systems. There will be occasional human lapses.<br><br>"However I
               believe that the combined efforts of the government, the private sector
               and a vigilant and cohesive community will continue to guard Singapore 
              from the terrorist threat, and continue to keep us safe and secure."<br><br>On
               its part, the Singapore Police Force (SPF) and the Internal Security 
              Department (ISD) have conducted security briefings and conferences to 
              reach out to the community to sensitise them to the threat of terrorism.<br><br>To date, these security briefings have reached out to over 300,000 individuals.<br><br>The
               SPF and the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) also leveraged on new 
              media platforms, such as YouTube and Facebook, to spread the message on 
              the need for public vigilance against possible terrorist threats.<br><br>Mr
               Shanmugam said they will continue to organise such activities and 
              exercises to raise public awareness and vigilance against terrorist 
              threats.<br><br>He said: "Past survey findings suggest that to the 
              general public, crime is a greater concern than the terrorist threat. 
              This is not surprising, given the fact that so far we have been 
              fortunate enough to have avoided a large scale terrorist incident.<br><br>Mr
               Shanmugam added that past surveys also suggest that there is generally a
               high level of confidence in the government and security forces' ability
               to respond effectively.<br><br>"In terms of public preparedness for a 
              terrorist incident, slightly more than half of the population indicated 
              that they are prepared for an attack and know what to do in the event of
               an attack. This is encouraging, but there is room for improvement. Home
               Team agencies will continue their outreach and educational efforts on 
              this front," he said.<br><br>- CNA/fa</span></span></p>
