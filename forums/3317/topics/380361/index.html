              <p>Eleven Singaporeans travelling in a tour bus were injured when their
              coach was involved in an accident in Danyang city in China's Jiangsu
              province. <br> <br> Four were seriously injured; 7 had mild injuries and had been sent to the Danyang Hospital for treatment. <br> <br> The accident happened at 2pm yesterday. <br> <br> It's believed that a car overtook the bus and hit it while doing so.<br> <br> The two vehicles plunged into a river below. <br> <br> Ronald Thye, whose parents were among the injured, said they are now
              waiting for further assistance from the local authorities to facilitate
              their return to Singapore. <br> <br> "We're hoping that arrangement can be made to bring them back to
              Singapore for treatment. Because over here we have been admitted to a
              two-way hospital which is a third grade hospital in China. That's why
              even the ambulances, they don't have any facilities or function inside
              for resuscitation so that's why they're unable to transport the
              critical." <br> <br> The Singaporeans were travelling on a tour organised by Singapore-based Kudo Travel. <br> <br> Its Manager is Barry Goh. <br> <br> "We have a private nurse to take care of them. So far, so good.
              Yesterday I called one of the passengers, the tour team leader, (he
              said) all of them are okay. Our agent over there is taking care of
              them."</p>

              <p><strong>Injured Singaporeans transferred to Shanghai hospitals</strong></p>
              <p>Eleven Singaporeans who were injured in a traffic accident in Danyang
              city in China's Jiangsu province have been transferred to Shanghai. <br> <br> They were moved from Danyang hospital to two hospitals in Shanghai. <br> <br> Ronald Thye, whose parents were among the injured, gave this update. <br> <br> "We're trying to go over to Shanghai to get proper medical attention
              and have a second opinion of the status of the injuries. There are two
              hospitals. The most critically ill, my mom, is sent to Hua Shan
              hospital. The rest to He Mu Jia. Some by ambulance, some by car. They
              were divided into batches you see." <br> <br> The Singaporeans were travelling in a tour bus when it was involved in an accident yesterday afternoon. <br> <br> It's believed that a car overtook the bus and hit it while doing so. <br> <br> The two vehicles plunged into a river below. <br> <br> Mr Thye said four were seriously injured and seven had mild injuries. <br> <br> The Singaporeans were travelling on a tour organised by Singapore-based Kudo Travel. <br> <br> Its Manager, Barry Goh, says he'll fly to China tomorrow to provide assistance for the injured. <br> <br> "To help the passengers see whether they need any help or not. (What
              kind of help or assistance?) If they want to come back to Singapore,
              then we can arrange to come back to Singapore or see if they need
              anything we can help them lah."</p>
