              <p><strong>UN panel praises Singapore for progress made in human rights</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>GENEVA: Singapore has received praise from a United Nations 
              panel for progress it has made in several key areas of human rights. </span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>A government 
              delegation has been meeting with UN officials and ambassadors in Geneva 
              as part of a compulsory review of human rights in all member states. </span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>During three hours 
              of talks, there was broad support for strides taken by Singapore on 
              issues ranging from the well-being of women and children, to the 
              promotion of racial and religious harmony. <br><br>But some countries 
              expressed concern over human rights in Singapore, and urged the country 
              to establish a national institution to deal with the issue. <br><br>In all, 16 nations are getting their human rights report cards during two weeks of gatherings in Geneva.<br><br>Friday was the turn of Singapore. <br><br>The
               delegation said the country had balanced increased human rights 
              protections for women, children, migrant workers and the disabled, while
               maintaining stability as its main priority. <br><br>Ong Keng Yong, 
              Ambassador-at-Large at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said: 
              "Trade-offs between different kinds of rights are inevitable. Our top 
              principle is pragmatism. Our focus is on the practical implementation of
               rights and how to balance them with economic imperatives and social 
              stability." <br><br>Several diplomats at the gathering raised issues 
              concerning the treatment of foreign workers in Singapore, and called for
               steps to improve conditions for migrants. <br><br>Kshenuka Senewiratne,
               Sri Lanka Ambassador, said: "We believe that measures adopted to 
              educate foreign workers in their native languages of their rights and 
              responsibilities, and avenues for assistance would further improve their
               conditions, especially in understanding local legislation and recommend
               that these measures be implemented." <br><br>Ambassadors from some 
              countries pressed Singapore to end its use of the death penalty for 
              certain crimes. But the government cites low crime rates as a indicator 
              of the success of capital punishment. <br><br>There were also calls for Singapore to establish a national human rights institution, a step the country is reluctant to take. <br><br>Ong
               Keng Yong added: "We don't need to establish a special body because our
               judicial system, our policies in Singapore, and the way that 
              Singaporeans have approached this issue, basically allow us to use what 
              we have currently in Singapore to promote and protect human rights." <br><br>Singapore is currently a signatory to international treaties on the rights of women and children. <br><br>At
               the gathering, Singapore was asked to sign up on other human rights 
              treaties - something the government says it is considering. <br><br>The Universal Periodic Review session is part of an ongoing process of assessments by the UN Human Rights Council. <br><br>Singapore says it welcomes the process as a vital opportunity for UN member states and stakeholders to exchange views. <br><br>The Council's full report on the review of Singapore's human rights situation is due out next Tuesday.<br><br>- CNA/de</span></span></p>
