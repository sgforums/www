              <p>He was 42 and she, only 13. Yet, they declared themselves “<em>lao gong</em>” and “<em>lao po</em>” (Chinese for husband and wife).</p>
              <p>The martial arts instructor, who is a father of two, and his student alleged had a sexual relationship when she was 13.</p>
              <p>They even went to a temple and “solemnised” their “marriage”, said the prosecution in their opening statement<em>.</em></p>
              <p>The man is standing trial for three charges of statutory rape and four charges of sexual exploitation, reported <em>The New Paper.</em></p>
              <p>He is unable to be named as the identity of the girl, who is now a Secondary Five student, has to be protected.</p>
              <p>The court understood that they met when she joined her school’s 
              martial arts club in 2007, when she was in Secondary One. He was then 
              the instructor of the club.</p>
              <p>Deputy Public Prosecutor Chua Ying-Hong told the court that the girl 
              and some of her team mates visited his house on February 20, 2007, the 
              third day of the Chinese New Year.</p>
              <p>They left a few hours later and headed to a nearby shopping centre, 
              where the girl realised that her appointment had been cancelled and she 
              contacted the man to tell him.</p>
              <p>He then offered to keep her company and drove to pick her up in a car
               and went for a drive. Along the way, they stopped for a smoke and had a
               chat before having dinner back in his flat.</p>
              <p>Later at night, he text messaged the girl to ask her to be his girlfriend, and she agreed.</p>
              <p>In March 2007, the couple drove to Turnhouse Road, near Changi, and proceeded to have sex in his car.</p>
              <p>The court was also told that in the following month, they had sex in his car on two separate occasions.</p>
              <p>on May 4, 2007, four months after they got to know each other, the 
              man took the girl to a temple in Yishun where they prayed and 
              “solemnised” their “marriage” to each other.</p>
              <p>By that time, the relationship had caught the attention of the 
              school’s principal after she received a call from a relative of one of 
              the man’s students stating that the instructor and the girl were having 
              an “unhealthy relationship” which was “more than that of a master and 
              disciple”.</p>
              <p>The principal then asked the teacher-in-charge of the club and the 
              school’s discipline mistress to investigate further. However their 
              efforts were in vain as the students did not reveal anything out of the 
              ordinary.</p>
              <p>While all this was going on, rumours were spreading in school about the couple’s relationship.</p>
              <p>The teacher-in-charge testified that the man had called her to 
              clarify that nothing was going on between him and the girl. She also 
              said that the man’s wife had contacted her to ask if there was anything 
              going on.</p>
              <p>“She said, ‘I’m begging you, please tell me because this has happened before.”</p>
              <p>“I told her the truth at that time, there was no evidence to suggest anything,” the teacher-in-charge said.</p>
              <p>However, in May, a student approached the teacher to tell her that the instructor was “going steady” with the girl.</p>
              <p>Another trainee also revealed to the teacher that the man had once 
              instructed her to lie to his wife that there was a training session on a
               particular day, reported <em>TNP.</em></p>
              <p>At the same time, the caller who tipped off the principal contacted 
              her again to say that the man and the girl were having a relationship.</p>
              <p>The discipline mistress testified in court that when she confronted 
              the girl about the issue on May 10, 2007, she appeared to be “quite 
              evasive”.</p>
              <p>Sensing that the girl was lying, she then asked for her mobile phone 
              and checked her text inbox where she found “intimate messages” sent from
               a “lao gong’, whose number matched that of the instructor.</p>
              <p>The discipline mistress also found a photograph of the couple, together with a long romantic poem.</p>
              <p>The girl even mentioned on her blog that she liked the instructor.</p>
              <p>The discipline mistress also discovered that the girl had been to the man’s house on several occasions for dinner.</p>
              <p>She said, “(The man) would drive the students home after dinner.</p>
              <p>“The second last person to be dropped off would usually be (a male trainee) and the last person would normally be the girl.”</p>
              <p>After all this was revealed, the man was summoned to the principal’s office and notified that his services would be terminated.</p>
              <p>He was also asked to cease all contact with the girl and the other students.</p>
              <p>The girl was sent for counselling, where she revealed her sexual 
              relationship with the man, which included holding hands, kissing and 
              sex.</p>
              <p>“She mentioned that they always had sex in his car,” the counsellor told the court.</p>
              <p>The man’s wife also confronted the girl after she had found out about their affair.</p>
              <p>The girl’s mother lodged a police report after being informed of the situation. The man was then arrested on May 16.</p>
              <p>“She was very uncomfortable (while speaking to the police)… There 
              were many things they (the police) asked her, and she did not understand
               many of the terms,” said the counsellor, who was asked by the girl to 
              accompany her to the police station to make the report, and again when 
              her statement was taken.</p>
              <p>In the defence’s opening statement, Mr Martin Decruz argued that they
               did not have sex against the girl’s will, and that the girl had 
              suffered no trauma.</p>
              <p>He added that he had evidence to prove that the man had alibis on Feb
               28, 2007, one of the days he was accused to have committed indecent 
              acts with the girl, wrote <em>TNP. </em>The man is now out on bail.</p>
              <p>If convicted of statutory rape, he can be jailed for up to 20 years 
              and caned. If conducted of sexual exploitation, he can be jailed two 
              years and fined S$5,000.</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Rape trial: Endearing messages from martial arts coach</h1>
              <p>FRAGMENTS of endearing messages were recovered from the computer and 
              laptop seized from the homes of a martial arts instructor and the 
              16-year-old student he is alleged to have raped three years ago.</p>
              <p>One specimen read: 'Hope you know how much lao gong treasure lao po.'</p>
              <p>When the trial started on Wednesday, prosecutors said the couple 
              even went to a temple to solemnise their 'marriage', and addressed each 
              other as lao gong (husband in Mandarin) and lao po (wife). Part of 
              another message stated that their love will never fade as it was more 
              than 100 per cent true, said an investigating officer on Friday.</p>
              <p>Another promised: 'Reach (age of) 16...I get supplementary 
              credit (card) for u so u can do some shopping also.' Then there was: 
              'Just wanna use this lifetime to lurve u.' The instructor, now 45, faces
               three counts of statutory rape and four counts of sexual exploitation, 
              allegedly committed between February and May 2007. He is denying the 
              allegations.</p>
              <p>The girl, now in Secondary 5 in the same school, testified 
              in-camera on Friday. Earlier testimony revealed that the man, who was 
              the coach of a martial arts club at a secondary school, had told two of 
              his trainees to keep his relationship with the girl, a secret.</p>
              <p>The girl's parents are divorced and her mother, a KTV 
              singer, testified that she did not know of her daughter's affair. The 
              girl had admitted to it to a school counsellor on May 11 2007. She also 
              said she had three boyfriends in 2006 and had had sex with one of them -
               a 15-year-old - from another school. And while she was 'wife' to the 
              instructor in 2007, she was seeing two teenage boys on the side. The 
              trial continues on Jan 17.</p>

              <p><strong>Accused rapist tells of controlling 'Tiger' wife</strong></p>
              <p>THE 45-year-old martial arts instructor accused of having sex with 
              his teenage student broke down on the stand on Tuesday, while talking 
              about how his wife had controlled his life for 12 years.</p>
              <p>He referred to his wife as 'Tiger' in his text messages to the 
              alleged victim, and told the court he was allowed to visit his mother 
              only once a fortnight and needed his wife's permission to make 
              unscheduled visits. His wife also did not allow him to chat with other 
              women.</p>
              <p>The revelations came on the fifth day of his trial for statutory rape
               and sexual exploitation, as he was being cross-examined by the 
              prosecution on the many text messages he had sent to the girl, now 16.</p>
              <p>Earlier that day, he said his wife also limited his time on the computer.</p>
              <p>He faces three counts of statutory rape and four counts of 
              sexual exploitation, allegedly committed between February and May 2007, 
              when the girl was 13 and in Secondary 1. The accused, the girl and the 
              witnesses were not named, as the court has barred the publication of 
              information that could lead to the identification of the girl, who is 
              now in Secondary 5.</p>
              <p>Prosecutors alleged that the married father of two, who was 
              then 41, had asked the then 13-year-old to be his girlfriend, and later 
              had sex with her in his car.</p>

              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: The wife of the martial arts instructor accused of 
              raping a 13-year-old girl nearly four years ago painted a picture of a 
              regimented life she imposed on her husband.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Taking the stand as a
               defence witness, she told the court that in their 12 years of marriage,
               she has never allowed him to go out at night without her permission.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>His daily routine revolved around taking their son to and from school, going for his martial arts classes, and little else. <br><br>And
               even when he's at home, she would give him a tongue-lashing if he spent
               too much time chatting online or sending text messages.<br><br>The 
              45-year-old man, who teaches martial arts at a secondary school, faces 
              three counts of statutory rape and four counts of sexual exploitation on
               the girl -- who is one of his trainees -- between February and May 
              2007.<br><br>He is said to have had sex with her in his car.<br><br>The 
              court has banned the publication of any information that could lead to 
              the identity of the alleged victim, now 16 years old and a Secondary 
              Five student at the same school.<br><br>The instructor's wife also backed his claim that he was at home on the night of Feb 28, 2007.<br><br>He is alleged to have held the girl's hands, and hugged and kissed her on this date.<br><br>The man, who is denying all the charges, is relying on a training video shot by one of his trainees as his alibi.<br><br>The wife told the court she remembered distinctly that her husband showed her that video at home after dinner that day.<br><br>The
               court had heard earlier that the instructor found his wife to be very 
              controlling, and that he had described her as "Tiger" to the alleged 
              victim.<br><br>The trial continues.<br><br>Statutory rape carries a jail term of between eight and 20 years and at least 12 strokes of the cane.<br><br>Sexual exploitation carries a fine of up to S$5,000, or up to two years' jail, or both, for a first-time offender.<br><br>-CNA/wk</span></span></p>
