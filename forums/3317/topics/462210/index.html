              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: A Chinese national who killed three women in a flat in Yishun four years ago has been sentenced to death.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Wang Zhijian, 46, 
              was tried for the murder of his 42-year-year lover, Madam Zhang Meng, 
              her 17-year-old daughter Feng Jianyu, and their flatmate Yang Jie, 36.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Wang also slashed Madam Yang's daughter, Li Meilin, who was 15 years old at the time of the incident in 2008. <br><br>On Friday, High Court Judge Chan Seng Oon found Wang guilty of the murder of one of the three victims. <br> <br>In
               his verdict, Justice Chan accepted Wang's defence of diminished 
              responsibility for the deaths of Madam Zhang and her daughter Feng. He 
              found Wang guilty of culpable homicide not amounting to murder in these 
              two instances.<br> <br>But Justice Chan found Wang guilty of murdering Madam Yang.<br><br>In
               a 52-page judgement, he said Wang had harboured so much hatred and 
              anger towards Madam Zhang that it was logical to expect that after he 
              had stabbed her, it "would have assuaged his anger".<br><br>The judge said this was not the case.<br><br>He
               said by the time Wang moved on to kill Madam Yang, he would have had an
               opportunity to cool down and be mentally responsible for his actions.<br><br>He
               said Wang was able to exercise his rational judgement, and that "his 
              intention to have Yang killed to silence her as a potential informant 
              and witness was clear".<br><br>The judge said Wang's mental responsibility was no longer substantially impaired by this time.<br><br>His acts, the judge said, were "deliberate, purposeful, directed and methodical".<br><br>So
               Justice Chan rejected the defence's argument that when Wang cut Madam 
              Yang's fingers, he had not regained his mental capacity.<br><br>- CNA/de</span></span></p>

              <p>i wonder if there are more people in the flat this guy's going to kill also? seems like given their agreesive men nature, and slutty women nature, they are really a bunc of savages and babarians.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>now those dead at nanking, i am sure some of them wre the works of lesser thiefs and criminals within the country during chaos and admist jap invasion.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i am glad this one we wont have towaste time and tazpayers' money takin care of in our prison, whcih may eventually result in conjection if more cheena goes in.</p>
