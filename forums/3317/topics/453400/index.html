              <p>STOMPer Andrew came across a facebook posting in which a man, who is said to be a lawyer, called MRT commuters 'peasantry'.<br><br>A peasant is defined as a member of a class of low social status, or informally as an uncouth or uncultured person.<br><br>Said Andrew:<br><br>"I was looking at my facebook yesterday then came accross a post.<br><br>"Never
               mind that COE prices are so expensive now, the person still has the 
              cheek to make such an insensitive comment saying that people who take 
              the MRT are commoners and peasants.<br><br>"Who does he think he is?<br><br>"According
               to my friend, his facebook says that he works in the law society. "This
               is quite bad because those people like him have got the education but 
              look down on us.<br><br>"Is this the way society should behave that the educated people look down on the poor?<br><br>"Hope it can be posted to raise the issue of elitism."</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p style="text-indent: 1em; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: medium; text-align: justify; line-height: 24px; margin-left: 28px; margin-right: 28px;">It is necessary to determine class status.</p>
              <p style="text-indent: 1em; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: medium; text-align: justify; line-height: 24px; margin-left: 28px; margin-right: 28px;">Although bad people are in the minority, they nevertheless occupy some of the crucial departments and are in authority. . . There should be distinction between one’s class component and one’s own performance, primarily the latter. To draw class lines is to ferret out the bad elements.</p>
              <p style="text-indent: 1em; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: medium; text-align: justify; line-height: 24px; margin-left: 28px; margin-right: 28px;">It also important to distinguish between class background and one’s own performance, with emphasis on the latter. The exclusive component theory is incorrect. The question is whether you take the stand of your original class or take a changed class stand, that is, taking the side of workers and poor and lower-middle peasants. Moreover, you are not supposed to engage in sectarianism, but must unite with the majority, even including some of the landlords and rich peasants, as well as their children. There are some counter revolutionaries and saboteurs who should be transformed, and if they wish to transform, we should have them, one and all. But if we consider only the background, then even Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin would be unacceptable. For instance, Marx studied idealism first and Materialism later before he developed Marxism. Both Hegel and Fueurbach were his mentors in the field of philosophy.</p>
              <p style="text-indent: 1em; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: medium; text-align: justify; line-height: 24px; margin-left: 28px; margin-right: 28px;">In undertaking class determination in factories, our purpose is mainly to find out those Kuomintang secretaries, generals, reactionary officers, escaped landlords, and landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries and bad elements. As in Pai-Yin Factory, it was to check the bad people, not every body, and not the technical staff who came from exploitative classes. Some of them used to serve the exploitative class. If their present performances are good, we should trust them, and even though it is not too good, they must be transformed. Some of them have come from exploitative classes, and so we must see how their performance is.</p>
              <p style="text-indent: 1em; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: medium; text-align: justify; line-height: 24px; margin-left: 28px; margin-right: 28px;">In order to produce socialist theory, it behoves intellectuals to study the existing phenomena of class struggle, to enhance the results of their study theoretically, and to proselytize them, thus changing the working class from a diffused into an organized class, and from a self-developing in to a self-conscious class. The workers, because they have to work and earn their living everyday under exploitation and oppression, cannot produce Marxism by themselves. Marx was not a worker himself, but he could perceive the trend of development, and after studying analytically, succeeded in changing bourgeois philosophy into proletarian philosophy, and bourgeois political economy into proletarian political economy, thereby educating the workers. In point of fact, it is impossible for a worker to read so many books or to read such bulky volumes, though the advanced ones could perhaps read more. The phenomenon of class struggle has existed for millenniums and even the bourgeoisie conceded that there was class struggle. It was only Marx and Engels who made it into a theory and systemized it. We must knock down the bourgeoisie. Socialism has succeeded capitalism. I myself also learned from the landlord class by studying Confucius’s book for six years and by attending bourgeois schools for seven years, spending 13 years altogether. I was then only 20-odd years of age, and was basically ignorant about Marx. It was only after the October revolution that I heard of Marx and read his books.</p>

              <p style="text-indent: 1em; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: medium; text-align: justify; line-height: 24px; margin-left: 28px; margin-right: 28px;"> </p>
              <p style="text-indent: 1em; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: medium; text-align: justify; line-height: 24px; margin-left: 28px; margin-right: 28px;"> </p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; text-align: -webkit-auto; text-indent: 0px;"> This distinction of at least two geographic areas in each civilization is of major importance. The process of expansion, which begins in the core area, also begins to slow up in the core at a time when the peripheral area is still expanding. In consequence, by the latter part of the Age of Expansion, the peripheral areas of a civilization tend to become wealthier and more powerful than the core area.</p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; text-align: -webkit-auto; text-indent: 0px;">Another way of saying this is that the core passes from the Age of Expansion to the Age of Conflict before the periphery does. Eventually, in most civilizations the rate of expansion begins to decline everywhere.</p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; text-align: -webkit-auto; text-indent: 0px;">     It is this<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> decline in the rate of expansion of a civilization which marks its passage from the Age of Expansion to the Age of Conflict.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; text-align: -webkit-auto; text-indent: 0px;">This latter is the most complex, most interesting, and most critical of all the periods of the life cycle of a civilization. It is marked by four chief characteristics: (a) it is a period of <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">declining rate of expansion</span></span></strong>; (b) it is a <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">period of growing tensions and class conflicts</span></span></strong>; (c) it is a <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">period of increasingly frequent and increasingly violent imperialist wars</span></span></strong>; and (d) it is a <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">period of growing irrationality, pessimism, superstitions, and otherworldliness.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; text-align: -webkit-auto; text-indent: 0px;">All these<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong> phenomena appear in the core area of a civilization</strong></span> before they appear in more peripheral portions of the society.</p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; text-align: -webkit-auto; text-indent: 0px;">     The decreasing rate of expansion of the Age of Conflict gives rise to the other characteristics of the age, in part at least. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">After the long years of the Age of Expansion, people's minds and their social organizations are adjusted to expansion, and it is a very difficult thing to readjust these to a decreasing rate of expansion.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; text-align: -webkit-auto; text-indent: 0px;">Social classes and political units within the civilization try to <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">compensate for the slowing of expansion through normal growth by the use of violence against other social classes or against other political units.</span></strong> From this come<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> class struggles and imperialist wars.</span></span></strong> The outcomes of these struggles within the civilization are not of vital significance for the future of the civilization itself. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">What would be of such significance would be the reorganization of the structure of the civilization so that the process of normal growth would be resumed.</span></span></strong> Because such a reorganization requires the removal of the causes of the civilization's decline,<span style="color: #ff0000;"> the triumph of one social class over another or of one political unit over another, within the civilization,</span> will not usually have any major influence on the causes of the decline, and will not (except by accident) result in such a reorganization of structure as will give rise to a new period of expansion.</p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; text-align: -webkit-auto; text-indent: 0px;">Indeed, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">the class struggles and imperialist wars of the Age of Conflict will probably serve to increase the speed of the civilization's decline because they dissipate capital and divert wealth and energies from productive to nonproductive activities...</span></span></strong></p>

              <h1 class="headline">Facebook user apologises for calling MRT commuters “peasants”</h1>
              <p>The man who drew flak for calling MRT users “common people” on his Facebook page has apologised for his “thoughtless remark”.<br><br>In an interview with <em>Yahoo! Singapore</em>, Nicholas-Seth Leong,
               30,  expressed his regret over the incident, which sparked a public 
              outry amid growing concerns of elitist behaviour in Singapore. <br><br>“I
               would like to apologise to everyone for the comment made and any 
              offense it may have caused,” said Leong, who declined to reveal his 
              occupation.<br><br>“It was a private comment made in reference to an 
              inside joke among friends. We, like many people, occasionally make jokes
               caricaturing politics and politicians,” he added and stressed that “no 
              insult was ever intended”.<br><br>In his Facebook status update posted 
              last Thursday, Leong had talked about his experience of connecting with 
              “the peasantry”, after he had taken the train earlier that day. <br><br>“I
               had a meeting this morning out of office. My boss told me we’d take the
               train down,” he wrote. “I told him it’s the second time I’m taking MRT 
              this year, it’s my first time in Clarke Quay MRT, it’ll be my first time
               to Dhoby Ghaut MRT in 2 years, and whenever I take the MRT, my friends 
              cheer and say they’ll need to buy the lottery.”<br><br>Leong continued 
              in a comment on his own status, “I feel my own angst riding with common 
              people. But I suppose it’s good to get the feel from the ground every 
              now and then to connect with the peasantry."<br><br>His comments quickly drew a flurry of reaction online.<br><br>Among the many offended by Leong’s “elitism” was <em>Yahoo!</em> reader Andrew Tay, a sales manager who takes public transport on a daily basis.<br><br>Tay
               said, “What makes (Leong’s post) so bad is that this is probably the 
              worst time in Singapore history to make such an offensive comment, not 
              only because of the sky-rocketing COE prices but also because of the 
              recent spate of breakdowns, which fuels resentment when the 
              public-transport system is already strained.”<br><br>The 32-year-old added it would be “best if he (Leong) could come out and make a public apology”.<br><br>When
               contacted, one of Leong’s former colleagues, who declined to be named, 
              revealed that Leong often appeared “amicable and friendly on the 
              surface, but had a rather low sense of self-awareness in that he would 
              try to appear and behave the richest and most successful amongst his 
              peers”.<br><br>“This has sometimes caused strong but subtle sense of 
              resentment between him and those who were around him,” he continued, 
              before adding that he “wasn't at all surprised” to see Leong’s post.<br><br>According to this ex-co worker, Leong drives an old Honda Civic and lives in a HDB flat. <br><br>Earlier media reports that referred to Leong’s Linkedin account said that he graduated from Temasek Polytechnic and is currently working as a “Customer Service Professional” at The Law Society of Singapore.<br><br>The account and his Facebook page have since been deleted.<br><br>While Leong declined to provide more details, he told <em>Yahoo! Singapore</em> that he understood why people were offended by his “misconstrued” comment.<br><br>“I
               do regret that thoughtless remark, and I realise that one should not 
              even joke about such things as it is insensitive, and it is so easy for 
              it to be taken out of context and misunderstood,” he said.</p>
