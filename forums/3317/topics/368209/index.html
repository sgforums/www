              <p><strong>MOE cancels registration of Brookes Business School</strong></p>
              <p class="first">SINGAPORE: Singapore’s Education Ministry (MOE) has
              cancelled the registration of a private school that has been
              investigated for offering fake degrees from a well—known Australian
              university.</p>
              <p>It is the first case this year of a school being stripped of its registration by the ministry.</p>
              <p>MOE
              said this follows investigations by the secretariat of the pro—tem
              Council for Private Education (CPE) on Brookes Business School for
              contraventions of the Education Act.</p>
              <p>The school has been accused
              by its students of peddling fake degrees from the Royal Melbourne
              Institute of Technology for as little as S$12,000.</p>
              <p>MOE told
              Channel NewsAsia some 400 local and overseas students are affected by
              the closure. Some have already paid more than S$10,000 in deposits.</p>
              <p>Most
              of the students whom Channel NewsAsia spoke to refused to appear on
              camera, but several of them said they already had doubts over the
              school’s credibility.</p>
              <p>Jonathan Ong, student at Brookes Business
              School, said: "I’m not surprised. Ever since I signed up with this
              school, there’ve been a lot of changes to their policies and the
              programme structures."</p>
              <p>This is despite the fact that the school
              was registered with MOE and had Casetrust accreditation from the
              Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE).</p>
              <p>Casetrust—endorsed
              schools receive certification for having good student
              welfare/protection practices and standards, such as clear fee policies,
              well—defined student redress practices and systems, a declared
              commitment to quality, and well—trained personnel.</p>
              <p>According to
              CASE’s website, the certification does not represent endorsement or
              accreditation of the quality of the courses offered.</p>
              <p>Thevanathan
              Pillay, assistant director, CASE, said: "For those students who have
              completed their course and feel they’ve been given a fake certificate,
              they should actually go to court and sue the business."</p>
              <p>MOE said
              the secretariat of the pro—tem CPE is working with various agencies and
              private education industry players to put in place measures to ensure
              that affected students have other avenues to complete their studies.</p>
              <p>Students
              may approach the Association of Private Schools and Colleges (APSC) to
              be placed in another private education institution. For this purpose,
              students should be prepared to show proof that they are currently
              enrolled students of Brookes Business School.</p>
              <p>They should also bring along the following documents: <br>i) student contracts; <br>ii) payment receipts; <br>iii) course schedules and assignments completed; <br>iv) any past tests scripts and results.</p>
              <p>The APSC helpline is 6252—3192 or 6252—6134.</p>
              <p>MOE
              said prior to approaching APSC, international students holding student
              passes issued by the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) should
              first approach CASE to get advice on fee returns under the Student
              Protection Scheme.</p>
              <p>CASE’s helpline is 6463—1811. Students may
              also contact pro—tem CPE via the MOE Customer Service at
              MOE_CPE_Contact@moe.gov.sg or 6872—2220.</p>

              <p><strong><span class="newsTitle">28 students of Brookes Business School file complaints with CASE to get refund</span></strong></p>
              <p>Consumer watchdog CASE has received 28 complaints from students affected by the closure of Brookes Business School.</p>
              <p>The students are seeking a refund on tuition fees paid out to the
              school, which can cost up to $12,000 for a one-year specialist diploma.</p>
              <p>As Brookes Business School is CaseTrust accredited, most of the
              students are covered by the Student Protection Scheme and the Standard
              Student Contract.</p>
              <p>Executive Director of CASE, Seah Seng Choon, said the more than 200
              foreign students are covered and will receive insurance payouts from
              NTUC Income.</p>
              <p>However, the Student Protection Scheme is optional for local students.</p>
              <p>For those who opted out of the scheme, CASE advises that students approach the Small Claims Tribunal.</p>
              <p>"They can go to the Small Claims Tribunal to get a judgment, and
              with that judgment, they can file a claim with the company. So if they
              need our assistance on this, they can come to our office and our
              officers can advise them on how to proceed to the SCT and the manner in
              which they can file a claim."</p>
              <p>Mr Seah also said that affected students can approach the
              Association of Private Schools and Colleges to be placed in another
              private education institution.</p>
              <p>The Ministry of Education de-registered Brookes Business School
              after it was found to have offered fake degrees from well-known schools
              such as the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology.</p>
              <p>About 400 students were enrolled in the school when it closed.</p>

              <p>TMC may not be the best, but its much better than studying at schools such as Brookes.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>SIM I think should be the best among the commercial schools, in terms of facilities. they even have a canteen and megabites restuarant there. They even have UniSIM. study there better.</p>

              <p>study in commercial institutions and studying in a university, there are many differences.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1) universities have professors, AP, Doctors as lecturers and tutors as full time. commercial schools mostly have masters or MBAs and some have doctorate degree. they usually worked part time and have a day time job.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) facilities and classrooms/auditoriums. no need to say much, as universities owned commercial schools.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3) library. university have a much bigger catalogue of books for all disciplines.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4) students. students in university are full time whereas the students in commercial schools study part time, usually in the evenings.</p>

              <div class="top_headline">
              <p>A SECOND private school run by a man who peddled fake degrees has been ordered to close.</p>
              <p>In a statement yesterday, the Education Ministry (MOE) said it had
              revoked the registration of Stamford Global Learning Centre, which has
              about 40 students and is also operated by Benny Yap Chee Mun.</p>
              <p>The order came a day after another school owned by Mr Yap, Brookes Business School, was ordered to close.</p>
              <p>As was the case with Brookes, Stamford Global's licence was taken away because it contravened the Education Act.</p>
              <p>MOE did not give any details.</p>
              <p>But according to a former Brookes staff member who requested
              anonymity, both schools handed out the same bogus qualifications from
              brand-name institutions in Australia and Britain such as the Royal
              Melbourne Institute of Technology.</p>
              <p>Stamford was much smaller than Brookes, however: It had an enrolment of about 40, while its counterpart had 400.</p>
              <p>When The Straits Times called the school yesterday, a staff member said lessons had been suspended.</p>
              <p>Mr Yap could not be contacted yesterday. Calls to his mobile phone
              were met with an automated message saying the number was no longer in
              use.</p>
              <p>A police spokesman confirmed that reports have been filed against
              both Mr Yap and Brookes. She said investigations had begun, but did not
              want to comment on what offences were being looked into.</p>

              <p><strong>CASE to help students of Brookes and Stamford recover school fees</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Within the past two days, 264 students have turned to
              the Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE) for help in seeking
              compensation from Brookes Business School and Stamford Global Learning
              Centre.
              <br> <br> CASE said it will help the current students of the schools to recover the remaining school fees in the next two weeks.
              <br> <br> The Association has also advised those who have graduated and those who wants to be compensated to seek legal help.
              <br> <br>CASE said it will have to seek the help of insurance companies to
              help compensate the students as the owner, who owns both schools, is
              missing.
              <br> <br>The Ministry of Education had ordered Brookes and Stamford to close
              earlier in the week after they were found to have offered fake degrees
              from well-known schools such as the Royal Melbourne Institute of
              Technology.
              <br> <br> Brookes had an enrolment of about 400, while Stamford had around 40 students.

              <p><strong>Local Brookes students did not know they could buy insurance</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Singapore students who enrolled in Brookes Business
              School said that they did not know they could buy insurance to protect
              themselves.
              <br> <br>More than 400 students were left in the lurch after the school was
              forced to shut down by the Education Ministry for peddling fake
              degrees.
              <br> <br>Foreign students at Brookes Business School may get some of their
              fees back as the private school was registered under CaseTrust, which
              requires schools to buy insurance for all foreign students. <br> <br> For local students, buying insurance was an option. 
              <br> <br> The Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE) said it did not make
              buying insurance policies compulsory for local students as there had
              been mixed reactions when it was first introduced. <br> <br> Said Seah Seng Choon, the executive director of CASE: "There were some
              quarters who feel that the students may not want this because of the
              fact that they were local and some were paying on a term basis, not
              like the foreign students who pay one lump sum." <br> <br> The insurance policy, which is stipulated under the Student Protection
              Scheme, assures students that they will get back the remainder of their
              tuition fees should a school close down. <br> <br> Alternatively under the Scheme, schools have to deposit their students'
              fees into a separate bank account, which will release the money in
              instalments until the course is completed.
              <br> <br>However, a student from Brookes Business School said that local
              students said they were not told they could tap into the scheme too.
              <br> <br>Said Mike, a former student of Brookes Business School: "No, the
              school did not offer it and I must say I didn't know about it." <br> <br> "Mike", who declined to reveal his real name, told Channel NewsAsia's
              Talking Point that he paid between S$18,000 and S$20,000 for his
              degree.
              <br> <br> Now, he and more than 50 students are looking at taking legal action against the Principal of the private school, Benny Yap.
              <br> <br> Another group of foreign students - all from China - are looking at doing the same.   
              <br> <br>Said Leonard Loo, managing partner of Leonard Loo &amp; Company:
              "Most of my clients who are the students are very anxious to get their
              money back and they chose not to go to the other options which are to
              claim on the insurance money or to CASE because those procedures may
              take some time. <br> <br> "Furthermore, a majority of these students have actually paid premium
              for their insurance to the school to protect their school fees, but
              some of them discovered that they don't have the policies or when they
              check with the insurers they are actually not covered, so there's the
              question of where their premiums went to." <br> <br> - CNA/yb</span></p>

              <p><strong>MOE cancels registration of Brookes Business School</strong></p>
              <p>SINGAPORE: Singapore’s Education Ministry (MOE) has cancelled the registration of a private school that has been investigated for offering fake degrees from a well—known Australian university.</p>
              <p>It is the first case this year of a school being stripped of its registration by the ministry.</p>
              <p>MOE said this follows investigations by the secretariat of the pro—tem Council for Private Education (CPE) on Brookes Business School for contraventions of the Education Act.</p>
              <p>The school has been accused by its students of peddling fake degrees from the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology for as little as S$12,000.</p>
              <p>MOE told Channel NewsAsia some 400 local and overseas students are affected by the closure. Some have already paid more than S$10,000 in deposits.</p>
              <p>Most of the students whom Channel NewsAsia spoke to refused to appear on camera, but several of them said they already had doubts over the school’s credibility.</p>
              <p>Jonathan Ong, student at Brookes Business School, said: "I’m not surprised. Ever since I signed up with this school, there’ve been a lot of changes to their policies and the programme structures."</p>
              <p>This is despite the fact that the <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">school was registered with MOE and had Casetrust accreditation from the Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE).</span></strong></p>
              <p>Casetrust—endorsed schools receive certification for having good student welfare/protection practices and standards, such as clear fee policies, well—defined student redress practices and systems, a declared commitment to quality, and well—trained personnel.</p>
              <p>According to CASE’s website, the certification does not represent endorsement or accreditation of the quality of the courses offered.</p>
              <p>Thevanathan Pillay, assistant director, CASE, said: "For those students who have completed their course and feel they’ve been given a fake certificate, they should actually go to court and sue the business."</p>
              <p>MOE said the secretariat of the pro—tem CPE is working with various agencies and private education industry players to put in place measures to ensure that affected students have other avenues to complete their studies.</p>
              <p>Students may approach the Association of Private Schools and Colleges (APSC) to be placed in another private education institution. For this purpose, students should be prepared to show proof that they are currently enrolled students of Brookes Business School.</p>
              <p>They should also bring along the following documents:<br>i) student contracts;<br>ii) payment receipts;<br>iii) course schedules and assignments completed;<br>iv) any past tests scripts and results.</p>
              <p>The APSC helpline is 6252—3192 or 6252—6134.</p>
              <p>MOE said prior to approaching APSC, international students holding student passes issued by the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) should first approach CASE to get advice on fee returns under the Student Protection Scheme.</p>
              <p>CASE’s helpline is 6463—1811. Students may also contact pro—tem CPE via the MOE Customer Service at MOE_CPE_Contact@moe.gov.sg or 6872—2220.</p>

              <p>Mr
              Yap faces action from Australian university RMIT for offering degree
              courses without authorisation. He also faces a civil suit from students
              trying to recover their fees.</p>
              <p>This after the Brookes Business School was ordered to shut down by the Education Ministry for peddling fake degrees.</p>
              <p>Mr
              Subhas said Mr Yap, who has spent more than S$1 million to pay his
              students, has repaid the school fees of about 50 students. Some
              students have also been transferred to other study schemes.</p>
              <p>Mr
              Subhas said: “I don’t think it is going to be a long drawn—out battle
              because the issues are quite clear. It is a matter of looking at the
              legal positions of some of the students.</p>
              <p>"As far as our client is
              concerned, he does not want any of his students to lose out. If he
              can’t pay them the money, he’ll try to make alternative arrangements
              for them to go to some other universities who will take them in."</p>
              <p>Meanwhile,
              one of the students trying to recover the fees said he and a group of
              50 others will go ahead with a legal suit against Mr Yap.</p>
              <p>"Mike" who came on Channel NewsAsia’s Talking Point said he does not believe Mr Yap is sincere in helping them.</p>
              <p>He
              said: "Of course I will tell them about this but I’m very sure that
              they will still consider taking legal action because Benny Yap has
              promised a lot of things which have not materialised so far. He has
              cheated us many times and we don’t trust him anymore."</p>
              <p>Channel
              NewsAsia understands that some former students of the Brookes Business
              School who are currently working have had their pay severely cut by
              employers, because of the fake degrees.</p>
              <p>Some who are in
              managerial positions saw cuts of nearly 50 per cent. Others were
              demoted or had their services terminated, while some students with the
              fake degrees resigned before their employers found out.</p>
