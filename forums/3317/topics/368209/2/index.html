              <p><strong>RMIT had lodged complaint about Brookes as early as 2007</strong></p>
              <p class="first">SINGAPORE: Australia’s RMIT had written to Singapore’s
              Education Ministry as early as April 2007 to complain about Brookes
              Business School.</p>
              <p>RMIT said Brookes was falsely associating itself with the university through its website and offering its degrees.</p>
              <p>This was revealed by Senior Minister of State for Education S Iswaran in a written parliamentary statement.</p>
              <p>In April 2007, RMIT alerted Singapore authorities to the suspicious nature of the Brookes Business School.</p>
              <p>Two months later, the Education Ministry gave Brookes a warning for
              carrying misleading information on its website and other publicity
              materials.</p>
              <p>Today, hundreds of students are helpless, either without a school or worse still stranded with a fake degree.</p>
              <p>Mr
              Iswaran said: "Over the years, the government had adopted a light touch
              approach in regulating this industry, which included among other
              measures, basic registration and CaseTrust accreditation for education
              providers."</p>
              <p>However, with the number of private schools rising, the minister said a "light touch" may not work anymore.</p>
              <p>The
              number of private schools doubled in the ten years between 1987 and
              1997, from 150 to 305. It then quadrupled in the next ten years between
              1997 and 2007, from 305 to 1,200 private schools.</p>
              <p>He said the
              Council of Private Education (CPE) to be set up under the new Private
              Education Bill will better regulate the industry.</p>
              <p>Students are
              advised to check degrees offered by private institutions with the
              ministry’s list of legitimate schools on its website.</p>
              <p>The ministry said degrees offered by Brookes were never on the list.</p>
              <p>Once
              the Private Education Bill is passed, the CPE will require education
              providers to specifically inform prospective students if degrees
              offered by them are on the list.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, police are still investigating the case.</p>

                                      from continuing with peddling fake degrees after the Royal
                                      Melbourne Institute of Technology reported to the Ministry in 2007
                                      about them?; and (b) What was done to alert the public so as to

              <p>................</p>
              <p><span>4</span>..On the Member’s specific questions,
                                      RMIT had written to MOE in April 2007 to report that the Brookes
                                      Business School was falsely associating itself with RMIT on its
                                      website and offering RMIT’s external degree programmes. In the same
                                      letter, RMIT had also informed MOE that it had obtained an
                                      undertaking from Brookes Business School to remove all references
                                      to RMIT under its programmes and collaterals, to notify affected
                                      students, and to refrain from any such activities in the future.
                                      RMIT had indicated that it would initiate legal proceedings against
                                      Brookes Business School if the undertaking was not honoured.</p>
              <p><span>5</span>..Subsequently in June 2007, MOE issued a
                                      warning to Brookes Business School for carrying misleading
                                      information on its website and other publicity materials. RMIT was
                                      kept informed and as MOE did not receive further indication from
                                      RMIT, considered the matter to be resolved through private action
                                      between the parties concerned. We also understand that no legal
                                      proceedings have been initiated by RMIT against Brookes Business
                                      School over the past two years.</p>

              <p>2.I think less students would choose Brookes from April if MOE
                                      tell the public about  RMIT's complaint.</p>

                                      should sound the warning.</p>

              <p>How can they assume" THE CASE is closed" when they have not

              <p><strong><span class="newsTitle">CASE: Brookes Business School Withheld Insurance Certs from Students</span></strong></p>
              <p>An internal investigation by consumer watchdog CASE into Brookes Business School found that the school has misled students.</p>
              <p>It withheld insurance certificates from them, which CASE says are serious breaches of the CaseTrust criteria.</p>
              <p>As a result, students may not be aware that they're under-insured or not insured under the Student Protection Scheme.</p>
              <p>Some of the receipts from students show that they've paid the school
              between $20,000 and $30,000, but the school only insured them for
              $1,000.</p>
              <p>Local students say they were not even offered the insurance option although the school should've done so.</p>
              <p>The majority of students who sought help from CASE also revealed that they were not given the Standard Student Contract.</p>
              <p>The business school was previously accredited with CaseTrust.</p>
              <p>It means the school was obliged to protect students' tuition fees either through an approved bank or an insurance scheme.</p>
              <p>Only with accreditation can the school enroll foreign students.</p>
              <p>CASE reminds all students enrolled in private schools to obtain a
              certificate of insurance from the school and make sure the full tuition
              fees are covered under the insurance when they sign up for the course.</p>
              <p>Students should also be given a copy of the signed Standard Student
              Contract, a sample of which is available at the CASE website.</p>
              <p>In the event the owner of the school Mr Benny Yap files for
              bankruptcy, CASE advises students to seek legal advice on recovery of
              any claims against the school.</p>
              <p>This could be with the Small Claims Tribunal or through legal proceedings.</p>

              <p><strong>CASE to step up checks on education providers</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: The Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE) says it
              will step up checks on private education providers in Singapore.
              <br> <br> This follows the recent Brookes Business School debacle where the school was found peddling fake degrees.
              <br> <br>Now, CASE has found out that Brookes was withholding insurance
              certificates from students. As a result, students might not have been
              aware if they were under-insured or not insured under the Student
              Protection Scheme.
              <br> <br> According to CASE, local students said the school did not offer the insurance option to them although it should have done so.
              <br> <br>CASE wants to remind all students enrolled in private schools to
              obtain a certificate of insurance from their private school and make
              sure their full tuition fees are covered under the insurance scheme
              when they sign up for their courses.
              <br> <br>Meanwhile, 31 students, mostly from China, have asked local lawyer
              Leonard Loo to help them file a lawsuit against the school. They want
              their school fees, which amount to a total of about S$700,000, back.
              <br> <br> This is the second batch of students to take such action, following similar action by a group of 19 students last week.
              <br> <br>Subhas Anandan, the lawyer acting for the school's owner Benny Yap,
              told Channel NewsAsia that one option that his client may consider is
              giving consent to judgement.
              <br> <br> This will allow both parties to save money and time by eliminating the process of a full trial.

              <p><strong>High Court allows 19 students to recover school fees from Brookes Business School</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : Singapore's High Court has given the green light for
              19 students to recover S$53,000 in school fees from the now defunct
              Brookes Business School. </span></p>
              <p><span>The private institution is accused of peddling fake degrees from the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology.
              <br> <br> Singapore's Education Ministry stripped Brookes Business School of its registration in July.
              <br> <br> The court's decision was delivered in less than two months - a
              significantly shorter wait compared to the usual nine months for a
              civil suit.
              <br> <br>The students' lawyer said the partners of Brooke Business School,
              Yap Chee Mun and Lim Cheow Young, failed to file a defence setting out
              their position. <br> <br> More than 400 local and foreign students were affected by the school's
              closure. Some 170 of them have since been accepted by seven other
              private schools. <br> <br> A total of 213 students applied for places, with the help of the
              Association of Private Schools and Colleges, but 36 were rejected for
              reasons such as not meeting the minimum requirement and not being able
              to produce proof of qualification.
              <br> <br>Another group of 31 affected students has filed a similar suit
              against Brookes Business School. They are looking to recover S$70,000
              in school fees. </span></p>

              <p><strong>Private Education Bill to ensure quality courses, school accountability</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Parliament has passed the Private Education Bill
              which, among other things will ensure the quality of courses offered at
              over 1,000 private schools here. </span></p>
              <p><span>And should a school be forced to closed, the new law will also
              make clear who should be held responsible. But some MPs felt the new
              law lacks bite.
              <br> <br>The new law is aimed at raising the standards of the private
              education sector here. But the Ministry of Education warned that
              tighter regulation will not eliminate risk.
              <br> <br>S Iswaran, Senior Minister of State for Education, said: "A strong
              regulatory framework, while necessary, is not a panacea. Regulatory
              systems in all countries aim to assure consumers of certain quality
              standards. <br> <br> "While risk can be mitigated, it can never be completely eliminated.
              The new system cannot by itself guarantee student satisfaction, avert
              school closures or prevent regulatory infringements." <br> <br> Under the law, all courses offered by private institutions will have to be registered with the new Council of Private Education.
              <br> <br> For external degree programmes for instance, checks include verifying
              the authenticity of the courses with the foreign university. And where
              courses do not make the mark, it will be the school's responsibility to
              lay out alternative arrangements for its students - such as
              transferring them to an approved course. <br> <br> Failure to do so will be a criminal offence, with penalties comprising fines and jail terms.
              <br> <br> But in Parliament on Monday, some MPs wondered if these measures serve as an effective deterrence.
              <br> <br> Christopher De Souza, MP for Holland-Bukit Timah GRC, said: "If the
              cohort comprises 20 students, the money the PEI would stand to gain
              from a dishonest cheating enterprise could easily exceed S$100,000. The
              maximum fine of S$10,000 is an insufficient deterrent. <br> <br> "A $10,000 fine lacks bite. PEIs could well consider it a business
              cost, and one which justifies taking the risk of embarking on an
              unscrupulous exercise to cheat vulnerable students. A fine of up to
              S$100,000 seems a more robust deterrent."
              <br> <br>Beyond basic registration, schools that accept foreign students
              will have to comply with new EduTrust standards, including mandatory
              fee protection.
              <br> <br>Halimah Yacob, MP for Jurong GRC, said: "My concern is that this
              will give the wrong signal that private schools catering to local
              students can have lower standards and quality."
              <br> <br>But Mr Iswaran stressed there will be safeguards to protect course
              fees for all students, including a limit on how much schools can accept
              upfront, and that not all schools will see it necessary to apply for
              the voluntary EduTrust.
              <br> <br>Registration of private schools is also subject to regular renewal.
              Schools will also need to disclose vital information such as the
              qualifications of their teachers.
              <br> <br>MPs were also divided as to how much regulation there should be.
              Some argued that self-governance clearly has not worked, while others
              warned that the new law represents a switch from one of no control to
              one of total control. <br> <br> In response, Mr Iswaran said the ministry's role can only go so far,
              and ultimately, students need to do their homework when applying to
              private schools. </span></p>
