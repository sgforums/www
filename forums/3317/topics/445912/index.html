              <p>STOMPers have expressed anger over Beijing University professor Kong 
              Qing-Dong's statement that Singaporeans have 'no quality', because we 
              rely on laws and fines to keep people in line.<br><br>His comments were 
              made as part of a Chinese television interview over an incident that 
              happened recently on Hong Kong's MTR. A Hong Kong man had approached a 
              Chinese National eating noodles on the train to tell him to stop. The 
              Chinese man had made a rude retort, sparking a heated argument over 
              nationality.<br><br>STOMPer <strong>Wall-E</strong> wrote:<br><br>"This Chinese professor is exactly the kind of person that gives Chinese people a bad name globally.<br><br>"His arrogance and hypocrisy, and sheer audacity in speaking as if every word from his mouth were gospel is sickening to watch.<br><br>"Over the course of his interview, he calls Hong Kongers dogs, and slaves of the British with a post colonial mindset. <br><br>"His
               ridiculous sense of entitlement is extraordinary. He is the one who is 
              behaving like a colonial master now, demanding that Hong Kongers conform
               to China's rules, and not speaking in dialects. <br><br>"He slams 
              Singapore also, calling us people with no quality, because we rely on 
              fines and rules to keep people behaving properly here.<br><br>"He does 
              not have the right to say this when many Chinese people habitually 
              behave badly in other countries, including here in Singapore.<br><br>"He
               is living in the past, with his misguided sense of Chinese superiority.
               Does he mean to say that Chinese people don't need laws? They do, but 
              they still don't behave any better than others.<br><br>STOMPer <strong>Jessica</strong> wrote:<br><br>"I
               watched this interview online, and feel this man is a disgusting 
              example of Chinese peoples' attitude towards other countries.<br><br>"Chinese people are the ones disgracing themselves by acting boorishly and rudely while visiting other countries.<br><br>"This fat fool is one reason so many people think Chinese people are arrogant and have no manners.<br><br>STOMPer <strong>pHail </strong>wrote:<br><br>"Simply
               unbelievable. This man from China has a lot to say about Chinese people
               overseas, but he cannot see the faults of his countrymen. <br><br>"Just visit us Professor Kong. We'll let you know what we honestly think of your comments and your hypocrisy."<br><br>STOMPer <strong>Eden</strong> wrote:<br><br>"This
               man made an example, saying Singapore is a lawful country but went on 
              to say that reliance on laws meant that people had no quality. <br><br>"What a criticizing implication on Singapore!"</p>
