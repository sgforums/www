              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: The authorities are hoping to engage those who have been illegally using a plot of state land at Clementi Avenue 4.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Residents have been 
              farming at the 1,800 square metre site for almost 30 years, but they are
               now being ordered by the Singapore Land Authority to move out by March 
              20.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>And for residents like Lester Yeong, they are hoping that a compromise can be reached between the authorities and residents.<br><br>Mr
               Yeong and his family have been farming in the area for about two years.
               They spend about two to three hours daily at the plot and have planted 
              about 20 species of fruits and vegetables there.<br><br>Mr Yeong said: 
              "It's like a kampong and it is near where we stay. My kids come here 
              every day after I return from work and they totally enjoy it. It's most 
              unfortunate that a single incident has caused SLA to issue the 
              encroachment notice. Right now, I have made an appeal to MP of Bukit 
              Timah, Sim Ann, that we would very much like to continue with what we 
              have been doing... and we are ready for any form of compromise. With 
              compromise, I believe that it'll be a very valuable community farming 
              area."<br><br>However, health issues are a concern.<br><br>A resident living in Clementi raised concerns a few weeks ago about leaves being burnt at the plot. <br><br>The burning had caused problems for her child who has asthma. <br><br>Aside from health concerns, the National Environment Agency is also worried about mosquito breeding.<br><br>And
               MP for the area, Holland-Bukit Timah GRC's Sim Ann, hopes those who 
              have been using the plot will come forward to share their views with 
              her.<br><br>Ms Sim said: "If they don't identify themselves, it's going 
              to be very hard for us to represent their views when we engage with 
              agencies such as the Singapore Land Authority and other concerned 
              agencies such as the National Environment Agency. The SLA has also 
              assured us that they will work with the community and stakeholders to 
              come up with an arrangement that is for the greater community interest."<br><br>SLA said it will consider whether the plot should be used for some form of interim community use.<br><br>- CNA/fa</span></span></p>

              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Residents who have been illegally using State land at Clementi Avenue 4 for farming were given a reprieve on Tuesday.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The Singapore Land Authority (SLA) has granted a three-month extension to those who have identified themselves.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>They had originally been asked to vacate by March 20.<br><br>The land was formerly occupied by the Malaysian Keretapi Tanah Melayu (KTM) but it has since been returned to Singapore.<br><br>So
               far, 13 individuals have come forward and they will work with 
              grassroots organisations for an acceptable arrangement during the grace 
              period.<br><br>The others have been given till April 3 to identify themselves.<br><br>The three months grace period will also be extended to them if they come forward between now and April 3.<br><br>If they do not do so, SLA said it will have no choice but to dismantle and remove the enclosed areas and illegal structures.<br><br>Measures are also in place to address health concerns, like mosquito breeding and the burning of leaves.<br><br>SLA
               said vector control has been carried out to prevent mosquito breeding 
              in stagnant ponds and signs will be put up to warn the public of 
              potential dangers such as potholes and ponds.<br><br>Advisory notices 
              will also be put up against the illegal burning of leaves after some 
              residents in nearby blocks had earlier complained that the burning had 
              caused discomfort, especially for those with breathing problems.<br><br>SLA
               said the land has been reserved under the Urban Redevelopment 
              Authority's Master Plan 2008 but there are no immediate plans for the 
              site.<br><br>The area's MP Sim Ann welcomed the move.<br><br>Earlier, on behalf of those using the land, Ms Sim had asked SLA for more time to resolve the matter.<br><br>Ms
               Sim said: "(It is) good of SLA to offer an extension to users who have 
              identified themselves. I'm also very glad to know that the users are 
              prepared to abide by all public health and safety regulations because 
              that's important. The grassroots will use this time to consider views 
              from the residents and see if we should apply for a temporary use of 
              state land for community purposes, pending future plans for 
              development."<br><br>SLA said it will step up surveillance of the area 
              and work with grassroots and residents to detect illegal activities, 
              like the burning of leaves.<br><br>It will continue to consult grassroots organisations on possible interim use of the land that will benefit the wider community.<br><br>It's
               understood that grassroots organisations are considering whether to 
              take up a Temporary Occupational License for community use.</span></span></p>

              that the burning had caused discomfort, especially for those with
              breathing problems.<br> <br> SLA said the land has been reserved under the Urban Redevelopment
              Authority's Master Plan 2008 but there are no immediate plans for
              the site.<br> <br> The area's MP Sim Ann welcomed the move.<br> <br> Earlier, on behalf of those using the land, Ms Sim had asked SLA
              for more time to resolve the matter.<br> <br> Ms Sim said: "(It is) good of SLA to offer an extension to users
              who have identified themselves. I'm also very glad to know that the
              users are prepared to abide by all public health and safety
              regulations because that's important. The grassroots will use this
              time to consider views from the residents and see if we should
              apply for a temporary use of state land for community purposes,
              pending future plans for development."<br> <br> SLA said it will step up surveillance of the area and work with
              grassroots and residents to detect illegal activities, like the
              burning of leaves.<br> <br> It will continue to consult grassroots organisations on possible
              interim use of the land that will benefit the wider
              community.<br> <br> It's understood that grassroots organisations are considering
              whether to take up a Temporary Occupational License for community
              use.</span></span></p>

              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Clementi residents will soon have a community farm in their backyard.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The Singapore Land 
              Authority said it's processing an application from the Bukit Timah 
              Citizens Consultative Committee for a three-year Temporary Occupation 
              Licence for a plot of State land at Clementi Avenue 4 for the farm.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The 1,250 square metre plot, previously occupied by illegal farmers, is where the community farm will be.<br><br>The land will be divided into 30 plots.<br><br>Eighteen
               individuals who had been working on the land had come forward to SLA 
              before the April 3 deadline, and will now get a 32-square metre plot on 
              which to grow their produce.<br><br>Priority for the other plots will be given to residents living in the area.<br><br>Users of the community farm will pay an annual maintenance fee of S$60 to defray costs.<br><br>Farmers will also get water supply and a temporary footpath will be constructed.<br><br>MP
               for Holland-Bukit Timah GRC, Sim Ann, who is also MP for the area, 
              said: "Arising from feedback from the residents, we feel that this 
              project can be integrated with a temporary footpath that links Block 305
               all the way to the Ulu Pandan Park Connector, which is where many of 
              our residents go for jogging and for walks. And I think this footpath, 
              because it's integrated with the community garden, will also allow 
              residents to access and to admire, the plants and the crops that the 
              farmers are cultivating."<br><br>- CNA/fa</span></span></p>
