              <p>As distressing as it sounds, i'm filing a magistrate's complaint against my biological mother for harrasment. Before you jump the gun, let me tell you that my mother is a crazy and psychotic. She has done things you will never believe like call strangers up, crying blemishing my wife's name. She also once called my friends over, took a packet of sugar and told them that this was all drugs. She's dillusional. Since Jan, when i finally moved out of her place, she she's been sending me mail almost daily and sms which consist of deregoratory terms and verbal abuse. Most of the material are mainly projected towards my partner. But the fact of the matter is that all this causes stress and I'm seeing a psychologist about this.</p>
              <p>I'm going to court to face her next week, in what other way can i make my case stronger? I've got all the mail and the sms's. If i get written testimonials from people whom she have communicated about me and my wife will that help?</p>
              <p>What else can i Do?</p>

              <p>Since u said she got mental problem .. U think things will end after the court case? No it will not.</p>
              <p>Why not seek professional help? AND LET SAID, she kill your partner (touchwood!) and she's a mental case .. She might jolly well just be send to a mental hospital and that's all.</p>
              <p>I dunno bout u but like wat other said, afterall this is your mum .. In our life we can choose to be who we wanna be, who to be our other half, wat friends u wan but u can't choose who's your parents and in this life if u r destined to be her child its a kind of fate.</p>
