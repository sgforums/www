              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: A mother who fell to her death with her young 
              daughter from a Bukit Batok flat in April had carried the girl before 
              making the fatal leap, the coroner's court heard Monday.<br><br>In an 
              inquest into the double tragedy, the court heard that the mother, former
               China national, He Xuejing, had intended to end her own life and took 
              nine-year-old Bao Peiqin with her.<br><br>Both fell to their deaths from a 12-storey flat at Block 290B Bukit Batok Street 24 at around 7am on April 15.<br><br>Forty-five-year-old Madam He was initially very positive about her move to Singapore almost 15 years ago.<br><br>She
               had no major complaints about her new life here, but her husband, 
              49-year-old Bao Xiaoming, an A*STAR researcher, recalled that her 
              attitude changed late last year.<br><br>He noted that she became more 
              agitated over what appeared to be trivial matters and could sense that 
              she was losing her enthusiasm about living in Singapore.<br><br>The Baos, who came from China, obtained their Singapore citizenship in 2003.<br><br>But
               even after nearly 10 years here, Madam He frequently told her husband 
              that their own behaviour and mannerisms were not like native 
              Singaporeans.<br><br>Her elder daughter had also overheard her saying 
              that unlike China nationals, Madam He felt that Singaporeans tended to 
              not reveal their feelings and opinions.<br><br>Madam He also felt that Peiqin was not welcomed in school and should return to China.<br><br>She deliberately did not send her to school one day to see how it would react to her daughter's absence.<br><br>And Madam He arrived at that conclusion after she claimed that staff members there did not call her to enquire about Peiqin.<br><br>Investigating
               officer, Sergeant Russell Lim Fang Yu, told the court that shortly 
              after discovering the bodies, officers went up to the Baos' flat and 
              noticed that a black chair had been placed beside a wide open bedroom 
              window.<br><br>Officers also found three handwritten letters, most 
              probably written by Madam He addressed to her parents, husband and elder
               daughter.<br><br>The court heard that the letters stated that she loved her family members and that she was about to "leave" with Peiqin.<br><br>State
               Coroner Imran Abdul Hamid said that Madam He had unlawfully caused her 
              daughter's death, adding that Peiqin was a victim of her mother's 
              "impulsive act".<br><br>Both died from multiple injuries and were pronounced dead at the spot at around 8am that day.<br><br>- CNA/cc</span></span></p>

              <p>in 2005 the gambler father murdered his wife and his 2 young children. a mother jumped with her child to death cos she had cancer (dunno which year). now this and the bedok reservoir mother and son death.</p>
              <p>the thinking of these parents were not rational due to depression. they were unable to think straight. all they wanted was commit suicide and die together with their child cos they reckoned their child would be abandoned and no one to take care of them anymore. also since they think that they are the parent, it would be justifiable if they were to die with me. My mom told me when I was young, since I gave birth to you, I also have the right to kill you. they know that such thinking was wrong, but they still do it anyway. I think there will continue to have such cases as parents killing their children in future.</p>
