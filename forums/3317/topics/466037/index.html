              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; font: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 20px;">Singapore and Malaysia announced plans Tuesday to build a high-speed rail link, fuelling hopes that Southeast Asia could one day enjoy a rapid European-style train system connected to China.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; font: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 20px;">Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and his Malaysian counterpart Najib Razak hailed the project, which would cut travel time between the city-state and Kuala Lumpur to 90 minutes. The target year for completion is 2020.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; font: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 20px;">"This is a strategic development in bilateral relations that will dramatically improve the connectivity between Malaysia and Singapore," the leaders said in a joint statement issued after meeting in Singapore.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; font: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 20px;">"It will facilitate seamless travel between Kuala Lumpur and Singapore, enhance business linkages and bring the peoples of Malaysia and Singapore closer together."</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; font: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 20px;">The existing rail link between the two countries dates back to the period of British colonial rule over both, with stops at several Malaysian towns. The current Singapore-Kuala Lumpur service takes more than seven hours.</p>
              <img src="http://news.mylaunchpad.com.my/DesktopModules/PackFlashPublish/Resources/handlers/imageResize.ashx?height=373&amp;portalID=5&amp;image=~/Portals/5/Images/News/197379/1361262566189-5-0.jpg" alt=""><br>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; font: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 20px;">No cost estimate was given for the construction of the new rail link.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; font: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 20px;">"(We) have some very preliminary figures but I am not inclined to mention those figures because it will tend to stick in people's minds," Najib said at a joint news conference with Lee.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; font: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 20px;">Lee quipped that Singaporeans would be able to have lunch with friends in Kuala Lumpur, which is about 350 kilometers (220 miles) away, and get back within the day.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; font: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 20px;">"It's a strategic project for the two countries. It will change the way we see each other," said Lee, likening it to the heavily used London-Paris connection.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; font: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 20px;">The 90-minute travel time for the new train compares with four hours by car, including clearing immigration, and five hours by bus.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; font: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 20px;">And while a flight takes less than an hour that does not take into account the time taken to check in, pass immigration and pick up luggage.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; font: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 20px;">Both countries belong to the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), which hopes to one day link most member states by rail and extend the connection to China and possibly India.</p>
              <img style="margin: 0px 0px 15px; padding: 0px; font: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;" src="http://news.mylaunchpad.com.my/DesktopModules/PackFlashPublish/Resources/handlers/imageResize.ashx?height=373&amp;portalID=5&amp;image=~/Portals/5/Images/News/197379/1361259501000-5-0.jpg" alt="">
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; font: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 20px;">ASEAN is contemplating a link that will run from Singapore to Kunming in southwestern China, thereby tapping into the country's vast high-speed network -- the world's longest at more than 9,300 kilometres and rapidly expanding.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; font: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 20px;">To link up with China, ASEAN estimates that there are 4,069 kilometres of missing links that need to be built, or existing railways that need to be upgraded, in several countries.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; font: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 20px;">"Beyond ASEAN, once these links are built, it will connect both the mainland ASEAN and ASEAN with its trading partners China and India," a fact sheet on the trading bloc's website said.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; font: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 20px;">A Singapore-Malaysia high-speed railway was first mooted in the 1990s by Francis Yeoh, head of Malaysian infrastructure conglomerate YTL, which built an express train service from Kuala Lumpur's main airport to the city centre.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; font: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 20px;">The idea was repeatedly shelved largely due to cost concerns. Malaysian media reports said in 2009 that the project's cost was estimated at $2.5 billion-$3.5 billion.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; font: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 20px;">Hopes for the project were revived in 2010 after Najib became prime minister.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; font: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 20px;">Chin Hoong Choor, an associate professor at the National University of Singapore specialising in transport, told AFP that there was "definite political will" to create a Singapore-Kunming rail link.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; font: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 20px;">The new Singapore-Kuala Lumpur service will be one of the important links in the network "and possibly among the first to be constructed due to demand and availability of funds," he said.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; font: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 20px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; font: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 20px;">2020 better not bankrupt first. lo</p>

              <p><strong>Most travellers welcome new high-speed rail link to Kuala Lumpur</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Most travellers have welcomed the new high-speed rail link between Singapore and Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>They say it offers an additional option while making travel plans within the region - be it for business or leisure.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Anos Enrado, a 
              tourist, said: "This is nice because it makes Asian countries more 
              connected and it's much faster travelling to other countries."<br><br>Alan
               Liew said: "Depending on the operation timing, they can leave on the 
              morning train and then come back on the last train back to Singapore. So
               it saves one night hotel accommodation."<br><br>Industry players, however, say fares on the 90-minute high-speed rail link will determine the impact on coaches and airlines.<br><br>The
               Express Bus Agencies Association says the development may have a 
              "tremendous impact", but coach operators will still have some edge.<br><br>Sebastian
               Yap, Terminal Services Sub-Committee, Express Bus Agencies Association,
               said: "To me the high-speed train cannot be cheaper than bus, there's 
              no way about it. So in terms of the pricing, I think we still have a bit
               of a competitive edge."<br><br>Still, coach operators may have to 
              re-strategise to include complimenting the rail service, by offering 
              services to smaller towns from the stations along the rail line.<br><br>Travellers say they do not mind paying more for speed and predictability which comes with the rail link.<br><br>"It is more secure and more safety. And the timing will be more fixed." <br><br>"I'm expecting about S$80 to S$90 per trip - per one way trip."<br><br>"I
               will take the train because (for) flying you need to check in and check
               out. I think the time will take a much longer time than the train."<br><br>Observers
               say airlines offering flights between the two cities will also see more
               competition - more so for full service carriers than budget airlines.<br><br>Siva
               Govindasamy, Managing Editor of Flightglobal Asia, said: "If this 
              high-speed rail system offers a premium proposition for these business 
              people who need to get from Kuala Lumpur to Singapore comfortably and 
              very fast, then I think its the full service carriers who could have a 
              bigger impact, because the leisure passengers are still price sensitive.
               <br><br>"The budget airlines cater to these leisure passengers, so they
               might not have an impact. We do not know what the aviation industry is 
              going to look like in seven years from now. Budget carriers may refine 
              their models, it may be cheaper for them to offer certain flights. New 
              technologies may come into play, airports may get more efficient."<br><br>- CNA/de</span></span></p>

              <p><strong>High-speed rail link may help ease labour crunch in S'pore</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE : The high-speed rail link between Singapore and Kuala Lumpur could help ease the expected labour crunch in Singapore.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Companies have 
              welcomed the infrastructure project that could potentially reduce 
              travelling time between the two cities to only 90 minutes.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The Association of 
              Small and Medium Enterprises (ASME) believes the project can help 
              attract more workers from Malaysia to work in Singapore.<br><br>Companies see the advantages of hiring workers from Malaysia, which is considered a "traditional" source of foreign workers.<br><br>The
               advantages include not having to post a S$5,000 security bond to employ
               them in Singapore. There are also minimal cultural and language 
              problems.<br><br>Companies said Malaysians living beyond Johor may want to work in Singapore if commuting is enhanced.<br><br>Chan
               Chong Beng, president of the Association of Small and Medium 
              Enterprises, said: "We should be able to attract a lot of these PMEs 
              (professionals, managers and executives) from Malaysia to come to 
              Singapore to work, and also the workers who want to tap on the higher 
              salaries in Singapore.<br><br>"If they can cut off the cost of 
              accommodation in Singapore, it will be very attractive for them to come 
              to Singapore to work, because they can either go back daily or they can 
              go back weekly and continue to be with their families."<br><br>ASME also believes the rail project could spur more Singapore companies to venture further into Malaysia.<br><br>However, industry players said there are challenges which authorities need to address.<br><br>Mark
               Hall, vice-president of Kelly Services, said: "Can we ease the border 
              crossing between Malaysia and Singapore? I read the argument in Europe. 
              In Europe, there is the high-speed rail link that connects London and 
              Paris, London and Germany, London and Spain. <br><br>"The difference 
              there is that the border crossing there is easier. Passports in 
              UK...there is no problem crossing over. Singapore and Malaysia in the 
              next seven years have to figure out what they can do with the border 
              control passing." <br><br>The high-speed train between Singapore and 
              Malaysia will change how Singaporeans commute to Kuala Lumpur. However, 
              whether or not it will entice more Singaporeans to find a job in Kuala 
              Lumpur will depend on several factors.<br><br>One Singaporean said: 
              "(The) price of the train fare...must be good value because it is a 
              day-to-day basis travelling to and from work, so it must be a good 
              price."<br><br>Another noted: "If Kuala Lumpur can bring more (and) 
              better opportunities, let's say higher salaries, of course who 
              (wouldn't) want to do that; as long as there is money available, maybe 
              people will try..."<br><br>In addition, workers have pointed out that for daily commuting to happen, the rail system needs to be reliable.<br><br>- CNA/ms</span></span></p>
