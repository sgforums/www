              <p>HONG KONG (AFP) - - It's not that Gary Chang doesn't have room in his
              tiny flat to swing a cat. With just 344 square feet (32 square metres)
              of floor space, he doesn't have room for the cat.</p>
              <p>Yet award-winning Hong Kong architect Chang has managed to squeeze
              24 rooms -- including a steam room and home cinema -- into his Swiss
              army knife-style home.</p>
              <p>Chang, 46, turned the tiny flat he has
              occupied since the age of 14 into what he calls his "domestic
              transformer," and in the process offered a vision for how one of the
              world's most densely-populated cities could better use its limited
              space.</p>
              <p>"The key idea is that everyone could look into their home
              more carefully and into how better to optimise their resources, because
              space is a resource," he said.</p>
              <p>"There is no use making your home as if it is a perfect show flat but at the same time never using the space," he said.</p>
              <p>Chang
              has tackled the lack of room by replacing the flat's walls with a
              series of accordion-like sliding units, hung from metal tracks on the
              ceiling, that can be moved about to form a variety of configurations.</p>
              <p>The partitions conceal drawers for clothes, shelves for toiletries and racks for thousands of CDs and DVDs.</p>
              <p>Chang
              grabs a handle near his wall-mounted television and suddenly the wall
              itself is moving across the polished granite floor to the centre of the
              room, revealing a folding laminate worktop and well-stocked minibar
              facing the kitchen behind.</p>
              <p>The flat can be one big, open-plan studio or, with very little effort, an arena of fold-down surfaces, seats and beds.</p>
              <p>The concept was born of necessity. Growing up in the flat with six others, Chang had to be flexible.</p>
              <p>"I
              have three younger sisters, so we all lived here. Originally there were
              three bedrooms, a living room and a dining room," he said.</p>
              <p>"My
              sisters occupied one room, my parents another room and the third was
              actually not for me, it was for an outsider -- my parents sub-let it to
              somebody else to get more revenue. So actually I slept in the living
              room."</p>
              <p>Chang still lives in the flat, and has spent his adult life
              reinventing his small corner of a 19-storey 1960s tower block in Hong
              Kong's bustling Sai Wan Ho district.</p>
              <p>The architect believes his
              innovations can show even the poorest families how to improve their
              domestic arrangements and is determined that his book "My 32m2
              Apartment: A 30-Year Transformation" will influence new housing.</p>
              <p>Lack
              of space is a huge problem in Hong Kong, a metropolis of seven million,
              reflecting rocketing rental prices, at least before the recent downturn.</p>
              <p>The
              average price per square metre nearly doubled from 32,777 dollars on
              Hong Kong island in 2002 to 58,915 dollars five years later, according
              to the city's housing authority.</p>
              <p>But Chang regards the dense
              housing as a kind of social arbiter, responsible for some of the city's
              most notable virtues, such as low crime.</p>
              <p>"Oddly enough, it's the
              lack of density that makes a place dangerous, because when the place is
              like Hong Kong, 24 hours it's busy and people feel safe," he said.</p>
              <p>"It's
              like we are monitoring each other in quite a frequent manner so
              actually I try to argue for high density -- we have efficiency,
              convenience and security."</p>
              <p>The optimisation of space means Chang
              can afford to squeeze in luxuries not usually seen in Hong Kong's tiny
              apartments, including a glass shower which doubles as a steam room, a
              1.9-metre (six feet-three inch) bathtub and a reasonably sized kitchen.</p>
              <p>There
              is even a wall-sized cinema screen, raised by remote control to reveal
              a huge, yellow-tinted window which gives the flat the illusion of being
              washed in warm sunlight, even on the cloudiest day.</p>
              <p>Chang's
              experiment in flexible living began after he graduated from the
              University of Hong Kong, where he had been studying architecture.</p>
              <p>"In
              the year I graduated, 1987, my parents moved to a better place in Hong
              Kong and my mother encouraged me to buy the place. So, starting in the
              late 1980s, it became my home," he said.</p>
              <p>Chang has renovated four
              times, on each occasion with a bigger budget and more innovative
              approach, turning a 350,000-Hong Kong-dollar (45,000 US) shoebox into a
              mini-palace worth around 1.3 million dollars.</p>
