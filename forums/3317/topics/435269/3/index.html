              <p>I read about Mongolia a long time ago before you and before the Internet era and Wikipedia . And I also read thoroughly.  I had a book on Genghis Khan who was Temujin before he became a Khan.</p>
              <p>You started of by being bias and think Wikipedia is superior or may be even a God to you. Your position is that you quoted and lifted everything wholesale from Wiki, you doubted the 40 millions but you never bothered to verify.  Instead, you swallowed wholesale - bait, hook and sinker.</p>
              <p>I asked a few questions and you dared not answer because that will put you into a difficult position.  If you think 40 millions is the death toll, quote other reliable sources, not just Wikipedia.</p>
              <p>Last I checked, Wikipedia is full of errors, bias and opinions of contributors.  You admittted that Wikipedia could be wrong yet you chose to believe.  You have blind faith.</p>
              <p>If I have presented 'what if', what has Wikipedia presented?  The 40 million death toll is a claim that could be inflated by the writer who had an enormous admiration of GK and wanted to show how mighty he was.  Until you can prove to me that there was reallly 40 million, your position is no better than my 'what if'.</p>
              <p>Having said all these, I sense that you stick to your position and sided with Wikipedia because that is your source and you rely on it ONLY.  A true seeker of knowledge do not just take one source which could be bias.  For instance, the Japanese history books claimed there was no Rape of Nanking - what do you say? </p>

              <p>This is an interesting thread but let it not descend into unnecessary flaming. After all, everyone in here is a history lover, no?</p>
              <p>I have to give my 2 cents worth that while wikipedia may be an interesting read, it is not the ultimate reliable source of info. I have ever seen Alessandro Del Piero's (Italian footballer) nationality as Singaporean and was born in 1911, all this on wiki. Anyone can edit wiki so there lies the problem.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Please paste below as your new reply parts where I got biased .</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>I stated Wikipedia is more reliable than YOU .</strong> doesnt mean I worship wikipedia like god . I did copy and paste the basic information about mongol invasion frm wikipedia to the first posts in this topi in order to provide a basic information of what the topic is really about and that is totally fair . I dont get why you are so worked up with that ? what is the connection with bait hook and fishing ? rhetorical .</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">You assumed I would be in difficult position by answering your question . does that mean you did wanted or was hoping for me to be in difficult position by asking me specific questions that you formulated in such ways in order to achieve that goal ?</span></p>

              <p>I read about Mongolia a long time ago before you and before the Internet era and Wikipedia . And I also read thoroughly.  I had a book on Genghis Khan who was Temujin before he became a Khan.</p>
              <p>You started of by being bias and think Wikipedia is superior or may be even a God to you. Your position is that you quoted and lifted everything wholesale from Wiki, you doubted the 40 millions but you never bothered to verify.  Instead, you swallowed wholesale - bait, hook and sinker.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Please paste below as your new reply parts where I got biased .</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>I stated Wikipedia is more reliable than YOU .</strong> doesnt mean I worship wikipedia like god . I did copy and paste the basic information about mongol invasion frm wikipedia to the first posts in this topi in order to provide a basic information of what the topic is really about and that is totally fair . I dont get why you are so worked up with that ? what is the connection with bait hook and fishing ? rhetorical .</span></p>

              <p>I asked a few questions and you dared not answer because that will put you into a difficult position.  If you think 40 millions is the death toll, quote other reliable sources, not just Wikipedia.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">You assumed I would be in difficult position by answering your question . does that mean you did wanted or was hoping for me to be in difficult position by asking me specific questions that you formulated in such ways in order to achieve that goal ?</span></p>

              <p>hahaha, you are absolutely right.  The issue was "Is the 40 million death toll tenable and credible claim?"  When looking at sources, there is this danger of 'confirming' by repetition.  Just because more than one source published the same figure doesn't mean it is the truth.  We have heard this before: a lie told repeatedly becomes a truth.</p>
              <p>I am open to facts and I have no interest to be stuck with any figure.  Unless, someone alive now has counted the dead toll caused by the Khans, we have no idea the correct figure.</p>
              <p>Oh note, history in not about exchange of ideas.  This forum is.  But sometimes we get heated up during exchanges, so let that be history!</p>

              <p>Yes it was written 'about 40 millions' in wiki and other sources and we just paste it up for discussion reference purpose . there is no need to sweat whether it is actually 40 millions or 5 millions .<em> <strong>it is like you are discussing about the danger of eating too much KFC and whether it should be considered a bio hazard(for example) and someone came up and say does kentucky fried chicken really came from kentucky ? like everyday ?</strong></em> sian right .</p>

              <p>In an exam, all questions have answers.  No answer, no marks.</p>
              <p>In reality, no answer means don't know, don't want to answer, better not to answer in case ....., don't want to look like an idiot, don't want to be challenged, don't want to be embarrassed, don't want to be in awkward position.</p>
              <p>Believe me the above are possible answers to why people don't answer question.  It is not the same as questions have no answers!</p>
