              <p>40 millions casualties is an impossible number.  There aren't millions of Mogol warriors, just tens or hundreds of thousands.  The conquest campaigns took years to cover the vast geographical expanse - three generation of Khans.</p>

              <p>40 millions would be the population of the countries conquered.</p>
              <p>The extent of Mongol Empire (minus China) would be about the same size as Soviet Union (USSR).  And history had a twist - Mongolia was a vassal state of USSR until recent time.  And USSR no longer exists!</p>

              <p>actually i think for most parts of china's history, it was cheaper to build a wall rather then send an army to fight them which prompt the decision to keep a wall there. It was meant to keep raiders out rather than a real army.</p>
              <p>Han and Tang dynasty's control extended beyond the great wall. Song dynasty only had the south china so no great wall for them.</p>
              <p>the current wall's built in ming dynasty long after the mongols were gone.</p>

              <p><br>But I think it happened back then bro coz I stumbled upon it in wiki this is how it goes :</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Before Genghis Khan died, he assigned <a title="Ögedei Khan" href="/wiki/%C3%96gedei_Khan"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Ögedei Khan</span></span></a> as his successor and split his empire into <a title="Khanate" href="/wiki/Khanate"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">khanates</span></span></a> among his sons and grandsons.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></span></span></a></sup> He died in 1227 after defeating the Western Xia. He was buried in an <a title="Tomb of Genghis Khan" href="/wiki/Tomb_of_Genghis_Khan"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">unmarked grave</span></span></a> somewhere in Mongolia at an unknown location. His descendants went on to stretch the Mongol Empire across most of <a title="Eurasia" href="/wiki/Eurasia"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Eurasia</span></span></a> by conquering and/or creating <a title="Vassal" href="/wiki/Vassal"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">vassal</span></span></a> states out of all of modern-day China, <a title="Korea" href="/wiki/Korea"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Korea</span></span></a>, the <a title="Caucasus" href="/wiki/Caucasus"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Caucasus</span></span></a>, Central Asian countries, and substantial portions of modern Eastern Europe, Russia and the Middle East. Many of these invasions resulted in the large-scale slaughter of local populations, which have given Genghis Khan and his empire a fearsome reputation in local histories.<sup id="cite_ref-mongolia_7-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-mongolia-7"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></span></span></a></sup> <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mongol campaigns may have resulted in the deaths of 40 million people."<sup id="cite_ref-china_8-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-china-8"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></span></a></sup></span></p>
              <p>Beyond his military accomplishments, Genghis Khan also advanced the Mongol Empire in other ways. He decreed the adoption of the <a title="Old Uyghur alphabet" href="/wiki/Old_Uyghur_alphabet"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Uyghur</span></span></a> script as the Mongol Empire's writing system. He also promoted religious tolerance in the Mongol Empire, and created a unified empire from the nomadic tribes of northeast Asia. Present-day Mongolians regard him as the founding father of <a title="Mongolia" href="/wiki/Mongolia"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Mongolia</span></span></a>.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></span></span></a></sup></p>

              <p>There may be several Khan generations, each expanding the Mongol empire, not necessarily by large and long battles resulting in huge casualties.  There could be walkovers, little resistance, small but decisive battles. Also, while the geographical stretch is large, the population centres ar few and far between.  In other words, if you take a village in Changi, you can claim you take Singapore!</p>
              <p>Take the Japanese invasion of Malaya - they landed somewhere in Trenggganu, sink two British ships, cycled into Singapore and the British surrendered all the colonies in SEA !!!!  For that how many died fighting the Japanese?</p>

              <p>The Mongol Empire lasted 3 generations till the end of the Yuan dynasty.  As I said, the Mongolians were excellent horsemen and archers and even unarmed combat like wrestling.  As nomadic they were used to living in small groups, independent and wandering the vast steppes and far flung wilderness where their horses would take them.  Also, there were clan clashes and raids and rapes were common. It was Temujin, the son of a warlord who united the various clans and formed a formidable fighting force. </p>
              <p>I seriously doubt the 40 million dead figure that was directly attributable to the Mongol conquests.  How many died in WWII ? </p>
              <p>I have given reasons for my doubt.  You have stuck to the figure without much basis - like 'it is possible', 'it is published by wikipedia', etc.</p>
