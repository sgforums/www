              <p><strong>S'pore needs more educated immigrants to make country dynamic, says MM 
              Lee</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : Singapore's Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew has 
              reiterated the need for Singapore to attract more educated immigrants. </span></p>
              <p><span>Speaking at the Indian New Year celebrations in Little India on 
              Saturday, Mr Lee said Singaporeans must recognise that with a declining 
              population, the country needs such people, including those who have 
              studied or worked in the US and Europe.
              <br> <br> With the economy in a buoyant mood after the government upgraded its 
              growth forecast for the year, Mr Lee said Singapore needs to grow as an 
              attractive hub for international trade, investment and talent to sustain
               long-term growth.
              <br> <br> "We benefited from being open to immigrants from around the world, 
              especially China, India and the region. Throughout history, Singapore 
              has welcomed migrants. When I first took office, we had 62,000 babies 
              every year from a population of 2 million. Today, Singapore citizens 
              produce only 32,000 babies in a year when we should have 60,000 just to 
              replace our population," said MM Lee. 
              <br> <br> Little India is a glowing example of how early immigrants have 
              flourished and taken root in the country.
              <br> <br> Mr Lee said the government understands the concerns of Singaporeans over
               new immigrants and foreign workers. So it has taken steps to moderate 
              the inflow and widen the differentiation between citizens and 
              non-citizens.
              <br> <br> Having educated immigrants here, said Mr Lee, makes Singapore more 
              competitive and dynamic.
              <br> <br> "The majority of the new PRs and citizens are skilled workers and 
              professionals in finance, IT and R&amp;D.  They bring new skills, global
               connections and a strong drive to create better lives for their 
              families," said Mr Lee. 
              <br> <br> Mr Lee gave an example of how one immigrant is making a difference.
              <br> <br> "Shyam Srinivasan came from Chennai at age 14, and went to Geylang 
              Methodist Secondary School and Victoria Junior College. He took up 
              citizenship and obtained a teaching scholarship from the Public Service 
              Commission," said the Minister Mentor. 
              <br> <br> "Last year, he graduated top of his class in Physics at Oxford 
              University. He is now doing his Masters in Applied Physics at Columbia 
              University. He will come back and complete his NS. He will educate and 
              inspire the next generation of Singaporeans," he said.
              <br> <br> Their presence has also helped to shape the Singapore landscape.
              <br> <br> Mr Lee cited how many Indian temples today have been refurbished to look
               "elegant" and "colourful". 
              <br> <br> "Our immigration policies have brought in better educated and wealthy 
              Indians who have made that qualitative difference to our lives. Their 
              support of these temples has resulted in this transformation, reflecting
               the transformation that is taking place throughout Singapore," said Mr 
              Lee. 
              <br> <br> Mr Lee said the challenge is to integrate newcomers into Singapore 
              society and an event like this Indian New Year Celebration is a good 
              example of how integration can be done. 
              <br> <br> The event brings together different communities, not just among the 
              different Indian ethnic groups, but also Singaporeans of all races. </span></p>
