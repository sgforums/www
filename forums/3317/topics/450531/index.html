              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE : For nearly three years, a husband-wife duo ran a 
              ring of Vietnamese prostitutes, many of whom were underage, and lived 
              off their earnings.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>For that, 
              42-year-old Seng Swee Meng was jailed five years on Wednesday after 
              pleading guilty to 15 counts of violating the Women's Charter Act. </span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>His wife, Ngo Tien, a
               Vietnamese national, is still at large after she left Singapore with 
              their their3-year-old daughter last July.<br><br>The duo recruited the women, some of them were between 16 and 17 years old at that time, from October 2008 to August 2011.<br><br>They put the women in their Geylang apartment where Seng's wife would coach the women on plying their trade. <br><br>Throughout their stay here, the pair would also take a cut of the girls' earnings, varying between S$300 and S$700 each time. <br><br>In
               addition, Seng and Ngo introduced the women to their friends, and 
              ordered them to provide sexual services for their friends as well. <br><br>On one occasion, they arranged for a 16-year-old girl to have sex with Seng's friend, a 52-year-old man, for S$100. <br><br>Seng turned himself in after his apartment was raided last August which saw 30 Vietnamese women being arrested.<br><br>The court heard that Seng, who is currently unemployed, became involved in vice activities through his wife.<br><br>In
               his mitigation, Seng's lawyer, S S Dhillon told the court that Seng was
               "reluctant to be drawn into the scheme" but assisted her eventually out
               of "financial desperation".<br><br>He added that Seng was not the 
              mastermind as his wife made the arrangements for the Vietnamese women to
               be brought into Singapore. <br><br>For receiving the women in Singapore
               and living off their earnings, Seng could have been jailed up to five 
              years and fined a maximum of S$10,000 for each offence.<br><br>- CNA/ms</span></span></p>
