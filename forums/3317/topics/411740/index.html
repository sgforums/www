              <p>JARRATT, Va. â€“ Teresa Lewis spent the last days before her execution 
              as she had spent one side of her life _ singing hymns and praying. That 
              devotion to Christianity, by her own admission, was countered by 
              outrageous bouts of sex and betrayal.</p>
              <p>That dark side led her life to a deadly turn in 2002 when she plied 
              two men with sex and cash to kill her husband and stepson to collect on a
               $250,000 insurance policy. For that, the 41-year-old on Thursday was 
              the first woman put to death in the U.S. since 2005.</p>
              <p>Lewis died by injection at 9:13 p.m., apologizing first to the sole 
              surviving daughter of the husband she had killed. She was the first 
              woman in Virginia since 1912 put to death. Her supporters and relatives 
              of the victims watched her execution at Greensville Correctional Center 
              in Jarratt.</p>
              <p>"She was very peaceful," before she entered the death chamber, said her attorney, James Rocap III.</p>
              <p>"We thought that we were supposed to be helping her, while she was 
              actually helping us," he said about the days leading to her death during
               which she laughed, sang and prayed _ for everybody.</p>
              <p>Lewis promised the killers a cut of a life insurance policy to shoot
               her husband, Julian Clifton Lewis Jr., and his son, Charles, as they 
              slept in October 2002. Both triggermen were sentenced to life in prison 
              and one committed suicide in 2006.</p>
              <p>Lewis appeared fearful, her jaw clenched, as she was escorted into 
              the death chamber. She glanced tensely around at 14 assembled 
              corrections officials before being bound to a gurney with heavy leather 
              straps.</p>
              <p>Moments before her execution, Lewis asked if her husband's daughter _
               her stepdaughter _ was near. She was. Kathy Clifton was in an adjacent 
              witness room blocked from the inmate's view by a two-way mirror.</p>
              <p>"I want Kathy to know that I love her and I'm very sorry," Lewis said.</p>
              <p>Then, as the drugs flowed into her body, her feet bobbed but she 
              otherwise remained motionless. A guard lightly tapped her on the 
              shoulder reassuringly as she slipped into death.</p>
              <p>More than 7,300 appeals to stop the execution had been made to the 
              governor in a state second only to Texas in the number of people it 
              executes.</p>
              <p>Texas held the most recent U.S. execution of a woman in 2005. Out of
               more than 1,200 people put to death since the U.S. Supreme Court 
              reinstated capital punishment in 1976, only 11 have been women.</p>
              <p>Lewis, who defense attorneys said was borderline mentally disabled, 
              had inspired other inmates by singing Christian hymns in prison. Her 
              fate also had drawn appeals from the European Union, an indignant rebuke
               from Iran and the disgust of thousands of people.</p>
              <p>The execution stirred an unusual amount of attention because of her 
              gender, claims she lacked the intelligence to mastermind the killings 
              and the post-conviction emergence of defense evidence that one of the 
              triggermen manipulated her. Her spiritual adviser, the Rev. Julie Perry,
               stood sobbing as she later witnessed the execution, clutching a 
              religious book.</p>
              <p>Throughout her life, a faith in God had been a seeming constant for 
              Lewis _ whether it was the prayer with her husband hours before he was 
              killed or her ministry behind bars.</p>
              <p>But there was another side.</p>
              <p>"I was doing drugs, stealing, lying and having several affairs 
              during my marriages," Lewis wrote in a statement that was read at a 
              prison religious service in August. "I went to church every Sunday, 
              Friday and revivals but guess what? I didn't open my Bible at home, only
               when I was at church."</p>
              <p>Her father said she ran off to get married, then later abandoned her
               children and ran off with her sister's husband. Then she had an affair 
              with her sister's fiance while at the same time having an affair with 
              another man.</p>
              <p>Lewis married Julian in 2000 and two years later, his son Charles 
              entered the U.S. Army Reserve. When he was called for active duty he 
              obtained a $250,000 life insurance policy, naming his father the 
              beneficiary and providing temptation for Teresa Lewis.</p>
              <p>Both men would have to die for Lewis to receive the payout.</p>
              <p>She met at a Walmart with the two men who ultimately killed Julian 
              Lewis and his son. Lewis began an affair with Matthew Shallenberger and 
              later had sex with the other triggerman, Rodney Fuller. She also 
              arranged sex with Fuller and her daughter, who was 16, in a parking lot.</p>
              <p>On the night before Halloween in 2002, after she prayed with her 
              husband, Lewis got out of bed, unlocked the door to their mobile home 
              and put the couple's pit bull in a bedroom so the animal wouldn't 
              interfere. Shallenberger and Fuller came in and shot both men several 
              times with the shotguns Lewis had bought for them.</p>
