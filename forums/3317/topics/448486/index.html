              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: The Manpower Ministry is reviewing the Employment of 
              Foreign Manpower Act, and intends to implement the changes later this 
              year.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The review will 
              cover four key areas aimed at ensuring penalties for breaches are 
              adequate, and that errant employers are held accountable.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>In Parliament on 
              Monday, Minister of State Tan Chuan-Jin said explicit provisions will be
               created to define major contraventions, instead of prosecuting them as 
              part of other, less serious offences under the act.<br><br>These include
               the collection of kickbacks from foreign workers, the use of local 
              "phantom workers" by employers to artificially boost their foreign 
              worker quota, as well as the submission of fake qualifications.<br><br>The
               penalties will also be increased. Currently, maximum penalties for 
              breaching work permit conditions are a S$5,000 fine and/or six months in
               jail. Mr Tan noted that these "do not adequately reflect the egregious 
              nature of such acts", but did not specify the range of penalties being 
              considered.<br><br>Third, authorities are looking into a new mechanism 
              to complement criminal prosecution, to allow them to react quickly to 
              regulatory contraventions.<br><br>Finally, the ministry will expand its 
              powers of investigation to deal with increasingly complex syndicate 
              operations. The proposed powers will be benchmarked to those provided 
              under the Workplace Safety and Health Act and the Employment Agencies 
              Act.<br><br>A public consultation exercise on the proposals will be held later this month.<br><br>Separately,
               the ministry is also reviewing the work pass conditions within the 
              Employment of Foreign Manpower Regulations, to better clarify the 
              responsibilities of employers, foreign workers and foreign domestic 
              workers.<br><br>Mr Tan said our foreign labour force needs to be treated
               decently, particularly to ensure that employment rights are upheld and 
              that workers are not subject to exploitative conditions.<br><br>As 
              foreign workers play an important role in building our infrastructure 
              and caring for our families, they should be treated in a manner that 
              reflects our Singaporean values of fairness and respect for all workers.<br><br>He
               added that by and large, employers in Singapore are found to be 
              responsible, and the majority of some 3,000 foreign workers surveyed 
              said they are generally satisfied with their working conditions and 
              intend to extend their contracts after they expire.<br><br>But Mr Tan 
              said while the ministry will be tough on errant employers, not all cases
               are surfaced early enough. To prevent employers from mistreating 
              workers, he said workers, the public and civic groups should help raise 
              the matter to authorities as soon as possible.<br><br>-CNA/ac</span></span></p>

              <p>Public consultation regarding inflating the salary to get Employment pass is absurd. It is for MOM to check the details before they grant the pass. There are some waiters in restaurant who has EP - P1 pass. </p>
              <p>MOM is giving approval based on the story created by the employer and a stack of documents that has been made up. This loophole is well known to all employers, employment agencies and for sure the MOM.</p>
              <p>The waiter got away, similarly there are large group who are quite happy they got this status instead of a S pass or work permit.</p>
              <p>It is for the MOM to put in place a better system and it will not help in any way by 'sweeping it under the carpet' by having a public consultation.</p>

              i applaud the uplifting of the foreign workers conditions...but the Act should also consider stepping up counter security measures against foreigns for criminal offences....particularly for the safety of our women here...but as well as some stringent measures and education to control maids from involving sexually with foreign workers...
                      
              separately, govt should consider subsidies to domestic employers to encourage regular health checks for maids ...such benefits ensure us a healthy working environment for both employers and maids...
