              <p>TWO police sergeants who conspired to get their hands on a $1,000 wad
               of cash found at Nanyang Polytechnic in April 2008 were jailed on 
              Thursday for attempting to cheat and providing false information. Abdul 
              Aziz Abdul Majid, from the Bedok police division, had also logged onto 
              the police database unlawfully.</p>
              <p>He was jailed a total of 10 months. His accomplice, fellow sergeant Nazir Ali Khan, 37, was jailed four months.</p>
              <p>In passing sentence, District Judge Jill Tan said that while it was 
              inexcusable to cheat another person, it was disgraceful for the two 
              sergeants to try to cheat another officer and get hold of the cash. Both
               men are appealing against the conviction and sentence.</p>
              <p>During the three-week trial, the court heard that Abdul Aziz
               was in financial difficulties when he went into the police database in 
              April 2008 and discovered the Clementi division was holding $1,000 in 
              its lost-and-found section. The 32-year-old then contacted Nazir and 
              devised a plan to claim the cash for themselves. On April 4, he posed as
               a vending machine technician who had lost $1,000 three days earlier, 
              and visited the Clementi police station. He lied that Nazir had informed
               him that the money had been found and was at the Clementi police 
              division.</p>
              <p>The cash was never handed over and, in the ensuing 
              investigation, Nazir was pulled up for an interview and told 
              investigators that Abdul Aziz had lost $1,000 either at Nanyang 
              Polytechnic or at Yio Chu Kang MRT station. He had merely called the 
              Clementi police division to help his friend recover the money.</p>
              <p>Both Abdul Aziz and Nazir have been suspended from their duties.</p>
