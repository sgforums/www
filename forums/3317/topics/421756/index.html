              <h1 class="storyheadline">Malaysia floods: Train services to M'sia disrupted</h1>
              <p>TRAIN services from Singapore to many parts of Malaysia were suspended for a second day on Tuesday due to floods.</p>
              <p>Earlier in the day, the Malaysian Railway (KTM) trains leaving 
              Tanjong Pagar Railway Station were going only as far as Kluang, Johor.</p>
              <p>But by evening, the flooding in Malaysia had abated a 
              little, allowing trains to go further up north to Labis, said a 
              spokesman from KTM.</p>
              <p>Passengers affected by the disruptions were given an option 
              to either get a refund for their train tickets, or to change their 
              travel dates.</p>
              <p>Affected passengers can call the KTM hotline at 1-300-88-5862 (within Malaysia) or +603-2267 1200 (from overseas).</p>
              <p>From Singapore, you can also call at 6222-5165.</p>

              <p><strong>Train services between Singapore and Malaysian on hold </strong></p>
              <p>Trains services between Singapore and Kuala Lumpur are unlikely to resume before Friday. <br> <br> Malaysian rail company, KTM, told MediaCorp that the force of the flood 
              waters had pushed out the ballast, or special stones, which keeps the 
              tracks in alignment. <br> <br> KTM's senior manager for corporate communications, Mr Mohd. Fazil 
              Ismail, said that work to re-align the tracks started yesterday and will
               continue today. <br> <br> They are hoping to complete track work by this Friday. <br> <br> Meanwhile, train commuters from Kuala Lumpur to Singapore have been 
              offered full refunds for the tickets or to change their travel dates. <br> <br> In the last two days, KTM has also rented buses to take passengers to the nearest train station unaffected by the floods. <br> <br> Mr Mohd Fazil said about 2,000 passengers have opted to take the bus to the Kuala Lipis train station. <br> <br> Services from Singapore to Kluang resumed yesterday, but track works 
              between Kluang and Kuala Lumpur are ongoing so train services between 
              the two locations are still on hold.</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">KTM restores Singapore-KL train services</h1>
              <p>COMMUTERS in Singapore are now able to once again travel by train to 
              Kuala Lumpur after nearly a week of disruptions caused by floods in 
              Malaysia on Jan 30.</p>
              <p>All affected services have been restored and are operating normally, according to Malaysian Railway KTM.</p>
              <p>But commuters should brace themselves for delays of 30 
              minutes or more in arrival times. This is because the trains will still 
              need to slow down at certain stretches where damaged tracks have just 
              been repaired.</p>
              <p>Departure times are unaffected.</p>
