              <p>Singapore’s tendency to rely on the continual acceptance of cheap foreign labour has made it a “one-trick pony”, said Association of Women for Action and Research (AWARE) director Corinna Lim.<br><br>Speaking
               as a panellist at a forum on the country’s population issues on 
              Saturday afternoon, Lim noted that its excessive dependence on foreign 
              workers over the years is a short-term one that needs to end sooner or 
              later, and that there are other ways to promote economic growth that we 
              somehow stopped working on.<br><br>“The problem with Singapore is that 
              suddenly, we became a one-trick pony,” she said, addressing about 50 
              members of the public in attendance. “Our one trick was bring in more 
              cheap foreign labour; we will increase GDP every year. And that is true,
               but it’s not the only trick in the book — (yet) it became so convenient
               for us that we used it all the time.”<br><br>Lim added that Singapore’s
               reliance on foreign workers extends beyond short-term economic goals to
               caring for the sick, the aged and the young.<br><br>“This one trick is 
              very short-term. How many more people can we have?” she asked. “I’m sure
               we can take 6 million (people), we might even be able to take 6.5 
              million.  But how many more beyond there? There must be an end to 
              this... we can’t keep adding more and more people.”<br><br>In another 
              point on Singapore’s population, the government’s repeated statements 
              relating fertility rates to the need for foreign workers to support 
              economic growth over the years are “illogical”, said Lim.<br><br>Quoting
               the then-Deputy Prime Minister Wong Kan Seng in 2010, who said 
              Singapore’s low fertility rates mean that it “must keep bringing in 
              foreign workers to support economic growth as the population ages”, Lim 
              said, “If you think about it, (it’s) completely illogical.”<br><br>“Having
               one extra foreign worker today is not going to make any difference at 
              all to the number of people that we have 20 years from now, which is 
              what this fertility issue is about,” she continued. “This (the mass 
              admission of foreign workers) has nothing to do with fertility; this has
               everything to do with the short-term economic needs that exist today — 
              it’s not to do with fertility, so stop trying to confuse us with this.”</p>
              <p><strong>Profit versus cost approach ‘forces us to ground zero’</strong></p>
              <p>Adding to the discussion was fellow panellist Vincent Wijeysingha, 
              treasurer of the opposition Singapore Democratic Party, who said 
              Singapore’s economic climate of seeking the highest profit from the 
              lowest cost will eventually “force us to ground zero”.<br><br>He said 
              going along the line of our “one trick” of continually bringing in more 
              and more foreign workers would still not enable us to compete with 
              countries that have much larger populations, such as Indonesia, South 
              Africa and Papua New Guinea.<br><br>“(The three countries have) huge 
              populations where you pay far lower than you would pay in Singapore,” he
               said. “So the idea that we can somehow compete — cheaper and cheaper 
              and cheaper labour — eventually you bottom out, you flat-line.”<br><br>Wijeysingha
               added that Singapore could go in the way of Liverpool and Detroit in 
              the 1970s and 80s, where in the case of Liverpool, its docks and 
              traditional manufacturing industries entered a sharp decline when 
              containerisation replaced its labour strategy, and for Detroit, its 
              automobile industry took a hit when foreign vehicles entered the fray.<br><br>While
               these cities and their parent countries — the UK and the U.S. — sought 
              refuge in their primary industries, Wijeysingha said Singapore “cannot 
              take shelter in a primary industry to stabilise us”.<br><br>“An economy 
              that seems fixated on the low-wage model is heading for crisis,” he 
              added. “We don’t have to be economists to say this, (and) the inability 
              of the government to comprehend this is not something we, the people, 
              should have to put up with any longer.”<br><br><strong>Data shows impact on low-wage workers: Leong</strong></p>
              <p>Lim and Wijeysingha were among a panel that also included The Online Citizen chief editor Kumaran Pillai and statistician Leong Sze Hian, who tackled issues relating to the question of whether or not Singapore can support and sustain a 6 million-sized population.<br><br>Speaking
               on the issue of the influx of S-pass and work permit holders who 
              depress the wages of Singaporean workers, Leong pointed out that the 
              impact of this phenomenon has been telling through available statistics.<br><br>Even
               though unemployment rates on the whole may stand officially below 2 per
               cent, Leong noted that the rates for cleaners, labourers and related 
              services are higher, at more than 5 per cent. <br><br>Aggravating the 
              situation is the fact that the net pay for these workers is falling over
               the years instead of rising with inflation, with Leong adding that in 
              the past decade, real wages for this category of workers fell by more 
              than 30 per cent when adjusted for inflation.<br><br>He also observed 
              that there appears to be discrimination by age in the workplace, where 
              at the median level for male workers in Singapore, real wages start to 
              fall by age 38. By the time he reaches 55, a man at the median income 
              level earns the same as what he did when he was 33, said Leong.<br><br>“We
               can sustain a 6 or even 6.5 million population,” said Leong. “The more 
              important question I would ask, though, is what kinds of people are we 
              bringing in?”</p>

              <p>you know this is not the solution. to get more cheap useless labor and opush wages down, more sgreans jobless or gettig fucked up jobs, you keep increasing the land prices until when? can increase sgreans but do that on businesses they will go elsewhere move. think again., unless you just want to milk profits from sg one geeneration after that you go elsewhere retire sgreans people still have to stay here live.</p>

              In the past it is quite different compare to nowadays.  In the past, most family don't have maid, however most of the wife don't work and were full time housewives, thus the demand for such job is not high and local can fill up.  However nowadays, unless the husband are super rich, most family need the double income.  There are still housework that need someone that are younger to do and nowadays it is common for work that end up long working hours, required travel etc, which mean both husband and wife might not be able to help much if just depend on their parents (Same case in Hong Kong if you actually see it)
