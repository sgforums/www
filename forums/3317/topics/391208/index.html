              <p>JAKARTA, Indonesia â€“ A teenager received a suspended jail sentence
              for posting insulting comments on a romantic rival's Facebook page, the
              latest case bringing Indonesia's tough defamation laws under criticism.</p>
              <p>Farah
              Nur Arafah, 18, was convicted Tuesday by three District Court judges in
              the town of Bogor, 35 miles (60 kilometers) south of Jakarta, of
              defaming her 18-year-old Facebook friend Felly Fandini. Arafah feared
              Fandini was attempting to sour the relationship with her boyfriend.</p>
              <p>Arahaf's posting in July last year called Fandini a pig and a dog, as well as saying she was promiscuous and overweight.</p>
              <p>Presiding
              judge Ekofa Rahayu sentenced her to 75 days in prison, but suspended
              the sentence because Arafah cooperated during her trial. She must serve
              the sentence if she breaks the law in the next five months.</p>
              <p>Arafah
              said her brush with the law had not put her off Facebook. "But I'll be
              more careful about what comments I post," she told The Jakarta Post
              newspaper.</p>
              <p>Arafah's defamation case was the latest involving social networking Web sites.</p>
              <p>A
              group of reporters recently complained to police when Indonesian
              actress Luna Maya Twittered that tabloid journalists were worse than
              prostitutes and murderers. Police did not press charges.</p>
              <p>A
              mother of two young children, Prita Mulyasari, became a national symbol
              for the plight of the powerless in Indonesia when she was sued by a
              hospital and spent three weeks in jail last year because she complained
              on Facebook that her mumps had been misdiagnosed. She has countersued.</p>
              <p>Andreas
              Harsono, consultant for Human Rights Watch, said Wednesday the New
              York-based watchdog would release a report next month showing that
              Indonesia's criminal defamation laws were among the world's toughest.</p>
              <p>Since
              the fall of the Suharto dictatorship in 1998, the penalty for
              defamation has been reduced from death to life in prison, Harsono said.</p>
              <p>But
              now the number of defamation cases under civil and criminal statutes
              has increased as a means of protecting the powerful and corrupt from
              criticism, he said.</p>
              <p>"It is an electoral democracy, but there are no civil liberties," Harsono said.</p>
              <p>A Facebook spokesman could not be immediately contacted for comment Wednesday.</p>
              <p>Charges
              relating to Facebook posts are not uncommon. Earlier this month a
              teenager in the U.S. state of Illinois was charged with two counts of
              harassment through electronic communication, and a Florida woman was
              jailed for making threats on the Web site.</p>
