              <h3>May 10, 2011 - TNP Forum</h3>
              <p>I had an unpleasant dinning encounter this evening at Thomson Plaza 
              Kopitiam foodcourt which I see the need to raise this matter on forum 
              page, hoping that the experience can be used as examples of social grace
               and courtesy that teenagers and public need to observe.</p>
              <p>The 4-persons table and 2-persons table adjacent to it were empty 
              when I arrived at the foodcourt to have dinner with my mother and 
              daughter.   Both my mother and daughter sat at the empty 4-persons table
               first while I went to top up my value card.   I came back shortly but 
              was caught by surprise by a teenager (boy about 14-17 years old, in dark
               blue colour school polo-tee) who just arrived and sat at the empty 
              2-persons table, with his dish of food,  staring at my mother rudely.  </p>
              <p>I
               asked my mother what had happened and was shocked to know that the 
              teenager chased away my mother and my daughter rudely by raising his 
              voice at them, citing that the seats were all taken.   I was definitely 
              not happy about his unreasonable act as the 2 tables were empty in the 
              first place when I arrived with my family.    I approached the teenager 
              and told him that tables were empty in the first place and that they are
               not for reservations. </p>
              <p>He, however, gave me an arrogant stare and told 
              me off rudely that the seats were already taken and that I should not 
              talk about it anymore.   His elder brother  (in polo shirt with a school
               logo SRJC)arrived then and told me off that the seats were taken and 
              just placed his dish of food on the table too.  The arrogant teeanager 
              had the cheek to advise the elder brother not to talk to me anymore and 
              tried to shame me by telling his brother loudly that I might get people 
              to beat them up.   Concurrently, this teanager's younger sister (in red 
              dress, about 6-8 years old) walked to the empty 4-persons table 
              and said rudely "Shoo!" to my daughter who is still sitting on 
              the chair. </p>
              <p>I am very taken aback by the teanagers' arrogance, rudeness, and lack
               of social grace and the bad example they had set.     I decided to 
              change to another table first while awaiting to see if the teeanagers 
              were with their parents.    After their parents arrived and sat down, 
              the teeanager who first chased away my mother and daughter, stared at me
               from his table and gave me a deliberate winning grin with his fingers 
              pushing up his mouth end-to-end.     How absurd can this teenager be?   
              Why are teeanagers so rude and insensitive these days? </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I decided I should talk to one of their parents after their dinner as
               I am concerned that their parents may not be aware what had actually 
              happen.  When they had finished their dinner and on their way out of 
              foodcourt, I quickly caught up with them.   The elder brother saw me 
              walking towards his mother and had deliberately blocked me by walking in
               between me and his mother.   I stretched out my hand to tap his 
              mother's shoulder, addressing her 'Madam'.   The mother turned around 
              and I asked her politely if I can have a word with her.  </p>
              <p>The arrogant 
              teeanager (the boy who first chased us away) hurried in front of his 
              mother, and challenged at me loudly (and accusing me) that "....if I 
              want to quarrel with his mum, I have to go through him first!"    I 
              turned to his father and said to him that I need to talk to either him 
              or his madam, of which his father then asked the kids to proceed to buy 
              bread.   The two boys followed but the girl clinged on the mother, not 
              wanting to allow her mother to stay back to talk to me.     Fortunately,
               the mother was kind enough to stay and talk to me and asked her 
              daughter to follow her father first.   </p>
              <p>Though it was a good chat I had with the mother and the conversation 
              ended amicably,  I hope that such incident will not happen on others in 
              the foodcourt again.   As long as the tables and chairs are empty in the
               first place when customers / patrons arrive, they can have the seats 
              first.    The "bully" tactic on old people and children or anyone,  to 
              get the seats that one wants cannot be condone.    I hope the above real
               experience I had can be of help to educate teeanagers to exercise more 
              control and politeness in their behaviour.</p>
