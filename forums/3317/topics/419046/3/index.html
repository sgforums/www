              <h1>December 21 2012 Predictions – The End of The World 2012?</h1>
              <div>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-6" title="2012 the end of the world" src="http://december2012endofworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2012-the-end-of-the-world-291x300.jpg" alt="2012 the end of the world">Until a couple of years ago there were not that many people who were acquainted with the end of the world 2012 prophecy that was put forward by many scholars who studied the end of the Mayan long calendar. This Long Count calendar has lasted for five thousand one hundred and twenty five years, and although the end of the calendar leads to many different interpretations, one of the most popular is the belief that at the end of this cycle the world (or humanity’s existence) will come to an abrupt end on December 21 2012.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">In order to fully understand the 2012 end of the world predications, then you should first understand the calendar that is at the center of this controversy. The current cycle, or baktun, of this calendar began on August 13th, 3114 B.C. This marked the end of the last period and the beginning of the current one. The baktun that we are currently living in is the thirteenth, and the end of this cycle is one that has been considered to have a large level of importance to the Mayan people, which is why so many people have come to the conclusion that this cycle’s end is one that will mean the end of the world as we know it.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>While there is no definite proclamation of how the end of the world 2012 predictions will happen, those who have studied this calendar claim that the long calendar was created in order to correspond with a long term astronomical prediction by the Mayan people.</strong> This has led some to believe that this end of the world scenario will play out in a manner that has something to do with something from beyond this world. While this correlation to something that is going on in outer space is not a definite thing, for some it comes from a basic understanding of Mayan culture and their unique understanding of astronomical phenomena and planetary alignments.</p>
              <h2>The Truth About Planet X – Nibiru</h2>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Something else that has been considered is the belief that the 2012 end of the world will come to Earth not through some planetary force outside of our galaxy, but through the power of our own sun. Some who have studied the timing of the 2012 prophesy and combined this knowledge with an understanding of the solar system believe that the end will come via a large solar flare. This flare will come about because of the infiltration of the orbits of the planets in our solar system by an outside orbiting planet that the Sumerians and the Babylonians referred to as Nibiru, and is sometimes referred to by modern scientists as Planet X. Those who subscribe to this theory believe that Nibiru only orbits through our system once every three thousand six hundred years.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">In addition to this, these cultures believed that there were a race of people who lived on Nibiru that were known as the Anunnaki. According to their creation mythology this superior race of beings came to Earth and genetically engineered human beings. They did this because they needed to get gold ore from our planet in order to help save their own environment. The humans that they created helped them by mining the gold from Africa. The basis for this mythology was found in ancient writings that were recently uncovered in relation to the ancient Sumerians, and they documented this creation in detail in their writings. If they are correct, then the end of the world 2012 that is depicted in the Mayan calendar will also coincide with the return of the Anunnaki. In essence, it would be the return of our creators, and this is also something that is closely linked in with the belief that the Mayan calendar signals the forthcoming Apocalypse.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">According to this 2012 end of the world philosophy, when this planetary body re-enters our system it will cause massive disruptions in the orbits of Jupiter, Uranus, Venus, and Earth. When Nibiru crosses our orbit they believe that it will cause the gases in Jupiter to ignite because it will get too close to the sun and the precarious balance that keeps its gas structure in check will be lost, therefore causing Jupiter to turn into a secondary sun. In combination with this, the solar flares that are released from the sun on a naturally reoccurring cycle are set to peak during the year 2012. It is believed that this occurrence in combination with the cycle of Nibiru will cause a massive amount of damage to the planet on a level that has never been seen before.</p>

              <h1>December 21 2012 Predictions – The End of The World 2012?</h1>
              <div>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><img title="2012 the end of the world" src="http://december2012endofworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2012-the-end-of-the-world-291x300.jpg" alt="2012 the end of the world">Until a couple of years ago there were not that many people who were acquainted with the end of the world 2012 prophecy that was put forward by many scholars who studied the end of the Mayan long calendar. This Long Count calendar has lasted for five thousand one hundred and twenty five years, and although the end of the calendar leads to many different interpretations, one of the most popular is the belief that at the end of this cycle the world (or humanity’s existence) will come to an abrupt end on December 21 2012.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">In order to fully understand the 2012 end of the world predications, then you should first understand the calendar that is at the center of this controversy. The current cycle, or baktun, of this calendar began on August 13th, 3114 B.C. This marked the end of the last period and the beginning of the current one. The baktun that we are currently living in is the thirteenth, and the end of this cycle is one that has been considered to have a large level of importance to the Mayan people, which is why so many people have come to the conclusion that this cycle’s end is one that will mean the end of the world as we know it.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>While there is no definite proclamation of how the end of the world 2012 predictions will happen, those who have studied this calendar claim that the long calendar was created in order to correspond with a long term astronomical prediction by the Mayan people.</strong> This has led some to believe that this end of the world scenario will play out in a manner that has something to do with something from beyond this world. While this correlation to something that is going on in outer space is not a definite thing, for some it comes from a basic understanding of Mayan culture and their unique understanding of astronomical phenomena and planetary alignments.</p>
              <h2>The Truth About Planet X – Nibiru</h2>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Something else that has been considered is the belief that the 2012 end of the world will come to Earth not through some planetary force outside of our galaxy, but through the power of our own sun. Some who have studied the timing of the 2012 prophesy and combined this knowledge with an understanding of the solar system believe that the end will come via a large solar flare. This flare will come about because of the infiltration of the orbits of the planets in our solar system by an outside orbiting planet that the Sumerians and the Babylonians referred to as Nibiru, and is sometimes referred to by modern scientists as Planet X. Those who subscribe to this theory believe that Nibiru only orbits through our system once every three thousand six hundred years.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">In addition to this, these cultures believed that there were a race of people who lived on Nibiru that were known as the Anunnaki. <strong>According to their creation mythology this superior race of beings came to Earth and genetically engineered human beings.</strong> They did this because they needed to get gold ore from our planet in order to help save their own environment. The humans that they created helped them by mining the gold from Africa. The basis for this mythology was found in ancient writings that were recently uncovered in relation to the ancient Sumerians, and they documented this creation in detail in their writings. If they are correct, then the end of the world 2012 that is depicted in the Mayan calendar will also coincide with the return of the Anunnaki. In essence, it would be the return of our creators, and this is also something that is closely linked in with the belief that the Mayan calendar signals the forthcoming Apocalypse.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">According to this 2012 end of the world philosophy, when this planetary body re-enters our system it will cause massive disruptions in the orbits of Jupiter, Uranus, Venus, and Earth. When Nibiru crosses our orbit they believe that it will cause the gases in Jupiter to ignite because it will get too close to the sun and the precarious balance that keeps its gas structure in check will be lost, therefore causing Jupiter to turn into a secondary sun. In combination with this, the solar flares that are released from the sun on a naturally reoccurring cycle are set to peak during the year 2012. It is believed that this occurrence in combination with the cycle of Nibiru will cause a massive amount of damage to the planet on a level that has never been seen before.</p>

              <p><span><span>WASHINGTON: Five thousand dead blackbirds rained
              from the sky on the first day of the New Year in Arkansas. Then
              more dead birds fell in other states. Then huge fish kills were
              discovered in multiple US waterways.<br>
              <br>
              And suddenly it became a worldwide phenomenon, with reports of mass
              die-offs of birds and fish in Sweden, Britain, Japan, Thailand,
              Brazil and beyond.<br>
              <br>
              Doves, jellyfish, snapper, jackdaws... it seemed no species was
              immune.<br>
              <br>
              Conspiracy theorists, doomsdayers and religious extremists warned
              that the end was nigh.<br>
              <br>
              Could it be astronauts testing a potent sound beam to ward off
              aliens? The US military experimenting with satellite-powered energy
              weapons?<br>
              <br>
              What about chemical sprays, meteor showers, or earthquakes
              activating pollutants from the BP oil spill in the Gulf of
              Mexico?<br>
              <br>
              "Birds" surged to the most searched term on The New York Times
              website.<br>
              <br>
              Religious bloggers loaded their sites with Bible verse, Hosea
              4:1-3: "The land dries up, and all who live in it waste away; the
              beasts of the field, the birds in the sky and the fish in the sea
              are swept away."<br>
              <br>
              But as speculation roiled the blogosphere, wildlife experts rolled
              their eyes.<br>
              <br>
              "It is not that unusual," said Kristen Schuler, a scientist at the
              US Geological Survey's National Wildlife Health Center.<br>
              <br>
              "There is nothing apocalyptic or anything that is necessarily out
              of the ordinary for what we would see in any given week."<br>
              <br>
              Indeed, the USGS keeps a log on its website with reports of groups
              of birds dying each week, averaging from dozens to thousands.<br>
              <br>
              Regarding the bird deaths in Arkansas, where the local custom is to
              set off fireworks to mark New Year's Eve, officials determined it
              was likely that the noise set off a deadly bird panic.<br>
              <br>
              "It appears unusually loud noises, reported shortly before the
              birds began to fall, caused the birds to flush from a roost," the
              USGS National Wildlife Health Center said in a statement posted on
              the Arkansas Fish and Game Commission website.<br>
              <br>
              "Additional fireworks in the area may have forced the birds to fly
              at a lower altitude than normal and hit houses, vehicles, trees and
              other objects. Blackbirds have poor night vision and typically do
              not fly at night."<br>
              <br>
              In Louisiana, Schuler said it looked like cold weather might have
              killed off about 500 birds.<br>
              <br>
              Meanwhile in Maryland, locals were spooked by reports of some two
              million dead fish in the Chesapeake Bay.<br>
              <br>
              But officials were quick to assuage those concerns, saying the
              deaths were a result of an unusual cold snap, combined with an
              overpopulation of a species known as spot fish.<br>
              <br>
              "Natural causes appear to be the reason for the deaths of the
              fish," said a statement by the Maryland Department of the
              Environment.<br>
              <br>
              "Spot may have difficulty surviving in colder temperatures, and the
              species' susceptibility to winter kills is well-documented," it
              said, noting that surface water temperatures last month were the
              coldest in 25 years.<br>
              <br>
              As for the bird and fish deaths elsewhere in the world, many were
              still under investigation.<br>
              <br>
              According to the National Wildlife Federation's Doug Inkley, the
              most frequent cause of mass death in birds is disease, though
              pollution and "just plain accidents" can also trigger large scale
              die-offs. Often, people just are not aware of them.<br>
              <br>
              "Most of the time these areas are not near human habitation such as
              in forests or in the woods," he said on CNN.<br>
              <br>
              But in today's Internet Age, when hardly anything remains secret,
              word of mass bird deaths has spread with unparalleled speed.<br>
              <br>
              "In 1960, if a bunch of birds started falling from the sky it may
              have been noticed by some people. It may have gotten reported in
              the local paper, but it may never have gotten any further than
              that," said Robert Thompson, professor<br>
              of pop culture at Syracuse University.<br>
              <br>
              "Now some of these kinds of stories, because they get out there on
              the Internet, if they are compelling enough they can immediately
              make this jump to national news," he said.<br>
              <br>
              "Let's face it, big quantities of birds falling from the sky or
              fish going belly up is a pretty compelling story."<br>

              This guy's theory bout the birds falling in 1960 jst appearing in papers should be applied to the global warming theory too. if u read the papers they always say worst earthquake since 1900+ , so its only been the once in the last 50/100 years? how is that catastrophic??? the scientists are jst lazy and point to a 'central theme' and call it global warming, so they can increase prices of stuff to make things greener, and the cope govt tax for their own 'research'

              UFOs on the Moon 2
                                                  By Billy Booth, About.com Guide
                                                  See More Aboutgovernment conspiracynasa ufosastronautsmoon structureskarl wolfeSgt. Karl Wolfe
                                                  www.ufocasebook.comUpgraded Security Status:
                                                  For Wolfe to be able to enter the NSA photographic lab, his security status was upgraded for one day. He was extremely nervous as he entered the high security building. As he made his way into the facility, he was shocked to see so many people-people from many different nations. He had naturally assumed that only American military personnel and scientists would be present. The foreigners had visitors name tags on, and Wolfe thought something very unusual was happening that day.
                                                  Station in a Dark Room:
                                                  Wolfe was really nervous now. Whatever he was to work on must be extremely important, with all of the foreign scientists there that day. He was led into a dark room to begin his duties. A red safety light was all he could see at first, but soon his eyes adjusted and he saw a lone airman manning a station in the dark room. The equipment would have to be moved to another location for troubleshooting and repair, and as he waited for transport, he began to chat with the airman.
                                                  Made by Intelligent Beings:
                                                  The airman told him that all of the NASA photographs were sent to Langley, where they were enhanced, and eventually made into photographs to be sent to and studied by the different branches of the military. He was also told why security was of the utmost importance at the lab on this particular day-recent enhanced imagery had clearly shown structures on the far side of the Moon. These structures were definitely not created by natural forces-they were made by intelligent beings. 
                                                  Base on the Dark Side of Moon:
                                                  "We discovered," the airman said, "a base on the back side of the Moon."
                                                  Wolfe was in no way prepared for what he had just been told. When he airman saw Wolfe nearly shaking in disbelief, he reiterated: 
                                                  
                                                  "Yes, a base on the dark side of the Moon." 
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  Had to be Alien:
                                                  Although Wolfe had not actually been told that some alien intelligence had made the aforementioned structures, who else could it have been? Although Russia had flown unmanned vessels around to the far side, no landing had been made, and the resources and technology needed to build a station there were far beyond that of Russia at the time. Had they made a landing on the Moon, the entire world would have known about it. And Wolfe knew America was still years from a Moon landing.
                                                  Secret Kept for 30 Years:
                                                  His anxiety reached a new level. He was looking at, and being told about, something that he should not have seen or known about. He was actually afraid of being arrested and a court martial. He only wanted to finish his job, and get out of there, and forget the whole incident. He would finish the repair he was called to do, but he could never forget what he had seen that day at Langley. He would tell not a soul for 30 years.
                                                  Sworn to Secrecy:
                                                  His release from the military also required that he not leave the United States for five years. This was a condition of his security status. He also was sworn to not reveal anything he had seen while performing his duties in the military. Wolfe would eventually put a report on what he had seen on video, which is now available on the Internet. There have also been several ex-NASA employees who have come forward telling of their experiences in air brushing structures out of NASA photographs of the Moon.
                                                  Astronauts Encounter Alien Ships:
                                                  One of the first reported astronaut encounters with alien ships occurred during the Apollo 11 mission, according to distinguished author Timothy Good. In his book, "Above Top Secret," he asserts that both Neil Armstrong and saw UFOs during their historic 1969 Moon landing. Good states that he recalls hearing one of the two astronauts make a reference to a "light" in or near a crater during the live television transmission.
                                                  Aldrin Admits Seeing UFOs:
                                                  Mission control requested additional information about the "light," but there would be no response from either astronaut. In a 2006 television documentary, "Apollo 11: The Untold Story," Buzz Aldrin admitted for the first time publicly that the astronauts saw UFOs on their trip to the Moon, but they were not allowed to discuss this information on the live audio feed to NASA. He stated that he felt it would have caused a "panic."

                                www.ldi5.comOtto Binder:
                                Another man who was a former NASA employee, Otto Binder, would come forward with information regarding radio ham operators who had their own VHF receiving equipment that enabled them to hear the actual live uncensored audio feed from NASA to the astronauts and vice versa. Parts of these communications were made public. Later, these tapes would be lost. Here is an excerpt:
                                These "Babies" are Huge:
                                NASA: What's there? Mission Control calling Apollo 11... 
                                Apollo: These "Babies" are huge, Sir! Enormous! OH MY GOD! You wouldn't believe it! I'm telling you there are other spacecraft out there, lined up on the far side of the crater edge! They're on the Moon watching us! 
                                
                                
                                Maurice Chatelain:
                                The former chief of NASA Communications Systems, Maurice Chatelain, would also go public with information regarding the Apollo 11 story. In 1979, he would confirm that Armstrong indeed had made the aforementioned communication regarding UFOs on or in a crater. Chatelain stated: 
                                "The encounter was common knowledge in NASA," he revealed, "but nobody has talked about it until now." 
                                
                                Dr. Vladimir Azhazha:
                                Two well respected Russians, one a physicist and the other a scientist, would also come forward with their statements confirming the Apollo 11 encounter. Dr. Vladimir Azhazha, a physicist and Professor of Mathematics at Moscow University made the following statement:
                                Astronauts Watched on Moon:
                                "According to our information, the encounter was reported immediately after the landing of the module. Neil Armstrong relayed the message to Mission Control that two large, mysterious objects were watching them after having landed near the moon module. But his message was never heard by the public-because NASA censored it."
                                Aldrin Took Movie of UFOs:
                                Soviet scientist, Dr. Aleksandr Kazantsev, stated that Buzz Aldrin took color movie film of the UFOs from inside the module, and continued filming them after he and Armstrong went outside. Dr. Azhazha claims that the UFOs departed minutes after the astronauts set foot on the lunar surface. 
                                NASA Transmissions Blocked:
                                Chatelain would also confirm that Apollo 11 transmissions were deliberately muted on more than one occasion, therefore keeping the secret information from the public. Chatelain's claims must be viewed with high credibility considering his professional background. He was an electronics engineer with Convair-his specialty being telecommunications. He was also head of an electromagnetic research group which developed systems for Ryan. 
                                Chatelain Built Apollo Communications System:
                                While employed at North American Aviation, he designed and built the Apollo communications and data processing systems. He would eventually own eleven patents. He also made the shocking statement that "all Apollo and Gemini flights were followed, both at a distance and sometimes also quite closely, by space vehicles of extraterrestrial origin-flying saucers, or UFOs, if you want to call them by that name. Every time it occurred, the astronauts informed Mission Control, who then ordered absolute silence." 
                                Astronaut Walter Shirra and Santa Claus:
                                He also said: "I think that Walter Schirra aboard Mercury 8 was the first of the astronauts to use the code name 'Santa Claus' to indicate the presence of flying saucers next to space capsules. However, his announcements were barely noticed by the general public." It would later become almost common knowledge that the term "Santa Claus" was a NASA code word for a UFO.

                                                  James Lovell Statement:
              We must also consider a statement by James Lovell on Apollo 8. He was on the command module, and after coming around the far side of the Moon, he made the statement, "PLEASE BE INFORMED THAT THERE IS A SANTA CLAUS." Many people dismissed this statement because it occurred on Christmas Day, 1968, but many of those who are leery of NASA, read much more into his statement. 
              Military Security Regulations:
              Although NASA is officially a civilian institute, much of its monetary support comes from the defense budget, and therefore astronauts are required to follow military security regulations. All imagery, and probably audio transmissions, are screened by the National Security Agency, supposedly for the sake of national security. There is also a rumored discussion between a professor and Neil Armstrong about the astronauts and UFOs. I have included this question and answer session below.
              Warned off by Aliens:
              Professor: What REALLY happened out there with Apollo 11? 
              Armstrong: It was incredible, of course we had always known there was a possibility, the fact is, we were warned off! (by the aliens). There was never any question then of a space station or a moon city. 
              
              Professor: How do you mean "warned off"? 
              
              Armstrong: I can't go into details, except to say that their ships were far superior to ours both in size and technology-Boy, were they big!... and menacing! No, there is no question of a space station. 
              
              
              A CIA Cover-up:
              Professor: But NASA had other missions after Apollo 11? 
              Armstrong: Naturally-NASA was committed at that time, and couldn't risk panic on Earth. But it really was a quick scoop and back again. 
              
              Armstrong confirmed that the story was true but refused to go into further detail, beyond admitting that the CIA was behind the cover-up. 
              
              "Gordo" Cooper:
              One of the most outspoken astronauts was Gordon "Gordo" Cooper, one of the original Mercury astronauts. His discussions with other astronauts, along with his own UFO sighting experiences, caused him to see a need for more discussion and disclosure about the subject of UFOs. In 1985, he appeared before a United Nations panel discussion on UFOs. Here is the statement he made.
              Top Level Program Needed:
              "I believe that these extraterrestrial vehicles and their crews are visiting this planet from other planets, which are a little more technically advanced than we are on Earth. I feel that we need to have a top level, coordinated program to scientifically collect and analyze data from all over the Earth concerning any type of encounter, and to determine how best to interfere with these visitors in a friendly fashion." 
              Handling Problems Peacefully:
              "We may first have to show them that we have learned how to resolve our problems by peaceful means rather than warfare, before we are accepted as fully qualified universal team members. Their acceptance will have tremendous possibilities of advancing our world in all areas. Certainly then it would seem that the U.N. has a vested interest in handling the subject quickly and properly." 
              Observed Flights of UFOs:
              "I should point out that I am not an experienced UFO professional researcher-I have not as yet had the privilege of flying a UFO nor of meeting the crew of one. However, I do feel that I am somewhat qualified to discuss them, since I have been into the fringes of the vast areas of which they travel. Also, I did have occasion in 1951 to have two days of observation of many flights of them, of different sizes flying in fighter formation, generally from west to east over Europe." 
              UFOs Beyond our Reach:
              "They were at a higher altitude than we could reach with our jet fighters... If the U.N. agrees to pursue this project and lend the credibility to it, perhaps many more well qualified people will agree to step forth and provide help and information."
              The head chair that day was U.N. Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim, and the direct quotations came from the November, 1988, issue (Vol 1, No. 3) issue of UFO Universe magazine; Condor Books 351 West 54th St., New York, N.Y. 10019]
              
              Extraterrestrial Powers Do Exist:
              In late 1973, NASA would finally loosen their lips a bit, as they confirmed that 25 astronauts had seen UFOs during lunar missions. Werner Von Braun, famous German rocket scientist, and head of the lunar exploration program, told Esotera magazine, that "extraterrestrial powers do exist, and they are more powerful than previously thought. Iâ€™m not authorized to give you any more details on the issue.â€� 
              The last humans to touch the lunar surface were Russians aboard the probe Luna 24 on August 19, 1976. President George Bush has urged NASA to resume exploration of the Moon, and tentative plans point to the year 2015 as the date that man once again may visit the surface of our moon. What will they find there?

              (Continued from Page 1)
              In December 1965, Gemini astronauts James Lovell and Frank Borman also saw a UFO during their second orbit of their record-breaking 14 day flight. Borman reported that he saw an unidentified spacecraft some distance from their capsule. Gemini Control, at Cape Kennedy told him that he was seeing the final stage of their own Titan booster rocket. Borman confirmed that he could see the booster rocket all right, but that he could also see something completely different. 
              During James Lovell's flight on Gemini 7: 
              
              Lovell: BOGEY AT 10 O'CLOCK HIGH. 
              
              Capcom: This is Houston. Say again 7. 
              
              Lovell: SAID WE HAVE A BOGEY AT 10 O'CLOCK HIGH. 
              
              Capcom: Gemini 7, is that the booster or is that an actual sighting? Lovell: WE HAVE SEVERAL...ACTUAL SIGHTING. 
              
              Capcom: ...Estimated distance or size? 
              
              Lovell: WE ALSO HAVE THE BOOSTER IN SIGHT... 
              
              Donald Slayton a Mercury astronaut revealed in an interview he had seen UFOs in 1951: 
              
              On July 17, 1962 Major Robert White reported a UFO during his fifty-eight-mile high flight of an X-15. 
              
              On May 11, 1962 NASA pilot Joseph Walker said that one of his tasks was to detect UFOs during his X-15 flights. He had filmed five or six UFOs during his record breaking fifty-mile-high flight in April, 1962.
              
              Eugene Cernan was commander of Apollo 17. In a Los Angeles Times article in 1973 he said, about UFOs: 
              
              "...I've been asked (about UFOs) and I've said publicly I thought they (UFOs) were somebody else, some other civilization." 
              
              Irregardless of the other Astronauts' admissions, Aldrin's statement seems to be an omen of a kind, possibly heralding in a new era of disclosure to the public. I only hope that others will follow his lead, and open up the doors of secrecy that guard what our government knows about UFOs.

              Landmark Cases
              
              In 1961, the most well known case of alien contact and abduction transpired in New Hampshire. Stopped in the middle of the road by an alien craft, Betty and Barney Hill would be taken aboard the craft, and subjected to medical testing.
              
              To see the full account of this case, see my article The Hills: Abducted by Aliens.
              
              A monumental case of a landed UFO, several small beings, and physical traces left behind, occurred in Socorro, New Mexico in 1964.
              
              Policeman Lonnie Zamora, thinking he was investigated a mining shack that had exploded, was stunned to see a UFO with 2 small beings.
              
              See all of the details of this case at The Socorro, NM Landing.
              
              Small Creatures
              
              Another alien contact case of interest is the 1964 encounter in Newark Valley, New York. Farmer Gary Wilcox was working in his fields, when his attention was drawn to a metallic object in the distance.
              
              He drove his tractor over to get a closer look, and soon two, small creatures, about 4 foot tall, emerged from the craft. They eased Wilcox's fears by telling him they had spoken to humans before.
              
              Wilcox talked to the beings for about two hours, even asking them if he could go along with them in their UFO. This request was declined. The beings said that their atmosphere was too thin for the farmer to survive. Soon, the craft flew away.
              
              In January, 1965, William Blackburn of Waynesboro, Virginia, was working at an archery club when he spotted two UFOs.
              
              One of the vehicles landed, and soon three beings about 3 feet tall, emerged from the craft. They spoke briefly in an unintelligible language, reentered the UFO, and shot away.
              
              Also in 1965, in Valensole, France, lavender farmer Maurice Masse thought he saw two "children" standing in the field. He walked toward them, and saw a landed flying object.
              
              This closer view enabled him to determine that the so-called "children" were not children at all, but small beings like he had never seen before. They had large heads, and long eyes. They were wearing a type of suit.
              
              It seems that Masse got too close to the UFO, as he was hit by a beam of some type. It disabled him for a time. Later, when he was shown a sketch of the Socorro, NM, craft, he stated: "Someone else has seen my UFO."
              
              A Busy Year
              
              1967 would be a banner year for alien contact. There are at least five reports from this year.
              
              One of the most bizarre accounts of alien abduction would occur, in which aliens paralyzed a family. See all of the details of this case at The Andreasson Abduction. 
              In Kent, Ohio, factory worker David Morris, claims to have seen 4 or 5 aliens emerge from a UFO on March 28.
              
              In Idaho, two young men claimed that they saw a UFO on Highway 26, just outside the city of Ririe. They saw a brilliant flash of light followed by the appearance of two small, strange-looking occupants.
              
              Also in Idaho, Marilyn Wilding, while waiting on her front porch for a ride, saw an unusual light in the sky. The object flew close enough for her to see two, small beings in the domed top of the UFO.
              
              A second case of alien abduction occurred in 1967. Patrolman Herbert Schirmer claims to have been abducted in Ashland, Nebraska. See more details at The Herbert Schirmer Abduction.
              
              Closing out the Decade 
              In Virginia in 1968, two teenage counselors at a summer camp watched UFOs descend over a lake. They claimed that they were both abducted. See the Buff Ledge Alien Abductions.
              
              Also in 1968, in Lakeland, Florida, two alien beings were seen in the domed top of a UFO. Mr. and Mrs. McMullen, Miss Sharon Burgess, and two school students all witnessed the UFO and two beings.
              
              A third 1969 case involved the Milakovics, a husband, wife, and son, who saw a large UFO with a domed top in Hanbury, England. Several alien beings could be seen within a lighted dome.
              
              Also in 1969, an alien abduction was reported to authorities by 24-year-old Jose Antonio da Silva, who was fishing at the time. The incident occurred in Minas Gerais, Brazil.
              
              Jose claims to have been hit by a force on his hind legs as his attention was on the lagoon. He was knocked to the ground. He was abducted by two small alien beings, about four foot tall.
              
              Next, let's take a look at Alien Contact Cases - The 1970s

              Some Final Reports
              
              Alien contact cases began to dwindle as the decade of the 90s began, but there were still some very important accounts to present. You will notice the small number of cases in this final report. There may be several reasons for this.
              
              Many reports of this kind are often kept in the hands of one investigator, or group for quite some time, while an investigation is conducted. Often, the witness is reluctant to have their story made public, and it might be many years before an incident of an alien encounter reaches the public.
              
              The first alien contact case of note in the 1990s occurred on December 19, and happened in Westchester, NY. To use a clichÃ©, it was a dark, stormy night, when our 22-year-old subject and his girlfriend settled down for the night in a guest house on his parent's property.
              
              Neither of the two used drugs at all, and neither one had drank any alcohol that night. As they began to settle down for the night, all at once the girlfriend exclaimed: "That was strange, a white ball of light just went by the window."
              
              After going outside, and finding nothing unusual, they again began to get ready to go to sleep. Suddenly, the girlfriend said in a panic, "They are touching me!"
              
              The two left their quarters, and proceeded to the security of the main house. As they settled in, they noticed the time - much more time had elapsed than they could recall. There were marks on the man's neck, and his girlfriend's wrist, as if she had fought against something, or someone.
              
              No explanation was ever found for the strange events in Westchester, New York.
              
              Strange Creatures
              
              In 1993, a strange UFO-alien encounter took place in the Dandenong foothills, near Belgrave, Victoria, Australia, and involved Kelly Cahill, her husband, and their three children. A one-of-a-kind description of alien beings was coined during this incident - they occupied space but were void of color as we know it.
              
              The Cahills saw, as they were driving home, a glowing, round craft with windows around it. It hovered so low, that Kelly thought she could see beings inside. The object would soon disappear, only to return again.
              
              See more of this fascinating case at The Kelly Cahill Abduction
              
              In 1996, a mysterious case would unfold. On January 20, NORAD gave a warning to its Brazilian counterpart that an unidentified object appeared to be coming down over the southern part of the state. Soon, UFO reports began to be called in by the citizens of the area.
              
              Soon, a fire department received a call about a strange creature, which they at first ignored. Soon, however, a second call was received stating the same thing. More similar calls were received, and a group of responders were sent to the location. They found the strange creature.
              
              This would be only one of many sightings of a strange creature that night. Was this an alien from the UFO? See all of the details at The Brazilian Entity.
              
              Two Final Cases
              
              In Illinois, on October 28, 1999, a man was taken through the floor of a UFO during an abduction. Inside the UFO, he was led by a small, gray alien to an examination table. Soon, he would see a larger gray alien.
              
              Later, several aliens helped him get this clothes back on. He claims that he was abducted twice. Some parts of his abductions he recalled by hypnosis, some he recalled unaided.
              
              A strange account from Longbridge, England, in 2003, completes this particular article. Walking home after work, our subject saw a large spacecraft over a park near the Kalamazoo site of the Rover Car company, where he was employed.
              
              At first, the man saw strange lights moving through the trees of the park, and soon discovered that the lights belonged to a large UFO. It was hovering about 5 feet above the ground. A low-pitched, humming sound came from the object. A distance away stood several, small, spindly creatures.
              
              The creatures had seen him! They began to move toward him. He quickly turned, and ran, making it to the edge of the park. A car pulled up, and motioned for him to come over. The driver asked him, "You didn't see anything, did you?"
              
              The frightened man told the driver he had seen nothing. He ran home, and called the police, who informed him that nothing unusual had been reported that night.

              Questions and Answers
              Malaysia Newspaper Interview
              By Billy Booth, About.com Guide
              See More Aboutufosaliensalien contactalien abductionmalaysia ufosOct 11 2010
              1. Some people still wonder if there are Aliens in the universe. How do you respond to this statement? Do you think that there are still many people who don't believe on Alien?
              
              Reply - Whether or not aliens really exist is a hotly debated topic. The many reports of not only alien abductions, but also close encounters with aliens, tell us that they do exist. However, mainstream science will tell you that these accounts are only stories, and there is no definitive proof there are aliens in the universe.
              
              2. Do you think that UFOs and alien entities will appear in the earth one day and communicate with human beings? Is there any scientific basis toward this statement?
              
              Reply - I and many other researchers believe that not only will aliens make an overt appearance, but have already communicated with world governments privately. The best proof that this will happen is the fact that early civilizations have paintings, cave drawings, and etchings that show visitors from space have already interacted with mankind in an earlier time.
              
              3. If UFOs appear, is there any research telling us how to communicate with them? Do human beings really need someone who is in charge of this job?
              
              Reply - There is research being done as to how to communicate with alien beings, such as SETI, and other privately funded programs. This is being done strictly from a theoretical standpoint. There is a contact protocol to follow maintained by many governments, and it is my belief that someone has to head this effort, we need one voice to communicate with them.
              
              4. Can you share your opinions toward how do human beings communicate with alien entities?
              
              Reply - I would imagine that at first the communication would be from aliens communicating with us by telepathy. It is obvious from previous personal accounts that this is how they communicate with humans initially. However, I'm sure very quickly, there would be some form of symbolic or language worked out to make communication a more simple process for humans.
              
              5. Malaysia's first astrophysicist was rumored to be appointed the leading official in ET contact, although it is already known as erroneous. How do you think about it? Who is the most suitable people to do that? What capabilites does he or she need?
              
              Reply - It is strange to me that this false information was released. Nonetheless, I know there are many citizens of the world that could fill this position. The most important thing is that the person would have to have all of the countries' interest in mind, and communicate for all of us, not just one country.
              
              6. Recently, there have been Aliens appear in Argentina's TV news. What do you think about it? Approximately how many of these kinds of cases happen in one year? Can you share some interesting UFO cases with us? Do you think there is good evidence to prove that there are entities in the universe?
              
              Reply - First of all, Argentina is no different that many other countries. Now and then, approximately 3-4 times per year, you hear an account of alien contact. These cases are often kept under wraps for a time, and the details can be sketchy. A full investigation is required to determine whether or not the case in point has any validity. It is possible that one case could be a major breakthrough.
              
              There are a number of cases that are excellent in proving the existence of alien beings... 1961 Betty and Barney Hill Abduction, 1973 Pascagoula, Mississippi, Abduction (Parker, Hickson), 1975 The Travis Walton Abduction, 1976 The Allagash Abductions, and the 1976 The Dechmont Forest Abduction, just to name a few.
              
              7. How can we verify that the entities that were seen were UFOs or Alien, not a hallucination?
              
              Reply - In many cases, there is not an easy answer. But, in the best cases, there are usually other witnesses to the event, physical traces left behind, and details derived from regressive hypnosis.
              
              8. From your expectation, what will happen if UFOs/Aliens come to earth one day. Is it good or bad for human beings? Will they destroy the earth?
              
              Reply - I wish I had a definite answer to this. This is the question that mankind needs to consider. Are we dealing with good or evil aliens? In our best wishful thinking, we want a visiting civilization to be benevolent, however, there is the possibility that we might make contact with warring group of aliens.
              
              9. What benefit do we gain from doing UFO research?
              
              Reply - We have learned many things from this research. One of the most important has been new developments of technology derived from reverse engineering of captured or downed alien craft. Secondly, the possibility of contact with an alien race has made us enlarge our view of the universe we live in. Humans occupy only a small piece of the vastness of space.

               and 
              Pictures Show NASA Cover-up
               
              You may have read my Apollo hoax article elsewhere on this web site, where I believe that the Apollo footage that has been released by NASA seems to be a hoax. I have uncovered various pictures and transcripts of astronaut conversations from the Apollo missions that relate to encounters with UFOs, and perhaps this is one reason why NASA would release fake footage to the general public. The following are excerpts of conversations from Apollo Astronauts on the Moon to Mission Control - which show that the Astronauts came across some strange and hard-to-explain structures and unusual sightings of unidentified craft - whilst on the surface of the Moon. 
               In the photo to the right, you can see an Apollo astronaut stepping down onto the Moon. In the background, space, the final frontier. Or is it a Hollywood backdrop, the ultimate deception?  Many people feel we have not been told the complete truth regarding NASA's space program, in particular the Apollo Missions of the late 60's and early 70's. Recent research has shown that conditions on the Moon could be very different from the 'official-line' which NASA would lead us to believe.  Dr Farouk El Baz, one of NASA's foremost scientists, confirmed public suspicions when he stated 'not every discovery has been announced to the public'. Is this the understatement of the millennium?Why is it that relatively few people have been allowed total access to the massive NASA archives (photographs which are supposedly in the public domain). Instead we have to make do with the two or three dozen 'reproductions' that appear in the 'official' textbooks, despite literally millions of photographic images obtained by NASA. Something is seriously amiss. Also the original photographs are huge (32"x24") so by the time they have been reduced to fit the pages of a regular book the clarity and quality reduced by the copying process make most of the images pretty meaningless.  In many cases, researchers are left with little more than 'smudges' and 'blurs'. 
              
              Even so, despite all these obstacles, there is still hard evidence when these photographs are scrutinized under the proverbial - and literal - microscope, that points to the fact that virtually everything NASA has told us about the moon is a lie. 
              
              The REAL NASA MOON PHOTOS, for example show all kinds of structures, seemingly both old and new, such as domes, pipelines, and even pyramids. So why aren't these photos in the public domain?  You can see in several of NASA's  film footage, the American flag 'flapping in the wind' and yet the Moon according to NASA has no atmosphere, because it is a vacuum! One film clearly shows a desperate astronaut trying his level best to hold the flag still! 
              
              We are also told that  the famous Neil Armstrong 'footprints' will remain etched on the Moon's surface forever. We are told this precisely because the Moon's 'atmosphere' is a vacuum. The laws of physics demand that dust becomes hardened and will compress in a 'vacuum' therefore ensuring the 'footprints' remain undisturbed. And yet great plumes of dust can be seen spewing forth from underneath the 'Moon Buggy' as it travels across the lunar surface.  Is this 'vacuum theory' some kind of wild hoax by NASA? 
              
              Another NASA cover-up are the small cloud formations that have been photographed above the Moon, again in a vacuum?. And while were on the subject of clouds what about the ONE HUNDRED MILE WIDE CLOUD OF VAPOR that was detected by NASA's own instruments. This embarrassing 'anomaly' was promptly dismissed by NASA scientists as being the result of the considerable volume of urine ejected by the Apollo Mission astronauts!  What were they drinking?! 
              
              For decades strange 'lights' and artificial seeming structures have been observed and recorded on the Moon by amateur astronomers.  Science writer Joseph Goodavage observed that over two hundred white 'dome shaped' structures had been seen and catalogued, only for them often to vanish and reappear somewhere else?. There are even colour photos from the Apollo 8 missions that clearly show evidence of green vegetation on the lunar hills. 
              
              These unusual findings, when added together with the anomalies which Richard Hoagland has shown to exist on Apollo Moon photographs, provide compelling evidence for an ongoing NASA cover-up of what the Apollo Astronauts really discovered on the Moon from 1969 to 1972. 
              
              The following Apollo Astronaut conversations were mostly taken from the out-of-print book "Our Mysterious Spaceship Moon" by Don Wilson (Dell, 1975): 
                
              
              
              
              
              Apollo 16 Mission: April 16 - 27, 1972 
              Charles Duke, Thomas Mattingly and John Young land in the Descartes highlands:
              
              Duke: These devices are unbelievable. I'm not taking a gnomon up there. 
              
              Young: O.K., but man, that's going to be a steep bridge to climb. 
              
              Duke: You got - YOWEE! Man - John, I tell you this is some sight here. Tony, the blocks in Buster are covered - the bottom is covered with blocks, five meters across. Besides the blocks seem to be in a preferred orientation, northeast to southwest. They go all the way up the wall on those two sides and on the other side you can only barely see the out-cropping at about 5 percent. Ninety percent of the bottom is covered with blocks that are 50 centimeters and larger. 
              
              Capcom: Good show. Sounds like a secondary ... 
              
              Duke: Right out here ... the blue one that I described from the lunar module window is colored because it is glass coated, but underneath the glass it is crystalline ... the same texture as the Genesis Rock ... Dead on my mark. 
              
              Young: Mark. It's open. 
              
              Duke: I can't believe it! 
              
              Young: And I put that beauty in dry! 
              
              Capcom: Dover. Dover. We'll start EVA-2 immediately. 
              
              Duke: You'd better send a couple more guys up here. They'll have to try (garble). 
              
              Capcom: Sounds familiar. 
              
              Duke: Boy, I tell you, these EMUs and PLSSs are really super- fantastic! 
              It is obvious that the astronauts are talking in code - meant to disguise what they are referring to. The big question is why the excited cries? Can this be *merely* due to the collecting of Moon rocks, as they would have us believe? Or did they find something much more substantial, which was not meant for public knowledge? 
              
              Apollo 16: Describing Domes 
              and Tunnels on the Moon
              Duke: We felt it under our feet. It's a soft spot. Firmer. Where we stand, I tell you one thing. If this place had air, it'd sure be beautiful. It's beautiful with or without air. The scenery up on top of Stone Mountain, you'd have to be there to see this to believe it - those domes are incredible! 
              Mission Control: O.K., could you take a look at that smokey area there and see what you can see on the face? 
              
              Duke: Beyond the domes, the structure goes almost into the ravine that I described and one goes to the top. In the northeast wall of the ravine you can't see the delineation. To the northeast there are tunnels, to the north they are dipping east to about 30 degrees. 
              
              Apollo 17
              Eugene Cernan, Ronald Evans, and Harrison Schmidt; Landed in the Taurus-Littrow Valley; Dec 7 - 19, 1972. 
              
              Check out the following weird conversation that took place: 
              
              Mission Control: Go ahead, Ron 
              
              Evans: O.K., Robert, I guess the big thing I want to report from the back side is that I took another look at the - the - cloverleaf in Aitken with the binocs. And that southern dome (garble) to the east. 
              
              Mission Control: We copy that, Ron. Is there any difference in the color of the dome and the Mare Aitken there? 
              
              Evans: Yes there is... That Condor, Condorsey, or Condorecet or whatever you want to call it there. Condorecet Hotel is the one that has got the diamond shaped fill down in the uh - floor. 
              
              Mission Control: Robert. Understand. Condorcet Hotel. 
              
              Evans: Condor. Condorset. Alpha. They've either caught a landslide on it or it's got a - and it doesn't look like (garble) in the other side of the wall in the northwest side. 
              
              Mission Control: O.K., we copy that Northwest wall of Condorcet A. 
              
              Evans: The area is oval or elliptical in shape. Of course, the ellipse is toward the top. 
              
               
              Again we have another example of code being used to disguise what has been found. For example, "Condorset Hotel". Why the codes, if there are no secrets being discussed. Why not explain to the American people openly what is going on? After all, they have paid for the mission. 
              Wilson says in his book (p. 139): "Although NASA has always held that the findings of lunar and space expeditions have never been held secret, it is interesting to note that Dr. Farouk El Baz, one of NASA's foremost scientists, does admit 'not every discovery has been announced'." 
                
                
              
              
              Another strange Apollo 16 
              "ground-to-air" conversation
              Capcom: What about the albedo change in the subsurface soil? Of course you saw it first at Flagg and were probably more excited about it there. Was there any difference in it there - and Buster and Alsep and LM? 
              
              Duke: No. Around the Alsep it was just in spots. At Plum it seemed to be everywhere. My predominant impression was that the white albedo was (garble) than the fine cover on top. 
              
              Capcom: O.K. Just a question for you, John. When you got halfway, or even thought it was halfway, we understand you looped around south, is that right? 
              
              Young: That is affirm. We came upon - Barbara. 
                
              
              Wilson writes (p.140): "Joseph H. Goodavage, whom included this conversation in a Saga magazine article, comments: "Barbara? That really needs some explanation, so I made an appointment with NASA geologist Farouk El Baz at National Aeronautics and Space Museum. Here's how part of our conversation went: 
              
              Saga: What do you suppose Young meant when he said they came upon "Barbara"? 
              
              El Baz:I can't really say. Code perhaps ... 
              
              Saga: But Barbara is an odd name for something on the Moon, isn't it? 
              
              El Baz: Yes, an enigma. As I suggested, perhaps a code, but I don't really know." 
              
              Apollo 17 conversation: 
              They find something startling, and are ordered to 
              immediately switch to code
              DMP (lunar module pilot): What are you learning? 
              Capcom: Hot spots on the Moon, Jack? 
              DMP: Where are your big anomalies? Can you summarize them quickly? 
              
              Capcom: Jack, we'll get that for you on the next pass. 
              
              CMP (command module pilot): Hey, I can see a bright spot down there on the landing site where they might have blown off some of that halo stuff. 
              
              Capcom: Roger. Interesting. Very - go to KILO. KILO. 
              
              CMP: Hey, it's gray now and the number one extends. 
              
              Capcom: Roger. We got it. And we copy that it's all on the way down there. Go to KILO. KILO on that. 
              
              CMP: Mode is going to HM. Recorder is off. Lose a little communication there, huh? Okay, there's bravo. Bravo, select OMNI. Hey, you know you'll never believe it. I'm right over the edge of Orientale. I just looked down and saw the light flash again. 
              
              Capcom: Roger. Understand. 
              
              CMP: Right at the end of the rille. 
              
              Capcom: Any chances of - ? 
              
              CMP: That's on the east of Orientale. 
              
              Capcom: You don't suppose it could be Vostok? (a Russian probe). 
              
              Wilson writes (p. 141): "The Vostok flights took place in the early sixties and were *strictly Earth orbiters*. They never reached the Moon!" 
              
               Apollo 16: Another strange conversation:
              Wilson writes (p. 141): "While on the Moon, did any of our astronauts see any indication of alien handiwork, such as strange constructions, disturbances or the like? Consider this strange Apollo 16 conversation:" 
                
              Orion:Orion has landed. I can't see how fat the (garble) ... this is a blocked field we're in from the south ray - tremendous difference in the albedo. I just get the feeling that these rocks may have come from somewhere else. Everywhere we saw the ground, which is about the whole sunlit side, you had the same delineation the Apollo 15 photography showed on Hadley, Delta and Radley Mountains ... 
              
              Capcom: O.K. Go ahead. 
              
              Orion: I'm looking out here at Stone Mountain and it's got - it looks like somebody has been out there plowing across the side of it. The beaches - the benches - look like one sort of terrace after another, right up the side. They sort of follow the contour of it right around. 
              
              Capcom: Any difference in the terraces? 
              
              Orion: No, Tony. Not that I could tell form here. These terraces could be raised but of (garble) or something like that ... 
              
              Casper: (Mattingly in lunar orbit overhead): Another strange sight over here. It looks - a flashing light - I think it's Annbell. Another crater here looks as though it's flooded except that this same material seems to run up on the outside. You can see a definite patch of this stuff that's run down inside. And that material lays or has been structured on top of it, but it lays on top of things that are outside and higher. It's a very strange operation. 
              
              Wilson writes (p.142): "And we might add that this is a very strange conversation. What are the real meanings of such terms used here as structure, blocked field, beaches, benches, terraces and the like? NASA claims that they are just metaphoric terms to describe unusual natural formations." 
              
               Strange Apollo 17 conversation about "Watermarks" on the Moon:
              Capcom: Roger, America, we're tracking you on the map here, watching it. 
              LMP: O.K. Al Buruni has got variations on its floor. Variations in the lights and its albedo. It almost looks like a pattern as if the water were flowing up on a beach. Not in great areas, but in small areas around the southern side, and the part that looks like the water-washing pattern is a much lighter albedo, although I cannot see any real source of it. The texture, however, looks the same. 
              
              Capcom: America, Houston. We'd like you to hold off switching to OMNI Charlie until we can cue you on that. 
              
              DMP: Wilco. 
              
              LMP: Was there any indication on the seismometers on the impact about the time I saw a bright flash on the surface? 
              
              Capcom: Stand by. We'll check on that, Jack. 
              
              LMP: A UFO perhaps, don't worry about it. I thought somebody was looking at it. It could have been one of the other flashes of light. 
              
              Capcom: Roger. We copies the time and ... 
              
              LMP: I have the place marked. 
              
              Capcom: Pass it on to the back room. 
              
              LMP: O.K. I've marked it on the map, too. 
              
              Capcom: Jack, just some words from the back room for you. There may have been an impact at the time you called, but the Moon is still ringing from the impact of the S-IVB impact. So it would mask any other impact. So they may be able to strip it out at another time, but right now they don't see anything at the time you called. 
              
              LMP: Just my luck. Just looking at the southern edge of Grimaldi, Bob, and - that Graben is pre-Mare. Pre-Mare! 
              
              Capcom: O.K., I copy on that, Jack. And as long as we're talking about Grimaldi we'd like to have you brief Ron exactly on the location of that flashing light you saw ... We'll probably ask him to take a picture of it. Maybe during one of his solo periods. Notice that the Capcom reiterates that it was a *flashing* light. It was therefore *no* meteor impact that they were witnessing. Notice also that the Lunar Command Pilot specifically mentions the word "UFO". 
              
              Wilson writes (p. 60): "This last conversation makes it obvious that both our astronauts and NASA do not take these sightings of light or UFOs lightly. Maps were marked and photographs were taken at the sites of these occurrences." 
              
              While the Apollo 17 astronauts were discussing the "Watermarks", the sighting of the UFO occurred. The conversation then returns to the Watermarks. 
              
              DMP: O.K. 96:03. Now we're getting some clear - looks like pretty clear high watermarks on this - 
              CMP: There's high watermarks all over the place there. 
              
              LMP: On the north part of Tranquillitatis. That's Maraldi there, isn't it? Are you sure we're 13 miles up? 
              
              Capcom: You're 14 to be exact, Ron. 
              
              LMP: I tell you there's some mare, ride or scarps that are very, very sinuous - just passing one. They not only cross the low planar areas but go right up the side of a crater in one place and a hill in another. It looks very much like a constructional ridge - a mare-like ridge that is clearly *as constructional as I would want to see it*." 
              
              Apollo 15 
              David Scott, Alfred Worden, James Irwin; went to the Appenine Mountains of the Moon, July 26 - Aug. 7, 1971. Conversation about discovering strange "tracks":
              Scott: Arrowhead really runs east to west. 
              
              Mission Control: Roger, we copy. 
              
              Irwin: Tracks here as we go down slope. 
              
              MC: Just follow the tracks, huh? 
              
              Irwin: Right we're (garble). We know that's a fairly good run. We're bearing 320, hitting range for 413 ... I can't get over those lineations, that layering on Mt. Hadley. 
              
              Scott: I can't either. That's really spectacular. 
              
              Irwin: They sure look beautiful. 
              
              Scott: Talk about organization! 
              
              Irwin: That's the most *organized structure I've ever seen*! 
              
              Scott: It's (garble) so uniform in width. 
              
              Irwin: Nothing we've seen before this has shown such uniform thickness from the top of the tracks to the bottom. 
              
              Wilson writes: (p. 145): "What are these tracks? Who made them? Where did they come from? Does NASA have an answer for the people?" 
              
              Another weird conversation about tracks 
              Made by Harrison Schmitt, a trained geologist and the only civilian ever to walk on the Moon (all the rest were military men, or as Hoagland would say - "good soldiers", who did what they were told).
              
              Schmidtt: I see tracks - running right up the wall of the crater. 
              
              Mission Control (Gene Cernan): Your photopath runs directly between Pierce and Pease. Pierce Brava, go to Bravo, Whiskey, Whiskey, Romeo. 
              
              Wilson writes (p. 145): "If this is not code, what is it? And why switch to the use of strange meaningless "code" words if NASA was not trying to cover up something startling, something that needed to be hidden from the public? In fact, science writer Joseph Goodavage maintains that "whenever something was discovered, the astronauts and CAPCOM apparently switched to a prearranged code, sometimes even on an alternate publicly unmonitorable channel. 
              NASA scientist Farouk El Baz admitted in a magazine interview that NASA did commit itself to a secretive search for various things on the Moon. 'We're looking for something - something ...' He admitted that 'a huge bridge-like structure in Mare Crisium has been reported ... That is all I can say about it.' When asked if 'that was a bridge - that you've actually found artificial structures or some kind of intelligently placed artifact?' El Baz quickly denied it. 
              
              'No. No. I am not admitting such a thing. But when you start to think about it, almost anything is possible. There are almost no limits [to] how you can interpret the many things astronomers have been observing and reporting for several centuries. Now the astronauts are seeing many anomalies close up'." 
              
              Apollo 15: 
              Astronaut sees white objects flying by
              Capcom: You talked about something mysterious ... 
              Orion: O.K., Gordy, when we pitched around, I'd like to tell you about something we saw around the LM (LEM or Lunar Excursion Module). When we were coming about 30 or 40 feet out, there were a lot of objects - white things - flying by. It looked as if they were being propelled or ejected, but I'm not convinced of that. 
              
              Capcom: We copy that Charlie. 
              
              Wilson writes (p. 54): "What could these mysterious flying objects have been? ... Can this be considered another UFO sighting? What did the astronaut mean when he reported that these peculiar 'white things' were *perhaps* 'being propelled or ejected'? And by whom?" 
              
              Apollo 11: 
              "I say that there were other spaceships!"
              
              Apollo 11, with Neil Armstrong, Michael Collins and Edwin Aldrin was the first Apollo flight to land on the Moon, on July 20, 1969. While Collins flew in orbit around the Moon in the command module, Armstrong and Aldrin descended in the lunar module, landing in the Sea of Tranquillity at 4:17 P.M. 
              
              According to hitherto un-confirmed reports, both Neil Armstrong and Edwin "Buzz" Aldrin saw UFOs shortly after that historic landing on the Moon in Apollo 11 on 21 July 1969. I remember hearing one of the astronauts refer to a "light" in or on a crater during the television transmission, followed by a request from mission control for further information. Nothing more was heard. 
              
              The following astonishing conversation was picked up by ham radio operators that had their own VHF receiving facilities that bypassed NASA's broadcasting outlets. At this time, the live television broadcast was interrupted for two minutes due to a supposed "overheated camera", but the transmission below was received loud and clear by hundreds of ham radio operators: 
              
              According to Otto Binder, who was a member of the NASA space team, when the two moon-walkers, Aldrin and Armstrong were making their rounds some distance from the LEM, Armstrong clutched Aldrin's arm excitedly and exclaimed: 
              
              Armstrong: What was it? What the hell was it? That's all I want to know!" 
              
              Mission Control: What's there?... malfunction (garble) ... Mission Control calling Apollo 11 ... 
              
              Apollo 11: These babies were huge, sir!... Enormous!... Oh, God! You wouldn't believe it! ... I'm telling you there are other space-craft out there ... lined up on the far side of the crater edge! ... They're on the Moon watching us! 
              
              Wilson writes (p. 48): "Binder ends his report with this observation: 'There has, understandably, been no confirmation of this incredible report by NASA or any authorities. WE cannot vouch for its authenticity, but if true, one can surmise that mission control went into a dither and then into a huddle, after which they sternly [ordered] the moonwalkers to 'forget' what they saw and carry on casually and calmly as if nothing had happened. After all, an estimated 600 million people around the world were hanging on every word spoken by the first two men to leave footprints on the Moon." 
              
              The book "Celestial Raise" by Richard Watson and ASSK [P.O. Box 35 Mt. Shasta CA. 96067 (916)-926-2316); 1987; page 147-148] records the following (continuation?) of the above remarkable dialogue of Apollo 11, which was picked up by hundreds of ham radio operators in the USA: 
              
              "During the transmission of the Moon landing of Armstrong and Aldrin, who journeyed to the Moon in an American spaceship, two minutes of silence occurred in which the image and sound were interrupted. NASA insisted that this problem was the result of one of the television cameras which had overheated, thus interfering with the reception. 
              
              This unexpected problem surprised even the most qualified of viewers who were unable to explain how in such a costly project, one of the most essential elements could break down... Some time after the historic Moon landing, Christopher Craft, director of the base in Houston, made some surprising comments when he left NASA. 
              
              The contents of these comments, which is included in the conversations [below], has been corroborated by hundreds of amateur radio operators who had connected their stations to the same frequency through which the astronauts transmitted. During the two minute interruption - which was not as it seemed, NASA, Armstrong and Aldrin with Cape Kennedy, censored both image and sound. 'I say that there were other spaceships.' 
              
              Here is reproduced completely the dialogue between the American astronauts and Control Center: 
              
              Armstrong &amp; Aldrin: Those are giant things. No, no, no - this is not an optical illusion. No one is going to believe this! 
              
              Houston (Christopher Craft): What ... what ... what? What the hell is happening? What's wrong with you? 
              
              Armstrong &amp; Aldrin: They're here under the surface. 
              
              Houston: What's there? (muffled noise) Emission interrupted; interference control calling 'Apollo 11'. 
              
              Armstrong &amp; Aldrin: We saw some visitors. They were here for a while, observing the instruments. 
              
              Houston: Repeat your last information! 
              
              Armstrong &amp; Aldrin: I say that there were other spaceships. They're lined up in the other side of the crater! 
              
              Houston: Repeat, repeat! 
              
              Armstrong &amp; Aldrin: Let us sound this orbita ... in 625 to 5 ... Automatic relay connected ... My hands are shaking so badly I can't do anything. Film it? God, if these damned cameras have picked up anything - what then? 
              
              Houston: Have you picked up anything? 
              
              Armstrong &amp; Aldrin: I didn't have any film at hand. Three shots of the saucers or whatever they were that were ruining the film 
              
              Houston: Control, control here. Are you on your way? What is the uproar with the UFOs over? 
              
              Armstrong &amp; Aldrin: They've landed here. There they are and they're watching us. 
              
              Houston: The mirrors, the mirrors - have you set them up? 
              
              Armstrong &amp; Aldrin: Yes, they're in the right place. But whoever made those spaceships surely can come tomorrow and remove them. Over and out. 
                
              
              A certain professor, who wished to remain anonymous, was engaged in a discussion with Neil Armstrong during a NASA symposium. 
                
              
              Professor: What REALLY happened out there with Apollo 11? 
              
              Armstrong: It was incredible, of course we had always known there was a possibility - the fact is, we were warned off! There was never any question then of a space station or a moon city. 
              
              Professor: How do you mean "warned off"? 
              
              Armstrong: I can't go into details, except to say that their ships were far superior to ours both in size and technology - Boy, were they big!...and menacing! No, there is no question of a space station. 
              
              Professor: But NASA had other missions after Apollo 11? 
              
              Armstrong: Naturally - NASA was committed at that time, and couldn't risk panic on Earth. But it really was a quick scoop and back again. 
              
              According to a Dr. Vladimir Azhazha: 
              "Neil Armstrong relayed the message to Mission Control that two large, mysterious objects were watching them after having landed near the Moon module (LEM). But this message was never heard by the public - because NASA censored it." 
              
              According to a Dr. Aleksandr Kasantsev, Buzz Aldrin took color movie film of the UFOs from inside the module, and continued filming them after he and Armstrong went outside. 
              
              Armstrong confirmed that the story was true but refused to go into further detail, beyond admitting that the CIA was behind the cover-up." 
              
              Cosmonaut Shadowed By Structured UFO
              In April of 1979, Cosmonaut Victor Afanasyev lifted off from Star City to dock with the Soviet Solyut 6 space station. But while en route, something strange happened. Cosmonaut Afanasyev saw an unidentified object turn toward his craft and begin tailing it through space. 
              "It followed us during half of our orbit. We observed it on the light side, and when we entered the shadow side, it disappeared completely. It was an engineering structure, made from some type of metal, approximately 40 meters long with inner hulls. The object was narrow here and wider here, and inside there were openings. Some places had projections like small wings. The object stayed very close to us. We photographed it, and our photos showed it to be 23 to 28 meters away." 
              
              In addition to photographing the UFO, Afanasyev continually reported back to Mission Control about the craft's size, its shape and position. When the cosmonaut returned to earth he was debriefed and told never to reveal what he knew, and had his cameras and film confiscated. 
              
              Those photos and his voice transmissions from space have never been released. 
              
              It is only now, with the collapse of the Soviet Union that Afanasyev feels that he can safely tell his story. 
              
              "It is still classified as a UFO because we have yet to identify the object." 
              
              During the late 60's and early 70's, NASA's Apollo Mission astronauts all experienced close encounters with 'unidentified space vehicles'. According to the first man on the Moon, Neil Armstrong, who took part in the Apollo 11 Mission, the reason why the US government changed their plans to build a 'Moon City' was because they were told to change those plans by unknown extraterrestrial voyagers...  'The fact is we were warned off' Armstrong told a NASA symposium. 'There was never any question then of a space station or Moon City.' 
              
              According to a former NASA employee Otto Binder, unnamed radio hams with their own VHF receiving facilities that bypassed NASA's broadcasting outlets picked up the following exchange: 
              
              'Buzz' Aldrin who was also with Armstrong on the Apollo 11 mission, was said to have taken colour film footage of alien craft, Armstrong later confirmed that this footage had indeed been shot by Aldrin, only to be confiscated by the CIA on their return to Earth.  Fearing for his wellbeing, Armstrong refused to go in further details, except to confirm that the CIA were behind an extensive cover-up campaign regarding the US space program and consequent encounters with UFOs. In 1979, former chief of NASA Communications, Maurice Chatelain, confirmed that Armstrong and Aldrin had encountered UFOs on the Moon. To this day Chatelain vehemently protests the truth of their accounts. 
              
              In December 1965, Gemini astronauts James Lovell and Frank Borman also saw a UFO during their second orbit of their record-breaking 14 day flight. Borman reported that he saw an unidentified spacecraft some distance from their capsule. Gemini Control, at Cape Kennedy told him that he was seeing the final stage of their own Titan booster rocket. Borman confirmed that he could see the booster rocket all right, but that he could also see something completely different. 
              
              During James Lovell's flight on Gemini 7
              Lovell:BOGEY AT 10 O'CLOCK HIGH.Cad 
              
              Capcom:This is Houston. Say again 7. 
              
              Lovell: SAID WE HAVE A BOGEY AT 
              10 O'CLOCK HIGH. 
              
              Capcom: Gemini 7, is that the booster or is that an actual sighting? 
              
              Lovell:WE HAVE SEVERAL...ACTUAL SIGHTINGS. 
              
              Capcom:   ...Estimated distance or size? 
              
              Lovell:   WE ALSO HAVE THE BOOSTER IN SIGHT... 
              
              'The encounter was common knowledge at NASA,' chatelain said. 'All Apollo and Gemini Flights were followed by space vehicles of extraterrestrail origin - or UFOs, if you prefer to call them that. Every time it occured, the astronauts informed Mission Control, who the ordered absolute silence'. He added 'I think Walter Schirra, aboard Mercury 8, was the first astronaut to use the code name 'Santa Claus' to indicate the presence of Ufos'.  But it was James Lovell, on board the Apollo 8 Command Module, who came out from behind the Moon and said, for everybody to hear 'Please be informed that there is a Santa Claus!' Even though this happened on Christmas Day, 1968, many people sensed a hidden meaning in those words.' 
              
              Chatelain also published an article in 1995 that confirmed that not only did the Apollo Moon Mission encounter UFOs, but that they also found 'several mysterious geometric structures of unnatural origin on the Moon'. 
              
              Another former astronaut, Dr Brian O'Leary, who was speaking at a science conference in 1994 confirmed the cover-up. 'For nearly fifty years, the secrecy apparatus within the United States government has kept from the public UFO and alien information, we have contact with alien cultures'. He went on to say 'the suppression of UFO and other extraterrestrial intelligence information for at least forty-seven years, is probably being orchestrated by an elite band of men in the CIA,NSA,NSS,DIA and their like. This small group appears able to keep these already hard-to-believe secrets very well'. 
              
              Statements from various NASA sources, including Maurice Chatelain reveal that all astronauts are briefed and debriefed, before and after every mission, and are warned not to discuss their encounters in public. Rumours of astronauts being 'threatened, 'going mad', or even 'losing their lives' on their return to Earth, abound. 
              According to Sgt Major Robert Dean, who carried the highest security clearance there is while serving at SHAPE (Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe) 
              in the 1960's, the US intelligence community is in possession of a top-secret dossier entitled The Assessment, detailing the history of extraterrestrial visitation, and an assessment of their purposes for visiting our planet. For the past twenty years Sgt Major Dean had fought to make this information public knowledge. 
              
              Former Nasa photographic technician, Donna Tietze said in an interview with a radio station in 1995 'The job of a co-worker in a restricted area was to airbrush out any anomalies found on the Moon photos'. The NASA Library is currently in possession of literally millions of photographs, plus an impressive catalogue of transmission tapes and videotapes documenting the presence of UFOs. The Clementine Probe alone sent back 1.6 million photographic images in 1994. 
                
                
              
              
               
              When President Dwight D. Eisenhower created NASA on October 1st, 1958, it was to 'coordinate national space activities' and to take 'full advantage of the military potential of space', and yet at the same time was to 'administer the civilian space program'. 
              NASA Astronaut Cooper denies seeing UFO in orbit - But Tells of His Dealings With Secret UFO Film
              Pioneering astronaut  L. Gordon Cooper denies being the first astronaut to see a UFO while in orbit, but stands by his reports of a strange encounter over Germany in the 1950s.Cooper flatly denied the long-standing claim, repeated over the years by various authors including UFOlogical saints J. Allen Hynek and Jacques Vallee, that he saw a greenish object with a red tail move past his Mercury 9 spacecraft in 1963. 
                
              
              "No, somebody made a lot of money selling lies on that one," Cooper, the sixth American in space, told Art Bell on the syndicated "Coast to Coast" talk radio show recently. "It was totally untrue, sorry to say." However, the retired air force colonel, who once lectured the United Nations on the reality of UFOs, still holds an "unshakable" belief in extraterrestrial intelligence, thanks largely to personal experience. 
              
              "On one occasion, I saw some strange vehicles that we assumed were UFOs," he told Bell. 
              
              In the encounter, which took place over Germany in the early 1950s, Cooper saw "flights of fighters flying by in the same sort of formation we flew, moving east to west." The U.S. Air Force base scrambled its own pilots, including Cooper, who remembers the objects as looking "just like saucers -- they were metallic looking, but we couldn't really get close enough to see more than that. You couldn't see any wings on them." 
              
              At the time, Cooper entertained the possibility that the craft might be a new Soviet design, but "looking back now," he suspects "it was some kind of extraterrestrial vehicle." 
              
              He also stood by his belief that he saw a UFO land at Edwards Air Force Base in California in 1957. Although Cooper had been filming the base with a camera crew at the time, the film, which he handed over to a high-ranking officer from Washington, has never emerged. 
              
              Area 51 and the lost Gemini photographs
              After another round of filming --- this time in orbit aboard Gemini 5 -- Cooper ran into trouble with the authorities when they confiscated film he took from space. However, in contrast to UFO legend, this film did not contain photographic proof of an alien encounter.Instead, he had ran afoul of the authorities for taking pictures of the "top secret" Nevada military base known familiarly as "Area 51". 
              "I found out fairly recently that one of the reasons it got confiscated was I had inadvertently â€¦ overflown Area 51," while taking test photos, he said. 
              
              Cooper had no comment on the Great Face on Mars."That's one of the reasons you need to send a manned mission to Mars, to study that stuff closer," he told Bell, gently criticizing today's NASA and recent presidential administrations for lacking the "bravery" to buildon previous generations' space advances. 
              
              UPDATE
              In recently published memoirs "Leap of Faith: An Astronaut's Journey into the Unknown", by USAF Colonel L. Gordon Cooper (Ret.) recounts how he chased UFOs over Germany in his F-86.  Following this experience, Cooper was very open minded about UFOs.  He writes, "I knew an Air Force master sergeant assigned to a team that received an emergency call-out from Washington D.C., to the Pacific southwest (not Roswell.)  He told me they reached a canyon and found a wreckage at the site.  According to his friend -- and I had been around him enough to consider him a reliable guy -- a metallic disk-shaped object had crashed, and sitting atop the wreckage were two very human-looking fellows in flight suits, waving at  them.  They were hustled away, and the sergeant never found out who they were or what happened to them."As a captain stationed at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., on May 3, 1957, he became aware that a metallic, saucer-shaped craft had landed (silently) sometime after   8:00 a.m. on base property.  He alleges that the event was filmed by a startled technical film crew on assignment 50 yards away, the craft zooming out of sight when the photographers tried to approach it for a better camera shot.  Cooper writes that, upon learning of the incident, he telephoned appropriate Pentagon officials, who ordered him to have all the film developed (but not printed) and to ship it immediately to the Pentagon. He adds that, before complying, he chose to peek at some of the negatives, which confirmed the existence of the "saucer" as described to him by the film crew.  Cooper notes that he heard nothing more about the film or the results of any investigation. 
              After reading the above information, I must ask you this...
              
              If NASA was formed as a  'civilian space agency', why were so many NASA programs funded by the US Defence Department? 
              
              Why were all astronauts subjected to US military security regulations? 
              
              Why were all video and photographic evidence screened by the National Security Agency? 
              
              Why were all the radio communications screened by the National Security Agency? 
              
              After spending millions of taxpayers' dollars planning a 'Moon City', why has the Moon not been visited by NASA since 1973? 
              
              Why are some of NASA's top photographic technicians employed to 'airbrush out' anomalies caught on film? 
              
              Why are astronauts and other NASA employees threatened with long jail sentences if they 'speak out' about what was really discovered out there in space? 
              
              Do you realise that no information, either photographic or otherwise, reaches the public domain until it has been thoroughly scrutinised and sanitized by the US intelligence community, and has been in effect since the space program began?. 
              
              Did you know that the main debates before the 'official' moon landings were regarding mining and mineral rights? Bearing in mind that the rich resources of titanium, aluminium, uranium, helium 3, and god knows what else, were found on the Moon.  Do you really think that the US would have then told the rest of the world to come on up and take a share?  Buzz Aldrin has said in his book, 'Men From Earth' 'Another exciting energy resource on the moon is... an ample supply of the isotope Helium-3 (HE-3), which is very rare on Earth but has been deposited on the lunar surface over billions of years by the solar wind.  It is estimated that at least a million tons of He-3 are readily recoverable from the regolith formations where lunar solar power stations would be practical. 
              
              This He-3 offers a key to safe, practical nuclear fusion energy on Earth. It is estimated that a single ton of He-3 delivered to Earth would be worth at least $1 Billion.' 
              
              Another issue is that one astronaut is seen to land 'heavily' after leaving the lunar module? How come when the Moon gravity is one sixth of the Earth's own gravitational pull? Even bearing in mind their heavy spacesuits which NASA claim weigh 185-190lbs, plus the astronauts weight, the total weight relative to Earth should have been 62 pounds or about four and a half stone. Again Buzz Aldrin says in his book that he weighed only 60 pounds, if this is the case they should have been able to jump at least six feet, but as official film footage shows, the astronauts struggle to jump over eighteen inches!  According to the laws of physics, this simply doesn't add up. 
              
              Did you know... 
              
              Official NASA footage clearly shows an Apollo module taking off from the lunar surface, evidently minus any conventional propulsion system?What you see is a series of 'bolts' clamping the module to the Moon's surface explode and the module simply floats up into space. Is this evidence of an antigravity propulsion in use by 1969? Or simply a computer-simulated take-off from Hollywood Studios?

              Kelly Cahill, a 27 -year-old housewife and mother of three children, is a pivotal figure in a remarkable episode which may have much to tell experiencers and researchers alike. She contacted me on October 4, 1993, seeking assistance in understanding a bizarre experience she underwent near the outer Melbourne suburban housing estate of Narre Warren North, in the foothills of the Dandenongs, Victoria, between Belgrave and Fountain Gate, during the early hours of August 8, 1993.
              
              
              Kelly told me that apart from her husband with her in their car, she was aware of another vehicle farther down the hill from their own position. That car contained at least two persons, a man and a woman. She paid little heed to them at the time because she and her husband had their attention riveted on a massive UFO which had landed in the field opposite them.
              
              Because Kelly lived in Victoria and I live in New South Wales, I passed details of Kelly's experience on to John Auchettl of Phenomena Research Australia (PRA) and urged Kelly to contact him. PRA got on the case immediately .
              
              By November 17 PRA had located the man and woman Kelly had seen that night. It turned out that the couple also had a friend (a woman) with them. These witnesses took Auchettl to the encounter site, to a spot consistent with Kelly's description. The group's drawings of the UFO and entities also closely coincide with Kelly' s.
              
              Here we have a striking situation. Two groups of persons unknown to each other have witnessed the same UFO encounter and entities. They also experienced missing time, and each group has been available to competent investigators. Independent witnesses have provided information which enable cross-checking and correlations to reveal a remarkable amount of similar information. The result is a compelling case for the reality of the strange events.described. The ontological status of the events is further strengthened by a range of apparently related physical traces, including ground traces, a magnetic anomaly, and effects on some of the witnesses.
              
              What is perhaps even more extraordinary about this case is that the second group described seeing yet another car parked farther back down from them. In it was (it appeared) one male who seemed to be gazing fixedly toward the encounter site. So we have the situation of three cars present: Kelly and her husband in one near the top of a hill, the three-person group (Bill, Jan, and Glenda) another 150 meters down the hill, and the other car, with one visible occupant, about 25 to 30 meters farther back.
              
              The first two cars were parked with their lights off. The other had its lights on. This circumstance may explain an apparent anomaly, in that Kelly was able to glance down and spot the second car, with what to her seemed only two persons (in fact three), but the group of three could not see Kelly, her husband, or their car. It was a dark and cloudy night. Evidently Kelly could see the second car only because it was backlit by the headlights of the third car.
              
              From the trio' s testimony, investigators could determine the location of this third car. The male was looking at the UFO's position through a break in the vegetation cover. The trio's evidence coupled with Kelly' s allowed for triangulation of the encounter site with the UFO. The location was consistent with the anomalies discovered (to be discussed later). Unfortunately, this potential additional witness has yet to be found.
              
              Typically witnesses to these sorts of events are known to each other, and such relationships often beg the question of whether the witnessed events have emerged from shared delusions or even collusion. Through Auchettl, Kelly became aware of the independent witnesses, but they knew nothing of her existence until quite recently. Kelly tried hard to persuade Auchettl to give her the other group' s names, but he refused because he wanted to maintain the integrity of the testimony. Only when the investigation was completed did the three learn what Kelly had been saying. So far they have not attempted to contact her. PRA has uncovered no evidence of a previous connection between the Cahills and the other group.
              
              After the encounter Kelly' s recollection faded from conscious memory, despite animated discussions about it with her husband in the immediate wake of the incident. Her husband remembered at least the UFO encounter but not the entities and has not acknowledged the missing time. It was her husband' s reference to the August 8 event at a barbecue on September 16 that led to Kelly's initial confused attempts to reconcile this troubling situation. Kelly found this temporary amnesia along, especially since she has vivid memories going all the way back to age two.
              
              Other events began to be seen in a different and bizarre perspective. These included a "dream" she had immediately after the encounter, upon getting home and going to sleep on August 8, and two "dreamings" in September. Each involved (apparently) the same entities as those encountered on the road. The latter two "dreamings" had a strange physical dimension. A further two "dreamings" followed, one on October 23 and the last during January 1994.
              
              Alarmed, Kelly sought help with little success from universities and aviation authorities. The latter gave her two UFO contact numbers, one in Victoria and mine in Sydney.
              
              After getting no satisfaction from the Victorian group, she contacted me, and after our preliminary discussion of her experience, the PRA investigation commenced.
              
              What follows is the transcript of an interview Kelly gave to my associate Robb Tilley on March 21 of this year.
              
              The details are consistent with those recounted to me on October 4, 1993, in numerous conversations with me since then, with the PRA investigation, and with a manuscript she is writing about her experience.
              
              THE INCIDENT
              
              My husband and I were driving to my girl friend's place up in the mountains. It was her daughter's . . . birthday.
              
              It was just after dark, and we were nearly there, about half an hour from her place. It takes us about an hour and a half from our place. It was just after 7.
              
              [The area has] little bits of field . . . and then you run right into a major shopping centre. . . .
              
              My husband drives really fast. . . . I'm just busy looking out the window . It's turned dark, and I look over towards this field as we are going past, and I see a ring of orange lights. It was the first time I ever thought I had seen something that wasn' t normal. . . . I was going to shut my mouth. I thought, "No, he' s just going to have a go at me." But a couple of minutes up the road I said, "I swear I saw a UFO." He said, "Don't be stupid! It was probably a helicopter." I said, "It wasn't making any noise. It was just sitting on the ground. Anyway, after a few jibes at me, he forgot all about it, and we arrived at [my girl friend's place].
              
              When we were there, my friends bring up this conversation, about what I thought I had seen. Her father says, "You think you've seen little green men or something, . Kelly?" and all this sort of stuff. It was turned into a joke, and I just totally forgot about it.
              
              We went out and played bingo. We came back. We had a bit of a problem about what time we left. As far as my husband's concerned, because we got home at 2:30 in the morning, it means we must have left at one o'clock.
              
              But that night I think we left at a quarter to 12. We got back from bingo at about 1 1, and we didn't stay for very long because [my friend's] daughter' s boy friend had just . . . split up with her and had gone home with the new girl friend . . . and she was really upset and crying, and we didn't want to stay. So we weren't there for that long at all.
              
              THE ENCOUNTER BEGINS
              
              Anyway, we were driving back down the road in the same stretch. Both of us,just me and my husband . . . we both saw this ring, mind you ... . in front of us, hovering above the road. It was just something sitting there. . . . I couldn't tell what it was. We were at first far away, but as you got closer to it was sort of . . . well, it wasn't like the orange light in the field. It was a round shape with some sort of glass around, or what looked like windows and lights around the bottom. Because it was dark, you couldn't really tell at first. But as we got closer and closer, there was no noise or anything.
              
              Even my husband's going. "You're right! That's something. That's very, very strange." And I swear we saw people in there, and then just as I said to him, "I swear there's people in there," it just shot off to the left as fast as it could go. I mean it just disappeared. Within a split second it had gone.
              
              We kept driving and about a kilometre ahead, all of a sudden, there's this really, really bright light in front of us, and I've got my hand up, up above my brow, to look out the window, because it's that bright, but I can't see anything.
              
              I said to [my husband], "What are you going to do?" He said, "l'm going to keep driving." From there, that is the last we remembered until . . . I knew I was going to see a UFO, you know, I just knew, because of what we had seen, I'd seen it twice in one night and he had seen it once . . . and the adrenalin is pumping, the heart is thumping, I'm so excited. All of a sudden I'm sitting in the car, and I'm saying to my husband, "What happened?" And he says to me, "I don't know. We must have gone around a corner or something." By the time we got home, he was definite of everything, but at that time he didn't know what happened either. I said to him, "I swear I've had a blackout," because adrenalin just doesn't disappear in a split second
              like that. I mean your heart is going mad! And all of a sudden. . . .
              
              One thing that really annoyed me was that I could smell vomit. I couldn't figure out where the smell of vomit was coming from.
              
              I argue about this half the way home until it started getting ridiculous, and I ended up just shutting up to stop all the fighting that was going to come out of it, you know, because we fight like cats and dogs. . . .
              
              As we were getting close to our home, about 20 minutes away from where we live (there was no one on the road), I saw a figure standing on the side of the road a tall dark figure. It was only for a couple of seconds, and I didn't relate it to anything until much later on at all. But it made me turn my head. I kept it in my mind, because it reminded me of a story I was told when I was a little girl about the headless horseman on the side of the road . . .because it was on the side of the road. It wasn't headless or anything,just this tall black figure. I saw it for only a couple of seconds, and then I couldn't see it anymore, but I thought I saw it.
              
              POST ENCOUNTER FALLOUT
              
              I get home. That night I actually had a dream about UFOs to top it all off, that something happened . . . but a whole lot of it went out of my head.
              
              Kelly and her husband argued about what happened for part of the way home. They agree they saw a UFO but cannot agree on the feeling Kelly had of experiencing a blackout or missing time and seeing people. They also could both smell vomit. Each experienced unexplained stomach pain. For Kelly it was like a pain from severe muscle fatigue which radiated from her lower abdomen to the upper shoulders.
              
              Later, after they got home, Kelly experienced menstrual bleeding and became quite ill. She had had her period only the week before. Eventually she entered the hospital with a womb infection. The doctors there said she must have been pregnant; either that, or she had had some kind of gynaecological operation. In fact, she had had neither in recent times. A strange triangular mark was also found on her abdomen along with a scar.
              
              Kelly elaborated on these matters: But when I got home that night, that's when I found the triangular mark below my navel, with what I thought was a little laparoscopy cut, and I also started bleeding that night. Three and a half weeks later I ended up in hospital... . . [The hospital] actually did a laparoscopy, another laparoscopy. This was not when I first went in. I went back in later, another six weeks after that, because I had a lot of pains in my stomach and just wanted to have it checked to see what it was. And I still had the triangular mark there. . . .
              
              They just did a blooming laparoscopy cut right next to it. [There was] no comment whatsoever. . . . I have a letter from a friend saying that she saw it.
              
              CONSCIOUS RECOLLECTIONS
              
              Kelly's recollections did not come from any hypnosis. Indeed she had only one session well after the main investigation had been completed. It failed to reveal anything of significance. Feeling that at best she had been only lightly under, she felt the session had been of little value.
              
              With regard to the August 8 encounter, she recalls crossing the road to the paddock, seeing at first one tall black being with glowing red eyes, then many. These latter seemed to be approaching rapidly, as if gliding. The large group of tall black beings apparently were split into two groups, one focused on Kelly and her husband, the other one on the other people who had also crossed farther down the road. The rest of her recollection is largely confusing and fragmented. She experienced voices and blindness.
              
              Kelly elaborated on how her memory came back: We went down to a girl friend's place a little bit later, a few weeks later, and the subject of UFOs came up, and her husband was saying, "Oh, I don't think they really exist." It was my husband that said, "If you had seen what Kelly and I saw, you might change your mind." I said, "What are you talking about?" You know, if I'd seen something, I'd have remembered it. I didn't even remember that I had seen it hovering in the middle of the road. It had been totally blanked out of my mind. And I search my head for days, because I knew he wouldn't say something if he didn't mean it. He was telling me, "Remember, on the way home from [your girl friend's], remember, it wasn't making any noise?" And I was just sitting there. I couldn't remember it.
              
              And a few days later, all of a sudden I remembered it! It hit me! And .. . . then I remembered going into the light, and then I couldn't remember anything else. A couple of weeks after that, this started to really bug me, because I remembered that light, and I remember arguing with him all the wayhome, but it was all I did remember.
              
              I went up to [my girl friend's] house again in October, this time for her other daughter's . . .birthday, and again we went to bingo. On the way home from bingo that night, we went along the same road, and as we passed a certain spot I just got this incredible feeling of terror go through me, I mean absolute terror. All of a sudden I just started remembering, and by the next morning I had remembered just about everything that happened, except there's still missing time that I can't.
              
              What we had actually done, we had driven . . . into the light, but the road curved, and the light we had thought was in front of us was actually to our right-hand side. It was in the field, and it was massive. . . . [Estimates put the possible diameter of the UFO at the "size of a house" or perhaps close to 5O meters.] So it was very big.Why I knew it was very big was because we could have driven for five minutes. The road sort of wound around this part.
              
              You could have driven for five minutes and not had it out of your sight the whole time.
              
              Kelly and her husband had a clear, uninterrupted view of a craft of enormous size. It was much larger than the UFO seen a few minutesearlier, and it was at ground level in the field at the bottom of a gully area.
              
              I asked him to stop the car, and we both got out. I remembered leaning back in, actually on the floor, to pick up my handbag, because I didn't go anywhere without my handbag. And that' s one of the sort of things that triggered off a lot of these memories doing that. The other thing was telling myself, "You are conscious. This is real! This is happening! This is real!". . . .
              
              For a while it was just absolutely terrifying, but you can't help it because it sounds really wacky. I mean this is not the way it's supposed to happen at all. . . .
              
              We crossed over the road. We jumped the gutter, and we walked up. . .I looked down the road, and there was another car-a light blue car-pulled up. Some people got out and went across the road. I only thought it was two, but it was actually three, but I didn' t pay much attention. They must have been at least a hundred meters down the road from us. When you've got something like that in front of you, and you' we got people down the road . . . well, I was more interested in what was in front of me than them, so I didn't get any detail. . . .
              
              I'm standing there, and we are looking at this thing [for about 3O seconds]. All of a sudden there is a black figure on the field. It's about seven foot tall. . . . I knew it was really tall at the time.
              
              For Kelly this was quite startling. She expected to see a human being, but this was not human. Kelly tried to use thought as a means of communication. She was immediately overwhelmed with fear. Its eyes seemed to turn to a red fire.
              
              At the distance of about 150 meters, they possessed an extraordinary luminosity .
              
              It started coming towards us, only slowly, and it had big red eyes. It sounds stupid, but it had great big round red eyes, like huge flies' eyes and they were red like, not like a reflection of red, but like burning red, like . . . fluorescent stop lights, I suppose, that sort of real burning red.
              
              All of a sudden I started screaming out [to my husbands. . . . Now this has really got me baffled because of the fact that a human being doesn't know this, so I don't even know how I came out with this, but I started saying, "They've got no souls." And then I started screaming, "THEY'VE GOT NO SOULS!" Then all of a sudden there were heaps of them in the field, not just one, a whole heap of them, and they started coming towards us . . . faster than a man could run, and they were gliding off the ground. They got halfway across the field.
              
              They split up. Some of them went towards the other people [two or three, Kelly thought]. and some of them [the rest] came towards us. Kelly found herself screaming to the other people down the road, "They're evil! They're going to kill us!"
              
              The next thing I know, I felt this oomph! in my stomach, right across here like I was winded, but I was thrown right back, and I was on my back on the ground. I sat up, with my head between my knees. Here, I'm trying to stay conscious. I couldn't see. My eyes. . . . It was all black.
              
              .. . . I'm screaming out to [my husband]. . . .
              
              Kelly speculated that her "winding" may have been caused by an electric fence present at the site. That may or may not be true. The fence may not even have been on at the time. Even if it was, the power may not have been strong enough to generate the effect she described. Nonetheless this possibly prosaic incident led her into confusion over whether the forces she was confronting were "good" or "evil."
              
              But the next thing I heard him saying, "Let go of me." His voice was all sort of cracked up with fear, and I'd never heard that from my husband. He's not frightened or afraid of anything. . . .
              
              Then this male voice said, "We [don't] mean you any harm." And then he said, "Why did you hit Kelly then?" That's the last I heard of [my husband]. No one else talked except me. I heard the male voice. Then I heard myself saying, "Oh, God, I'm going to be sick." I've got my head between my knees, and I just felt, like, violently nauseous. Then I must have blacked out for a little while.
              
              I don't remember being sick. Then I remember hearing talk about being a peaceful people, and I started screaming out, I said, "Don't believe them! They're going to steal your souls!" I know it sounds so ridiculous now, but at the time I was hysterically terrified. . . . I had never felt terror like that. Not even in my worst nightmares had I experienced terror like that. . . .
              
              Oh, there's one thing I remember that he said: "I wouldn't harm her. She's my daughter." Now when I first saw the-on the way up to [my girl friend's] in the field, the first thing I did was pray. And I took it as sarcasm straight away. And it sounded like sarcasm. . . .
              
              It sounded like there was even a small laugh after that. I don't know-it just wasn't good to me.
              
              For Kelly, a strong faith in God often involved an ability to get answers to many of life's situations, albeit sometimes in the most subtle and unlikely ways. For her the brief observation of a possible UFO on the way to her girl friend's place on August 7 was perhaps a glimpse of one of life's mysteries, perhaps even a lesson from God. So she made a silent prayer which began with "Father." She thought for a moment, "Wait for me. I'll be back down this way in a few hours." To put this in context, it should be pointed out that Kelly had long been on a spiritual quest, anchored in a religious journey and a desire to understand the great mysteries.
              
              Though she had little time for organized religions, she had a deep interest in the great religious works and had studied them, particularly the Bible, in great detail. Therefore, given her brief prayer for clarification of the nature of the UFO event on the way up to her friend, as well as the use of the word Father, she got a sense of "mockery" when she heard the voice saying, "She is my daughter."
              
              Anyway, I started screaming and going on about demons trying to steal people's souls. . . . I like not to admit that it came from my mouth, but it did. . . . But I'm going to tell it the way it is.
              
              Next thing I hear him saying, "Would somebody do something about .her?" And I felt a hand . . . touch my shoulder. It wasn't hard. It was quite gentle.That's when I absolutely cracked! I'm still sitting on the ground, and I couldn't see a thing, but I made sure that my eyes were just fierce. . . . Something snapped in me. Before that I was crying. All of a sudden something snapped in me, and I got so angry . Then I started screaming out, "How dare you do this to these innocent people?" Like it was my fault. Because I was on a big spiritual search, and I really got the impression that it was my fault. And I thought, why involve other people?. . . I felt like, almost like there was a fight for me. Like it was something I had to do. . . .
              
              Anyway, I started screaming out stupid things, told them to go back where they came from. Next thing I remember I was sitting in the car. I've still got missing time.
              
              When she found herself sitting in the car, her last memory was of driving into the light.
              
              THE DREAM OF AUGUST 8, 1993
              
              Once she was home and asleep, the night brought a bizarre dream. This dream is of interest in that it emerged within hours of the encounter and it places Kelly back in the encounter. The subsequent "dreamings" do not have this quality about them. Nonetheless they were unusual in their own way, for reasons that will shortly be apparent.
              
              In the August 8 dream she is on the side of the road with her head between her knees. She becomes aware that she can see again. A being is leading her husband down the slope onto the field. Throughout the dream she is unable to see the beings above the level of their elbows. Their limbs seem long and thin.
              
              Inexplicably convinced that the being with her husband is female, she tackles it and then blacks out. In the dream she once again regains consciousness to find herself on the extreme right of the field with the UFO further down the field to the left. Before her on the ground is a still body, at first nonhuman, then changing to human. A middle-aged woman standing further down the field is screaming at her, "Murderess! Murderess!" She is overcome with grief with no awareness of having killed anyone.
              
              Still in the dream, a hand on her shoulder leads her, and she follows obediently. Eventually Kelly becomes aware that she is in a small room, with only a small table and a being standing before her. The being tells her she did not kill anyone and they had to use her sense of morality to overcome her fear. Kelly has a profound feeling that she knows this being. On a table behind the being is a Bible, one of hers, which had disappeared a few weeks before. The being gives Kelly a strange choice which deepens her suspicion of the beings' motives. She is told she can come but must leave the Bible behind. In the dream the being gives her this Bible.
              
              The dream ends at that point. A few days after the encounter, her husband found the Bible in the car.
              
              The "dreamings" mentioned earlier, first interpreted as something like a ghostly episode, take on a bizarre perspective when Kelly's recollections flooded back. The first two preceded the point when more complete recall of the events of August 8 returned.
              
              THE "DREAMINGS"
              
              The first started with a presence which warns her to be calm. Then a frightening "sucking" sensation begins as if something is being taken from her. She comes out of the dream terrified and is confronted by a tall black figure in a floor length hooded cloak, about seven feet tall, with glowing red eyes. She screams, and the being disappears.
              
              Initially Kelly interpreted the being as like a "soul vampire" or the Grim Reaper. At the time she did not place this incident in a UFO context, since the memories had yet to resurface.
              
              In the second "dreaming" she experiences her legs being lifted and drawn out of the bed. She wakes and once again finds the same or similar being present, but this time the cloak obscures the eyes.
              
              When after I did remember it, I had another dream, and these dreams seemed very physical. I know I'm dreaming, and I've got to wake up out of them. . . .
              
              In this particular one, I felt as if my legs were being pulled off the bed, and it was like I was paralysed from my waist down, and my legs were being pulled over to the side; yet I could almost use the top of my body. Then I'm grabbing a pillow, trying to hit my husband, to wake him up. . . . I'm fighting this. I'm not going to let this thing drag me off the bed by my legs. Then I woke up and saw it standing there again! This time the hood covered the eyes, and it didn't scare me. . . . I was still terrified, but it didn't scare me quite as much, because each time it scared me, it was that same power like I felt out in the field that night.
              
              When I was sitting on the ground, it was like something, almost like a frequency or a sound vibration or something. And it's getting right into my head! And I couldn't get it together. Like I was trying to get my logical thoughts together, not logical, almost conscious thoughts, and I was fighting it the whole time, which is probably why I seemed to remember more than my husband or even the other people.
              
              The third "dreaming" occurred at a friend' s place on October23 (see front cover). By then Kelly had experienced the flood of recollections. The two earlier "dreamings" took on an added significance, especially given the presence of the beings after Kelly had awakened from her "dreamings." This time she wakes from a "dreaming" which seems to take the form of a "peak experience" (as psychologist Abraham Maslow calls it; Richard Maurice Bucke defined it as the sense of"cosmic consciousness"). She sees apparently the same creature as before; but unlike earlier manifestations, it is naked and leaning over her as if about to kiss her navel area. It is tall, with a head much larger than normal, long and thin arms, with an abdomen out of proportion to its thin frame, like a child's stomach suffering from malnutrition.
              
              Its skin is like gray-black plasticine. Kelly's screams turn into an "uninterrupted stream of hysteria" and words.
              
              In the morning she insisted that her husband check under the car. She had heard a distinct voice during the night urging such a check. He ignored her request, but their car subsequently suffered such a problem.
              
              Numerous other "psychic" events and "electrical disturbances" followed. Frequently their car started up when no one was inside it. The vehicle had a kill switch which rendered these events even more startling and curious. Kelly thought she had developed enhanced psychic powers. The electrical events apparently ended in January 1994, as did many of the psychic incidents.
              
              The fourth "dreaming" occurred in January of this year.
              
              In the dream the bathroom light is blown. There is a sense of presence. Something persistently tries to grab Kelly's right hand. Eventually she lets her hand be taken. Immediately she wakes up. Once again the creature in the black robe is standing by her bedside. It goes away. It turned out that the light had indeed blown and that diamond and sapphire rings .she wore on her right hand had disappeared. To date they have not
              been found.
              
              OTHER MATTERS
              
              Other, earlier episodes, experiences, and issues of possible significance: . From July through September 1993 small orange fireballs, about the size of tennis balls, frequently hit the windows of the house. Kelly, her husband, and her mother witnessed the phenomena.
              
              o About two and a half years earlier, at Lalor, Kelly had a peculiar dream in which she moved through a flesh-like hourglass apparatus. The same night she experienced a "vision" of opening their back door and seeing a light for a few seconds. Then she blacked out. Kelly experienced the same sense of power she felt in the field in August
              1993.
              
              o After the encounter and until July 1994, the Cahill house (built in 1949) had been the scene of fleeting observations of tall "shadows," seen by both Kelly and her husband.
              
              o A bad smell occasionally permeated the house and seemed to move around.
              
              THE OTHER WITNESSES
              
              If the August 8 encounter had revolved only around Kelly, it could be argued that the experience may have been some sort of psychological episode. But the presence of other witnesses - a married couple and their friend, plus a possible other observer in a third car-forcefully argues for a real encounter. Indeed, the PRA contends that the focus of the incident was not Kelly but the two other women.
              
              As in Kelly' s situation, the females in the other group seemed to play a dominant role. Bill, the male witness in the trio, appears, like Kelly's husband, to have had only limited involvement. The two women consciously recalled onboard episodes. They remembered the UFO and the tall black beings. Their description did not feature the red eyes Kelly saw.
              
              For the trio the experience apparently started when they approached the site. All three could hear a strange noise and suddenly felt ill. Bill thought he was going to faint. He lost control of the car and ran off the road, striking a pole. After checking for damage, they drove off. A few minutes later a speeding car with its high beams on shot past them. Then another passed. They came to a bridge with a sharp turn following it almost immediately. Farther along this section the trio stopped. As all this was going on, Bill's vision was impaired. Obviously he had Some type of vision as he was driving, but he was unable to remember seeing the UFO. The two women with him recall the UFO clearly, and their descriptions closely match Kelly's.
              
              In some unexplained manner Bill was isolated from the central experience. He has conscious recall of smells and sounds and remembers that a lot of activity was going on. He does not recall seeing anything. He subsequently underwent hypnosis, which expanded his apparent recollections to seeming onboard components, but once again these were through the senses of smell and hearing only.
              
              The two women did not think of theirs as an "abduction" experience. They felt as if they had exercised free will all through it. Yet the principal element of their onboard experience was a form of examination-not, however, visually remembered. Other parts of their onboard experience exist in visual images and conscious memory. Hypnosis in their cases appears to have only reinforced what they recall already.
              
              The entities did not speak and provided very little information. Neither woman saw the other or any of the others while in the alien environment presumably aboard the UFO. Curiously, each was still aware of what was happening to her companion, ostensibly through psychic means.
              
              The trio apparently did not have the complex background experiences described by Kelly. Their experience seem limited only to the August 8 encounter.
              
              There is also some physical evidence. PRA found a possible related ground trace and low-level magnetic anomaly at the encounter site.
              
              COMMENT
              
              Kelly has gone on to write her own account of the experience and its difficult aftermath. In October 1994 John Auchettl and PRA, whose investigative thoroughness is to be commended, released a comprehensive report on the affair. In this emotionally explosive area it is easy for people to get caught up in less than satisfactory situations while they attempt to understand extraordinary experiences. I hope this event and the documentation that flows from it will be of some help to others in similar situations.
              
              The victims of these experiences must not be unrealistically encouraged by advocates of an alien presence; nor, at the other extreme, should they be ridiculed by the sceptical among us. They should be helped to deal with their experiences, whether those experiences turn out to be prosaic or profound in origin. The second part of this report will review the PRA report and examine in detail the accounts of the other group of witnesses. It will also consider the physical evidence and provide reflections on the nature and meaning of this event.
              
              Update (12/6/02) The Cahill case, PRA &amp; openness:
              
              It should be noted that the above "comment" in the 1994 IUR report was prepared on the assumption that the "PRA comprehensive report on the affair" was about to be released. Despite nearly a decade passing, John Auchettl and PRA have not released their report other than a few fragments of information. 
              
              As the researcher responsible for passing Kelly Cahill onto PRA in the first place, principally because I am NSW based and the incident occurred in Victoria, I have to say now that that decision was, in hindsight, a mistake. 
              
              My comment in my 1994 IUR report: "John Auchettl and PRA, whose investigative thoroughness is to be commended", was based entirely on conversations with Auchettl and discussions with Kelly Cahill at the time (1993-1994), and in retrospect should have been qualified more accurately. While Auchettl &amp; PRA may well have been thorough in their investigation, in reality there has been no way to absolutely verify this, because of their unwillingness to release their report and data on the case. PRA have offered some seemingly unusual and convoluted explanations for this lack of sharing.
              
              I have long encouraged openness and sharing in UFO research (my web site is in part an expression of my position on this matter). My attempts to encourage PRA in this direction, from my perspective, have been very disappointing, and have instead lead me to not to refer cases to John Auchettl and PRA. Unless PRA changes their apparent lack of transparency and openness, researchers and witnesses should carefully consider the wisdom of cooperating with Phenomena Research Australia (PRA).
