              <p><strong>MDA, MTI, MOE &amp; Mindef found to have lapses in audit books</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Four government agencies have been singled out for 
              lapses in the way they've managed their finances. </span></p>
              <p><span>The latest Public Accounts Committee report issued on Wednesday 
              attributed three main factors to the significant number of audit 
              findings.
              <br> <br> They are laxity in procurement and contract management, lack of rigour 
              in scrutiny by approving authorities and too light a touch in 
              ministry-statutory board dealings.
              <br> <br> The Media Development Authority (MDA) was found to have the most number 
              of lapses, which the committee said taken together, "reflect poorly on 
              the overall internal controls of the MDA".
              <br> <br> They include undue delay in refunding S$6.06 million in Radio and TV 
              (RTV) license fees.
              <br> <br> The committee noted that as of 31 March 2008, MDA had accumulated the 
              overpaid or unused balance of RTV license fees.
              <br> <br> At the time of the audit in November 2008, MDA was still processing 
              refunds which had arose way back in 2005.
              <br> <br> In response, the Information, Communications and the Arts Ministry said 
              since October 2009, two automated processes have been put in place to 
              increase the efficiency of refunds.
              <br> <br> MDA has since completed making the refunds.
              <br> <br> MDA was also found to have paid more than necessary for out-sourcing of 
              enforcement functions.
              <br> <br> The agency had entered into a two-year contract valued at S$933,312 to 
              outsource some of its enforcement functions.
              <br> <br> But before the start of the contract, it was discovered that some of the
               functions could not be outsourced due to legal reasons.
              <br> <br> The Committee said MDA did not seek a reduction in the contract price 
              for the reduced scope of work.
              <br> <br> Other lapses include shortcomings in the management of Public Service 
              Broadcast programmes and not having a system for monitoring and 
              enforcing compliance with broadcasting licence conditions. 
              <br> <br> In view of the number of lapses noted, the committee recommends that the
               Auditor-General's Office (AGO) consider reviewing MDA's governance and 
              controls in two to three yearsâ€™ time, instead of the usual once in seven
               years.
              <br> <br> Among the other agencies taken to task, the Education Ministry was 
              rapped for paying more than necessary on school cleaning contracts while
               the Defence Ministry was found to have carried out wrongful 
              certification for a consultancy project, resulting in advance payment of
               $289,499 to the Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA). </span></p>

              <p><strong>Call for more audits</strong></p>
              <p>ABOUT 10 months after the Media Development Authority (MDA) was 
              criticised for being tardy, it refunded to radio and TV owners all the 
              excess licence fees it had collected from them.</p>
              <p>The amount was more than $6million.</p>
              <p>Similarly, the Education Ministry, which was chided for unfairly 
              rejecting some lower bids for school cleaning contracts, has introduced 
              guidelines on how civil servants are to evaluate tenders.</p>
              <p>These improvements were noted by a parliamentary committee 
              that tracks what government ministries and statutory boards have done to
               correct irregularities in the use of public funds identified by the 
              Auditor-General (A-G) in his 2008/09 report last July.</p>
              <p>But more can be done, said the watchdog Public Accounts 
              Committee (PAC), made up of eight MPs, in its annual report yesterday.</p>
              <p>It wants the A-G to audit more often those showing many 
              lapses, recommending that he pore over their financial accounts at least
               once in two to three years, instead of the usual once every seven 
              years.</p>
