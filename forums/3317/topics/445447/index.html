              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Singaporeans today are more accepting of people with 
              disabilities as part of the community, workplace and everyday life.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>This is according to
               findings by the Society for the Physically Disabled (SPD) which 
              conducted a nationwide survey to gather the public's perception towards 
              people with disabilities.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The study, which 
              mirrors an earlier one conducted in 2009, is part of the Society's 
              on-going 'I Accept' campaign which aims to encourage the public to 
              accept people with disabilities as equal members of society.<br><br>A total of 904 respondents, aged between 15 and 65 took part in the initiative.<br><br>It consisted of both street and online surveys conducted from end-November till end-December last year.<br><br>The
               findings revealed that there is a considerable improvement in the 
              public's perceived barriers in communicating with people with 
              disabilities.<br><br>25.3 per cent of the respondents say they think it 
              is harder to communicate and deal with people with disabilities than 
              non-disabled people, compared to 43 per cent in 2009.<br><br>There is 
              also a significant decrease in the number of people who feel people with
               disabilities are dependent on others - from 47 per cent in 2009 to 13.4
               per cent in the 2011 polls.<br><br>53.1 per cent of those surveyed felt
               people with disabilities should be accompanied by a non-disabled person
               when going out to public places. <br><br>This is a slight fall from the 66 per cent polled in 2009.<br><br>Ninety-three per cent agreed that more can be done to help people with disabilities on public transportation in Singapore.<br><br>Ninety-six
               per cent also expressed the need for more members of the public to give
               way to people with disabilities while entering lifts and boarding 
              trains.<br><br>Nearly 80 per cent of 61 respondents who are in a position to hire are open to employing people with physical disabilities.<br><br>SPD's
               president Ms Chia Yong Yong, said: "Besides generating awareness and 
              greater acceptance of people with disabilities in major areas such as 
              employment and education, we hope to also cultivate graciousness in the 
              public's everyday encounters with people with disabilities such as 
              showing a little more patience, giving way and lending a helping hand.<br><br>"It
               is heartening to see improvements in the level of receptiveness towards
               people with disabilities amongst Singaporeans, and we do hope to see 
              this trend continue, and to see more people with disabilities integrated
               and included in our mainstream society."<br><br>- CNA/fa</span></span></p>
