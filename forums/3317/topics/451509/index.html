              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Some six years after a Singapore education company 
              had its branches in Vietnam shut down, another has suffered a similar 
              fate. </span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>According to media 
              reports in Vietnam, Raffles Education Corporation - which is listed on 
              the Singapore Exchange - had its licence revoked last month by 
              authorities in Ho Chi Minh City after it had been found enrolling 
              students for unauthorised courses. </span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>In December last 
              year, Raffles International Training Centre (RITC) Vietnam - a design 
              institute run by RafflesEducationCorp - was one of three private 
              colleges penalised by the Vietnamese Ministry of Education and Training 
              for allegedly offering illegal joint training programmes with foreign 
              colleges.<br><br>RITC was accused of cooperating with the Raffles 
              College of Higher Education in Singapore without the necessary licence. 
              The three private colleges were reportedly fined 220 million Vietnamese 
              dong (S$13,100) and ordered to suspend advertising, admission and 
              training activities leading to the award of diplomas and degrees from 
              overseas. <br><br>Responding to Today's queries, RafflesEducationCorp 
              confirmed the revocation of its licence. A spokesperson said: "The onset
               of regulatory tightening in Vietnam is beyond the group's control."<br><br>She
               said the group's priority is to "fulfil our obligations to Raffles 
              students and so, we have accordingly processed the permanent transfer of
               more than 400 students from Vietnam to other Raffles Education 
              Corporation colleges in Singapore, Sydney and Phnom Penh". <br><br>The 
              spokesperson added: "We have offered to bear student airfares and 
              contribute partially to their living expenses in these cities. Our focus
               is on the welfare of our students, first and foremost, and to minimise 
              any disruption to their continual learning process. Students who have 
              chosen to discontinue their studies with us have been given refunds for 
              tuition fees paid." <br><br>RafflesEducationCorp has so far refunded a total of S$5.6 million, according to the spokesperson. <br><br>The
               Thanh Nien Daily also reported that there was an order barring RITC 
              director-general Edmund Hwong from leaving Vietnam. But the 
              RafflesEducationCorp spokesperson refuted this. <br><br>The 
              RafflesEducationCorp had previously clarified its position on the 
              controversy. According to the group, there were no clear regulations in 
              Vietnam "governing credit transfer processes leading to the award of 
              diplomas and degrees from overseas".<br><br>Following the authorities' decision in December, RITC "fully paid the stipulated violation fine". <br><br>Both
               its centres in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh also complied with the suspension 
              order. Subsequently, it appealed against the fine and suspension, as 
              well as sought dialogue with the authorities. But all discussions 
              "yielded unworkable options".<br><br>In 2006, Today broke the news that 
              the Singapore International Training Consultancy (SITC) closed its 
              branches in Vietnam after it had run into financial difficulty.<br><br>It
               left thousands of students in the lurch and the teachers' salaries were
               unpaid. The SITC was funded largely by Singaporean investors but its 
              operations were headed by a Taiwanese, who had an international arrest 
              warrant issued against him.<br><br>- </span><span class="path">TODAY</span></span></p>
