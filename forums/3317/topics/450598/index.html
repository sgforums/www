              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>It said Pyongyang's "failed" missile launch was a provocative act that breached past agreements and harmed Asian security.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>"North Korea is only
               further isolating itself by engaging in provocative acts, and is 
              wasting its money on weapons and propaganda displays while the North 
              Korean people go hungry," White House spokesman Jay Carney said.<br><br>The
               White House statement also said the US is prepared to engage with North
               Korea but the North must adhere to its international obligations, 
              adding that the US remains vigilant to the North Korean provocations and
               is committed to the security of its allies.<br><br>"While this action 
              is not surprising given North Korea's pattern of aggressive behavior, 
              any missile activity by North Korea is of concern to the international 
              community. <br><br>The United States remains vigilant in the face of 
              North Korean provocations, and is fully committed to the security (of) 
              our allies in the region" spokesman Jay Carney said in a statement.<br><br>According to the US, the North had fired a ballistic Taepodong-2 missile.<br><br>The
               North American Aerospace Command (NORAD) and the US military's Northern
               Command "detected and tracked a launch of the North Korean Taepodong-2 
              missile," NORAD said in a statement, adding that "at no time were the 
              missile or the resultant debris a threat."<br><br>The US military said 
              the missile disintegrated shortly after lift-off and that the missile 
              never posed a threat, with no debris falling on land.<br><br>According 
              to Japan and South Korea which had been tracking the rocket since its 
              early-morning launch, the debris of the rocket fell into the sea.<br><br>-AFP/sf</span></span></p>

              <h1>Romney denounces N. Korea launch, blames Obama</h1>
              <p>WASHINGTON (AFP) - United States (US) Republican presidential hopeful
               Mitt Romney on Thursday denounced the launch by North Korea of a 
              long-range rocket and said it underscored the weakness of President 
              Barack Obama.</p>
              <p>'I condemn in the strongest possible terms the attempted North Korean
               missile launch,' Mr Romney said in a statement after news of the 
              launch, which Washington, Seoul and Tokyo said appeared to have failed.</p>
              <p>'Although the missile test failed, Pyongyang's action
               is another blatant violation of unanimous United Nations Security 
              Council resolutions and demonstrates once again that Pyongyang is 
              committed to developing long-range missiles with the potential of 
              carrying nuclear weapons.'</p>
              <p>Mr Romney said the weapons programme 'poses
               a clear and growing threat to the United States, one for which 
              President Obama has no effective response.'</p>

              <h1>N. Korea says satellite 'failed to enter orbit'</h1>
              <p>SEOUL, South Korea (AFP) - North Korea said Friday its satellite had 
              failed to enter its preset orbit, as the launch sparked international 
              condemnation.</p>
              <p>'The earth observation satellite failed to enter its preset orbit.</p>
              <p>Scientists, technicians and experts are now looking 
              into the cause of the failure,' the North's official news agency said 
              without elaborating.</p>
              <p>The North's admission of failure marked a 
              departure from its past. It has insisted that two previous attempts in 
              1998 and 2009 to put satellites into orbit succeeded even though both 
              clearly failed.</p>

              <h1>N. Korea admits failure as world raps rocket launch</h1>
              <p>PYONGYANG (AFP) - North Korea admitted on Friday its heralded 
              long-range rocket launch had failed, disintegrating mid-air and plunging
               into the sea soon after take-off in a major embarrassment for the 
              reclusive state.</p>
              <p>Defying international warnings, the North 
              went ahead with what it termed a launch to put a peaceful satellite into
               orbit, drawing condemnation from world leaders who said the 
              'provocative' act threatened regional security.</p>
              <p>Some four hours after the rocket reportedly exploded 
              over the Yellow Sea, it admitted the satellite had failed to enter 
              orbit, adding 'scientists, technicians and experts are now looking into 
              the cause of the failure'.</p>
              <p>The United States (US) and its allies, who 
              condemned the exercise as a disguised ballistic missile test banned by 
              United Nations (UN) resolutions, reacted strongly.</p>

              <p><strong>After rocket fiasco, N. Korea may test bomb: analysts</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>HONG KONG: The humiliating failure of North Korea's 
              much-publicised rocket launch may push the hermit state into testing a 
              nuclear bomb in an attempt to save face, analysts said Friday.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Touted as a glorious
               demonstration of North Korean technology to mark the centenary of the 
              birth of founding leader Kim Il-Sung, the rocket instead turned into a 
              damp squib when it crashed into the sea.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The 30-metre 
              (100-foot) Unha-3 (Galaxy-3) rocket blasted off early Friday morning 
              from a newly built space centre on the country's northwestern coast.<br><br>But
               shortly after launch it broke apart and the debris fell into the Yellow
               Sea off South Korea, the South's Yonhap news agency quoted a 
              high-ranking military source as saying.<br><br>"North Korea executed its
               highly anticipated missile launch and with its failure managed to 
              achieve the second-worst outcome imaginable. The worst would have been 
              hitting China," Marcus Noland of the Washington-based Peterson Institute
               for International Economics wrote in a blog post.<br><br>"The North 
              Koreans have managed in a single stroke to not only defy the UN Security
               Council, the United States, and even their patron China, but also 
              demonstrate ineptitude."<br><br>North Korea invited up to 200 foreign 
              journalists to Pyongyang for the launch and the centenary commemorations
               on the weekend, the largest number of overseas media ever welcomed in 
              to the reclusive state.<br><br>The "humiliation" of the rocket failure, 
              Noland said, might force new leader Kim Jong-Un -- who took over after 
              his father, Kim Jong-Il, died in December -- to conduct a nuclear weapon
               test to restore the country's honour.<br><br>"It would be easy to 
              gloat, but paradoxically, the missile failure may have actually 
              increased the danger the world faces," he wrote.<br><br>"Before the launch, it was probable that North Korea would conduct a third nuclear test; now it is a virtual certainty."<br><br>Analysts
               say satellite imagery showing what looks like preparations, and the 
              communist regime's previous patterns of behaviour -- with missile tests 
              followed by bomb tests -- suggest a third nuclear test could be 
              imminent.<br><br>"Now, after this fiasco, it seems likely that such a test will move forward at the earliest moment," Noland wrote.<br><br>Rory
               Medcalf, international security programme director at the Lowy 
              Institute think-tank in Australia, said the regime's plans to test a 
              uranium-fuelled nuclear device could be pushed forward.<br><br>"I will 
              not say definitively that we are going to see a nuclear test or some 
              other provocation but I think the chances are higher today than they 
              were yesterday," he told AFP.<br><br>North Korea has said the rocket 
              launch was a peaceful attempt to put a satellite into orbit but the 
              United States, South Korea and Japan have condemned it as a poorly 
              disguised ballistic missile test.<br><br>UN resolutions ban the North from testing long-range missiles that could be used to launch a satellite or a nuclear warhead.<br><br>The
               North is believed to have six to eight plutonium-fuelled atom bombs, 
              and analysts say it is working on a uranium-based device. It last 
              conducted a nuclear test in 2009.<br><br>Jingdong Yuan, acting director 
              at the Centre for International Security Studies at the University of 
              Sydney, said that if the country's military leaders wanted to push on 
              with a nuclear test "they will have their way".<br><br>But the 
              temptation will be weighed against the risk that another embarrassing 
              failure will ruin the centennial celebrations, he said.<br><br>IHS Jane's managing director Tate Nurkin said the "biggest concern about North Korea is their weakness not their strength".<br><br>"We
               don't think that North Korea is seeking conflict. They are seeking 
              attention and the concessions that come with that attention that can 
              help prop up the regime," he said in a statement.<br><br>North Korea has been developing missiles for decades both for what it terms self-defence and as a lucrative export commodity.<br><br>Previous
               tests have had mixed results, and the last long-range launch in 2009, 
              which came shortly before the nuclear test, is also believed to have 
              been unsuccessful.<br><br>- AFP/wm</span></span></p>

              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SEOUL: North Korea has placed troops on heightened vigilance, 
              the South's defence minister said on Friday as the failed rocket launch 
              drew international condemnation.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>"North Korean 
              (troops) were placed on heightened vigilance," Defence Minister Kim 
              Kwan-Jin told a parliamentary committee, according to his office, 
              although it was not clear whether the move followed the failed launch.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Kim gave no details on the movement of North Korean troops but condemned the rocket launch as a provocation. <br><br>The
               minister suggested at a separate meeting with General James Thurman, 
              head of US troops in South Korea, and US ambassador Sung Kim that the 
              international community needs "proper sanctions", a defence ministry 
              spokesman told AFP.<br><br>North Korea has said the rocket would place a
               satellite in orbit for peaceful research purposes, but Western critics 
              saw the launch as a thinly veiled ballistic missile test, banned by 
              United Nations resolutions.<br><br>The defence committee of South 
              Korea's parliament adopted a resolution calling for a "firm" response to
               any additional provocations by North Korea.<br><br>The North should 
              "immediately stop developing weapons of mass destruction and long-range 
              delivery devices" that raise tensions on the Korean peninsula, the
