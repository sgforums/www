              <p class="feature_divider" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"> </p>
              <div id="article_content" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; padding: 0px;">
              <p style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">A neighbor in the town of Kanie, Aichi Prefecture, where a mother and son were murdered and another son injured, described a conversation with one of the surviving sons. “Two of the four sons lived with their mother – the second son, Masaki, who was killed and the third, Isao, who was injured. I saw the eldest boy the day after the incident – he was pale-faced and said that he wanted a quiet funeral in consideration of the circumstances. It was heartbreaking to see him.”</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">The gruesome murder happened during Golden Week in the middle of the night between May 1 and 2. The mother, Kihoko Yamada was bludgeoned to death, Masaki died of multiple stab wounds and Isao, who came home at 2 a.m. was attacked from behind but seized the knife from the assailant, whose leg he stabbed. No fingerprints other than those of the victims have been found. </p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">A former Metropolitan Police Department investigator told Shukan Post that the crime committed indicates animosity as the motive, “based upon the untouched bankbooks and cash belonging to the victims” and “the fact that no one in the neighborhood heard any shouts or arguing voices, which implies the likelihood that the assailant was not a stranger to the family. The house cat was killed probably because it was simply in the way. Moreover, judging by the brutality of the wounds on the victims, intense malice is suspected.”</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">In fact, it has been confirmed by a source in the Aichi police department that the investigating team is looking into the possibility of disputes between the family and anyone acquainted with them. </p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">So far, though, family problems that may be related to the crime have not been identified, as attested by a friend who says the family got along very well. After the husband passed away 10 years ago, Kihoko raised her four sons on her own and as a cat-lover, enjoyed taking care of stray cats as well. Masaki’s friend describes him as a devoted son, giving his mother 100,000 yen out of his monthly salary while training at a pastry shop to become a patissier, his childhood dream. </p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">The eldest and youngest sons live independently, but are known to see each other on a frequent basis. The youngest works for a beverage company and is the twin brother of Isao.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">The question remains, then, as to whether there were any altercations that involved acquaintances and relatives. </p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Shukan Post interviewed the eldest and youngest brothers on the evening before Kihoko’s wake, held on May 4, as they entered their late mother’s home. In answer to a question about disputes within the family or otherwise, the eldest son snapped, “You guys would probably know.”</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Maybe the ongoing police investigation will eventually shed light on what this mysterious comment may mean.</p>
