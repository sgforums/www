              <p>JILTED by his girlfriend of seven years, Alex Wong Kia Soon, 30, 
              tried to set fire to her father's provision shop in Bukit Batok Street 
              33. He brought along two bottles of kerosene, lit the homemade cloth 
              fuses and threw them down onto the roof of the shop at 11.40pm on Oct 4.
               Luckily, the fire went out after a few seconds and damage was estimated
               to be less than $50.</p>
              <p>On Thursday, Wong was jailed for a day and fined $5,000 by a 
              community court. He had pleaded guilty last month to one count of 
              committing mischief by fire. Two other similar offences - committed on 
              Sept 22 and Oct 3 last year - were taken into consideration for the 
              purposes of sentencing.</p>
              <p>The court ordered for a probation report was ordered but on Thursday,
               District Judge Ng Peng Hong heard that probation was not recommended as
               Wong, who suffers from a major depressive disorder, does not want to 
              undergo psychiatric treatment or take his medicine.</p>
              <p>He had complained to the probation officer that his 
              medication made him 'feel weird'. Wong also claimed he was much better 
              now but Judge Ng advised him that since psychiatrists deemed it 
              necessary for him to continue treatment, he should listen to the 
              professionals. Added the judge: 'If there are side-effects, tell the 
              doctors and they will prescribe other drugs.'</p>
              <p>His lawyer VG Sambandan had informed the court that at the 
              time of the offences, Wong had lost his job as an IT engineer and his 
              pet cat of 15 years had also died. All these misfortunes coupled 
              together had a detrimental effect on his client's mental state, the 
              lawyer said.</p>
