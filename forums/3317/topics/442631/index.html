              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: A probation report has been called on Thursday for a 
              14-year-old girl who held her 10-year-old male relative while her mother
               splashed hot oil on him.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The girl, her parents and two sisters aged 20 and 24, were arrested in June this year. </span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Channel NewsAsia understands the 46-year-old mother, who works as a cleaner, is the grand-aunt of the boy.  <br> <br>The
               court heard the boy -- who started living with the family at age four 
              when his biological mother went to prison -- had been abused since 2009.<br><br>Early
               this year, the girl and her sisters complained to their mother that the
               boy had eaten all the food in the house, and was playing with the gas 
              stove.<br> <br>Their mother then instructed the three of them to hold 
              the boy's arms and legs down while she heated cooking oil in a frying 
              pan. <br> <br>The woman then took off his shirt and used a ladle to splash hot oil from the frying pan onto his face and bare body.<br> <br>She then told her daughters to turn him around, where she repeated the act on his bare back. <br> <br>A
               medical report by Dr Sharon Wong of KK Women's and Children's Hospital 
              revealed the boy suffered facial deformities, including multiple 
              first-degree burns and several scars over his head and face.<br><br>The boy is currently in a welfare home.<br><br>Two other charges against the girl - of voluntarily causing hurt - were also taken into consideration.<br><br>On
               two separate occasions, she had aided her mother by holding the boy 
              down while her mother snipped his fingers with a pair of scissors, and 
              pressed a hot ladle against his back. <br> <br>In mitigation, her 
              lawyer, Mr M S Rajendran, said she was "not thinking rationally when she
               was confronted with obedience towards her mother".<br><br>The court also heard the girl knew the boy was in pain and "felt sorry for him but could not bring herself to defy her mother".<br> <br>Her lawyer added the girl is currently in a girls' home and is remorseful.<br> <br>Her uncle and aunt have offered to take custody of her and have signed a bond ensuring her good behaviour.<br> <br>Both her parents and sisters will have their cases mentioned in court on 23 December. <br> <br>- CNA/wk</span></span></p>

              <p>I think the issue with eating animals is irrelevant here. If there's karma, all the people should suffer sunburns from a big big hole in the sky, and why is that little boy there chosen to suffer for you and I?</p>
