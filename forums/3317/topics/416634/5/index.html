              <p>Notice... you are talking about "tax payer" that is income of 20
              k PA and above. If you are having exemption/reduction from
              parents, children and etc.. you might not be a taxpayer
              at all. So there is a huge % of the Singapore population that is
              not inside this data at all. My father earns about $3k per month,
              and he have never pay any tax for 20 over years. </p>
              <p>The initial thread is talking about "<span style="color: #333333;">Over 30% earn
              less than $1,200?" &lt;-- they are not tax payers at all and they
              do not feed into the table posted by eagle. They are totally
              outside the scope.  </span></p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>Actually if you have tax deductions, you still considered part of "taxpayers". Just that you pay $0. You can have a assessable income of &lt;$20k and not pay any tax. But you are still in the records of IRAS. Hence your dad will still be in the table I posted.</p>
              <p>:)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I initially posted the table just for extra data to ponder about, and not trying to prove or disprove anything. The people who earn less than $1.2k still fit into the table because they still have assessable income. They just fall into the tax bracket of $0 tax.</p>

              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: The third and final Institute of Technical Education (ITE) regional campus will start operating in January 2013.<br><br>The
               ground-breaking ceremony for the campus in Ang Mo Kio, known as ITE 
              College Central, was held on Wednesday morning. The project is the most 
              extensive ITE campus project to date.<br><br>However, the cost of the project was not disclosed.<br><br>The
               campus will span a land area of 10.6 hectares and will be able to 
              accommodate 10,400 students - 40 per cent more than what the other two 
              campuses can hold.<br><br>New programmes in the performing arts will be offered at the campus.<br><br>Education
               Minister Dr Ng Eng Hen who officiated at the ceremony said this would 
              allow ITE to support Singapore's growing arts and entertainment 
              industry.<br><br>The new campus will also offer courses in niche areas 
              such as Design and Media, Early Childhood Education as well as Aerospace
               Engineering.<br><br>Dr Ng said over the years, ITE enrolment has risen 
              from 19 per cent of the graduating secondary cohort in 2000, to 22 per 
              cent last year.<br><br>A result, he said, of changing perceptions.<br><br>"More
               students are enrolling, because they all know there is real value in an
               ITE education. That's the proof of the pudding. You can do all the 
              marketing you want, you can come up with campaigns. But if the students 
              don't believe you can give value to them, your enrolment will fall."<br><br>Dr
               Ng added that ITE graduates have also done well in the labour market, 
              with four in five securing jobs last year despite the downturn.<br><br>Separately,
               the Ministry of Education (MOE) told MediaCorp that from next year, 
              foreign students who did not go through Singapore's education system 
              will not be able to attend the ITE's full-time Nitec and Higher Nitec 
              courses.<br><br>The MOE said these students were admitted directly into 
              ITE's traineeship and engineering courses to address "specific, short 
              term manpower needs" of employers.<br><br>Part-time courses that serve that need will continue to admit foreign students directly, said the MOE.<br><br>The MOE said about four percent of each full-time ITE cohort are foreign nationals.<br><br>Most of them enter ITE after taking the GCE 'N' and 'O' level examinations in Singapore.<br><br><br>-CNA/ac</span> </span></p>

              <p>1) Is rental income not income, even if it is not in the
              workforce report? Please, tell me rental income is not income,
              dividends received is not part of income, nor income from other
              online sources. I do know people making $2k a month from online
              sources and this is not taxed. Trading income is perhaps not income
              to you too. Am I right to say that?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) 21% of population earns below $1.2k a month is what is
              officially reported. I'm talking about income sources that are not
              official, that do not need to be reported. In actual fact, the
              number earning less that $1.2k is likely lower. Are you saying this
              is wrong?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3) I have again pointed out real life scenarios. 21% is
              reported. IMO, there is no scenarios where it can be higher than
              that, but there's scenarios where it can be lower. So it can only
              be lower. Are you saying this is wrong too?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4) Finally, as I have said before, my aim is on the sentence of
              whether Singaporeans are better of the last decade. Some of the
              reasons include people choosing to work part time and thus earn
              less than $1.2k per month. And that is the reason I said the
              results is not representative, for this final conclusion by the
              author. Are you going to dispute this?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>5) "you're arguing against statistical facts with hypothetical
              scenarios that can't be dis-proven"</p>
              <p>And this is where you are wrong. Again, my main point is against
              the author, who has argued for his conclusion based on a flawed and
              myopic analytical view of the statistical data shown.</p>
              <p>And in which post did I argue against statistical facts? Did I
              mention in any post that it is wrong? Statistics is merely numbers.
              I'm pointing out where it is not representative, and how it cannot
              leads to the conclusion that was made.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In total, there 5 paragraphs of questions for you. I have
              labelled them for your convenience for discussions.</p>

              <p>Actually if you have tax deductions, you still considered part

              <p>I can see that you insist on failing to understand what is truly meant by income. It's not playing with words nor are they assumptions; it is fact. Fact is, my dividends are not taxed on my side. Fact is, my meagre online advertising revenue from my blogs is not taxed. Fact is, the amount I gain from trading stocks is not taxed. And these are what I considered as part of my income. In fact, at 27 yrs old, I can stop working right now, do a 6 hrs week part time relaxing job for $1k a month and be part of the 21%, and survive on these alternative income sources and still see my savings grow slowly. Why? Because my expenses aren't high.</p>
              <p>I just choose not to stop because I have some life goals I set out to achieve; they are still far from being achieved. I have done up my path myself, I don't see how many others aren't doing it yet.</p>
              <p>In fact, there's this person who had been buying SMRT since he started working. And he has accumulated so many that he quitted in 2008 to relax and enjoy his SMRT dividends, at the age of 35. But he's single though.</p>
              <p>It would be interesting to see you define what you mean by income.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Each of 1, 2, 3 and 4 are all pointing at the same thing: the numbers and statistics are not representative enough for the conclusion by the author. These are my supporting points, and they are all direct to the point. And they are highly relevant.</p>
              <p>It just got longer because you continue to evade questions by beating round bushes. You would be better off explaining why points 1, 2, 3 are irrelevant than merely just making a baseless claim.</p>
