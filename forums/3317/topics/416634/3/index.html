              <p>Huh? How does that link?</p>
              <p>How many of those aged 20-49 are housemakers seeking to make some extra income for the family? Do you know how many hours are they part timing?</p>
              <p>I do part time work on top of my full time job, and to earn $1.2k requires about 15+ hrs from myself, or roughly 4 extra hours a week. But again, as I have mentioned, I'm the minority.</p>

              <p>That makes sense, but you still didn't get my point. Perhaps I wasn't clear, or maybe I really wasn't.</p>
              <p>To put it clearly, what I meant is some of these 21% choose to earn less than $1.2k because they do not need the money. So it isn't a big hoo-ha.</p>
              <p>But of course, I do not deny that there are groups unable to attain a full

              <p>I know a few people who have achieved "financial freedom" but prefer to work full time. Their reasons for working despite not needing to, are social ie the need to feel like they're socially connected and the need to be their "own person" and not end up being a "nobody".</p>

              <p>Asset rich retirees and couples with a high earning spouse are considered roundabouts by you when to me, it is very in context with being not representative of whether many

              <p>turnover $600kpa is actually very little. turnover is not profit, it's not even income (profit = income - expenses). turnover means all the money that come in + go out. So 600k pa for turnover is very little.</p>
              <p>if he had a sales job that provided him with as crazy an amount as $100kper month (that's $1.2 million per yr), he should have stuck with it.</p>

              <p>I heard they were scholars, and before this, had high flying,
              but super stressful jobs. Their savings can last them for a few
              years.</p>
              <p>They just broke down from the stress and decided to take some
              breathers I guess.</p>

              <p>What a coincidence. My friend is not a scholar but she married one and so she could quit .But she's no slouch in self identity department and her plan is to figure out what she really wants to do with her life instead of slaving away at a job she's less than happy in. Long term ambition is to earn as much as my sec school bud. She's giving me a measure of inspiration cos I'm tempted to do the same, although it takes courage, because you always wonder whether you're making a huge mistake and by the time you know it, its too late to reverse it.</p>

              <p>If his sales job only made him $1+k per month then he should quit cos nothing much to lose. At least his business has a fighting chance to make it big.</p>
