              <p>I'm answering you HEAD ON. you made a logical flaw in your statements. And then you hide in your shell like a turtle.</p>
              <p>You said "the % of asset rich retirees and couples with a high earning
                                      spouse could be the same (+/-) the last decade &amp; now</p>

              <p>We all know that money shrinks with time because of increasing costs of goods, so life with 1.2k per month 10 yrs ago, is not the same as the same amount now. Your argument above has holes, because while the % of people with high income spouses or rich retirees remain fairly the same (also false, because of rising affluence over the decades means a higher and higher % of these groups of people), the value of their wealth also shrinks from inflation.</p>

              <p>Why are you evading? LOL. The fact is that you can never outwit or outlogic either of us and its as clear as day. You're just not at the same level. You have no faculty of logic, basic reasoning abilities and powers of analogy and deductions. All this is part of IQ, which is genetically determined.</p>
              <p>People have survived with $800 per month. If you make more, you have more to enjoy. if you make $50k a month, you can buy piano classes for your kids, live in a nice landed property, your kids would have gone to Europe many times over by the time they're 9. Thats the difference between having money and not having. If you make less, you have less. It's that simple.</p>
              <p>Anyway no need to talk so much. I only meant to call you out (expose) and show you what a fucktard with no logic you are. I'm leaving the office now. Goodbye fucktard. Have a nice time rotting in a local university (or wherever you fucktards go to)</p>

              <p>There are very few poly grads who do not go to get a degree.

              <p>Your inference that "with their educational qualifications", all
                  poly grads will not reach $3k and beyond is so simplistic it can
                  only be uttered by someone born yesterday. Many high income
                  earners, including those in top earning property and financial
                  product sales, are poly grads. Some of them didn't even bother to
                  get a private degree and make $20k a month.</p>
              <p>Many poly grads not in sales jobs make $100K per annum and
                  above, doing the same jobs in the office as degree holders.</p>

              <p>What nonsense you are speaking? I think you are still quite naive. You assume that people must get that degree after they get their diploma immediately? My uncle get his degree at 35 years old.  And I would consider him as a degree holder now. But they are still many people who are still ITE, or diploma holder until the day they died.  </p>
              <p>"Top earning property and financial product sales, are poly grads" How many are they? Be realistic. My ex-SGT is doing property now, earning 6 k per month. But they are the limited few. When you flip the newspaper and look at property advertisement in ST701 you would know how many property agents are they? </p>
              <p>I think you are the most naive people, that I have ever since. When I work at MOM, 5 years old ago, doing june/july employment survey, you are still swimming. Go to the MOM website and look at employment stats. yourself. Dont come and argue without doing your homework. </p>
              <p>There are always exceptions here and there but we are talking as a  general picture. </p>
              <p>Most older generations in their 40 to 70 s, are also Singaporeans, and they are still working. And most of them are not even ITE or dipolma holder. Have you forgot that they exist? </p>

              <p>well, that what I have been trying to imply all along. How would you know whether the percentages is the same, or different, or less? Especially with so many newcomers... We wouldn't know! The demographics has changed a lot since last decade.</p>

              <p>1) Is rental income not income, even if it is not in the workforce report? Please, tell me rental income is not income, dividends received is not part of income, nor income from other online sources. I do know people making $2k a month from online sources and this is not taxed. Trading income is perhaps not income to you too. Am I right to say that?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) 21% of population earns below $1.2k a month is what is officially reported. I'm talking about income sources that are not official, that do not need to be reported. In actual fact, the number earning less that $1.2k is likely lower. Are you saying this is wrong?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3) I have again pointed out real life scenarios. 21% is reported. IMO, there is no scenarios where it can be higher than that, but there's scenarios where it can be lower. So it can only be lower. Are you saying this is wrong too?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4) Finally, as I have said before, my aim is on the sentence of whether Singaporeans are better of the last decade. Some of the reasons include people choosing to work part time and thus earn less than $1.2k per month. And that is the reason I said the results is not representative, for this final conclusion by the author. Are you going to dispute this?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>5) "you're arguing against statistical facts
                      with hypothetical scenarios that can't
                      be dis-proven"</p>
              <p>And this is where you are wrong. Again, my main point is against the author, who has argued for his conclusion based on a flawed and myopic analytical view of the statistical data shown.</p>
              <p>And in which post did I argue against statistical facts? Did I mention in any post that it is wrong? Statistics is merely numbers. I'm pointing out where it is not representative, and how it cannot leads to the conclusion that was made.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In total, there 5 paragraphs of questions for you. I have labelled them for your convenience for discussions.</p>
