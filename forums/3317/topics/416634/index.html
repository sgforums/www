              <p>The  real nominal median income for all employed residents rose by 
              only 1.1%  to $2,500 in 2010. After two consecutive years of negative 
              real income  growth in 2009 (- 1.8%) and 2008, six years (2001 to 2006) 
              whereby  median income hardly moved, and just one year of significant 
              rise in  2007, the bottom line is that real wage growth for the last 10 
              years or  so, is only about slightly over one per cent per annum.</p>
              <p>With  inflation running at 3.5% now, and the Minister of State for 
              Trade and  Industry’s (MTI) recent announcement in Parliament that 
              inflation is  expected to hit 4% by the end of this year, it is likely 
              that workers  may see a third consecutive year of negative real wage 
              growth.</p>
              <p>The real median monthly income from work of residents in full-time employment only increased by 1.8% to $2,710 in 2010.</p>
              <p>Part-timers’ real median monthly income increased significantly by 11% to $700 in 2010.</p>
              <p>Since  the definition of a part-timer was changed from 2009, from 
              working 30  to 35 hours a week, this increase in income may be due to 
              some extent to  more people not being able to get work of more than 35 
              hours a week.</p>
              <p>If someone works seven hours a day, for five days a week, would you consider this worker as a part-timer?</p>
              <p>Also, how does one survive on just $700 gross income (which includes the employee’s CPF contribution) a month in Singapore?</p>
              <p>In  this connection, from 1999 to 2010, the median gross monthly 
              income of  part-timers increased by only 1.4% per annum, from $600 in 
              1999 to $700  in 2010 (not adjusted for inflation yet).<strong> If we adjust for inflation, the increase per annum is near to zero.</strong></p>
              <p>There  were 400,100 residents who earned up to $1,200 and below per 
              month from  work, forming 21% of the workforce. This was slightly lower 
              than  401,600 or 22% a year ago.</p>
              <p>Why does the MOM keep using the same $1,200 benchmark, year after year, for the last 10 years, without adjusting for inflation.</p>
              <p>After adjusting the $1,200 for inflation, I estimate the percentage of residents earning less than $1,200 to be over 25%.</p>
              <p>In  2001, 25.1% earned less than $1,200. So, I believe more people 
              today  earn less than $1,200 (inflation-adjusted), compared to 9 years 
              ago.</p>
              <p>If we include the non-seasonally 4.1% or 84,400 unemployed as of June, and the 10,900 discouraged unemployed, I estimate that <strong>over 30% of residents earn less than $1,200 (inflation-adjusted) or are unemployed.</strong></p>
              <p>Discouraged  workers are persons outside of the labour force who were
               not looking  for a job because they believed their job search would be 
              in vain.</p>
              <p>176,700  or 9.0% of employed residents in 2010 were part-timers, up 
              from 156,200  or 8.4% in 2009. Around half or 49% of the part-timers in 
              2010 were  willing and available to work additional hours (i.e. 
              underemployed),  down from 52% a year ago.</p>
              <p>However, the number of underemployed  residents rose from 80,500 or 
              4.3% of all employed residents to 86,600  or 4.4% over the year.</p>
              <p>Once out of work, mature residents were  more likely to stay 
              unemployed for extended periods. Close to three in  ten (28%) resident 
              job seekers aged 40 &amp; over had been looking for  work for at least 
              25 weeks in June 2010, higher than two in ten (20%)  for all job 
              seekers.</p>
              <p>Of all the categories of workers, Service  &amp; Sales workers had 
              the highest unemployment rate of 5.5%. Even  Cleaners, Labourers &amp; 
              Related workers had the third highest  unemployment rate of 5.3%.</p>
              <p>Aren’t these the jobs that we have been  constantly told that 
              Singaporeans don’t want? If so, then why is the  unemployment rate so 
              high for these workers?</p>
              <p>Does this mean that even Cleaners and Labourers who lost their jobs, had difficulty getting re-employed in the same jobs?</p>
              <p>To what extent has our liberal foreign worker policy contributed to this?</p>
              <p>In my view, the above statistics clearly indicate that many Singaporeans may not be better off over the last decade or so.</p>
              <p>I rest my case.</p>

              <p>Or to reduce total tax paid, the property income is for the homemaker who stays at home while the other spouse is out there earning big bucks?</p>

              <p>I also have a friend earning $1k+ per month, but married a husband earning $9k+ a month. Both are residents, and go into two different tax brackets. Was this taken into account?</p>

              <p>Well, all i know is......those in the lower rung...like delivery drivers, general workers, retail, cleaners, security etc etc; they earned $1200 ten years ago and today, they still earn that kind of salary. Just take a look at the poly grads and you can see. Average entry pay is still $1500. After 10 years, it will still be pretty much the same.</p>

              <p>When they say assessable income $30,000 with a percentage of 11.5%, it just means that those who are taxable in the current income bracket.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hence you see a monthly figure of $2,500 ($30,000 / 12 months), those who have a monthly salary of under $2,000 don't even need to submit the income tax returns. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The figures for assessable income are all those income earners subjected to tax, not those who earn than $2,000 and don't submit their returns. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>how accurate are these figures? I take this to be reflective of
              personal income, and $30,000 equals $2500/month.</p>
              <p>It seems that these figures suggests only 11.5% of taxpayers
              earn below $2.5k/ month. incredible.</p>
              <p>and 30.7% earns $40k/yr, or $3.3k/month.</p>
              <p>seems abit over-inflated to me, considering that some managers
              are only earning slightly over 2k, in the f&amp;b and retail
              industries. lets not mention about the avg rank and file workers
              who are earning $1000++ /mnth.</p>

              <p>You're such a fucktard.</p>
              <p>The table is inverse, because it calculates where you stand against the rest of the population.</p>
              <p>Do you seriously think  98.7% of the pop. earn $500,000 per annum? Or is it someone who earns $500,000 per annum earns more than 98.7% of the pop.? <br>U very stupid leh.</p>

              <p>It doesn't matter. In the professional world, salary packages are calculated annually.</p>
