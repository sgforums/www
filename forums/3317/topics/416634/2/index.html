              <p>You are wrong. Minimum income thats taxable I believe is $20k per annum, not $30k per annum. So if you make between $20k to $30k per annum (let's say $22k), you have to pay income tax. Please read http://www.iras.gov.sg/Tax%20Calculators/IIT/IIT.html</p>
              <p>This is why the table makes sense. It starts off at $30k per annum, and states that if you make $30k, you earn MORE than 11.5% of the taxpayers (who make less than $30k and more than $20k per annum). By the time you go down to the chart to $500K, the $500k per annum guy earns more than 98.7% of taxpayers here.</p>
              <p>Note that high income earners pay higher and more tax than anyone else because the SG tax system is heavily burdened on the high income. Refer to the IRAS income tax calculator in the link and look at how the % of tax to be paid based on taxable income increases exponentially. The low income people who make less than $40k per annum hardly pay any dipshit (less than a few hundred bucks a year), whereas a guy earning $200k per year (many of my friends in their 20s) pay income tax through their nose! (about $22k every year)</p>
              <p>This is such a simple chart that doesn't even require the economics skills of a J1 student. Is everyone here like some underprivileged retards or something? lol</p>

              <p>There are very few poly grads who do not go to get a degree. note I said, get a degree, I didn't say where. How many do not go on to get a private degree if they didn't couldn't go overseas?</p>
              <p>Your inference that "with their educational qualifications", all poly grads will not reach $3k and beyond is so simplistic it can only be uttered by someone born yesterday. Many high income earners, including those in top earning property and financial product sales, are poly grads. Some of them didn't even bother to get a private degree and make $20k a month.</p>
              <p>Many poly grads not in sales jobs make $100K per annum and above, doing the same jobs in the office as degree holders.</p>

              <p>so i listed &lt;30k instead of &lt;20k</p>
              <p>that doesn't change the fact that 21% are paid less than
              $1.2k</p>
              <p>we are talking about singaporeans earning less than $1.2k here,

              <p>No you didn't even understand the chart and the way it was laid out and how it was calculated.</p>
              <p>Take your tax elsewhere? haha dumb people are quite funny many a time. Who do you think is supporting the fiscal budget of everything that runs the country and allows it to survive, let alone function? who's paying for your social services, teh running of the airports and roads and the subsidies for the schools and farmer universities? if all the high income people left SG, thats when ppl like you will shrivel up and die before you can say "kill me god i'm a retard"</p>

              <blockquote>
              <p>With strong income growth, the number and share of full-timers with gross<br>monthly income from work of $1,200 and below declined to 262,700 or 15% in 2010 from 275,000 or 17% in 2009. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>After including part-timers, there were 400,100 residents who earned up to $1,200 per month from work, forming 21% of the workforce.</strong></span></p>

              <p>The part in red tells me that many part timers earn below $1.2k, so much so that they can raise the percentages from 15% to 21%.</p>

Unlike younger potential entrants who mostly preferred to work full-time, the majority or 68% of mature female potential entrants aged 40 &amp; over preferred part-time employment, which would better allow them to balance their work and family commitments.

              <p>If these figures are to believed..to extrapolate:</p>
              <p><em>The real median monthly income from work of residents in full-time employment only increased by 1.8% to $2,710 in 2010.<br>Part-timers’ real median monthly income increased significantly by 11% to $700 in 2010.<br>Since the definition of a part-timer was changed from 2009, from working 30 to 35 hours a week, this increase in income may be due to some extent to more people not being able to get work of more than 35 hours a week.<br>If someone works seven hours a day, for five days a week, would you consider this worker as a part-timer?</em><em>Also, how does one survive on just $700 gross income (which includes the employee’s CPF contribution) a month in Singapore?</em><em>In this connection, from 1999 to 2010, the median gross monthly income of part-timers increased by only 1.4% per annum, from $600 in 1999 to $700 in 2010 (not adjusted for inflation yet). If we adjust for inflation, the increase per annum is near to zero.There were 400,100 residents who earned up to $1,200 and below per month from work, forming 21% of the workforce. This was slightly lower than 401,600 or 22% a year ago.</em></p>
              <p>Median monthly full time income is $2.7k+. Not bad, since it means at least 50% of the other full time workers make more than that and the other 50% make less than that (Thats the meaning of median, fucktards).</p>
              <p>Using the lowest figure of 12 months without bonus, this means at least 50% of all full time workers make $2710 x 12 = $32400 per annum. Most of these make more, since most people have at least the 13 month bonus and many people, have several months bonus. Some people even have 8 month bonus. This makes the 50 percentile income-taxable. In fact, as long as one makes $20,001 per annumm, his or her income is taxable.</p>
              <p>My question to the people marginalised by the figures above, is that why are you so lazy and choose not to work full time? LOL. MSM? If we were anything like them, we won't be calling you fucktards to your face. They're actually rather civil people unfamiliar with riff-raffs like you. haha.</p>
