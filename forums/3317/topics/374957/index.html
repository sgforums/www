              <p><span>SINGAPORE: 366 couples in Singapore tied the knot on Wednesday, the ninth day of the ninth month of 2009. </span></p>
              <p><span>The number is the second highest in a decade and five times as
              many compared to an average day. It is less than the current record of
              765 couples set on 7 July, 2007.
              <br> <br>Newly-wed couples like Simon Wong and Jennifer Lim chose 09/09/09,
              hoping that the date would bring longevity to their weddings and lives.
              <br> <br> The number nine is considered auspicious for the Chinese, as it sounds
              similar to 'jiu, jiu', the Chinese word for 'long-lasting'.
              <br> <br>Apart from the nice ring to the date 09/09/09, there are practical
              reasons for getting a marriage certificate on this particular date.
              <br> <br> "It is easy for him (the groom) to remember. So, no reason for him to forget any (wedding) anniversary gift," said Jennifer Lim.
              <br> <br> Even though the date coincides with the Hungry Ghost Month on the lunar calendar, many did not see that as an issue. 
              <br> <br>"For the lunar seventh month, we don't consider it a concern
              because this is not a Chinese ceremony. We'll do it by next year," said
              groom Chua Yih Puoh.
              <br> <br>But the Registry of Marriages said the potential record-breaking
              date to watch out for is the 20th of September - written as 20-09-2009
              on paper.
              <br> <br>It also coincides with the eighth month of the lunar calendar - the
              number eight is considered by the Chinese as auspicious. More than 600
              couples have already registered to get hitched on that day.
              <br> <br>09-09-09 is also popular with parents welcoming their newborn. At
              least three hospitals said they delivered double the usual number of
              babies. <br> <br> For Mr and Mrs Buay, who coincidentally also celebrated their sixth
              year of marriage on Wednesday, their bundle of joy is perhaps the best
              anniversary gift. And as if the series of nines on Wednesday isn't
              enough, their little one was born at exactly 9.09am!
              <br> <br> Raffles Hospital said of the 18 babies born there on Wednesday, nine were induced through Caesarean upon the parents' request.
