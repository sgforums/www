              <p><strong>Lin Chi-ling in financial difficulties?</strong></p>
              <p class="first">Recent rumour has it that Lin Chi-ling's brother's
              cosmetic business has recently run into financial problems and is now
              in debt.</p>
              <p>To show support for her family, Lin did not just invest money in her
              brother's cosmetic business but also endorsed the products.
              Unfortunately, the NT$50million (about S$2.5million) she forked out was
              unable to save her brother's business. The distribution rights of the
              cosmetics will be withdrawn in June.</p>
              <p>Taiwanese media exposed that
              Lin previously accepted the financial aid of Jerry Yan, the
              model-turned-actor whom she had dated for four years.</p>
              <p>Though Yan
              is known to be frugal, he is very generous to his girlfriend and
              friends. He initiated to help his then-girlfriend when he learnt that
              they were in dire financial straits. Being a high grossing celebrity,
              Yan forked out millions every year, between 2002 and 2006, to help the
              Lin family clear their debt and even gave her a luxury car.</p>
              <p>The couple broke up later after Lin became famous and too busy to maintain the relationship.</p>
              <p>Neither
              party was available to comment about the report but Lin's mother
              rebutted furiously, saying that her family is not facing any financial
              difficulty and her daughter does not need to contribute to the family.</p>
              <p>She added, "Jerry Yan has no special relationship with our family, why would there by any monetary flow between us?"</p>
              <p>With
              regards to Lin's rumoured relationship with businessman Qiu Shikai,
              Lin's mother said that both Lin's and Qiu's businesses are on par and
              they never depended on outsiders to eliminate their debt. Neither is
              Lin Chi-ling after the Qiu family assets.</p>
