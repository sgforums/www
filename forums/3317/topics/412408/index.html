              <p>IN A surprise move, Dr Ong Teck Chin, the principal of Anglo-Chinese 
              School (Independent), has resigned from the school he has headed since 
              1994.</p>
              <p>Contacted yesterday by The Straits Times, he would only say: 'I have 
              been wanting to step down for a while. Do you know I had a bypass? Two 
              years ago.'</p>
              <p>He added: 'I have done a lot for ACS and I want to move on.'</p>
              <p>He said he was 'going overseas' and added: 'Do you know I am
               past my retirement age? I am 61 years old. It is time I took it easy.'</p>
              <p>His resignation four weeks before the end of the school year
               surprised teachers, students and parents, especially as it comes in the
               midst of the students' final-year examinations.</p>
              <p>The Straits Times learnt that a complaint was recently filed
               against Dr Ong to the board of governors, which was looking into it.</p>

              <p><strong>Mystery surrounds ACS (I) principal’s sudden resignation</strong></p>
              <p>The principal of Anglo-Chinese School (Independent), Dr Ong Teck Chin, has stepped down with immediate effect after 16 years in charge.</p>
              <p>According to <em>The New Paper</em>, Dr Ong has had an alleged complaint lodged against him by a male former teacher of the school.</p>
              <p>The school’s board of governors, led by former school sprinter and 
              Parkway Holdings vice-chairman Richard Seow, is investigating the 
              complaint.</p>
              <p>When queried on the incident, Dr Ong would only say that it’s the right time for him to step down.</p>
              <p>He told <em>The Straits Times</em>, “I have been wanting to step down for a while. Do you know I had a bypass? Two years ago.”</p>
              <p>He went on to add, “I have done a lot for ACS and I want to move on. 
              Do you know I am past my retirement age? I am 61 years old. It is time I
               took it easy.”</p>
              <p>Asked to comment on the ongoing investigation, he said,”Ask the ACS board. I don’t want to respond to any allegations.”</p>
              <p>While some ACS (I) teachers have been informed of Dr Ong’s decision 
              to step down, they were also told not to communicate with the media. </p>
              <p>But the timing of his resignation – which comes four weeks before the
               end of the school year — has puzzled teachers, students and parents, 
              since it comes in the midst of the students’ final-year examinations.</p>
              <p>Madam E Chua, 54, a housewife whose son graduated from the IB programme last year, said the news saddened her.</p>
              <p>She told <em>TNP</em>, “I’ll always remember Dr Ong for pioneering the IB programme in Singapore.”</p>
              <p>One of Dr Ong’s greatest contributions was starting the Integrated Programme where students bypass the GCE O levels and graduate with an International Baccalaureate (IB) diploma at the end of six years.</p>
              <p>ACS (I) was the first and only school in Singapore to offer the IB diploma.</p>
              <p>He was also instrumental in helping ACS (I) – one of the first schools- to attain the Education Ministry’s pinnacle award, the School Excellence Award, in 2004.</p>
              <p>The appointment of Dr Ong as principal of ACS (I) was itself deemed 
              controversial, as he was a former student of rival school, Raffles 
              Institution.</p>
              <p>Dr Ong, now married with three children, first graduated from the National University of Singapore (NUS) in 1972 with an honours degree in chemistry.</p>
              <p>In 1975, under a Rhodes Scholarship, he went on to further his studies at the University of Oxford. Upon his return to Singapore, he became a physiology lecturer at the faculty of medicine at NUS.</p>
              <p>He held dual positions as lecturer at NUS and vice-principal in ACS 
              (I) from 1988 till 1994, when he was appointed principal of the school.</p>

              <p><strong>ACS (I) replaces principal</strong></p>
              <p>MRS Fanny Tan, deputy principal of ACS(I) has been appointed acting 
              principal of ACS(I) with immediate effect, taking over from Dr Ong Teck 
              Chin who resigned suddenly.</p>
              <p>Mr Richard Seow, chairman of the ACS Board of Governors, who 
              announced the appointment in a statement on Tuesday, also said the 
              Boards are currently looking into a complaint that has been directed at 
              Dr Ong.</p>
              <p>He added that Dr Ong, who has headed the school since 1994, has informed the Boards of his intention to retire from ACS(I).</p>
              <p>'Dr Ong has offered his resignation, which has been accepted
               by the Boards. He is currently on leave,' he said. 'Notwithstanding his
               resignation, the Boards take a serious view of any complaint and are 
              currently determining the facts of the matter.'</p>
              <p>Mrs Tan is an experienced educator who has been with the school since 1988 and a deputy principal for the past 14 years.</p>
              <p>'Mrs Tan, senior administration and the strong team of 
              educators and staff will continue to build on the school's strengths and
               successes,' said Mr Seow. 'As we transition the leadership of ACS 
              independent, our students and staff remain the board?s priority,' he 
              said.</p>
              <p>The statement said that Dr Ong has been contemplating 
              retirement now for a number of years. 'One of his reasons for retirement
               is his desire to slow down on the advice from his doctor since his 
              multiple bypass surgery in 2008. We respect his decision and thank him 
              and his family for their invaluable contribution to the school over the 
              years,' it said.</p>
              <p>Under Dr Ong's leadership, ACS independent has received many
               notable accolades and successes in all aspects of student life, 
              including being the first school to be awarded the Singapore Quality 
              Class award.</p>

              <p><strong>Probe into ACS principal</strong></p>
              <p>TWO Anglo-Chinese School (ACS) boards are looking into a complaint by
               a male teacher that ACS (Independent) principal Ong Teck Chin had acted
               inappropriately towards him.</p>
              <p>The teacher contacted The Straits Times last Thursday and alleged the
               principal had 'behaved inappropriately' towards him, and he had e-mail,
               text messages and recordings to prove his claims.</p>
              <p>Asked about these allegations yesterday, Dr Ong, who resigned 
              unexpectedly last weekend, declined to comment. 'I had told the school 
              board that I will let them address it,' he said.</p>
              <p>Mr Richard Seow, chairman of the ACS board of governors, 
              confirmed in a statement yesterday that both the ACS board of governors 
              and ACS (I)'s board of management were looking into a complaint directed
               at Dr Ong.</p>
              <p>'Notwithstanding his resignation, the boards take a serious 
              view of any complaint and are currently determining the facts of the 
              matter,' said Mr Seow.</p>
              <p>He did not name the complainant and did not specify the 
              nature of the complaint. He told The Straits Times that an inquiry 
              committee had been formed comprising members of both boards.</p>

              <p>One of them, housewife Amy Ng, 45, whose son is in Secondary 3, said:
               'We would like Dr Ong and the board to reconsider their decision. Over 
              the years, he has done a great job, and the school has won a lot of 
              awards. We would like him to come back.'</p>
              <p>The more than 10 parents interviewed all expressed shock at Dr Ong's resignation, and also support for him.</p>
              <p>Of the complaint, they maintained that a person was innocent until 
              proven guilty. But they added that the school's boards should 
              investigate the allegations thoroughly.</p>
              <p>A parent whose son is in Secondary 1 said: 'He is an educator, and 
              this is a boys' school. If there is inappropriate behaviour, clearly 
              this cannot be accepted.</p>
              <p>'I would definitely want the boards to investigate and for the findings to be made public.'</p>

              <p>True, but the general public typically attributes a school's success to the principal, not the driving force (the teachers) behind the rising academic standards.</p>

              <p><strong>'Inappropriate behaviour'</strong></p>
              <p>AN INVESTIGATING panel has found that the former principal of 
              Anglo-Chinese School (Independent), Dr Ong Teck Chin, had behaved 
              inappropriately towards a male teacher.</p>
              <p>'Dr Ong Teck Chin has conducted himself in an inappropriate manner 
              and his conduct has fallen short of the standards expected of a 
              principal,' said a joint statement by the ACS Board of Governors and the
               ACS(I) Board of Management on Monday.</p>
              <p>It added that 'Dr Ong deeply regrets his actions and has apologised'.</p>
              <p>Mr Mark Richie Tan, a biology teacher in his 30s, had tendered his 
              resignation early last month and complained to the boards that Dr Ong 
              had behaved inappropriately towards him. At the same time, Dr Ong, 61, 
              resigned abruptly, citing health problems.</p>
              <p>In the last six weeks, the two boards had carried out 
              'investigations and deliberations', interviewing former and current 
              teachers who had worked closely with Dr Ong.</p>
              <p>Mr Tan has since retracted his resignation and is back 
              teaching biology at the school. The last day for Dr Ong - who took over 
              as principal in 1994- will be Nov 30 even though Dr Ong had told 
              students earlier that he will be serving a six-month notice.</p>
