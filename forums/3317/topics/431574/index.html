              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: A global study found that 53 per cent of 16-22 year 
              olds said they would rather give up their sense of smell than give up 
              their technology like laptops and mobile phones.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Technology was seen as a tool for this generation to give them a sense of the world.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>It also found that justice is the second most important motivator for young people.<br><br>The
               study also showed that Singapore youths in particular are increasingly 
              rejecting material possessions, such as the five Cs of cash, credit 
              card, car, condominium and country club; and turning towards a new "C" 
              of commune, focusing on the need for connection, relationships and 
              community.<br><br>This finding was part of a global study of 16 to 30 
              year-olds across 17 countries including Singapore, Malaysia and China. 
              The research was conducted on 9,000 youths through both online surveys 
              and focus group interviews.<br><br>The research called "The Truth about 
              Youths" also found that Singapore youths, despite the pressure to 
              perform academically, were no longer attracted to the concept of winning
               at all costs. Instead, they stressed the need to look at the bigger 
              picture and focus more on happiness and less on winning.<br><br>The 
              research conducted by Global McCann Worldgroup examines the motivations 
              of youth and seeks to uncover what makes them both similar and different
               from previous generations.<br><br>Eric Leong, Strategic Planner for the
               McCann Worldgroup, said: "When we talk about Singaporean youth, the 
              current generation have had a more comfortable upbringing and because of
               that, their expectations and their wants and needs are different from 
              previous generations.<br><br>"They are a lot more laid back when it 
              comes to the workplace, what they look for. They are looking for 
              somewhere where they can socialise, where they can have a bit of fun as 
              well as work, so they are driven in different ways."<br><br>-CNA/ac</span></span></p>
