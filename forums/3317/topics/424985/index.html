              <p>THE number of Singaporeans visiting the two local casinos is 
              declining gradually - after higher-than-expected attendance in the past 
              year since they opened, Minister for Community Development, Youth and 
              Sports Vivian Balakrishnan disclosed on Saturday.</p>
              <p>This indicates that the novelty factor is 'wearing off', he said.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, his ministry is closely monitoring die-hard casino-goers, 
              and may implement more safeguards to curb their entry into casinos, if 
              needed.</p>
              <p>Dr Balakrishnan was speaking at an annual forum for 
              contributors to Reach, the Government's feedback portal. He was joined 
              by Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong and Reach chairman Amy Khor.</p>
              <p>Questions on the casinos and problem gambling dominated the 11/2 -hour forum, which was attended by about 150 people.</p>
              <p>A university student questioned the effectiveness of the 
              $100 daily entry levy in keeping Singaporeans out. Between April and 
              November last year, $130 million in levies were collected. Last June, 
              Marina Bay Sands said that Singaporeans comprised a third of the 25,000 
              punters who visited daily since its opening in April.</p>

              <p><strong>More safeguards to be introduced to curb gambling addiction if needed: Dr Balakrishnan</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Community Development, Youth and Sports Minister 
              Vivian Balakrishnan has assured Singaporeans that more safeguards will 
              be introduced to identify and protect those who are most vulnerable to 
              problem gambling, if the need arises.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Dr Balakrishnan said this at a forum for contributors to the government feedback portal, REACH.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>He added that the 
              casino novelty amongst locals is wearing off and the number of residents
               at the casinos is gradually declining.<br><br>Still, Senior Minister 
              Goh Chok Tong, who was at the forum, said that it is important to keep 
              senior citizens engaged to discourage them from going to the casinos.<br><br>Singapore's
               integrated resorts have been operating for over a year and concerns 
              about problem gambling topped the issues at the Reach forum.<br><br>Dr 
              Balakrishnan said the authorities have been keeping a close watch on the
               profile and usage patterns of those who frequent the casinos.<br><br>"Actually
               if I wanted to, I can tell you who in this room goes and how often you 
              go, but I don't want to do that and that would be unnecessarily 
              intrusive...taxi drivers will tell you, people who go there, they go 
              there, they come back out, no money to even pay the taxi fare but they 
              need a ride home to pay the money and then go back to the casino. These 
              are warning signs."<br><br>Senior Minister Goh felt that older people have a different problem.<br><br>"Not
               because they have money but because they are bored...you go to the 
              casinos to pass time the root cause is people who do not have interests 
              in their lives," said Mr Goh.<br><br>A major programme in Singapore to 
              ensure that senior citizens always have useful things in their old age 
              is the Active Ageing programme. It is coordinated by the People's 
              Association and also involves various community and welfare 
              organisations in the country.<br><br>But Mr Goh said a long term 
              solution is to ensure that the younger generation of today develop 
              interests which stand them in good stead when they age. He added that 
              there is also a need for Singaporeans to be more self reliant.<br><br>Mr
               Goh said: "How many of you followed the latest tragic events in Japan 
              with the tsunami...and then put into context our floods in Singapore 
              against that kind of disaster.<br><br>"I am not saying we shouldn't do 
              anything about the flood. But the amount of noise you made with just 
              sporadic flood compared to the Japanese. I saw them on TV. Very stoic 
              looking. You don't see them crying. This has happened, just get on, 
              that's the kind of spirit you want to have and you call it nation 
              building."<br><br>-CNA/ac</span></span></p>
