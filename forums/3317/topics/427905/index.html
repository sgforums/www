              <p>He said he was the managing director of Chan Brothers Travel, and told Stomp blogger Silver Ang that he was wanted her to do a travel commercial.<br><br>With
               this belief, Silver treated him as a friend, and paid $10,940 for his 
              personal expenses, only to discover that he was a conman. <br><br>30-year-old
               Chan Kok Yong cheated victims of more than $21,000 by offering them 
              fake tour packages, and also feigned interest in hiring them, as in 
              Silver's case. <br><br>He was found guilty and jailed for 16 months yesterday (Apr 14), but has not compensated the victims.<br><br>Silver
               met Chan on a film set last month and he told her he was interested in 
              engaging her to do a travel commercial for Chan Brothers. <br><br>Over 
              the next few days, she paid for his personal shopping, entertainment and
               transport expenses. Chan claimed that he would pay her back when the 
              "project" was completed. <br><br>However, Silver was unable to contact him afterwards. <br><br>Suspicious,
               she went to Chan Brothers to verify his identity and was told that no 
              such person worked for the company. She made a police report on March 
              30. <br><br>Chan told the court that he resorted to cheating people 
              because he had incurred debts when his mother was diagnosed with cancer.
               He added, ""I have paid back all my debts now. Today is the first 
              anniversary of my mother's death... I am determined to turn over a new 
              leaf."<br><br>In an interview, Silver said, "I treated him as a friend. 
              But he took advantage of our friendship. Even when he is released, I 
              will not trust him again."</p>
