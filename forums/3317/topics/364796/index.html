              <div>
              <p>The first of Singapore's two integrated resorts - the Marina Bay Sands Integrated Resort - will be opening later this year.</p>
              <p>As part of social safeguards to ensure that the opening of the
              casinos does not lead to more gambling problems, the National Council
              on Problem Gambling began accepting applications for the Family
              Exclusion Order this April.</p>
              <p>Since then, close to 80 enquiries have been made by those seeking to bar their family members from the casinos.</p>
              <p><em>Jeremy Koh</em> has more.</p>
              <p>Are you preocupied with gambling?</p>
              <p>Do you need to gamble with increasing amounts of money in order to achieve the desired excitement?</p>
              <p>These are among the questions which counsellors at the Tanjong Pagar
              Family Service Centre use to make a diagnosis of problem gambling.</p>
              <p>The centre is the first point of contact for problem gamblers and
              their family members who are seeking to bar them from the casinos.</p>
              <p>Charles Lee is a Senior Counsellor at the centre.</p>
              <p>"We have some who are cooperative and we have some who may still
              have issues of resistance and reluctance so these are some of the
              things we need to deal with. For example for resistant respondents, i
              will mainly deal with their anger issues by giving them more
              information on why it's important for them to come in for the session."</p>
              <p>Of the 78 who have made enquiries, 14 have already formally applied
              for their family members to be included under the Family Exclusion
              Order.</p>
              <p>Most of the 14 gamblers are Chinese males, aged between 30 and 60 and have received at least an 'O' level education.</p>
              <p>Later this month, hearings will be conducted into two of these applications - both initiated by wives against their husbands.</p>
              <p>If that goes through, their husbands will be the first two to be barred from the local casinos.</p>
              <p>But will the Family Exclusion Order really solve the issue of problem gambling?</p>
              <p>Mr Lee again.</p>
              <p>"This order is important because it tells the family members that
              they have a right not to suffer the consequences of their family
              members who have the addiction. Regarding that of course everything has
              its limitations but at least something is done for the family members
              in this case."</p>
