              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: The Health Ministry has said it will improve 
              financing policies to keep healthcare affordable for all, even for those
               who require longer-term care for chronic conditions and ageing.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>There will also be 
              further expansion of public healthcare infrastructure and manpower in 
              the coming five years, said the ministry on Wednesday in its addendum to
               the President's Address on the opening of the 12th Parliament. </span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The ministry said 
              Singaporeans will have greater access to subsidised care in the 
              community through new primary and rehabilitative care facilities, and 
              expanded portable subsidies for private healthcare services.<br><br>The 
              ministry added that it will strengthen the social safety net by 
              expanding subsidies for medication, outpatient care and intermediate and
               long-term care.<br><br>The Ministerial Committee for Ageing will 
              significantly step up investments in more integrated health and social 
              care facilities to provide the elderly with the care they need.<br><br>The
               Health Ministry will also focus on extending the range and coverage of 
              healthcare services to tackle chronic conditions and cancer, in 
              particular cardiovascular diseases and diabetes.<br><br>Its aim is to 
              build up on integrated care for the chronically ill, so their treatment 
              will be managed on an ongoing, rather than episodic basis. To do this, 
              the ministry will further exploit technology to make it easier for 
              patients to move seamlessly between providers.<br><br>One of the 
              technologies introduced is the CLEO system (Clinic specific Electronic 
              Medical Record and Operations IT system) which will facilitate the 
              sharing of patient information among GPs.<br><br>With this system, GPs 
              will now find it easier to follow up on care for chronically ill 
              patients, such as those suffering from diabetes and high-blood pressure.<br><br>Dr
               Jonathan Pang Sze Kang, a GP with Everhealth Family Clinic &amp; 
              Surgery, said: "This system is supposed to be intelligent enough to give
               me reminders and prompt me to do certain things at certain intervals 
              for each individual chronic disease. That by itself is a wonderful 
              development. So in case I'm too busy or my nurses forget to remind 
              patients or I forgot to remind patients, the system prompts me so that 
              our delivery will be enhanced and improved upon."<br><br>"So for 
              example, if a patient has diabetes, the system will prompt me every year
               that I need to do tests and maybe every three to six months, I need to 
              do certain assessments. And if I have not done anything yet, the system 
              will show me that nothing has been done yet."<br><br>The system will start rolling out by the second quarter of next year and by 2013, some 50 GP clinics will be equipped with it.<br><br>With
               the CLEO system, GPs will have have access to the National Electronics 
              Health Record (NEHR) system which will provide them with an array of 
              patient information. These include their current care received at other 
              healthcare institutions, medication histories, drug allergies, 
              laboratory investigations, clinical diagnoses and X-ray reports.<br><br>Dr
               Patrick Chia, Director of Clinical Transformation Services at MOH 
              Holdings, said: "They will do things in a more organised and systematic 
              manner in terms of clinical tools that will be used to help them. They 
              will find that they can find more specific knowledge better... be able 
              look up references in a better way. They would be able to manage and 
              track patients better... Because many times in a manual world, tracking 
              is just not tenable."<br><br>With more GPs sharing patient information, 
              patient confidentiality has been a concern among some patients. But GPs 
              Channel NewsAsia spoke to stressed that before their information is 
              keyed in, it will be agreed upon by relevant parties and must be crucial
               to the management of their medical condition.<br><br>Dr Jonathan said: 
              "Individual GPs must find out from their patients what they are 
              comfortable and what they are not comfortable with. The GPs should also 
              reassure their patients that their data and information is confidential 
              within the legal parameters laid down in Singapore. So if for some 
              reason, the patient chooses not to divulge certain information then of 
              course, we won't put this information in the system."<br><br>The 
              ministry's goal is to roll out the NEHR system to some 10 GPs, a hospice
               and a nursing home by the end of this year. It will also be rolled out 
              to all public hospitals by June 2012.<br><br></span><em> Videos and text of President Tony Tan's speech at the opening of parliament are available </em><a class="path" href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/parliament/">here</a><span><br><br>-CNA/ac</span></span></p>
