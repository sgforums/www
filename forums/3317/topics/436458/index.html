              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE : The Borders Bookstore at Wheelock Place has entered 
              its last chapter. It is closing its flagship store for good following 
              disputes with its landlord.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The store has less than a week to clear out from its current premises.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>For the past few days now, book lovers only saw a 'The Store is Closed' sign at the entrance of the bookstore at Wheelock Place.<br><br>Then, on Friday afternoon, staff of the bookstore at Wheelock Place were seen clearing the shelves.<br><br>Singapore's
               Borders Bookstore had stood strong even as its US and Australia 
              branches closed one by one, struggling to keep up with digital media.<br><br>But
               it is not free of troubles either, as a dispute with its landlord 
              Wheelock Properties seems to have shut its flagship store for good.<br><br>Tim
               Reid, interim judicial manager of Borders, said: "The rent cheque for 
              August was not paid in the beginning of the month. And when the cheque 
              was issued, initially there were some errors in the cheque - the amount 
              and words did not reflect the amount and digits, and there was a need 
              for a new cheque to be issued. <br><br>"The landlord requested a cashier's order but the cashier's order was not delivered within the timeline that was asked for."<br><br>Mr Reid that said to his knowledge, Borders does not have a history of late payment for its rent. <br><br>However,
               Wheelock Properties was not willing to alter its position that the 
              Borders store remain closed, despite the store's attempt to negotiate.<br><br>Borders
               is one of the most iconic stores at Wheelock Place. Although the book 
              chain has another store at Parkway Parade, many book lovers MediaCorp 
              spoke to were surprised and concerned that the store at Wheelock Place 
              remained closed.<br><br>One person said: "It is a shame...if it is 
              closing, because it is a place for people to hang out; it is not just a 
              place to pick up books, people kind of meet here, and it is strange to 
              see it is going."<br><br>Another added: "It is a pity because this is really good location, it is really nice, I liked it very much."<br><br>A
               third noted: "Right now, I think bookstores are getting more and more 
              outdated with the Internet going on, we can easily get books online, and
               so I personally won't visit bookstores."<br><br>Its judicial manager said the priority now is to remove Borders' stock from its premises by August 23.<br><br>Some
               of the books will be transferred to its Parkway Parade branch, while 
              the rest will be sold at a discounted price at a book sale.<br><br>One 
              customer commented: "I usually read a lot of novels and I usually buy 
              them from Borders also. So if they are to have a big sale, then I think I
               will probably go there."<br><br>Borders' judicial manager also said he may seek a buyer for the Singapore company.<br><br>A
               judicial manager helps to rehabilitate a company or preserve part or 
              all of its business when it is in financial difficulty but is not 
              hopelessly insolvent.<br><br>There are no plans yet to open a new outlet.<br><br>- CNA/ms</span></span></p>

              <h1>What caused Borders Singapore to close?</h1>
              <p>In its heyday, the Borders bookstore at Wheelock Place was the 
              top-earning outlet of all the Borders chain stores. It pipped the other 
              1,200 stores worldwide and emerged tops in terms of sales dollars per sq
               ft.</p>
              <p>That was in 2006. Last week, it closed shop, following the fate of 
              the American and Australian stores, and went under judicial management.</p>
              <p>What went wrong for this once-thriving bookstore that had changed 
              book-selling in Singapore when it opened its 32,000 sq ft store in 1997?</p>
              <p>Consumers say they have been turned off by Borders' poor book 
              selection and proliferation of non-book products - including toys and 
              cookware - in the past few years.</p>

              <p><strong>High Court places Borders under judicial management</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: The High Court has placed Borders bookstore under judicial management for six months.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>It was revealed in 
              court that Borders had taken several steps to improve its financial 
              situation including the sale of Borders or its assets to Popular 
              Holdings and negotiating with Everbilt Developers - its landlord at 
              Wheelock Place -  to half its rent at Wheelock Place from S$541,000 per 
              month to S$275,000.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Under judicial management, Borders cannot be sued by any of its creditors.<br><br>The
               company will explore options, such as talking to potential buyers to 
              prevent winding up. Borders is represented by Allen &amp; Gledhill. <br><br>Its
               leading counsel, Mr Edward Tiong said: "There is still hope the name of
               Borders will continue as it has sentimental value for Singaporeans."<br><br>The
               company is also in negotiations with REDgroup Retail - its parent 
              company in Australia - to obtain a formal release from the A$2.5 million
               loan from REDgroup.<br><br>Borders' fate was tied up with REDgroup's 
              when it was acquired by the latter in 2008. REDGroup had also become 
              insolvent and placed under voluntary administration in Australia in 
              February this year. <br> <br>According to court documents, this resulted
               in Borders "no longer being able to leverage on the economies of scale,
               established relationships or general advantages of operating as part of
               a larger group, as it previously had."<br> <br>Borders will also be 
              looking at the possibility of an arrangement where REDgroup agrees to 
              assign their rights to the Borders' debt such that Borders' employees, 
              gift card holders and creditors can be paid.<br><br>It was reported that there are some 1200 gift card holders with about S$400,000 in credit with the bookstore.<br><br>Borders
               is also hoping to receive proceeds from its S$1.8 million in rental 
              deposits for its lease at Wheelock and Parkway Parade. <br><br>- CNA/fa/cc</span></span></p>

              <p><strong>Borders bookstore at Parkway Parade to shut</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Thousands of bargain-hunters were at the Borders 
              bookstore at Parkway Parade mall, lured by the 70 per cent sale this 
              weekend ahead of its closure on Monday.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>But up until about a week ago, there was still a scramble behind the scenes to keep the retailer afloat in Singapore.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The Parkway Parade 
              outlet - the retailer's second in Singapore - opened in 2007, a decade 
              after its first store opened in Wheelock Place.<br><br>"Prior to the 
              decision to close it, it was a little bit slow. We couldn't buy new 
              books either, so traffic was dropping significantly. We were booming the
               first year we opened. Second year was quite good as well, but third 
              year it had actually declined. Book retailing has definitely changed; 
              the customer habits have definitely changed as well," said Elissa 
              Crosswell, sales manager of Borders Singapore. <br><br>On Wednesday, 
              Borders USA terminated its Brand License Agreement governing activities 
              in Australia, New Zealand and Singapore, giving stores in those 
              countries 90 days to comply. Two days later, Borders Singapore announced
               the Parkway Parade store will shut for good.<br><br>The closure of the 
              Parkway Parade store was not always a foregone conclusion. Up until 
              recently, corporate recovery firm Ferrier Hodgson was in talks with 
              about eight or nine retailers to take over the outlet, and it believed 
              it could have negotiated a separate licence agreement with Borders USA. <br><br>But
               with the rental lease for the store running out in end-October, there 
              was simply not enough time for an agreement to be reached.<br><br>Tim 
              Reid, the judicial manager from Ferrier Hodgson, said besides finding 
              someone to buy the stock and take on the lease obligations, a priority 
              was to ensure continued employment for its 60 staff.<br><br>He said: "I 
              told all the parties, if I had two similar bids, the party that can 
              offer employment for as many of the staff who wish to carry on in this 
              industry - that is clearly going to be a very deciding factor."<br><br>Talks
               started shortly after Reid was appointed in August. Most of the 
              companies that came forward were Singapore firms, though not all were 
              from the book industry.<br><br>Eventually, the decision was made to 
              shut, partly spurred by strong sales at the clearance sale for the 
              Wheelock outlet at the Singapore Expo earlier this month.<br><br>Parkway Parade's mall management had also offered to extend the lease, but was eventually turned down.<br><br>Reid
               explained: "If I incur the overheads of extending the lease, and all 
              the staff costs for another month or even longer, the marginal benefit 
              of doing so reduces dramatically because we have only so much stock to 
              sell.<br><br>"And at a 70 percent discount, it would be inappropriate 
              for me to bring in more stock, because we are possibly selling that 
              stock at a significant loss."<br><br>The 60 employees of Borders 
              Singapore were told of the closure about a week ago, and will get help 
              in finding new jobs. About 30 of them on full-time contracts will also 
              be entitled to compensation.<br><br>"Morale back then was quite low, but
               as a sales team we had to keep the staff happy. So now their morale is 
              quite high, and we're looking forward to sell off everything we have in 
              the store," said Azhari Zainal, department manager at Borders Singapore.
               <br><br>On Sunday, shelves were emptied as shoppers filled their baskets.<br><br>"Whenever
               my mom comes to Parkway to shop at Giant or Cold Storage, she'll always
               drop my brother and I here to read books. So now that Borders is 
              closing down, I can't do that anymore," lamented customer Mitchell Lim. <br><br>Reid
               said he is seeking to give a "significant return" to gift card holders 
              who have made a claim against Borders, and has requested that those who 
              have not registered with the insolvency company to do so quickly.<br><br>He expects to give an answer in one or two months. <br><br>- CNA /ls</span></span></p>
