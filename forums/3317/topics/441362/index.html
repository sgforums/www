              <p>A Singaporean couple who were kicked out of the home of their eldest son
               after an argument moved into a three-room rental flat in Taman Jurong 
              on Wednesday.<br><br>Foo Thin Tak, 62, his wife Tham Swee Kheng, 55 and 
              their 27-year-old youngest son moved into their new home after spending 
              two nights at McDonald’s outlets in the Woodlands area.<br><br>Earlier 
              on Monday, a heated family argument had prompted the couple’s eldest 
              son, a 33-year-old army regular who wanted to be known as Foo, to kick 
              his parents and younger brother out his five-room flat in Woodlands 
              Drive. Foo is married with two daughters.</p>
              <p>He had claimed that his 
              father had threatened to kill him with a knife during an argument, in 
              which police were later called in, reported<em> The New Paper.</em> But this and other allegations made by Foo were refuted by his parents who labeled him as hot-tempered.</p>
              <p>Desperate
               to find a temporary shelter, the couple went to HDB Hub in Toa Payoh on
               Wednesday morning and managed to select a rental HDB flat managed by a 
              private operator. <br><br>Together with their youngest son, who is 
              employed as a security guard, they will be sharing the place with 
              another family, with rent costing around S$245 a month.<br><br>However, 
              the couple were initially selective in choosing the flat for various 
              reasons. For instance, they initially refused a flat on the 16th floor, 
              claiming that they had to walk up the stairs as the lift did not stop on
               the floor. And when shown a flat on the 13th floor, they also rejected 
              it saying the west-facing room in the house was too hot.<br><br>Eventually,
               they chose the former flat after the private operator declined to show 
              them other flats as the policy states that residents will be allocated 
              the rooms instead of being allowed to choose.<br><br>This was not the 
              first time Foo had thrown his parents and brother out his house. They 
              first moved into his flat in 2007 but stayed only for six months after 
              constantly getting into arguments over the state of his brother who was 
              unemployed then. <br><br>The couple had no home of their own as they had
               sold their 4-room Teck Whye flat a few years ago after failing to pay 
              the monthly instalments. In 2010, Foo reconciled with his family and 
              offered them to stay in his flat. However, constant arguments over money
               led them to the current situation.<br><br>Now clearly estranged with 
              their eldest son, Tham said she will be picking up the rest of the 
              family’s belongings from his house later this week, adding that she also
               does not want to maintain any ties with him.</p>

              <p>Army Regular Foo, his wife, and two daughters are also staying in the house. They are entitled to a certain degree of peace and comfort, and also be spared from mental anguish.</p>

              <p>at 24, the youngest son, and somemore working, he should be ashamed that he is still depending on his parents and elder brother.</p>
              <p>And as for the parents, they are living in their son's house, and not the other way round. The son paid for, and owns the house, and therefore is the head of the household, and his parents are just guests freeloading on their son's hospitality. They have no right to argue with their elder son.</p>
              <p>Its not as if they sold their flat to pay for son's flat. They had onced owned a flat, but its too bad that they are not responsible enough to pay for the installment of their own house. At 62 and 55, they have not yet reach the retirement age, and are therefore expected to continue working.</p>
              <p>And beggars can't be choosers. Their attitude with HDB's rental flats tell all.</p>
              <p>Many people who are more worthy of rental flats are still way behind in the queue. Those single parents, families with disabled members. etc.</p>
              <p>They are extremely lucky that HDB allocated them a cheap rental flat at just $265/month, in such short notice, and yet they still want to be choosy, complaining about climbing stairs, that a room is too hot.</p>
              <p>Out in the market, $265 won't even get you a storeroom.</p>
