              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: A man implicated in the death of his sex partner, 
              whose body was found in a trolley bag, has been sentenced to two weeks' 
              jail for not alerting the police of the death.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Pee Weai Hong, 33, had admitted that he was aware of the death of 28-year-old Wong Teck Siong on 3 April 2011.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Instead of reporting
               the death to the police, Pee accompanied his partner, Teo Boon Leong, 
              in the disposal of Mr Wong's body at Labrador Park on that night.<br><br>The three men were involved in a love triangle, which started two months before Mr Wong's death.<br> <br>In the morning of 3 April, Teo had found Mr Wong lying face down in the apartment the three men shared. <br><br>Teo told Pee he did not want to report the matter as he had taken drugs and had also ejaculated into Mr Wong's body.<br><br>Teo added that the police might also detect drugs in Pee's body.<br><br>So, he instructed the accused not to probe further.<br><br>Mr
               Wong's body was found in a black trolley bag along the shoreline of the
               Resorts World Sentosa construction site on 16 April 2011.<br><br>In her
               judgement, District Judge Jasvender Kaur noted that there was 
              deliberate omission, which is "undoubtedly more culpable than a failure 
              through inadvertence or pure panic". <br><br>She said that while Teo, 
              aged 44, was older and made the decisions in the relationship, Pee had 
              known that the deceased's family members were enquiring about him.<br><br>Pee was present when they went to the apartment to find out where the deceased was.<br><br>The
               judge said the aggravating factor was that Pee participated in 
              concealing the death by showing Mr Wong's brother a false text message.<br><br>She
               added that the pathologist could not determine the cause of death as 
              Pee and Teo had impeded the course of proper investigation.<br><br>These warranted a custodial term.<br><br>Pee
               also admitted to one count of cheating a Mr Wong Teck Seng into 
              believing that the deceased was still alive, by showing contents of a 
              group chat to Mr Wong.<br><br>This was taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.<br><br>Teo, a businessman, was granted a discharge that has the effect of an acquittal in January 2013.<br><br>- CNA/ir</span></span></p>
