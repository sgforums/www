              <p><span>SINGAPORE - Malaysia and Singapore have agreed to reduce the toll charges for the Second Link to increase the road connectivity between the two countries. <br><br>This was announced by Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak and his Singapore counterpart Lee Hsien Loong after they met for a retreat at the Shangri-La Hotel in Singapore on Monday. <br><br>The toll charges at both sides of the Second Link, connecting Tuas in Singapore and Tanjung Kupang in Johor, would be reduced significantly, both leaders said at a joint press conference after the retreat. <br><br>The new toll charges will be announced within a month. <br><br>Mr Najib said he and Mr Lee agreed that for the two countries to further enhance their bilateral ties, the road connectivity between Malaysia and Singapore needed to be increased and smoothened. <br><br>Both leaders also announced that the Joint Ministerial Committee (JMC) on Iskandar Malaysia, tasked to increase the connectivity between the two countries, had agreed on several moves. <br><br>Among these, the cross-border scheduled bus services will be doubled with the introduction of eight new additional routes (four from each side) between Pasar Bakti and Larkin in Johor and the two integrated resorts, Boon Lay, Yishun, Newton and Changi Airport in Singapore; and <br><br>The cross-border taxi services will also be liberalised with taxis being allowed to pick up and drop off passengers from any location on the domestic leg of that journey, instead of only at the designated taxi terminals. <br><br>The JMC has also formed a Cross Border Land Checkpoint Committee to facilitate cooperation on operational management and cross-border traffic. <br><br>Mr Lee and Mr Najib also discussed the issue of water, in particular the 1961 water agreement which expires next year. <br><br>PM Lee said: "There is the Skudai Water Works which is in Johor which Singapore has been using to extract the water from the Skudai River. Singapore will hand over the Skudai Waterworks in good working order to Malaysia gratis on the 1st of July 2011 when the Water Agreement expires." <br><br>As for the idea of a third link, which was floated when the two Prime Ministers met last year, Mr Najib said it's a long term project. <br><br>The immediate priority is to optimise the usage of the Second Link. <br><br>- Bernama/CNA/ir <br></span></p>

              <p><strong>Toll charges at Second Link to go down by 30% from Aug 1</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Motorists using the Second Link got some good news from
               the Prime Ministers of Malaysia and Singapore on Tuesday. </span></p>
              <p><span>Speaking at a news conference after their meeting in Kuala Lumpur 
              on Tuesday, the leaders announced that both countries will reduce their 
              toll charges at the Second Link by 30 per cent with effect from August 
              1.
              <br> <br> A hint that toll charges would be reduced substantially was made when 
              Prime Ministers Lee Hsien Loong and Najib Razak met for their retreat in
               Singapore on May 24.
              <br> <br> Another major development announced during that retreat was the land 
              swap arrangement following the decision to relocate the Tanjong Pagar 
              Railway station to the Woodlands train checkpoint by 1 July 2011.
              <br> <br> In a joint statement, the leaders said they discussed the land swap 
              issue and Singapore's offer was conveyed to Prime Minister Najib.
              <br> <br> They had a productive meeting and discussed some initial responses.
              <br> <br> They then agreed to study the matter further and to meet again in three 
              months, after Hari Raya Adilfitri, to finalise the land swap decisions.
              <br> <br> Prime Minister Najib said he will visit Singapore with the final 
              decision.  - CNA/vm </span></p>

              <p><strong>No impact on imports expected from lower toll charges at Second Link</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : Importers in Singapore do not expect the lower toll 
              charges at the Second Link to lead to cheaper goods from Malaysia. </span></p>
              <p><span>That's because toll charges make up a small portion of transport 
              costs.
              <br> <br> Importers also said they cannot pass the cost savings to consumers 
              because transport costs are paid for by their Malaysian suppliers.
              <br> <br> However, suppliers from further up north, like Kuala Lumpur, may change 
              routes to make use of the Second Link. 
              <br> <br> As for transport companies in Singapore, the reduction in toll charges 
              will not benefit them because deliveries to Malaysia are normally made 
              by Malaysian-registered vehicles. 
              <br> <br> Toll charges for the Second Link will be reduced by 30 per cent from 
              August, announced by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and his Malaysian 
              counterpart Najib Razak after their meeting in Kuala Lumpur on Tuesday. -

              <p><strong>Motorists enjoy lower toll charges when using Second Link</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : Starting Sunday, motorists will enjoy lower toll 
              charges when they drive into or leave Singapore using the Second Link. </span></p>
              <p><span> Some coach operators were worried that the lower charges would encourage more to use the link, which could cause jams. </span></p>
              <p><span> They pay a toll of S$3.90 at the Second Link. </span></p>
              <p><span>One operator, Grassland Express, is taking a wait-and-see approach. 
              <br> <br> That is because it said the toll does not form the bulk of operating costs. 
              <br> <br> Instead, it said that rising fuel costs could offset the 30 per cent or S$1.70 toll reduction. 
              <br> <br> But another coach operator is happy that toll has been reduced. Transtar
               told Channel NewsAsia that it plans to bring down fares by about 10 per
               cent. 
              <br> <br> Destinations that could possibly enjoy such reductions include Malacca, Kuala Lumpur, Taiping in Perak and Alor Star in Kedah.
              <br> <br> Transtar hopes that the move can make coach travel more attractive. 
              <br> <br> Sebastian Yap, executive director, Transtar, said: "Low cost carriers 
              have been affecting us a bit. This will be a good opportunity for us to 
              have some free area to adjust ourselves to be more competitive." -
