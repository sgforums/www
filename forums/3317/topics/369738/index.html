              <p><span>SINGAPORE: The Public Service Division in the Prime Minister's
              Office is introducing a one-year Overseas Development Programme for
              China to groom public servants for China-related work. <br> <br> This was announced at the Public Service Commission (PSC) scholarships award ceremony on Saturday.
              <br> <br> Fresh graduates or mid-career professionals can apply for the programme
              where they will get to spend up to nine months working in a Singapore
              company or government agency located in China. When they finish their
              stint, they will be doing China-related work in the Civil Service in
              Singapore.
              <br> <br>This year, 87 PSC scholars were selected from over 2,500
              applicants. And a record number will be going to China for their
              undergraduate studies.
              <br> <br> The PSC has been sending scholars to China since 1993 but the numbers have been small in the past.
              <br> <br>Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, speaking at the award ceremony,
              said: "We need to send more students to study in China because it has
              become a major player in Asia and in the world. <br> <br> "Its influence has grown and will continue to grow. Its relevance to us is increasing. 
              <br> <br> "And we need people who can understand the Chinese, interact with them,
              be comfortable in that milieu, be able to read how they think, how they
              act, what their preoccupations are, and to know some of them personally
              so there are personal ties to link you up."
              <br> <br>Ten students were awarded the inaugural PSC China Scholarship,
              seven are from the Bicultural Studies Programme and one from the
              Chinese Language Elective Programme.
              <br> <br>Lau Yuan Zhi, a recipient of the PSC China Scholarship who is
              headed to Peking University, said: "China and Singapore currently
              already have very strong bilateral ties. Through more of us going over
              there, we hope that when we come back, we can serve the government,
              serve the people, to strengthen such ties."
              <br> <br>This year, two undergraduates were also awarded the PSC Mid-Term
              Scholarship, the purpose of which is to widen the points of entry into
              the public service. Since its inception in 2007, six such scholarships
              have been given out.
              <br> <br>Faiz Mohd Irwan Law was one of the PSC Mid-Term Scholarship
              recipients this year. The Honours-year student at the Nanyang
              Technological University (NTU) said: "When I finished my 'A' Level, I
              haven't decided what I wanted to do as a career. It was only after my
              experiences in NS (National Service) and a few years of my university
              that I realised that I have a passion to serve the people."
              <br> <br>For the future, Mr Lee said the PSC will have to work harder to
              bring in good people, as more scholarships become available and more
              parents have the resources to send their children abroad.
              <br> <br>Meanwhile, those interested in the Overseas Development Programme
              for China can attend an information session on 15 August. More
              information is available at this website: www.psd.gov.sg/odp

              <p>Sometimes I find myself wondering.</p>
              <p>Back when PRC was really very poor, Nanyang Uni was made to close down for fear of communist influence.</p>
              <p>Now they're so called rich, suddenly you wanna make ppl to learn Chinese when lots of parents are alrdy influenced by old days policy.</p>
              <p>Anyway, the issue of guanxi, you sure tat it's really a good way of communication? I point to them, the recent Rio's case. A failed accquisation by cardboard can lead to retailation by cardboard</p>

              <p><br>it was coincidental, the main founder of Nanyang Uni Mr Tan Lark Sye was also a leftist siding w/ e BS</p>
              <p>I remembered hearing his citizenship kena revoked, tat's why today only Dr Lien was honoured w/ a road named after him in NTU's campus and not Mr Tan Lark Sye.</p>
