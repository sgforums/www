              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">City Harvest trial: 6 leaders found guilty on all charges, out on bail<br><br></span></strong></p>
              <p>SINGAPORE: All six City Harvest Church (CHC) leaders facing charges including criminal breach of trust and falsification of accounts were found guilty on all counts on Wednesday (Oct 21).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Following the judgment, the church said all six are now taking legal advice, with some of their lawyers suggesting their clients may appeal the sentence. All have been released on bail of between S$750,000 and S$1 million, though overseas travel is not permitted.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sentencing will take place at a later date, with the court due to hear submissions from defence and prosecution lawyers from Nov 6 to 20.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In a statement released later on Wednesday, the National Council of Churches said it was "saddened" to learn of the verdict, calling it a reminder for the community to pay greater attention to church governance and the management of funds.<br></p>
              <p>The six leaders of the church - founder and senior pastor Kong Hee; deputy senior pastor Tan Ye Peng; former church board member and Chairman of CHC's Investment Committee John Lam Leng Hung; former church board and CHC Investment Committee member Chew Eng Han; and former finance managers Sharon Tan and Serina Wee - were each convicted on between three and 10 counts of criminal breach of trust and falsifying church accounts.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>"CONSPIRACY TO MISUSE CHURCH FUNDS"</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Judge See Kee Oon – the Presiding Judge of Singapore’s State Courts – said the six “engaged in conspiracies to defraud and falsify accounts”, based on the “extensive documentary evidence” unearthed during a 140-day trial that spanned three years.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He said two sets of bonds from music production firm Xtron and glass manufacturer Firna "were not genuine investments ... and were all wrong uses of CHC's funds". He added: "I do not see how they can be said to have acted in good faith in relation to the charges they face."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Said Judge See in his oral judgment: "I find that the accused persons were variously inextricably entangled in two conspiracies to misuse CHC’s funds. One conspiracy consisted of misusing building fund monies for the Crossover, and the other involved misusing CHC’s funds, a substantial portion of which comprised building fund monies, to create the appearance of bond redemptions and to defraud the auditors via falsified accounts through the various roles they played.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Each of them participated and functioned in their own way as crucial cogs in the machinery."<br></p>
              <p>The defence lawyers’ arguments – centering on the altruistic motives of the six, who the lawyers argued did nothing for personal gain, but out of a belief in the evangelistic mandate of the church – did not negate their active and knowing participation in their acts, said Judge See.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"They chose to participate in the conspiracy to misuse CHC’s funds, which included siphoning off large amounts from the building fun for Sun Ho’s music career and eventually for the round-tripping transactions to enable the bond redemptions. They chose to defraud the auditors with falsified accounts suggesting a series of genuine transactions for the redemption of bonds and advance rental," he said.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"The evidence points overwhelmingly to a finding that they had all acted dishonestly and in breach of the trust reposed in them and they played their respective roles in a conspiracy with intent to cause wrongful loss to CHC and to defraud the auditors."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Kong and Lam were convicted on three counts of criminal breach of trust; Tan Ye Peng, Chew and Wee each were found guilty of six counts of criminal breach of trust and four counts of falsifying the church's accounts; while Sharon Tan was convicted on three counts of criminal breach of trust and four counts of falsifying the church's accounts.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>"WE ARE DISAPPOINTED BY THE OUTCOME"</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The six were first charged in court in June 2012 for misappropriating S$24 million of church funds to finance the Crossover Project. Another S$26 million was used to cover up the initial amount through sham investments in two companies owned by CHC supporters, music production firm Xtron and glass manufacturer Firna, the court heard.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Kong's wife, Ho Yeow Sun, was the face of the church's Crossover Project meant to turn her into a pop star, with the aim of evanglising through popular music.<br></p>
              <p>Ho, in a statement posted on the church Facebook page within an hour of the judgement, said they were "disappointed" by the outcome, but called on the church to continue to focus on its core mission.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"This protracted season has been extremely difficult, not just for the six, but also for all their families and friends, as well as for our congregation. More than ever before, let’s have a unity that is unbreakable," she wrote.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Pastor Kong and I are humbled by the tremendous outpouring of love and support shown to us during this time. We thank you for your prayers. Please continue to pray for Pastor Kong, Pastor Tan, John Lam, Sharon, Serina and Eng Han."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>She added: "Since 2012, we have had a new management and a new Church Board running the operations of the church. Therefore, let’s stay the course with CHC 2.0."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Of the six, Chew - the only one to represent himself during the trial - told Channel NewsAsia that he was considering appealing the judgment following the sentencing.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>All were offered bail, with Kong, Tan Ye Peng, Lam and Chew set at S$1 million. Wee and Sharon Tan had their bail set at S$750,000. All six posted bail.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For each count of criminal breach of trust, the six accused could face up to 10 years’ jail and a fine. The falsification of accounts carries a jail term of up to 10 years and a fine.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The punishment for criminal breach of trust by a public servant, banker, merchant or agent set out under Section 409 of the Penal Code – the section under which all six accused have been convicted – is a life sentence or up to 20 years’ jail.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, the maximum sentences judges of the District Court can impose is 10 years per charge, or an aggregate sentence of up to 20 years.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This means that the maximum punishment that can be meted out to the six accused is 10 years’ jail per charge, with a total sentence not exceeding 20 years’ jail. </p>

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Days ahead challenging, but I have no fear: City Harvest Church founder Kong Hee<br><br></span></strong></p>
              <p>SINGAPORE: City Harvest Church founder Kong Hee has broken his silence a day after a court handed down a guilty verdict to him for three counts of criminal breach of trust.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On Wednesday (Oct 22), Kong and five other leaders of the mega church were found guilty of misappropriating S$24 million of church funds to finance his wife's pop music career as part of an evangelism project, and using another S$26 million to cover up the amount through sham bonds.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In a Facebook note on Thursday, Kong said it is a difficult time for him and his family, just as it is for his co-accused. He said his family and him are "continually assured and strengthened by the love and support" shown to them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Please keep praying for me and those involved in the trial, for our families, and especially for the congregation of City Harvest Church, which I love so dearly with all my heart.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"The days and steps ahead are challenging, but with God's grace and love, I have no fear. The Lord Jesus, my Good Shepherd, will lead and guide. I will obey, I will follow, by faith," Kong wrote.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">CHC says it has taken steps to improve accountability<br><br></span></strong></p>
              <p>SINGAPORE: City Harvest Church says it has taken steps to improve accountability in the megachurch, in the three years since the trial began. This statement was made to its congregation at the church's first English service, since the courts found six Church Leaders guilty of misappropriating S$50.6 million worth of church funds.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The service saw Senior Pastor and church founder Kong Hee personally apologising to the congregation saying they have "suffered much over the past few years" because of their commitment to the church and him.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"I'm so sorry for all the pain and turmoil that you have had to endure under my leadership, under my watch," said Kong. "You've had to answer questions and criticisms from families, friends, colleagues.”</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Though Kong stopped short of apologising for his actions, the Church board said it has taken measures to improve management independence.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>“As a board we want to assure everyone that we will not let this trial happen in vain,” said Ms Aries Zulkarnain, executive pastor at City Harvest Church. “Pastor Kong has shown us the blueprint of CHC 2.0.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>“Over the past three years, the board has taken significant steps to improve our governance to fulfil the purpose and mission placed on this church in wiser and lawful ways. And we will continue to do so as we journey towards our future.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>“The steps taken include the following:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The renewal and rotation of board members to ensure independence is enhanced and maintained.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Selection of well-diversified, experienced board members. A significant majority of board members are non-executive board members and independent.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Appointment of a legal firm as legal advisor to the board.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Setting up of an internal compliance team, and an annual outsourced internal audit function."</p>

              <p>God has spoken clearly in this trial.</p>
              <p>As God is all knowing and the judicial system is God's doing!</p>
              <p>So you pray for God to aquit them?</p>
              <p>What your pass deeds does not and will never be your justification to break the law of the Land!</p>
              <p>Those of you who still pray for God's acquittal is blindsided by their pass deeds!</p>
              <p>And to these Pastor and leaders of CHC ,</p>
              <p>Let your spirit be immerse into the Spirit of God.</p>
              <p>And your pray according to His Spirit.. Not from your intellect!!</p>

              <p>But be still in all your inner spirit.. That the Spirit of God will then communicate to you the prayer that he wants you to pray!</p>
              <p>Have you not know this? That the wrong questions will never be the right answers even though you got the answer!</p>
              <p>Is not too difficult to fathom.. Is because you are full of self!</p>

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">City Harvest Church says row with Chew Eng Han ‘sensationalised’<br><br></span></strong></p>
              <p>SINGAPORE: As the dust settles on the criminal trial of the leaders of City Harvest Church (CHC), the church has taken issue with news reports about its ongoing civil suit against its former fund manager Chew Eng Han and his firm AMAC Capital Partners.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It launched the suit last year, which involves about S$21 million in unreturned investments, including S$4.6 million in accrued interest, that Chew and his firm allegedly owes the church.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On Friday, The Straits Times reported the claim made to the court by Chew’s lawyer that CHC had breached the Moneylenders Act by acting as an unlicensed moneylender.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>At its church service on Sunday (Nov 22) at Suntec Singapore, CHC executive pastor Aries Zulkarnain said recent reports may have “sensationalised” the issue and invited members to raise queries on the matter.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Assuring the congregation that the suit is in the hands of “able lawyers”, CHC investment committee chairman Rick Chan also said members will be updated on latest developments.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>“Given that CHC is accountable to its members and is a registered charity at law, our remaining (option) was to file a suit against AMAC and Eng Han to recover (the losses),” Mr Chan said at the start of the service.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Parties had failed to reach a satisfactory resolution despite four years of negotiation and pursuing a lawsuit was its “last resort”, he added. “We want you, our members, to know the actual facts, so that ... you’re equipped with the necessary knowledge. The matter has not gone for trial yet, and the board is doing our very best to protect the interests of the church,” said Mr Chan.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>At the service, CHC founder and senior pastor Kong Hee, who was sentenced on Friday to eight years in jail for misuse of church funds, thanked the church for the prayers and moral support for him and the other church leaders. “I pray that with the conclusion of this court trial, healing will begin for you, and that we finish with this chapter and move on to greater things,” he said to loud applause.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Church members TODAY spoke to after the service said they remain hopeful and have faith in its leadership.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Mr Jonathan Goh, 42, said he did not feel discouraged: “Our hope is in God. We’re still very hopeful that God will use these circumstances for good.” Another churchgoer, who wanted to be known only as Mr Chin, said: “Our trust is in God, not in man. As the Bible tells us, all men will make mistakes.”</p>

I can imagine this wasn't an easy trial for everyone involved, but what other recourse they might have had is beyond my comprehension. Hopefully history won't repeat itself, but I don't say that with a a lot of confidence.</p></div>

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">City Harvest trial: Kong Hee to appeal conviction and sentence<br><br></span></strong></p>
              <p>SINGAPORE: City Harvest Church founder Kong Hee is preparing to file an appeal against both his conviction and sentence, he announced on Friday (Nov 27).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Whilst I respect the Court’s decision, there are points which appear to be erroneous and warrant appeal. I will therefore be preparing to file an appeal against both my conviction and sentence," he said in a Facebook post.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Kong was one of six City Harvest leaders in the recent trial, where he was sentenced to eight years' imprisonment for criminal breach of trust. The six were found guilty of misappropriating S$50 million of church funds.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Earlier on Friday, the prosecution filed an appeal against the sentences for the six people convicted, which the prosecution called "manifestly inadequate".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"My lawyers will also address the prosecution’s appeal at the appropriate time," wrote Kong.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">City Harvest trial: Prosecution appeals 'manifestly inadequate' sentences<br><br></span></strong></p>
              <p>SINGAPORE: The prosecution in the trial against six City Harvest Church leaders on Friday (Nov 27) has filed an appeal against the "manifestly inadequate" sentences against the six people convicted.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In his sentencing last Friday, Judicial Commissioner See Kee Oon issued the following sentences:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Senior pastor Kong Hee, the founder of the church, was sentenced to eight years' imprisonment for criminal breach of trust.<br></p>
              <p>John Lam, former secretary of the church's management board, was sentenced to three years' jail.<br></p>
              <p>Sharon Tan, former finance manager, was sentenced to 21 months in prison.<br></p>
              <p>Former board member Chew Eng Han was given a sentence of six years.<br></p>
              <p>Senior pastor Tan Ye Peng, five years and six months.<br></p>
              <p>Serina Wee, former finance manager for the church, was handed a five-year jail term.<br></p>
              <p>The AGC said in its press release: "Having carefully considered the written grounds, the prosecution is of the view that the sentences imposed are manifestly inadequate, in all the circumstances of the case. The prosecution has accordingly filed notices of appeal today, against the sentences imposed on all six accused persons."</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: 'Benton Modern RE', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;">SINGAPORE — The prosecution for the trial against six City Harvest Church (CHC) leaders has appealed against the sentences imposed on them, while three of the six, among them church founder Kong Hee, said they intend to appeal against their conviction.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: 'Benton Modern RE', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;">The Attorney-General’s Chambers today (Nov 27) said in a media statement that the prosecution had “carefully considered the written grounds” and filed notices of appeal, saying the sentences were “manifestly inadequate, in all the circumstances of the case”. </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: 'Benton Modern RE', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;">Last Friday, the six CHC leaders were sentenced by Presiding Judge of the State Courts See Kee Oon, with Kong receiving the heaviest sentence of eight years. The others received between 21 months and six years. They had been found guilty last month of criminal breach of trust and falsification of accounts.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: 'Benton Modern RE', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;">Deputy public prosecutor Christopher Ong had called for the six to be jailed for about five to 12 years each to reflect the gravity of their offences. But Judge See, delivering his sentence, had said while the case involved huge sums of charity monies and serious breaches of trust, there was no personal gain and no financial loss to the church. </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: 'Benton Modern RE', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;">He also said the six believed they were working with the support of the church, and while the return of funds to CHC does not demonstrate remorse entirely, it should not be negated.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: 'Benton Modern RE', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;">Today, Kong, who was deemed the most culpable by Judge See, said on Facebook he intended to appeal against his conviction. “Whilst I respect the court’s decision, there are points which appear to be erroneous and warrant appeal,” he said. </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: 'Benton Modern RE', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;">Kong’s deputy, Tan Ye Peng, also intends to appeal against his conviction, said his lawyer N Sreenivasan today. </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: 'Benton Modern RE', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;">When contacted, Chew Eng Han, CHC’s former investment manager, reiterated he would appeal against his sentence as well, while lawyer Paul Seah, acting for former church finance manager Sharon Tan, said they were still considering their options. </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: 'Benton Modern RE', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;">Lawyers for Serina Wee and John Lam could not be reached by press time. ADDITIONAL REPORTING BY KELLY NG</p>
