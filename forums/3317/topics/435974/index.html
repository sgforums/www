              <p>A foreign woman used words like 'moronic' and 'incompetent' to describe 
              Singaporeans when she commented on MP Penny Low's Facebook page, after 
              the latter apologised for using her iPhone when the Anthem was being sung during the National Day Parade. <br><br>She even implied that Singaporeans are cowardly, saying that "they are ready to pack up and run" if a war were to break out.<br><br>The
               comments were made when the foreign woman was apparently trying to show
               her support for the MP, saying that she should ignore the comments made
               by some Singaporeans, often implying that they are too ignorant and 
              unqualified to criticise her. <br><br>STOMPer Jean, who came across the postings online, was enraged by the foreigner's comments. <br><br>She wrote to STOMP:<br><br>"I
               chanced upon some outrageous comments made by Ms Rachelle Ann Beguia 
              who is one of the many netizens who commented on Ms Penny Low's 
              Facebook.<br><br>"The discussion took off when MP Ms Low was apologising for being caught using her iPhone when the National Anthem was being played at the recent NDP. In the midst of heated discussion, Ms Beguia made a few insulting and hurtful remarks about Singaporeans.<br><br>"She
               said: 'These moronic 'Singaporeans', their code, their morals, their 
              'loyalty' and 'patriotism'... all dropped at the first sign of 
              trouble... just ask any of them if they want to be excused from serving 
              NS and they will be the first to raise their hands... Require any of 
              them to serve an extra month of NS and they will riot in Singapore... 
              Ask them to fight a war, almost all will declare they are ready to pack 
              up and run.'<br><br>"Is she trying to say all our NSMEN are cowards? On what grounds was she making such accusations? <br><br>"She
               further explained the followings to one of the Facebook users: 'But 
              when foreigners like Bangladeshi, Thais and Indians come and provide 
              labour for building flats and roads, you didn't seem to have complained 
              about it...if tomorrow the government decides to hire foreigners to 
              become soldiers and no more serving of NS for all men let's see if you 
              will make the same comment...By the way, if foreigners can come and 
              snatch your jobs and flats it only shows one thing.... how incompetent 
              you are.'<br><br>"I strongly believe she owes Singaporeans and our NSMEN
               an apology. She insults our soldiers, their commitment to the nation 
              and the lives lost for the safe protection of her and her family to grow
               up in Singapore. <br><br>"These insults are totally uncalled for." <br><br>According to STOMPer Stephanie, Ms Beguia has apologised for her comments. In her latest Facebook posting, she said:<br><br>"I
               am very sorry for the insensitive comments I have posted earlier. It 
              was a lack of judgement. For those who have been hurt by those comments.
               I am very sorry once again."</p>

              <div class="story_headline2"><br></div>
              <div class="story_headline2">There is a new twist to the case of the Filipino woman who insulted 
              Singaporeans on MP Penny Low's Facebook page. Now, a man who claims to 
              be the foreign woman's husband, has declared that he was the one who 
              posted those comments and that he did it without his wife's knowledge. <br><br>STOMPer NotaBelieber,
               who found his posting online, feels that even if the man is really the 
              husband of the woman, he might just be taking the fall for his wife. <br><br>Said the STOMPer:<br><br>"His name is Gay Chao Hui, Joachim.<br><br>"Apparently he posted the comments on Penny Low's Facebook using his wife's account without her knowledge.<br><br>"He has since posted an apology on the same page.<br><br>"Apparently, he once posted he was very 'embarrassed' to be a Singaporean on a Filipino forum."<br><br>According to the STOMPer, the man is a teacher at a JC in Singapore.<br><br>She added:<br><br>"However, some netizens think it's just him taking the fall for his wife, as the style of writing is different.<br><br>"If it was really him who posted the comment, I'm even more shocked that these comments came from a Singaporean's mouth.<br><br>"I
               mean, it's true, we all complain -- it's normal -- but he did it 
              firstly using his wife's account, and on an MP's Facebook page."</div>

              <div class="story_headline2">The Ministry of Education posted in a comment on its Facebook page that it is aware of Mr Gay's replies to MP Penny Low's apology on Facebook in which he insulted Singaporeans using his Filipino wife's account. The MOE is now looking into the incident.<br><br>Mr
               Gay Chao Hui, a teacher a Tampines Junior College, later apologised on 
              the MP's page and said it was him who used his wife's Facebook account 
              to post the comments, in which he called Singaporeans 'moronic' and 'incompetent'.
               His wife, Rachelle Ann Beguia, is said to be a clerk working at the 
              National Heart Centre, and disciplinary action has since been taken 
              against her.<br><br>Netizens were concerned with the fact that Mr Gay is
               an educator, while others are sceptical about the apology, saying he 
              might just be taking the fall for his wife.<br><br>STOMPer Stefanie alerted STOMP to MOE's response on its Facebook page. The comment was posted yesterday afternoon (Aug 14):<br><br>"Thank
               you for this feedback regarding Mr Gay Chao Hui. MOE is aware of this 
              incident and takes a serious view of the matter. We are looking into 
              it."</div>

              <p>Singaporean teacher Mr Joachim Gay is under scrutiny by Ministry of Education, while the National Heart Centre has taken disciplinary actions against his wife, Ms Rachelle Ann Beguia, for insensitive comments posted in Ms Beguia's name on MP Penny Low's Facebook page. <br><br>Mr Gay admitted that he had made the postings with an account shared with his wife. <br><br>STOMPer FBehave hopes that this incident should be a lesson for not just the couple, but other Facebook users as well.<br><br>Said the STOMPer:<br><br>"While
               the couple should face disciplinary action for this, I hope other 
              Facebook users, bloggers, or forum users, should also learn something 
              from this.<br><br>"Please think about the consequences before you post anything.<br><br>"The Internet is just another public forum, and people should be responsible for the things they post online.<br><br>"Just because you are typing it in the comfort and privacy of your home doesn't mean that your comments are private.<br><br>"Will the couple lose their jobs because of this?<br><br>"I hope not, but I hope they learn a valuable lesson from all this and move on with their lives."</p>
