              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Former Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew said Singapore is
               what it is today because of globalisation. He said the investments of 
              trans-national firms have played a part in the country's development.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Mr Lee made these remarks on Friday night while hosting French oil giant TOTAL to dinner at the Istana.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>He has been on the 
              firm's International Advisory Committee since 1993, and said the 
              experience has given him useful inputs as a Senior Advisor to the 
              Government of Singapore Investment Corporation (GIC).<br><br>Mr Lee 
              recounted how Singapore overcame the odds after separating from Malaysia
               and becoming independent in 1965. He said Singapore made some errors in
               its history, but got more things right than wrong, on the whole.<br><br>He
               said: "We were suddenly confronted with the challenge of making a 
              living for two million people on a barren island at the southernmost tip
               of Asia, which gives us the advantage of servicing all the ships that 
              cross the Atlantic and the Pacific.<br><br>"But more than that, we 
              learned how to create conditions which gave confidence to investors, and
               made living in Singapore safe for foreigners and their families."<br><br>TOTAL's
               chairman and chief executive, Christophe de Margerie, paid tribute to 
              Mr Lee as Singapore's founding father and invited him to stay on the 
              company's Advisory Committee for as long as he wants. TOTAL bases 
              several of its activities in Singapore, including the marketing of 
              lubricants.<br><br>-CNA/ac</span></span></p>

              <p>so how to do&gt;?</p>
              <p>we dont pay milions for even one error. becasue one error alone is enbough to kill the whole island. wake up, one error in a country's admistration cannot be comparable to one error made by an employee in the private sector.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>even private sector, many times one error a manager made in decision a lot of times i see casued so much trouble and shift the direction of the company on the whole - for good or bad infinitely.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>been to so many countries but only see the middle and upper class lifestyle only. even been to the skid rows of US? or the worse of cheena's streets? i bet they have not!</p>
              <p>sg is a small country, and we know we will always depend on our own population no matter what happens. to tell the people not to give birth to more than 2 children alone is very worng! more so if hard policies have been implemented to stop it, its almost like genocide, say we may not have a term for it. just like porn, have have hardcore and softporn.</p>
              <p>the ghamn should not then make it a propaganda!</p>
              <p>Nicole seah said right. we should not have the old style only fit and patch minor repairs in the system's loopholes. right now we should overhaul it, and start looking at our population birthrate and stop relying on foreign labor! what they did with the short in populatiopn backthen was to get more atificial 'sgrens' from other countries - and we know which one country they did massively with that! to cover up for the mistake a greave one!</p>
              <p>casino was a joke - more jobs for the people. your sons and dotters go werk at casino arh? go therer werk or wank better!</p>

              <p>It's always that enticing and intriguing for power struggle from foreigner, singaporeans and futue political parties in hybric for the pursuit on the hardwork of Singaporeans wealth. How would they love this to be protected and continue in the glory of its party and system has to be contested earnestly.</p>
              <p>Singapore since independence is based on democracy because the Singaporeans are democratic. This <span>democratic shift in Singapore's political system is nothing new in the heart of singaporeans in view of its democratical nature. There were many mistakes done in the course of developing singapore, one was publicly encouraging singaporeans to invest on share and many innocent young and oldies who never involved in gambling suffering mindset change and made loses and family in disarray.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="icon_razz.gif"> </span></p>
