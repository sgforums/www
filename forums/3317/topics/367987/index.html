              <p><strong>Potong Pasir &amp; Hougang now eligible for lift upgrading programme</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: For the first time, opposition-held Potong Pasir and
              Hougang will be eligible for the Lift Upgrading Program (LUP) for 65
              precincts islandwide.
              <br> <br>Senior Minister of State for National Development Grace Fu revealed
              this to the media on Monday at a Home Improvement Programme event.
              <br> <br>Residents received upgrades to their piping, laundry areas and
              electrical systems and 33,000 more households across Singapore are
              expected to benefit from the scheme over the next three years.
              <br> <br> The programme is expected to cost S$1 billion.
              <br> <br>They were also given the option to upgrade their toilets, doors and
              grilles, with up to 95 per cent of this cost being subsidised. <br> <br> Lee Kwai Heng, upgraded flat owner, said: "If you get your own
              contractor, where can you get such a good price? I know someone from
              upstairs who got someone in to do the same works before this scheme and
              they paid S$20,000."
              <br> <br>Even more popular among residents is the Lift Upgrading Programming
              and the ministry said the timing is right to go ahead with it.
              <br> <br>Grace Fu, Senior Minister of State, National Development Ministry,
              said: "We've seen that construction costs are showing signs of decline.
              So, it's a very good time for us because there are resources that are
              available in the market. So the government intends to increase our
              efforts in lift upgrading projects."
              <br> <br>When asked by journalists if the surprise announcement - to include
              Opposition wards Potong Pasir and Hougang in the programme, was
              deliberately timed, Ms Fu said the move had been planned for a while.
              <br> <br> Potong Pasir MP Chiam See Tong and Hougang MP Low Thia Khiang were not available for comment.
              <br> <br> Residents in both wards welcomed the news, especially the elderly.
              <br> <br>Said one elderly resident: "Upgrading the lifts will definitely
              benefit the senior citizens, because they are old and maybe they have
              weaker legs."
              <br> <br> Residents will find out in a few months if any of their blocks will be amongst the 1,000 which get the upgrade in this exercise.
              <br> <br> The entire project expected to be completed in 2014.
              <br> <br> Since the programme started in 2001, about 80 percent of the eligible blocks built before 1990 have received new lifts.
              <br> <br> This year's LUP had 15 more precincts selected than last year. </span></p>
