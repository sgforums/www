              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: He told her that they were going to meet his friends at a secluded forested area near Mandai Road.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>But it quickly 
              turned into a nightmare for a 16-year-old girl, who had to cover herself
               in newspapers and seek help after she was stripped naked and molested 
              by a 58-year-old man.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Tan Leng Hwa, who 
              was 42-years-old at the time of the 1996 offence, was jailed four years 
              and two months on Tuesday for one count of aggravated outrage of 
              modesty.<br><br>Tan, who was charged for the offence in 1997, was also 
              found guilty of a second charge of failure to attend court that year, 
              after he left Singapore for Johor Bahru and absconded bail for 14 years.<br><br>The court heard Tan had befriended the girl, who was a secondary school student then, at a block in Marsiling Lane in 1996.<br><br>Sometime
               later that year, he drove her to a dark forested area off Mandai Road, 
              under the pretext that they were going to look for his friends there.<br><br>Shortly
               after, the tall and tanned man asked her to be his lover. She rejected 
              him, but this did not stop him from kissing her and caressing her 
              breasts. Her efforts to break free from the car also failed as he 
              restrained her and also removed her spectacles to hinder her escape.<br> <br>His
               attempts did not let up even when she succeeded in running out of the 
              car, as he managed to pull off her shirt in the process. He even 
              followed her out of the car to hug her and remove her bra, before 
              touching her breasts again. He then continued pulling off her shorts and
               underwear despite her struggles.<br><br>The court heard that the girl was completely naked when she eventually fought herself free.<br><br>Tan had left the place when he lost track of her.<br><br>Failing to recover her clothes, the victim covered herself with newspapers before running to the main road for help.<br><br>A taxi driver passing by spotted her. He gave the girl his shirt to cover herself up, before driving her to a police post.<br><br>A medical report revealed that she suffered multiple abrasions on her breasts, buttocks and limbs.<br> <br>The court heard that Tan surrendered himself to the police a few weeks later.<br><br>Deputy
               Public Prosecutor Davyd Chong who described the offence as "highly 
              intrusive", called for a jail term of more than three years.<br> <br>Mr 
              Chong said that the girl, who is now 31-years-old, "had to suffer the 
              indignity and humiliation" of having to publicly seek help while clothed
               in newspapers.<br><br>He added that the "trauma, anguish and 
              psychological impact the attack had on the girl, will certainly leave 
              her scarred for the rest of her life."<br><br>He also told the court 
              that Tan has a propensity of violence and has a string of previous 
              offences, dating as far back as 1975. These included theft, possession 
              of a gun without a license, and armed robbery, which saw Tan receiving 
              an eight year jail term and 20 strokes of the cane, then.<br><br>-CNA/ac</span></span></p>
