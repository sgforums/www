But for most, it was the inscription on a gateway to a living hell.<br>Enlarge<br> <br> <img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/12/18/article-1236853-07A602E6000005DC-565_634x382.jpg" alt="" width="634" height="382"><br><br>The entrance to Auschwitz in a picture taken last night after the sign above this gate was stolen<br><br>Mystery shrouded the motivation for the theft, which took place in the early hours of yesterday. But police fear it was more sinister than a drunken prank.<br><br>Some believe the shadowy Nazi memorabilia network, where a piece such as the 90lb sign could be sold for a small fortune, could be behind the theft.<br><br>It could never be displayed, but there are known to be many relics of the Nazi era in private collections, owned by wealthy individuals with an obsession of history's most evil regime.<br><br>Poland's ambassador to Israel, Agnieszka Magdziak-Miszewska, said police information indicated the robbery was 'meticulously planned'. <br><br>She said the thieves skilfully avoided CCTV cameras monitoring the entrance to the camp that was opened by the Nazis in 1940 initially to incarcerate Polish political prisoners. <br><br> <img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/12/18/article-1236853-07A5650B000005DC-393_634x375.jpg" alt="" width="634" height="375"><br><br>Tourists walk underneath the replacement of the 'Arbeit macht frei' (work will set you free) sign in Auschwitz</p>

              <p>A hole cut in the Auschwitz fence believed to have been made by the thieves <br><br>'Everyone is doing everything they can to catch those who did this,' she said, adding that the governor of the region has declared a state of emergency. <br><br>Whoever took the sign was armed with a screwdriver with which they loosened one side before wrenching it from its mountings. <br><br>Auschwitz museum official Pawel Sawicki said: 'It's a symbol of what Auschwitz stands for. But a place where hundreds of thousands died obviously doesn't mean anything to the thieves.'<br><br>Noach Flug, chairman of the Centre of Organisations of Holocaust Survivors, called on the Polish government 'to exert an especially concentrated effort' into catching the thieves and bringing them to justice.<br><br>The missing sign, which is occasionally removed for conservation work, has been replaced by a replica while the hunt goes on. <br><br>A former Polish army barracks, the Nazis converted the site into what became known to Holocaust planners as Auschwitz 1. While thousands were murdered in its buildings, the far larger complex at Birkenau several miles away - with railway lines that transported the Jews of Europe virtually to the doors of the gas chambers - was chiefly responsible for the deaths of 1.1million.</p>

              <p>I have a feeling that it might be too late, that the old sign has been broken up and melted down. The thieves were so efficient in breaking in and making off with it, who's to say that they haven't destroyed it already? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="icon_sad.gif"></p>

              <h1>5 arrested as Auschwitz sign recovered</h1>
              <p>December 21, 2009 -- Updated 1302 GMT (2102 HKT)</p>
              <p><strong>(CNN)</strong> -- Police in Poland have recovered the infamous sign
              stolen from the front gate of the Auschwitz concentration camp and
              arrested five men, they announced Monday.</p>
              <p>The "Arbeit Macht
              Frei" sign, which means "Work Sets You Free" in German and is
              synonymous with the Nazi camps of World War II, was stolen late last
              week from Auschwitz in Poland, police said Friday.</p>
              <p>The theft prompted outrage around the world.</p>
              <p>Five
              men in their 20s and 30s have been arrested, journalist Tomas Machala
              of CNN affiliate Polsat in the Polish capital Warsaw said Monday.</p>
              <p>They were not neo-Nazis, he said, in response to speculation at the time of the theft that the far right was responsible.</p>
              <p>"They
              have some criminal background," he said, noting they had been arrested
              for robbery and brawling in the past. He did not give their names.</p>
              <p>"They wanted to sell the sign and earn some money," he said. Police
              said it was too early to say if they acted on their own or were hired
              to commit the robbery. They face up to 10 years in prison if they are
              convicted, Machala said.</p>
              <p>It is not clear how they managed to steal the sign, which was cut into three pieces into order to fit it into a car, he said.</p>
              <p>They
              were arrested hundreds of miles north of the concentration camp
              memorial, near the city of Gdansk. The sign had been hidden in a
              forest, Machala said.</p>
              <p>Police were "alerted at 5 a.m. local time
              on Friday by museum guards" that the sign, was stolen, according to
              police spokeswoman Agnieszka Szczygiel.</p>
              <p>The heavy iron sign "was removed by being unscrewed on one side and pulled off on the other," Szczygiel said.</p>
              <p>The police investigation is ongoing.</p>
              <p>The chairman of Yad Vashem, Israel's Holocaust museum, called the theft shocking.</p>
              <p>"The
              theft of such a symbolic object is an attack on the memory of the
              Holocaust, and an escalation from those elements that would like to
              return us to darker days," Avner Shalev said Friday.</p>
              <p>"I call on
              all enlightened forces in the world -- who fight against anti-semitism,
              racism, xenophobia and the hatred of the other -- to join together to
              combat these trends," he said.</p>
              <p>More than 1 million people died
              in gas chambers or were starved to death in the Auschwitz-Birkenau
              concentration camp complex; about 90 percent of the victims were Jews.</p>
              <p>Rabbi
              Marvin Hier, founder and dean of the Los Angeles-based Simon Wiesenthal
              Center, called the sign "the defining symbol of the Holocaust.</p>
              <p>"Everyone
              knew that this was not a place where work makes you free, but it was
              the place where millions of men, women, and children were brought for
              one purpose only -- to be murdered," Hier said. "The audacity and
              boldness of this crime deserves the full attention of the Polish
              government."</p>
              <p class="cnnInline">The center calls itself one of the largest international Jewish human rights organizations.</p>

              <p>I guess it's best to leave it as it is instead of attempting to join it together. Display it inside the museum entrance building and leave the replica where it is..</p>

On December 24, Swedish intelligence announced it was probing a plot to attack both targets.</strong><br><br>The sign above Auschwitz's gateway has long symbolised the horror of the camp, created by Nazi Germany in occupied Poland in 1940 and in operation until Soviet troops liberated it in 1945.<br><br>This was where 1.1 million mainly Jewish prisoners from across Europe died during World War II: some from overwork and starvation, but mostly in the camp's notorious gas chambers. Among the other victims were non-Jewish Poles, Roma and captured Soviet soldiers.<br><br>Copyright © 2009 AFP. All rights reserved.</p></div>

              <p>Fifth member of "Arbeit macht frei" gang charged<br>23.12.2009 17:27<br><br>As a fifth member of the gang who stole the "Arbeit macht frei" sign from the Auschwitz gate is formally been charged with theft, three guards on duty at the time have been suspended from duty. <br><br>Martin A., thought to be the “brain” behind the theft, has been detained for three months while prosecutors compile the case against him and four other members of the gang, who were charged yesterday. <br><br>The ring leader was thought to be in contact with a buyer for the stolen gate, who is probably someone who lives in Sweden, reports the PAP news agency. <br><br>Meanwhile, <strong>unofficial reports say that three guards on duty last Friday morning when the gate was unscrewed from gate 1 at the former Auschwitz Nazi death camp have been suspended from duty</strong>, although the museum’s press officer, Bartosz Bartyzel, at the site has not confirmed this. “Any announcement on personnel matters will be made when the prosecutor’s investigation and an internal audit has been completed,” was all he would say. <br><br>Yesterday, prosecutors in Krakow criticised the museum’s security system. They said that four of the men originally entered the site at around 21.00 CET, Thursday. <strong>But after they discovered that they hadn’t the necessary tools to make the theft, they left through a hole in the parameter fence, obtained the right equipment and re-entered the site. The security guards and surveillance systems failed to pick up the activity both times.</strong></p>
