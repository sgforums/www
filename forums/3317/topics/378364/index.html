              <p><strong>Watching TV a favourite pastime of baby boomers, according to survey</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : A survey by the Council for Third Age has revealed
              that watching TV has now become the favourite pastime of the baby
              boomers in Singapore. </span></p>
              <p><span>The council said this is the first time such a poll has been done
              on the consumption habits and interests of this group of Singaporeans
              aged between 45 and 65.
              <br> <br>According to the poll of 1,000 respondents, six in 10 of them count
              watching TV as their favourite pastime, followed by shopping, reading
              and cooking. <br> <br> However, this may not necessarily mean that this group of Singaporeans is a sedentary lot. 
              <br> <br> Gerard Ee, chairman, Council for Third Age, said: "One of the results
              of watching TV, for instance the popularity of the Korean series, has
              actually increased travel to Korea. This is something that I hope the
              travel industry become mindful of. You are talking about people who
              rode with Singapore's prosperity and they do have savings."
              <br> <br> Seven in 10 surveyed said they travel once or twice a year, even if there is a recession. 
              <br> <br> But the interest level was slightly lower when it came to learning a new skill. 
              <br> <br>The survey also showed that four in 10 of the baby boomers are
              interested to learn something new such as cooking, IT or even a third
              language, and many of them said they are likely to do so within the
              next six to 12 months.
              <br> <br>In fact, the poll showed that four in 10 respondents are already
              using the internet to email, source for news or to shop online. <br> <br> Mr Ee said: "There are enough people out there who are interested in
              these areas and justify further studies and the attention of the
              commercial sector out there, and it really shows them that there is the
              potential that is yet to be exploited. " <br> <br> The Council for Third Age said it plans to share these findings with
              its relevant partners like travel agencies and voluntary welfare
              organisations next week. </span></p>
