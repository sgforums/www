              <p><strong>Malaysia's 'McCurry' beats McDonald's over trademark</strong></p>
              <p class="first">KUALA LUMPUR (AFP) - - Malaysia's highest court ruled
              Tuesday against US fast food giant McDonald's, which has waged an
              eight-year battle to prevent local eatery "McCurry" from using the
              prefix "Mc" in its name.</p>
              <p>"It is the end of the road for McDonald's. McCurry can use the
              prefix," said lawyer Sri Dev Nair who represented the family-owned
              restaurant, which serves up Malaysian favourites like tandoori chicken
              and fish masala.</p>
              <p>"McCurry and McDonald's are two different
              businesses which sell different types of food and they have different
              customers," he said, rejecting McDonald's claim that the use of "Mc" in
              its name could cause confusion.</p>
              <p>In April, McCurry scored a
              David-and-Goliath victory when the appeals court overturned a 2006 high
              court decision that McCurry had illegally infringed on the burger
              chain's trademark.</p>
              <p>McDonald's on Tuesday sought permission from
              the federal court to contest the appeals court decision, but judges
              denied the application and said the burger chain's petition was "not
              properly framed".</p>
              <p>"It is unfortunate we have to dismiss the
              application with costs," said Judge Arifin Zakaria, who headed the
              three-member panel. Costs amounted to 10,000 ringgit (2,845 dollars).</p>
              <p>"Justice has been served. The food that we serve is very different from McDonald's," said McCurry owner Kanaeges Suppiah.</p>
              <p>"We
              have no similarities with them at all. That's what we have felt all
              this while and that's why we could go on until this stage," she told
              reporters.</p>
              <p>McDonald's counsel declined to comment, saying they had to brief their client first.</p>
              <p>"We abide by the court's decision," lawyer Wong Sai Fong said.</p>
              <p>The
              McCurry restaurant, which the owners say is short for Malaysian Chicken
              Curry Restaurant, was established in 1999. McDonald's has 185 outlets
              in Malaysia, the first of which it opened in 1982.</p>
