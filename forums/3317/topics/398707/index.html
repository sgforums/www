              <p>Janaa Fakha (8-yr-old), sister Maasa (5-yr-old) and brother Hussein (9-yr-old) waited for their father to take them
              from the fields to their home in the village of Al Ain al
              Baida in Jordan Valley. </p>
              <p>They were at the rear of
              the tractor when an Israeli military jeep swerved off the road, at high speed, and
              rammed the tractor. While Hussein suffered a broken leg, the girls didn’t stand a chance.
              With the body of one sister draped obscenely over its front bumper, the
              jeep reversed and rammed again into
              the tractor.</p>
              <p>What might be a tragic accident is revealed
              for what it was – a cold-blooded murder.</p>
              <p>The Israeli soldiers threatened Emad (the father) with their rifles before Israeli police reached the scene. The
              soldiers claimed it was “an accident”, but Israeli citizen Eliazer
              Salam, from Yama, witnessed the
              incident and testified that the driver had swerved off the road and
              accelerated into the tractor.</p>
              <p>The driver was arrested but there has been no news that he is to
              face any charges in a court of law.</p>
              <p>Similar incidents in the Nablus region – at Awarta and in Jenin
              – where Israeli military vehicles have run down
              pedestrians and ram civilian cars, with fatal consequences, seem to
              point to an emerging pattern.</p>
              <p>A single, small grave in the graveyard at Al
              Ain al Baida houses the remains of two small sisters, their severed
              limbs and bodies buried as one.</p>

              <p>The elderly white supremacist charged with killing a security guard at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in June died Wednesday afternoon at a North Carolina hospital, authorities said.</p>
              <p>James W. von Brunn, 89, who was wounded in the head during the assault, had been undergoing mental health evaluations at a federal prison in Butner, N.C., in recent months. He died at a hospital near the prison shortly before 1 p.m., a federal prison spokeswoman said.</p>
              <p> Von Brunn's quiet death contrasts sharply with the brazen violence he unleashed June 10 in what prosecutors have described as a suicide mission, an attack that shocked the nation and sent tourists scattering for cover on a busy downtown street.</p>
              <p>Prosecutors said that von Brunn, an admitted white supremacist who lived most recently in Annapolis, had been planning the assault for months and that he hoped "to send a message to the Jewish community" that the Holocaust was a hoax. "He wanted to be a martyr for his cause," a prosecutor said in court.</p>
              <p>Before the shooting, von Brunn had finalized his funeral plans and gotten his finances in order for relatives. Then, shortly before 12:45 p.m., he double-parked his red Hyundai on 14th Street NW in front of the museum and walked toward the front doors, a rifle at his side, authorities have said.</p>
              <p>As von Brunn neared the entrance, security guard Stephen T. Johns, 39, opened the door for him. The white supremacist fatally shot Johns at point-blank range, authorities have said.</p>
              <p>Other guards quickly returned fire, wounding von Brunn in the head. He was treated at District hospitals but needed a wheelchair and had difficulty speaking during a court hearing several months ago.</p>
              <p>Von Brunn was indicted by a federal grand jury on charges of first-degree murder, committing a hate crime and gun violations. If convicted, he would have been eligible for the death penalty.</p>
              <p>His guilt was never in serious doubt -- the shooting was witnessed by dozens of people, it was captured on surveillance video and the assailant was carted away in an ambulance -- but some had hoped to glean some insights into von Brunn's psyche during the court process. Many, including Johns's relatives, remain shocked that anyone could be filled with so much hatred that he would shoot a helpful security guard at a museum that serves as a memorial to the slaughter of millions of people.</p>
              <p> Johns left behind a young son.</p>
              <p> "I just hope he was ready to meet his God," said Nola Gorham, Johns's grandmother, of von Brunn. She said that she didn't wish him bad luck, even though he did "a terrible thing," but that "nothing can bring closure."</p>
              <p>The museum issued a brief statement on its Web site Wednesday that didn't mention von Brunn by name and continued to hail Johns's heroism. "This tragedy is a powerful reminder that our cause of fighting hatred remains more urgent than ever," the statement said.Von Brunn's son, Erik, told a reporter that he was aware of his father's death but declined to comment further. The son has said that he wished his father had died in the attack, not Johns.</p>
              <p>During a September court hearing, von Brunn told U.S. District Judge Reggie B. Walton that he wanted a quick public trial, but the judge delayed the defendant's day in court pending mental health tests.</p>
              <p>He had been held at the prison in North Carolina since Sept. 25. In addition to his wounds from the attack, he also suffered from congestive heart failure and sepsis, prison officials said.</p>
              <p>It is not clear when he was taken to the hospital or how he died.</p>
              <p>Von Brunn was known for decades as a loner and white supremacist who spun elaborate conspiracy theories about Jews and black people in leaflets, in books and on his Web site.</p>
              <p>In December 1981, he walked into the Federal Reserve with a handgun and threatened to take the members of the Board of Governors hostage. He had hoped his actions would lead to the deportation of all Jews and black people from "the white nations" of the world.</p>
              <p>He was convicted and served a little more than six years in federal prison.</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px;">We stopped by the roadside at the spot where the two little girls had been killed. Their blood still stained the cushion on which they had been sitting, fragments of the military jeep which had rammed their father’s tractor still littered the ground. Janaa Fakha (8), her sister Maasa (5) and their brother Hussein (9) never saw what hit them as they waited for their father to take them from the family fields to their home in the small village of Al Ain al Baida in the northern Jordan Valley. Al Ain al Baida (the White Spring) is one of the few remaining Palestinian villages here. Its inhabitants scratch a living from what remains to them of their lands in this fertile and beautiful area.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px;">That April day Emad Fakha had taken three of his four children to help in the fields after school, something they enjoyed, a treat. The children had climbed into the “basket” on the ground at the rear of the tractor, ready to be lifted up. Emad was preparing to start the motor when an Israeli military jeep swerved off the road, at speed, and rammed into the tractor from behind. While Hussein was thrown clear and suffered only a broken leg, the little girls didn’t stand a chance. With the body of one sister draped obscenely over its front bumper, the jeep reversed for five or six metres and then rammed once again into the tractor. What might have been a tragic accident is thus revealed for what it was – a cold-blooded murder.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px;">Their jeep undriveable and so unable to escape, the soldiers threatened Emad with their rifles. More soldiers arrived but it was 25 minutes before the Israeli police reached the scene. The soldiers claimed that it was “an accident”, but Israeli citizen Eliazer Salam, from the settlement at Yama, who had witnessed the entire incident from his car, testified that the jeep driver had not applied his brakes at any stage and had, indeed, swerved off the road and accelerated into the tractor.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px;">The jeep’s driver was arrested but there has been no news that he is to face any charges in a court of law. When I asked the family whether there would be an inquest (explaining that this was the usual procedure in Western, democratic countries) they didn’t understand the term. They have no recourse to the protection of the law, as we know it. Far from protecting the civilian population of the territories which they occupy, as required under international law, the Israeli military brutalises and preys upon a helpless people.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px;">Recent similar incidents in the Nablus region – at Awarta and in Jenin – where Israeli military vehicles have been used to run down pedestrians and ram a civilian car, with fatal consequences, seem to point to an emerging pattern. The psychopathic tendencies of certain members of the Israel Defence (sic) Force have found an outlet.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px;">Meanwhile, a single, small grave has been dug in the graveyard at Al Ain al Baida. It houses the remains of two small sisters, their severed limbs and bodies buried as one, together forever under the sun, clouds and rain of their beloved Palestine.</p>

I was young, idealistic, and more than willing to put my life at risk for my convictions. It was 1947 and I wasn't quite 18 when the Iraqi authorities caught me for smuggling young Iraqi Jews like myself out of Iraq, into Iran, and then on to the Promised Land of the soon-to-be established Israel.</strong></p>
              <p style="line-height: 34px; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;"><strong>I was an Iraqi Jew in the Zionist underground. My Iraqi jailers did everything they could to extract the names of my co-conspirators. Fifty years later, pain still throbs in my right toe-a reminder of the day my captors used pliers to remove my toenails. On another occasion, they hauled me to the flat roof of the prison, stripped me bare on a frigid January day, then threw a bucket of cold water over me. I was left there, chained to the railing, for hours. But I never once considered giving them the information they wanted. I was a true believer.</strong></p>
              <p style="line-height: 34px; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;"><strong>My preoccupation during what I refer to as my "two years in hell" was with survival and escape. I had no interest then in the broad sweep of Jewish history in Iraq even though my family had been part of it right from the beginning. We were originally Haroons, a large and important family of the "Babylonian Diaspora." My ancestors had settled in Iraq more than 2,600 years ago-600 years before Christianity, and 1,200 years before Islam. I am descended from Jews who built the tomb of Yehezkel, a Jewish prophet of pre-biblical times. My town, where I was born in 1929, is Hillah, not far from the ancient site of Babylon...</strong></p>

Ben Gurion covered this up with propaganda.

              <p>you mean the holocaust is a myth ?</p>
              <p>the simple truth is if it's real, why is it a crime to investigate it..............the truth fears no investigation..........!!</p>
              <p>also in one supposedly major concentration camp (could have been Auschwitz), the jews have REPEATEDLY revised the death toll from 4.5m to around 1m...............</p>
              <p>as for losing 6m in Europe during WW2, a top rabbi said there were less than 6m jews in occupied Europe so how could 6m died ?</p>
              <p>there were photos of mass graves that the jews said hundreds of thousands were buried but yet the graves were far too small and shallow...............wouldn't the graves be the size of football stadiums to house hundreds of thousands of bodies ?</p>
              <p>even modern cremation experts have said it's impossible even today to burn the number of dead bodies the jews claimed on a daily basis............</p>
