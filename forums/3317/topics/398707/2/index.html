              <p>you mean the holocaust is a myth ?</p>
              <p>the simple truth is if it's real, why is it a crime to
                  investigate it..............the truth fears no
                  investigation..........!!</p>
              <p>also in one supposedly major concentration camp (could have been
                  Auschwitz), the jews have REPEATEDLY revised the death toll from
                  4.5m to around 1m...............</p>
              <p>as for losing 6m in Europe during WW2, a top rabbi said there
                  were less than 6m jews in occupied Europe so how could 6m died
                  ?</p>
              <p>there were photos of mass graves that the jews said hundreds of
                  thousands were buried but yet the graves were far too small and
                  shallow...............wouldn't the graves be the size of football
                  stadiums to house hundreds of thousands of bodies ?</p>
              <p>even modern cremation experts have said it's impossible even
                  today to burn the number of dead bodies the jews claimed on a daily
                  basis............</p>

              <p>The simple truth is As romanista2001 is trying to discredit the Jews.</p>
              <p>The Jews who repeatedly revised the death toll are As romanista2001</p>
              <p>The top rabbi is none other than As romanista2001</p>

              course I thought I knew it all back then. I was young, idealistic,
              and more than willing to put my life at risk for my convictions. It
              was 1947 and I wasn't quite 18 when the Iraqi authorities caught me
              for smuggling young Iraqi Jews like myself out of Iraq, into Iran,
              and then on to the Promised Land of the soon-to-be established
              Israel.</strong></p>
              <p style="line-height: 34px; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;"><strong>I was an Iraqi Jew in the Zionist underground. My Iraqi
              jailers did everything they could to extract the names of my
              co-conspirators. Fifty years later, pain still throbs in my right
              toe-a reminder of the day my captors used pliers to remove my
              toenails. On another occasion, they hauled me to the flat roof of
              the prison, stripped me bare on a frigid January day, then threw a
              bucket of cold water over me. I was left there, chained to the
              railing, for hours. But I never once considered giving them the
              information they wanted. I was a true believer.</strong></p>
              <p style="line-height: 34px; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;"><strong>My preoccupation during what I refer to as my "two years in
              hell" was with survival and escape. I had no interest then in the
              broad sweep of Jewish history in Iraq even though my family had
              been part of it right from the beginning. We were originally
              Haroons, a large and important family of the "Babylonian Diaspora."
              My ancestors had settled in Iraq more than 2,600 years ago-600
              years before Christianity, and 1,200 years before Islam. I am
              descended from Jews who built the tomb of Yehezkel, a Jewish
              prophet of pre-biblical times. My town, where I was born in 1929,
              is Hillah, not far from the ancient site of Babylon...</strong></p>
              <p style="line-height: 34px; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">...<strong>I know now that from the beginning many Arab leaders
              wanted to make peace with Israel, but Israel always refused. Ben
              Gurion covered this up with propaganda. He said that the Arabs
              wanted to drive Israel into the sea and he called Gamal Abdel
              Nasser the Hitler of the Middle East whose foremost intent was to
              destroy Israel. He wanted America and Great Britain to treat Nasser
              like a pariah...</strong></p>

              <p>Deir Yassin, an Arab village cleared out in 1948 by Jewish forces brutally weeks before Israel was formed, </p>
              <p>Ha'aretz, an Israeli newspaper, is petitioning Israel's High Court of Justice to release
              written and photographic evidence in military archives. Survivors of Deir Yassin, a village of 400, claim the Jews committed a massacre.</p>
              <p>In 2006, Israeli arts student, Neta Shoshani, applied for access to
              the Deir Yassin archives as a 50-year
              embargo on the secret documents had expired. She
              was granted limited access to the material, but  there
              was an extended ban on more sensitive documents. </p>
              <p>Among the documents is a damning report written by Meir Pa'il, a Jewish officer
              who condemned his compatriots for bloodthirsty conduct on
              that day. Equally incriminating are the many photographs that survive.</p>
              <p class="font-null">"The
              photos clearly show a massacre," says Daniel McGowan, a US professor who works with Deir Yassin Remembered. "Those photos
              show villagers lined up against a wall and shot."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Abdul-Kader Zidain was 22 years old then and joined a band of 30 fighters from the village to fend off
              the surprise Jewish offensive, even though they were clearly
              outnumbered.</p>
              <p class="font-null">"They went into the houses and
              they shot the people inside. They killed everybody they saw, women and
              children," said Mr Zidain, who lost four of his family, his father and brothers, in the attack. </p>
              <p>Survivor testimonies are supported
              by Mr Pa'il (Israeli officer), whose detailed eyewitness account was published in 1998.
              Awaiting reassignment, he observed the attack and described how he heard sporadic firing from the houses, and
              went to investigate.</p>
              <p>There he saw soldiers had stood the
              villagers in their homes and shot them. He saw around 25 prisoners led to a
              quarry between Deir Yassin and Givat Shaul. He and a companion saw everything and took
              photographs. "They
              stood the prisoners against a wall and shot all of them," he
              said. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>By UN estimates, 750,000 Palestinians had fled
              their homes by the end of the 1948 War of Independence, roughly 60 per
              cent of Palestine's pre-war Arab population.</p>
