              <p>A TWO-YEAR-OLD boy died after his mother accidentally reversed over him as he ran out of the gate to greet her.</p>
              <p>Henry Harrington's mother did not realise what had happened until a 
              cabby driving past the house screamed at her to stop the car. Neighbours
               said they saw the Australian housewife get out of the white 
              multi-purpose vehicle, then start yelling for help as she cradled her 
              child.</p>
              <p>'I saw her carrying a baby who was covered in blood,' said Ee-Shao 
              Xuan, 10, who lives next door to the family's bungalow in Bishan.</p>
              <p>Henry was taken to KK Women's and Children's Hospital where 
              he died about an hour after the accident on Monday, police said. The boy
               was at home with his four-year-old sister and the family's maid when 
              the tragedy occurred.</p>
              <p>He was playing with his kick scooter in the garden when his 
              mother, who wants to be known only as Mrs Harrington, arrived home at 
              about 4.30pm and tried to open the electric gate with a remote control.</p>
              <p>When only one side opened, she got out to open the gate by 
              hand before getting back behind the wheel and reversing. 'We think that 
              was when my son saw my wife,' said Henry's father, Mr Dion Harrington, 
              43. 'We think he must have run up to the driver's door, but the car was 
              turning in and he got knocked over.'</p>
