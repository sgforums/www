              <p>Samsung has ended an <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/technology/technology-news/taiwan-probes-samsungs-attack-on-htc-20130416-2hwt4.html">online campaign in Taiwan</a> amid a local regulator's probe into whether the company broke the law 
              by paying for positive reviews of its products and negative comments 
              about rivals.</p>
              <p>Taiwan's Fair Trade Commission (FTC) is gathering information
               after receiving emails earlier this month alleging posts to online 
              forums were suspicious, said Sun Lih-Chyun, a commissioner at the 
              regulator. Samsung said in a statement the situation was "unfortunate" 
              and it ceased using anonymous comments in online marketing last year.</p>
              <p>Samsung, which has overtaken Apple and Nokia to lead the $US294 billion smartphone market, last month <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/digital-life/mobiles/hands-on-samsung-galaxy-s4-20130315-2g539.html">unveiled its new Galaxy S4 handset</a> at an event in New York's Radio City Music Hall. Taiwan-based HTC, which <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/digital-life/mobiles/htc-one-a-standout-20130418-2i26z.html">released its flagship HTC One</a> last month, has lost market share amid competition and delays in shipments of own products.</p>
              <p>"These are the two star products at least for the first half 
              of this year," said Warren Lau, an analyst at Kim Eng Securities in Hong
               Kong. "So I would suspect that some sales marketing people will try 
              their very best to market their products."</p>
              <div id="adspot-300x250-pos-3" class="ad adCentred">Advertisement</div>
              <p>Posts to online forums are alleged to have included criticism
               of rival smartphones, including those made by HTC, and praise of 
              Samsung's products, Sun said. HTC has been asked to provide information,
               while Samsung has yet to be contacted by the FTC, he said.</p>
              <p><strong>'Insufficient understanding'</strong></p>
              <p>Samsung, which announced its online communications credo in 
              2011, said it remains committed to engaging in transparent and honest 
              communications with consumers.</p>
              <p>The South Korean company's credo prohibits criticisms of 
              competitors and their products and it voluntarily ceased using anonymous
               comments last year, it said in a statement.</p>
              <p>The situation "occurred due to insufficient understanding of 
              these fundamental principles" of transparent and honest communications 
              with consumers, Samsung said.</p>
              <p>The commissioners discussed whether the posts would breach 
              one of the articles of fair trade regulations relating to false 
              advertising, with penalties of as much as $TWD25 million ($A812,000) an 
              incident, said the FTC's Sun.</p>
              <p>A more serious breach of a separate article on defamation is 
              also being investigated and could lead to criminal charges with 
              imprisonment of as long as two years per case, Sun said. A defamation 
              case would first require a victim to file a formal complaint, he said.</p>
              <p>"We are disappointed that a competitor would resort to 
              misleading consumers to discredit our innovation," HTC said in a 
              statement.</p>

              <h1>Samsung Taiwan apologies for the fake HTC One reviews</h1>
              <p><strong>Samsung Taiwan apologies for the fake HTC One reviews in Taiwan.</strong> Samsung Taiwan hired students to post fake reviews about the HTC One 
              and that is pretty bad. Maybe Samsung Taiwan is worried about their 
              sales in Taiwan. Samsung didn’t say they hired persons but in the text 
              below you can make this up. Let’s hope Samsung won`t do this anymore.</p>
              <p>Even we must say the HTC One has pretty nice build quality.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Samsung Electronics remains committed to engaging in 
              transparent and honest communications with consumers as outlined in the 
              company’s Online Communications Credo. We have encouraged all Samsung 
              Electronics employees worldwide to remain faithful to our Credo.</p>
              <p>The recent incident was unfortunate, and occurred due to insufficient understanding of these fundamental principles.</p>
              <p>Samsung Electronics Taiwan (SET) has ceased all marketing activities 
              that involve the posting of anonymous comments, and will ensure that all
               SET online marketing activities will be fully compliant with the 
              company’s Online Communications Credo.</p>
              <p>We regret any inconvenience this incident may have caused. We will 
              continue to reinforce education and training for our employees to 
              prevent any future recurrence.</p>
