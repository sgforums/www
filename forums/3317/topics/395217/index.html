              <p>LONDON (AFP) - – A British grandmother was heavily fined and 
              electronically tagged for selling a goldfish to a child, triggering 
              criticism Wednesday of over-zealous use of animal protection laws.</p>
              <p>Pet shop owner Joan Higgins, 66, was fined 1,000 pounds (1,500 
              dollars, 1,120 euros) also given a dusk-to-dawn curfew for selling an 
              animal to a person under the age of 16, but her 47-year-old son Mark -- 
              also ordered to do community service -- slammed the ruling as a farce.</p>
              <p>The pair were prosecuted after the local council sent a 14-year-old 
              boy to buy a goldfish in a "sting" operation following reports that 
              their shop, Majors Pets, had sold a gerbil to a teenager with learning 
              difficulties.</p>
              <p>The shopkeepers sold the fish without asking his age or how the fish
               would be cared for, prosecutors said.</p>
              <p>"I think it's a farce and legal lunacy and I told the council that,"
               said Mark Higgins, cited by the Daily Telegraph, noting that his mother
               was also given an electronic tag.</p>
              <p>"What gets me so cross is that they put my Mum on a tag -- she's 
              nearly 70, for goodness sake... You would think they have better things 
              to do with their time and money," he said.</p>
              <p>But Trafford Council in northern England defended the decision to 
              prosecute, noting that the gerbil sold to the teenager with learning 
              difficulties -- who was also 14 -- was put in a cup of coffee.</p>
              <p>"The evidence presented for this conviction clearly demonstrates 
              that it is irresponsible to sell animals to those who are not old enough
               to look after them," said Iain Veitch, the council's head of public 
              protection.</p>
              <p>Higgins and her son pleaded guilty at Trafford Magistrates' Court to
               selling an animal to a person aged under 16. She was ordered to obey a 
              curfew from 6:00 pm to 7:00 am for seven weeks because she is unfit for 
              community service.</p>
              <p>Her son, who manages the shop, was fined 750 pounds (1,100 dollars) 
              and ordered to carry out 120 hours of unpaid community work at the end 
              of eight months of legal action Tuesday.</p>
              <p>The story was highlighted by a number of British newspapers 
              Wednesday. The Daily Express said it made a "farce" of Britain's legal 
              system, adding in a front-page headline: "Proof Britain really has gone 
              mad."</p>
