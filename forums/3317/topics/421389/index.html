              <p><strong>First H1N1 death reported in Singapore this year</strong></p>
              <p>An elderly man has died from H1N1-related causes, the first such reported case this year.</p>
              <p>77-year-old Mohd Lazim Kalang died in hospital on Wednesday, due to a lung infection. <br> <br> But experts say the flu strain has not become more severe since the pandemic in 2009. <br> <br> Mohd Lazim was sent to the Singapore General Hospital on 15 January after running a fever for several days. <br> <br> A few days later, he was diagnosed with H1N1. <br> <br> But a lung infection soon set in, and by then it was too late. <br> <br> Mohd Lazim died from pneunomia 10 days after being warded. <br> <br> At his family home in Bedok, his son-in-law Ali Attan says the family 
              was initially worried because they were not advised to be quarantined, 
              despite having been in close proximity to Mr Mohd Lazim. <br> <br> They were also concerned the children would be infected. <br> <br> <strong><em>"Previously we only heard that H1N1 was dangerous, and it 
              will spread, so that's why we were worried. But now we're not worried 
              because it's a normal flu." <br> </em></strong><br> The H1N1 flu is now one of three seasonal flu strains circulating in Singapore and the rest of the world. <br> <br> As such, the Health Ministry says there is no need for special protection measures like isolation and quarantine. <br> <br> But it adds that H1N1, like other flu strains, can cause pneumonia and 
              respiratory problems, especially in the elderly, the very young and 
              those with chronic diseases. <br> <br> Doctors say symptoms for the current H1N1 strain (H1N1-2009) may appear more severe, because it is a relatively new strain. <br> <br> But most will recover with ample rest. <br> <br> Doctors also advise vaccinations to protect against the flu in future.</p>
